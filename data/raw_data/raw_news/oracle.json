Gal has received 10,000 records from the alleged attacker \u2018rose87168\u2019 and is working on validating this data. To verify the claim, Gal contacted Hudson Rock customers who appear in the data. He asked them to specifically confirm whether the user accounts exist, whether the tenant IDs match, whether they are production or test environments and whether the accounts have access to sensitive data.\n\nThere are now three confirmations that the data is authentic. One indicated that the sample\u2019s users actually exist and actively host data. In addition, some accounts have access to sensitive information, which refutes the earlier assumption that these would only be test environments.\n\nConnection with previous vulnerability\n\nThe attacker claims to have used the same RCE (Remote Code Execution) previously reported by cybersecurity company CloudSEK. CloudSEK had already confirmed that Oracle had indeed been hacked despite denials from the company itself.\n\nIn their investigation on March 21, CloudSEK discovered that the domain login.us2.oraclecloud.com had been compromised. At the time, they were already talking about the hack\u2019s \u2018profound impact\u2019.\n\nConsequences for Oracle customers\n\nThe confirmation that the data provides access to production environments with sensitive data makes the situation worrying. Although Oracle previously strongly denied that there had been a hack, Hudson Rock\u2019s new findings seem to refute this claim.\n\nGal is calling on Oracle to provide more information or repair the situation.

Oracle denies everything\u2014despite compelling evidence and a very awkward .txt file uploaded to an Oracle login subdomain.\n\nThe breach allegedly hit login.us2.oraclecloud.com, a subdomain conveniently offline. Screenshots and Wayback Machine captures suggest it was running a creaky old Oracle Fusion Middleware 11G setup, which hadn\u2019t been touched since the tail end of the Obama administration.\n\nCybersecurity firm CloudSEK is pointing fingers at CVE-2021-35587\u2014a juicy unauthenticated exploit in Oracle Access Manager\u2014as the likely entry point. You\u2019d think something slapped into the CISA KEV catalogue in 2022 might have been patched by now, but Oracle seems to prefer its software aged like fine milk.\n\nMeanwhile, over 140,000 cloud tenants are being shaken down by the cyber extortionist, who\u2019s offering to remove their data from the dark web\u2014for a price.\n\nCloudSEK confirmed the authenticity of the breach with medium confidence and high severity. They\u2019ve even built a tool to help victims figure out if their credentials have been tossed into the digital wild.\n\nOracle\u2019s public relations department, however, is clinging to the \u201cnothing to see here\u201d narrative, much to the confusion of experts. Jake Williams, a man who knows his way around a compromise, asked the million-dollar question: \u201cHow did a threat actor upload a file to an Oracle login server if nothing happened?\u201d So far, crickets.\n\nChad Cragle, CISO at Deepwatch, says Williams raises a critical point. \u201cIf there was no breach, how did a threat actor allegedly upload a file to the Oracle Cloud subdomain? This indicates unauthorized access, even if it wasn\u2019t a full-scale compromise. Dismissing the incident without addressing this key detail raises more questions than answers. If Oracle wants to maintain credibility, they must clarify how the file ended up there, whether any security gaps were exploited, and why the subdomain was taken down.\u201d\n\nDeepwatch\u2019s CISO Chad Cragle rightly notes that taking down the subdomain screams \u201ccover-up\u201d more than \u201cprecaution.\u201d\n\nFenix24 CISO Heath Renfrow said that the presence of a threat actor-uploaded file in the webroot of what appears to be an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) login subdomain is deeply concerning.\n\n\u201cThis detail, coupled with the public availability of sensitive data on forums, raises valid questions about the scope of compromise and whether customers with federated login configurations could be at risk.\u201d\n\nApono CEO Rom Carmel said: \u201cBy compromising what appears to be a significant number of keys and credentials, the attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to many more systems and data.\n\n\u201cThis incident raises important questions about whether access to the server containing such sensitive resources was properly restricted\u2014not just who had access, but also when that access was permitted. It also calls into question whether the affected resources had adequate access controls in place to enforce least privilege and limit access to defined, secure time windows,\u201d Carmel said.",

            "content": "(@philww)\n\nLloyds Banking Group, one of the UK\u2019s top retail banks with 30 million customers, announced an expansion of its working partnership with Oracle ahead of last week's Oracle CloudWorld Tour London event. Steven Jeffrey, Director, Cloud Platform, at Lloyds, was on the keynote stage to discuss the implications of the deal for the bank's customers, resilience, and business benefits.\n\nThe partnership with Oracle is part of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s continued migration of services to the cloud, which Jeffrey said on stage was part of a \u00a34 billion ($5.2bn) transformation of the historic bank. The multi-year deal with Oracle will see Lloyds expand its multi-cloud strategy, moving existing Oracle databases to run on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) within Microsoft Azure data centers. Jeffrey said Microsoft was involved in the discussions and decision-making and that the bank has been able to move workloads to the Azure data centers in six weeks \"with no incidents or impacts.\u201d\n\nAt CloudWorld London, Jeffrey tied the infrastructure refresh to the move to digital banking, explaining:\n\nThe world has changed, and we have to deal in real-time with our customers, not use batch processing or paper or when bank representatives are at their desks. We can learn from the neo-banks, and we really think there is an opportunity to revolutionize how banking is done.\n\nHe said success will be measured by engagement, or in other words:\n\nOur customers love the service, and that is the mark of success.\n\nAnd, of course, AI had to be mentioned, especially as Oracle announced its AI Agent Studio to the London audience. Jeffrey said the announcement is likely to help the bank with AI investment decisions, adding:\n\nWhat might we be able to do for our customers? We can create more engagement.\n\nResilience\n\nOnline bank outages have become a staple of mainstream news outlets, with Lloyds suffering a major outage on Friday 28th February 2025, traditionally pay day for many of its customers. Lloyds Banking Group hopes its further move to cloud computing will prevent the bank from once again hitting the headlines. \"Resilience is important to us,\" said Jeffrey, adding that the Oracle deal provides:\n\nA single pipeline for infrastructure and a standard language for infrastructure development.\n\nThe Cloud Platform director said Lloyds is becoming an increasingly engineering-focused digital organization, with many of its 3000 graduate joiners having an engineering culture. There\u2019s been change too within the technology department. He explained:\n\nThe best engineer is held back by process. We have moved to an iterative and product-model approach. Iteration is important as it unlocks skilled people and processes.\n\nSimilar product-led and iterative working models have given the neo-banks that challenge Lloyds an edge in terms of being able to quickly and reliably develop and deploy new services. Jeffrey was clear that although Lloyds is significantly older, it too can adopt this model.\n\nMulti-cloud is central to the Lloyds deal with Oracle. The bank will operate a number of databases within its own data centers using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer, while others are migrating to Oracle Database@Azure. Using the OCI platform to manage the multi-cloud approach, Lloyds will be able to deploy databases within Azure data centers or its own on-premise facilities and be sure that the capabilities and operations offer the same performance levels. In a statement, Joe Soule, CIO, Enabling Services, Lloyds Banking Group, said:\n\nAs we focus on growth and diversifying our business, maximizing our use of data across the Group becomes critical so that we can innovate and deliver new services faster for our customers. The ability to flexibly deploy Oracle databases on-premises or in the public cloud, in combination with Microsoft Azure through a multi-cloud approach, enables us to accelerate the pace at which we adopt digital technologies. This ensures we can support our customers with high-performing services and the best customer experience possible.\n\nMy take\n\nStaying out of the headlines will be vital for the venerable bank.",

Now, Oracle, a cloud computing company, is stepping in to try to keep it running. The company is reportedly negotiating a deal to oversee American user data in exchange for a stake in TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.\n\nAt first glance, this might seem like a simple fix\u2014but it\u2019s far from that.\n\nThe U.S. government has been wary of TikTok for years, citing concerns that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could use the app to spy or spread misinformation. In response, Washington issued an ultimatum: ByteDance must sell TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to an American company or face an outright ban.\n\nThat standoff has led to a long legal battle, with restrictions piling up along the way. Earlier this year, tensions peaked when TikTok was briefly removed from U.S. app stores under a new law. But when President Trump returned to office in January 2025, he delayed the ban, giving TikTok more time to find a solution. Now, with the April 5 deadline looming, the pressure is back on.\n\nOracle has been involved in this saga since 2020. In 2022, it launched 'Project Texas,' a plan to store American user data on U.S. soil. But reports later suggested that ByteDance employees in China still had access, making it look more like a PR move than a real security solution.\n\nNow, with time running out, Oracle is back with what some are calling 'Project Texas 2.0,' a renewed attempt to convince lawmakers that TikTok\u2019s U.S. data is fully secure.\n\nBut the real problem isn\u2019t just where the data is stored\u2014it\u2019s who controls TikTok\u2019s algorithm.\n\nThat algorithm is what makes TikTok so addictive, deciding which videos users see and keeping engagement high. The U.S. government wants oversight to prevent potential misuse, but ByteDance has made one thing clear: it will not sell its recommendation system. Without access to the algorithm, lawmakers remain sceptical that any deal\u2014short of a full sale\u2014will resolve the security concerns.\n\nThat\u2019s the standoff we\u2019re seeing today. Oracle says it can guarantee TikTok\u2019s security, TikTok refuses to hand over its algorithm, and the U.S. government isn\u2019t backing down.\n\nIf Oracle can\u2019t come up with a plan that satisfies Washington, TikTok could face a permanent U.S. ban\u2014this time, for real. The clock is ticking, and millions of users are waiting to see what happens next.",

The breach, exploiting a vulnerability in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure, now endangers over 140,000 tenants and has raised serious questions about cloud security practices.\n\nIncident discovery and exploitation\n\nAccording to CloudSEK\u2019s analysis, the threat actor claimed to have breached the subdomain login.us2.oraclecloud.com \u2014 an endpoint once hosting Oracle Fusion Middleware 11G. The initial access was gained by hacking the login endpoint (login.(region-name).oraclecloud.com), where sensitive single sign-on (SSO) and LDAP credentials were stored.\n\nThe compromised database contains approximately 6 million lines of data, including critical assets such as JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys. The attacker even offered an incentive to those who could help decrypt or crack these credentials and has been actively reaching out to affected organizations demanding a \u201cfee\u201d to remove their data.\n\nVulnerability analysis and exploit details\n\nThe breach appears to be linked to a well-known vulnerability \u2014 CVE-2021-35587 \u2014 which affects Oracle Access Manager (OpenSSO Agent) in Oracle Fusion Middleware. According to FOFA data, the vulnerable endpoint, last updated on Sept. 27, 2014, allowed an unauthenticated attacker network access via HTTP. This easily exploitable flaw enabled a complete compromise of Oracle Access Manager, underscoring how outdated configurations and poor patch management can lead to large-scale security failures. The fact that the affected subdomain was captured on the Wayback Machine in February 2025 further points to the longstanding vulnerability present in legacy Oracle systems.\n\nExpert analysis and the broader cybersecurity context\n\nCybersecurity analysts have long warned that the rapid adoption of cloud technologies can outpace the implementation of necessary security frameworks. This incident reinforces that message.\n\nExperts argue that cloud services offer scalability and flexibility but introduce complex security challenges that require continuous vigilance and proactive defense strategies.\n\nThe consequences of this breach are severe. Beyond mass data exposure, there are heightened risks of credential compromise, corporate espionage, and potential extortion.\n\nOrganizations now face additional challenges: besides safeguarding sensitive data, they must contend with possible ransom demands from threat actors. Immediate mitigation measures include:\n\nResetting passwords, particularly for privileged LDAP accounts.\n\nRotating tenant-level credentials.\n\nAffected organizations should also regenerate certificates and secrets linked to compromised configurations, audit logs for unusual activity, and implement enhanced monitoring.\n\nExplore the best database security solutions to protect your sensitive business and customer data from unauthorized access.",

            "content": "Oracle is caught up in a cybersecurity mess right now, with claims about a massive data breach affecting its cloud infrastructure. Last week, Hackread.com published an article based on the findings of cybersecurity firm CloudSEK revealing that a threat actor had stolen 6 million records from Oracle Cloud. The hacker, identified as \u201c rose87168 \u201c, claimed to have compromised a key Single Sign-On (SSO) endpoint, resulting in the exfiltration of sensitive data including SSO and LDAP credentials, OAuth2 keys, and customer tenant information.\n\nOracle\u2019s Firm Denial\n\nShortly after the story broke, Oracle issued a categorical denial, making a strong statement that \u201cThere has been no breach of Oracle Cloud.\u201d The company maintained that the credentials published by the threat actor were not associated with Oracle Cloud and emphasized that no Oracle Cloud customers were affected. This statement directly contradicted the findings of CloudSEK, which had alerted the public and Oracle via formal reports.\n\nCloudSEK\u2019s Follow-Up Investigation\n\nHowever, CloudSEK has doubled down on Oracle\u2019s claims with a new follow-up analysis, presenting what it calls \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of the breach. In a blog post, which the company shared with Hackread.com ahead of its publishing over the weekend, CloudSEK outlined how their researchers detected the threat actor\u2019s activities on March 21, 2025.\n\nAccording to the cybersecurity firm, they traced the attack to a compromised production SSO endpoint ( login.us2.oraclecloud.com ), which the hacker exploited to steal records from more than 140,000 tenants.\n\nCloudSEK also found evidence that the threat actor had actively used the compromised domain to authenticate API requests via OAuth2 tokens , as seen in an archived public GitHub repository under Oracle\u2019s official \"oracle-quickstart\" account. The endpoint was proven to be in use for production purposes, contradicting Oracle\u2019s assertion that the credentials were unrelated to their infrastructure.\n\nNew Evidence: Real Customer Data Confirmed\n\nOne of the most noteworthy pieces of evidence involves real customer domain names that the hacker provided as samples. CloudSEK verified the domains against publicly available data and found that they were, in fact, valid Oracle Cloud customers. Some of the domain names identified include:\n\nsbgtv.com\n\nnexinfo.com\n\nnucor-jfe.com\n\nrapid4cloud.com\n\ncloudbasesolutions.com\n\nThese domains were present in GitHub repositories and Oracle partner documentation, and CloudSEK confirmed they were not mere dummy or canary accounts. Additionally, the compromised endpoint, login.us2.oraclecloud.com , was validated as an active production SSO setup, used in real-world configurations by OneLogin and Rainfocus.\n\nThe screenshot shared by CloudSEK shows \u201clogin.us2.oraclecloud.com\u201d was a production SSO setup\n\nThe Impact and Concerns\n\nThe impact of this breach, if proven, could be serious. The exposure of 6 million records, including encrypted SSO and LDAP passwords risks unauthorized access, espionage, and data breaches across affected systems. Additionally, the inclusion of JKS files and OAuth2 keys means attackers might gain long-term control over affected services.\n\nCloudSEK warns that the compromised credentials could potentially be cracked and reused in a way that poses further risks to enterprise environments. The hacker is also reportedly demanding ransom payments from affected firms to delete the stolen data, amplifying both financial and reputational threats.\n\nCloudSEK\u2019s Stance: Evidence over Speculation\n\nIn response to Oracle\u2019s denial, Rahul Sasi, CEO of CloudSEK, stated that the company is focused on providing transparency and evidence rather than speculation. CloudSEK has been sharing its findings through public reports and free tools to help organizations assess whether they are affected.\n\nAdditionally, Rahul recommends companies change their SSO and LDAP credentials right away and set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add extra protection. It\u2019s also important to take a closer look at logs to spot any unusual activity related to the compromised endpoint. Keeping an eye on dark web forums for any signs of leaked data is a good move too. On top of that, it\u2019s a good idea to get in touch with Oracle Security to figure out any weak spots and fix them.\n\nQuestions Are Pouring In Already\n\nCybersecurity experts are already questioning Oracle\u2019s quick denial. Chad Cragle, CISO at Deepwatch, a San Francisco, Calif.-based AI+Human Cyber Resilience Platform stressed that Oracle needs to address the questions raised by CloudSEK to maintain its credibility.\n\n\u201cCloudSEK raises a critical point. If there was no breach, how did a threat actor allegedly upload a file to the Oracle Cloud subdomain?\u201c argued Chad. \u201cThis indicates unauthorized access, even if it wasn\u2019t a full-scale compromise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDismissing the incident without addressing this key detail raises more questions than answers. If Oracle wants to maintain credibility, the company must clarify how the file ended up there, whether any security gaps were exploited, and why the subdomain was taken down,\u201c he added.\n\nHeath Renfrow, CISO and Co-founder at Fenix24 a Chattanooga, Tennessee-based cyber disaster recovery firm, expressed concerns about Oracle\u2019s stance on the breach and the threat actor\u2019s ability to upload files within critical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cRegardless of Oracle\u2019s position, the presence of a threat actor-uploaded file in the webroot of what appears to be an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) login subdomain is deeply concerning,\u201c said Health. \u201cThis detail, coupled with the public availability of sensitive data on forums, raises valid questions about the scope of compromise and whether customers with federated login configurations could be at risk.\u201c\n\nHackread.com has reached out to Oracle.

            "content": "AWS Vs. Azure Vs. GCP Vs. Oracle Vs. IBM Customer Spending Face-Off: Report From how much customers are spending per month on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud to how many cloud clients are leveraging MSPs, CRN breaks down the most important takeaways from Flexera\u2019s new 2025 State of the Cloud report that partners should know about.\n\nTop Public Cloud Providers Similar to global market share, the top five public cloud providers being used are AWS, Google Cloud, IBM, Microsoft Azure and Oracle. AWS is the top public cloud provider being used by respondents for running workloads at 79 percent. Microsoft placed in second with 77 percent of respondents running workloads on Azure. Approximately 46 percent of respondents use Google\u2019s GCP to run workloads on. About 27 percent use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to run workloads on, while 17 percent leverage the IBM Cloud. Most respondents use AWS for running significant workloads at 53 percent, while Azure is the most used cloud platform for client\u2019s running some workloads on at 31 percent. Google Cloud is seeing the highest number of respondents experiment on its platform at 20 percent.\n\nSpending Per Month On AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle And IBM Similar to 2024, AWS and Azure are nearly tied across all spending tiers\u2014although Azure has a slight edge for those spending $1 million or more monthly. For those spending less than $50,000 monthly, Google Cloud Platform is the leader. Breaking down each public cloud company and the amount respondents spend per month: For Azure, 50 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 19 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For AWS, 48 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 17 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For GCP, 44 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 7 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For Oracle, 29 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 3 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million. For IBM, 24 percent of respondents spend $200,000 or less per month, while 3 percent spend between $1 million to over $5 million.\n\nEnterprise Spending On AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, And IBM Flexera broke down respondents for how much they spend on public cloud into two categories: enterprises and SMBs (next slide). Looking specifically at what enterprises spend per month on public cloud, enterprise respondents slightly lean more toward Azure usage compared to AWS in terms of leadership. For Azure, 22 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 47 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For AWS, 21 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 44 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For GCP, 8 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 43 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For Oracle, 3 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 32 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month. For IBM, 3 percent are spending $1 million to $5 million per month, while 26 percent are spending $200,000 or less per month.\n\nSMB Spending On AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, And IBM Looking at the results from small-medium businesses (SMBs), respondents slightly lean more toward AWS compared to Azure in terms of leadership. Google Cloud Platform is in third place, with Flexera pointing out that 2 percent of SMBs are now spending $1 million or more per month on GCP compared to zero percent in 2024. Here\u2019s a breakdown on how much SMBs are spending per month on the top five public cloud platforms. For AWS, 67 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on AWS, while 6 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For Azure, 62 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on Azure, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $2 million. For GCP, 49 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on Google Cloud, while 3 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For Oracle, 15 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on OCI, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $5 million. For IBM, 15 percent of respondents are spending $200,000 or less per month on IBM Cloud, while 2 percent are spending $500,000 to $2 million. No SMBs reported spending over $5 million per month on any cloud provider.\n\nNearly All Respondents Using Cloud Provider Discounts Cloud provider discounts from AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are a critical way customers can help with costs. Approximately 96 percent of all respondents are using at least one of the cloud provider discount options. The most frequently used discount is the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, at 45 percent, which is a common contractual vehicle for organizations that use Microsoft products and services. The second highest used discount at 44 percent is the Google Committed Use discounts for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In third place is the AWS Reserved Instances discount which 42 percent of respondents leverage, followed by AWS\u2019 Enterprise Discount Program (EDP) at 40 percent. Bespoke negotiated discounts are more common with Oracle at 35 percent, and IBM at 27 percent than with other providers. \u201cThis is most likely due to existing contractual relationships with these providers for other services that are leveraged to obtain cloud consumption discounts,\u201d Flexera said. The average number of public clouds used is 2.4, and the average number of discount options used across all cloud providers is 3.9. \u201cThis is good to see, but there\u2019s still room for additional discounts to be used for most organizations,\u201d Flexera said.\n\nAnnual Public Cloud Spend Flexera saw an increase in public cloud spending in 2025 compared to 2024. For example, 33 percent of customers report spending over $12 million per year, up from 29 percent in 2024. \u201cThis supports the idea that as cloud costs rise, more workloads are moved to\u2014or born in\u2014 the cloud,\u201d said Flexera. Breaking down the overall numbers: Approximately 33 percent spend between $12 million to over $60 million annually. About 41 percent spend between $1.2 to $12 million annually. Around 24 percent spend $1.2 million annually or lower. Looking at enterprise respondents, about 55 percent spend over $6 million per year, while 44 percent spend between $600,000 to $6 million. In terms of SMB respondents, 81 percent spend $2.4 million or less annually on public cloud, while 17 percent spend over $2.4 million annually.\n\nHybrid Cloud Vs. Public And Private Some other key findings in Flexera\u2019s report include that 70 percent of respondents have embraced hybrid cloud strategies by using at least one public and one private cloud. The remaining 30 percent either use only public cloud or private cloud. Large enterprises make use of multi-cloud tools more than smaller organizations, regardless of the tool type. \u201cOrganizations seem to have found their steady state\u2014that is, the mix of clouds that meets their current needs. For the most part, that involves at least one public and one private cloud,\u201d said Flexera.",

It is now clear that the domain login.us2.oraclecloud.com was compromised. The company speaks of a \u201cprofound\u201d impact for customers due to the breach.\n\nA Techzine reader has also told us that Oracle requested a password reset from their employer, adding: \u201cthat should tell you something\u201d . We tend to agree. It\u2019s somewhat odd Oracle opted to deny that a breach had occurred, foregoing the caveat that no such incident had been detected. The latter offers the affected company an opportunity to not have to contradict itself.\n\nOriginal article, 9:27 AM:\n\nOn Thursday evening, a hacker claimed to have stolen six million records from Oracle Cloud. Servers in both Amsterdam and Chicago may have missed a patch to prevent a breach. Oracle, however, denies that its systems have been compromised.\n\nThe alleged attacker goes by the name \u201crose87168.\u201d The 6 million records are said to have exposed 140,000 tenants, with Java Key Store files, encrypted passwords, and Enterprise Manager JPS keys as the spoils of war.\n\nOracle refuses to pay and denies any wrongdoing\n\nOracle is clear about its view when asked by The Register and others. \u201cNo breach\u201d is the verdict of the American cloud player. \u201cThe published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, external parties are assuming a successful compromise based on their verbiage. CloudSEK speculates that the US2 server in Chicago was not patched for CVE-2021-35587, a critical vulnerability in Oracle Access Manager within Oracle Fusion Middleware. The attacker\u2019s method of obtaining data from EM2 (in Amsterdam) is unknown, but it may have stemmed from the same issue.\n\nA month ago, rose87168 is said to have contacted Oracle with a demand for more than 200 million dollars in crypto coins. Oracle refused to comply. This was expected, as paying cyber criminals is illegal in the US.\n\nDangers\n\nHack or no hack, resetting credentials is a highly recommended step for organizations on Oracle Cloud. rose87168 states that affected tenants can also pay to remove their credentials from the leak list, but that offers no guarantees. The hacker could very well still utilize the data or sell it to someone else, assuming this hasn\u2019t been done in advance anyway. As mentioned above, negotiations with cybercriminals are illegal in the US, while the policy in Europe is less restrictive.\n\nSince rose87168 shared even more evidence with BleepingComputer, it is likely that the hack did take place. The infiltration is alleged to have occurred 40 days ago. However, it remains to be seen whether organizations recognize their credentials in the data that BleepingComputer has shared with them. If not, it may be the case that fellow cybercriminals are the \u2018victims\u2019 of this ordeal. At any rate, it is very much possible organizations have already reset their credentials and prevented any ill effects.\n\nUnknown matters\n\nAccording to rose87168, the available files could crack the SSO passwords. Someone else could also extract the hashes of LDAP passwords, but the attacker himself did not succeed in doing so. The stolen data will be useful for further hacks if organizations do not take appropriate measures. In any case, the disclosure of the attack should convince them to check for compromises and renew their credentials.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this year already that alleged hacks can turn out to be fake. Despite claims made by the Space Bears group, for example, Atos wasn\u2019t actually compromised by them in the end.\n\nAlso read: Atos confirms: no hack by Space Bears",

This material was said to have been obtained by the miscreant from at least one of the cloud provider's single-sign-on (SSO) login servers by exploiting a security vulnerability.\n\nOracle says that's not true.\n\n\"There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud,\" a spokesperson told The Register on Friday.\n\n\"The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as noted by the guys at Bleeping, the miscreant boasted of creating a text file on an Oracle Cloud login server, specifically login.us2.oraclecloud.com, captured here by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine in early March, as proof that systems were compromised.\n\nThat file contains simply the email address of the person attempting to sell what's said to be the stolen Oracle Cloud data. We've asked Oracle for further clarification or an explanation. It's claimed that information was exfiltrated from the EM2 as well as US2 login server. Samples of allegedly stolen info were also shared by the would-be thief.\n\nLooking through the Wayback Machine, we can see that the US2 server was as recently as February 2025 running some form of Oracle Fusion Middleware 11G.\n\nInfosec outfit CloudSEK reckons that server may not have been patched to close CVE-2021-35587, a known critical vulnerability in Fusion Middleware's Oracle Access Manager, specifically its OpenSSO Agent.\n\nExploiting that bug \u2013 which can be done over HTTP with no authentication \u2013 would potentially give an intruder access to the very kind of information put up for sale this week. Public exploit code for the flaw exists.\n\nOn Thursday, what was claimed to be six million records of Oracle Cloud customers' Java KeyStore files, which contain security certificates and keys; encrypted Oracle Cloud SSO passwords; encrypted LDAP passwords; Enterprise Manager JPS keys; and other information stolen from the cloud provider went up for sale on BreachForums by a previously unknown netizen going by the name rose87168. The potentially affected customers is said to number in the thousands.\n\nThe price for this info has not been disclosed, as far as we can tell, and the seller is also accepting zero-day exploits as payment. It's said rose87168 contacted Oracle about a month ago to let the database giant know about the alleged data theft, wanted more than $200 million in cryptocurrency in exchange for details about the claimed heist, and was turned down.\n\nThe miscreant has also asked for help in decrypting encrypted credentials.\n\n\"The SSO passwords are encrypted, they can be decrypted with the available files,\" the internet hoodlum claimed in their BreachForums post. \"Also LDAP hashed passwords can be cracked. I couldn't do it, but if someone can tell me how to decrypt them, I can give them some of the data as a gift.\"\n\nAdditionally, the would-be thief has shared a list of the domains of all of the companies caught up in the denied security breach, and noted that the apparently not-compromised Oracle customers can \"pay a specific amount to remove their employees' information before it's sold.\" \u00ae",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL 1.81%) has been a steady performer on the stock market over the past five years, delivering respectable gains of 230% to investors and outperforming the Nasdaq Composite's 143% jump by a handsome margin. But the technology giant has been under pressure this year.\n\nShares of the company that's known for providing database management and cloud services have dropped 7% in 2025 as of this writing, roughly in line with the Nasdaq's move. Oracle's recently reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended on Feb. 28) didn't help matters; the stock dropped following the release of its report on March 10, but has since recovered.\n\nThe company's anemic growth wasn't good enough to meet Wall Street's expectations, while poor guidance added to the gloom. But savvy investors can consider using the pullback as a buying opportunity since there are clear signs that the company is set to step on the gas in the future. The massive opportunity in the cloud infrastructure market could send Oracle's stock soaring over the next five years.\n\nInvestors shouldn't miss the stunning growth in Oracle's backlog\n\nInvestors were quick to press the panic button following the company's latest results as the 8% year-over-year increase in revenue and 4% jump in adjusted earnings weren't enough to meet consensus estimates.\n\nMoreover, management's forecast of a 9% increase in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint is slightly lower than the 11% that analysts were expecting.\n\nBut focusing on Oracle's near-term performance and overlooking its long-term forecast is like missing the forest for the trees. The remarkable demand for the company's cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference is leading to phenomenal growth in its backlog.\n\nThis is evident from the 62% year-over-year increase in Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO) last quarter to $130 billion. The metric refers to the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, and it is worth noting that this metric grew at a much faster pace than the company's top line last quarter.\n\nOracle management pointed out on the latest conference call with analysts that the quarter was its strongest ever in terms of bookings. The company added $48 billion worth of new contracts to its backlog. At the same time, Oracle is constrained by capacity. The demand for the company's cloud infrastructure is exceeding supply as more companies are turning toward Oracle's offerings to train and deploy AI models and applications.\n\nManagement adds that its cloud infrastructure is \"faster and, therefore, cheaper than our competitors.\" The good part is that the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure could keep growing at a terrific pace through the end of the decade. Goldman Sachs is estimating the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market will generate $580 billion in annual revenue by 2030.\n\nThe pace of growth in Oracle's RPO and the impressive rate at which it is signing new contracts suggest that the company is indeed on its way to cornering a lion's share of the huge addressable opportunity. Importantly, the booming size of Oracle's RPO is set to translate into stronger growth for the company in the coming years.\n\nOracle is expecting its revenue growth in the next fiscal year to accelerate to 15%, followed by a stronger jump of 20% in fiscal 2027. Both these numbers are higher than what the company was previously anticipating. Oracle had guided for $65 billion in fiscal 2026 revenue in September last year, but it now believes that it can hit $66 billion in revenue in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, a 20% increase in its revenue in fiscal 2027 would send its top line to more than $79 billion. That's higher than what analysts are expecting.\n\nInvestors would do well to note that Oracle could end up exceeding its own expectations in the long run considering the terrific pace at which it is increasing its data center capacity to meet demand. Management is going to double the capacity of its data centers in the current fiscal year, and it plans to triple the same by the end of the next fiscal year.\n\nSo, it is easy to see why Oracle is expecting an acceleration in its revenue growth, as higher data center capacity will enable it to fulfill more of its RPO. That, in turn, should ideally lead to strong growth in the company's bottom line.\n\nImpressive profit growth signals healthy stock gains over the next five years\n\nIn September last year, Oracle projected that its earnings could increase at an annual rate of more than 20% through fiscal 2029. However, management's comments on the latest earnings conference call suggest that it could do better.\n\nAssuming Oracle can clock a 25% annual earnings growth rate over the next five years, its bottom line could jump to $18.31 per share by fiscal 2030 (using its projected fiscal 2025 earnings of $6.00 per share as the base). Oracle is currently trading at 21 times forward earnings, a discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25.\n\nIf the market decides to put a higher valuation on Oracle and it trades at 25 times earnings in five years, that would put its stock price at $458. That would be a 197% jump from the stock price as I write this.\n\nInvestors should consider adding this AI stock to their portfolios following its recent drop. It is not just attractively valued right now; it has the potential to deliver healthy gains in the long run.",

Stocks rallied last Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and forecast two interest rate cuts for 2025.\n\nStill, markets are bracing for April 2 , when Trump is expected to implement so-called reciprocal tariffs to match duties imposed by trading partners.\n\nLast week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off concerns after the stock market logged its worst week in more than two years: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put a good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.\u201d\n\nBlair, like many other White House officials, pinned the blame on government spending even as data showed that the government spent more during Trump\u2019s first month in office than it did over the same period a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe president has said very clearly the volatility will settle down,\u201d Blair said, vowing to implement \u201cas soon as possible\u201d changes like deregulation, boosting domestic manufacturing, and introducing tax relief. \u201cBut yeah, there\u2019s going to be a little bit of adjustment.\u201d\n\nBlair said the president wants to provide \u201cpredictability\u201d to the markets and businesses \u201cso that they can do their business planning in a way that they can count on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we will get to a place very soon where they feel pretty comfortable with how to plan,\u201d he added.",

This was goodwill gesture from the team, after Nicolai Sehested's F50 was ruled out of racing, due to damage attained during a collision at the Los Angeles Sail Grand Prix last weekend.\n\nAs part of the team's commitment to giving back and growing the sport, joining the NorthStar SailGP Team this weekend were two Canadian interns, one of whom was the first mentee of the NorthStar Mentor Program.\n\nA second place in San Francisco condenses the season leaderboard for the Rolex SailGP Championship. Canada is in 5th, just two points behind Spain who are in third. Things are trending in the right direction. The team is also currently second place in the Impact League, after scoring third on first Focus Area, with the NorthStar Locker.\n\nThe team now sets their sights on the first ever Enel Brazil Sail Grand Prix that will take place on 3-4 May in Rio.\n\nElbows up!",

If ByteDance can't find a buyer for TikTok's US operations, the ban passed by Congress will kick in April 5.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters this past week that a high-level agreement satisfying US national security concerns by early April was \"almost\" certain.\n\nPresident Trump said last weekend that four bidders had emerged, but he didn't identify them. Names previously floated by Trump and others have included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the US government.\n\nOne prominent corporate name, however, keeps surfacing: Oracle.\n\nThe tech giant co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison already acts as TikTok's primary cloud provider and had attempted a prior purchase of TikTok that eventually fizzled during Trump's first term in 2020.\n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison and U.S. President Donald Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Jan. 21.

ByteDance\u2019s leaders reportedly want to retain a hands-on role with TikTok\u2019s operations in any such deal.\n\nBloomberg separately reported that an Oracle deal being mulled by the White House would task the tech giant with safeguarding Americans' data on TikTok in exchange for a stake in the company, while leaving app\u2019s algorithm in the hands of ByteDance.\n\nTikTok and its CEO Shou Zi Chew have repeatedly objected to letting go of the app's proprietary algorithm. Neither TikTok nor Oracle responded to a request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, Reuters offered up yet another scenario involving Oracle.\n\nThe news agency said the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their existing stakes and acquire the US operations of TikTok as part of a new entity, while Oracle protects the US user data to ensure it is not available to China.\n\nThese investors include Jeff Yass' Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford's General Atlantic. In such a scenario, Chinese ownership in the new business would drop below a critical 20% threshold needed to avoid the US ban.",

            "content": "A recent investigation by CloudSEK\u2019s XVigil platform has uncovered a cyberattack targeting Oracle Cloud, resulting in the exfiltration of six million records and potentially affecting over 140,000 tenants. Reportedly, a threat actor, identified as \u2018rose87168,\u2019 perpetrated this attack that involved the theft of sensitive data, including JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, which are now being sold on Breach Forums and other dark web forums.\n\nThe attacker, active since January 2025, claims to have compromised a subdomain login.us2.oraclecloud.com , which has since been taken down. This subdomain was found to be hosting Oracle Fusion Middleware 11G, as evidenced by a Wayback Machine capture from February 17, 2025. They are demanding ransom payments from affected tenants for the removal of their data and have even offered incentives for assistance in decrypting the stolen SSO and LDAP passwords.\n\nCloudSEK\u2019s analysis indicates that the threat actor may have compromised a vulnerable version of Oracle Cloud servers, potentially leveraging an older flaw, CVE-2021-35587, which affects Oracle Fusion Middleware (OpenSSO Agent) with the following identified as the impacted versions:\n\n11.1.2.3.0\n\n12.2.1.3.0\n\n12.2.1.4.0\n\nThis CVE, added to the CISA KEV catalogue in December 2022, allows unauthenticated attackers to compromise Oracle Access Manager, potentially leading to a complete takeover. This aligns with the type of data exfiltrated and shared by the attacker. Its exploitation could allow attackers to gain initial access to the environment and then move laterally within the Oracle Cloud environment to access other systems and data. Further investigation revealed that the Oracle Fusion Middleware server was last updated around September 27, 2014, indicating outdated software.\n\n\u201cDue to lack of patch management practices and/or insecure coding, the vulnerability in Oracle Fusion Middleware was exploited by the threat actor. This easily exploitable vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Access Manager,\u201d CloudSEK researchers noted in the blog post shared exclusively with Hackread.com.\n\nHowever, Oracle has issued a statement denying any breach of its cloud infrastructure. \u201cThere has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data,\u201d Oracle stated in response to the reports. This directly contradicts CloudSEK\u2019s findings and the attacker\u2019s claims.\n\nNonetheless, if it occurred the breach\u2019s impact could be substantial as the exposure of a whopping six million records raises the risk of unauthorized access and corporate espionage. The exfiltration of JKS files is most concerning as these contain cryptographic keys, which could be used to decrypt sensitive data or gain access to other systems within the affected organizations. Moreover, the compromise of encrypted SSO and LDAP passwords could lead to further breaches across Oracle Cloud environments. The use of a zero-day vulnerability also raises concerns about the overall security of Oracle Cloud.\n\nCloudSEK recommends immediate credential rotation, thorough incident response and forensics, continuous threat intelligence monitoring, and engagement with Oracle Security for verification and mitigation. They also advise strengthening access controls to prevent future incidents.",

An airline could manage hundreds of millions of reservations and a manufacturing company could keep tabs on the production data on, say, a million units of finished product.\n\nThe value and utility of relational databases drove Oracle sales. But there was another factor at work. The relentless drive of Oracle's mercurial co-founder Larry Ellison .\n\nEllison is a gifted innovator and leader but also hyper-competitive and many of the company's aggressive sales tactics stemmed directly from this drive.\n\nThese included threatening licensing audits, bundling products into groups that exceeded customers' needs, renewal efforts that threatened longer-term contracts if early offers were not accepted, and, of course, a young aggressive sales force led by managers who frequently got calls from Ellison himself.\n\nWhile some of these tactics were questionable, they did their job in one respect: they drove sales at Oracle.\n\nBut Ellison's vision paid off as well. He understood early on the importance of cloud computing, and as early as 2012, shifted the company's focus away from so-called on-premise computing to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.\n\nWhile cloud computing has not killed off on-premise computing, it has relegated it to a smaller sector of the market, and Oracle dominates cloud-based enterprise-wide solutions. Further, it killed many on-premise software companies that did not embrace cloud computing quickly enough.\n\nAnd Ellison's vision paid off again with AI. His embrace of the technology as early as 2020 by reconfiguring Oracle products means that today, its Gen2 Cloud solution is the leading infrastructure for managing generative AI workloads.\n\nOracle's investments in technology, commitment to innovation as technology shifts and its relentless marketing machine have shown up on the company's top and bottom line.\n\nSince 2005, revenues have grown from $11.7 billion to $49.9 billion for the year ended 2023.\n\nShould AI technology live up to its billing, Oracle could have another significant leg up in its growth. Even if the AI market is slower to develop than anticipated, Oracle is well-positioned to be present if and when it takes off.\n\nNote: This content first appeared in Louis Navellier's latest book, The Sacred Truths of Investing: Finding Growth Stocks that Will Make You Rich , which was published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

            "content": "Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware has jumped substantially in the past couple of years. Technology giants in the U.S. and abroad, along with governments around the globe, are pouring billions of dollars into developing powerful large language models (LLMs), which can then be deployed to create useful applications to enhance productivity.\n\nMarket research firm IDC is expecting global AI spending to hit a massive $337 billion this year. That figure is expected to more than double by 2028 to $749 billion. This huge spending is going to be a tailwind for Oracle (ORCL 1.81%) and Dell Technologies (DELL 2.32%), two tech giants that are already benefiting from the huge outlay on AI infrastructure.\n\nHowever, both stocks have been under pressure this year. While Oracle is down 10% so far in 2025, Dell is down by 16%. But a closer look at the recent developments in their businesses suggests that the downturn may not last for long. So, which one of these two AI stocks is the better buy on the dip?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nThe case for Oracle\n\nOracle has traditionally been known for providing database management software, but AI has opened a whole new growth opportunity for the company. Customers have been rushing to rent Oracle's cloud infrastructure for both AI model training and inferencing applications. In fact, the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure is so strong that it doesn't have enough capacity available to meet all of it.\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue shot up an impressive 51% year over year in its fiscal 2025's third quarter (which ended on Feb. 28). The segment's growth was well ahead of the 8% increase in Oracle's overall revenue last quarter. The cloud infrastructure business now produces 19% of Oracle's top line, up by almost six percentage points from the year-ago period.\n\nThis business is set to move the needle in a bigger way for Oracle in the future. Customers continue to line up to rent Oracle's cloud AI infrastructure, as evidenced by the $48 billion worth of bookings that it received last quarter. As a result, the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) jumped 63% year over year to $130 billion.\n\nRPO is the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled. The good part is that the growth in this metric accelerated in the previous quarter by a whopping 22 percentage points when compared to the year-ago period. Simply put, the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure has strengthened, and this business is set to drive stronger growth for the company.\n\nNot surprisingly, Oracle is ramping up its cloud capacity at an aggressive pace to meet the solid end-market demand. CEO Safra Catz remarked on the company's latest earnings conference call:\n\nAnd we expect that our available power capacity will double this calendar year and triple by the end of next fiscal year. As we bring more capacity online, our revenues will clearly accelerate. What we are seeing in the market is that we are the destination of choice for both AI training and inferencing.\n\nOracle is doing the right thing by bumping up its capacity as the size of the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service market is expected to reach a whopping $580 billion by 2030. An increase in capacity will allow Oracle to corner a bigger share of the end market, which is why the company is expecting to clock 15% revenue growth in the next fiscal year, followed by a 20% increase in fiscal 2027.\n\nFor comparison, Oracle is expected to conclude the ongoing fiscal 2025 with an 8% increase in its top line. Moreover, with new growth drivers such as the $500 billion Stargate Project coming into play, there is a good chance that Oracle could eventually grow at a faster pace than what it is currently projecting.\n\nThe case for Dell Technologies\n\nAI training and inference in the cloud take place with the help of specialized servers that are set up in a way that they can process huge amounts of data quickly and in an efficient manner with the help of various types of chips that include graphics cards, processors, and high-bandwidth memory. Not surprisingly, the demand for AI servers has shot up remarkably for training and deploying AI models and applications.\n\nAccording to one estimate, sales of AI servers could jump by almost 6 times between 2024 and 2030, generating an annual revenue of $838 billion by the end of the decade. Dell is the largest player in the server market, with an estimated market share of 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The booming demand for AI servers gave Dell's infrastructure business a big lift in the recently concluded fiscal 2025, with its revenue from this segment jumping an impressive 29% year over year to $43.6 billion.\n\nThe company sold $10 billion worth of AI servers last year. It is targeting a 50% jump in AI server revenue in the current fiscal year. However, don't be surprised to see Dell exceeding its expectations. The company reported an AI server backlog worth $4.1 billion at the end of the previous quarter. However, it then struck a deal with xAI in February for AI servers worth $5 billion, taking its total backlog to $9 billion.\n\nThe delivery of the equipment to xAI is expected to be completed this year. Moreover, the potential growth opportunity in the AI server market, along with Dell's strong position in this space, suggests that it still has a lot of room for growth. Throw in the fact that Dell has an additional AI-related catalyst in the form of the market for AI PCs (personal computers), and there is a good chance that its growth could accelerate in the future.\n\nHowever, Dell is expecting its revenue to increase by 8% in the current fiscal year, which would be identical to the previous one. Analysts are expecting identical growth in the next fiscal year, followed by a slowdown two years later.\n\nThere is a possibility that Dell could beat these expectations once PC sales start improving and complement the healthy growth in the company's infrastructure business.\n\nThe verdict\n\nWhile Dell's future does seem promising thanks to the two AI-related catalysts the company is sitting on, the rapid proliferation of this technology is moving the needle in a bigger way for Oracle. This is evident from Oracle's guidance for the next couple of fiscal years, which points toward an improvement in its growth rate.\n\nDell, on the other hand, may have to wait for its PC business to get back into good shape. The one thing in Dell's favor is its cheap valuation, as we can see in the chart below, but the premium that Oracle is trading at is justified.\n\nOracle has built up a massive revenue pipeline that should translate into years of solid growth. Moreover, Oracle's valuation isn't all that expensive when compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 25 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). So, investors looking to add one of these two AI stocks to their portfolios have an easy decision to make after considering the points discussed above.",

Driver Giles Scott enjoyed three podium finishes - including two wins - in the first four fleet races of the weekend.\n\nAustralia and Spain round out the top three, with 32 and 29 points, respectively. France and New Zealand find themselves in the battle for third - but with work to do - heading into day two with 23 points each.\n\nReflecting on a standout opening day, Scott said: \"We had a really good day today, plenty going on out there, but we kept our noses clean and sailed well.\" Commenting on the course - a sailor's favorite - Scott continued: \"It was a day to push today, really nice flat water, almost all teams were pushing as hard as they could. Plenty going on and plenty of calls to make. It's really nice to be on a bigger course for the first time in a while - stretch your legs, pick a few shifts.\"\n\nWith three different winners in four races, the height of competition across the fleet was on full display in San Francisco - one of the most tactical venues on the Rolex SailGP Championship calendar. Fleet race one went the way of the French, with driver Quentin Delapierre showing his expertise in top-end conditions. Delapierre executed a flawless start, sweeping across the line in first ahead of Australia and Spain.\n\nFleet race two got off to a promising start for the Germany SailGP Team presented by Deutsche Bank, but a boundary penalty forced the team to drop back, giving the lead to NorthStar Canada who sailed away with the win. In fleet race three, Spain managed to hold off NorthStar Canada to claim victory, with Australia close behind in third.\n\nIn the fourth and final fleet race of the day, a stunning overtake on the final reach saw Canada claim their second win of the day ahead of France in second and New Zealand in third. It was the only podium finish for New Zealand, with driver Peter Burling conceding, \"We struggled a little bit out there today. We couldn't get quite off the start line in good shape, then had a big issue with the wind screen shutting down our boat.\"\n\nThe U.S. SailGP Team had a difficult start to their second home event, finishing bottom of the event leaderboard after two last-place finishes and two ninths. Grinder and jib trimmer Anna Weis said, \"It was great to race in front of the home fans, but we had a pretty tough day. It was kind of frustrating.

The San Francisco Giants will start the season on the road, meaning there will be no home games for yet another week after the season starts.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean Oracle Park will not see any baseball until then. The Giants will be hosting the Detroit Tigers for two exhibition games starting on Monday. These are usually the games reserved for the [redacted] Athletics. But with them being\u2026. (/gestures vaguely towards Sacramento and Las Vegas) displaced at the moment, the Tigers get to fill in this year.\n\nSo, since baseball is returning to Oracle Park very soon, and because it\u2019s Friday and we all love a good debate to waste time on a Friday, I wanted to ask Giants fans where their favorite place to sit in the ballpark is.\n\nNow, the answer to this can go multiple ways. Maybe you\u2019ve had some epic seats behind the plate one time and that was your favorite. Or maybe you have season tickets that you meticulously picked out for their location. Or maybe you love the vibe of a certain section. All answers are valid! One of the greatest parts about Oracle Park is that there really isn\u2019t a bad seat in the house.\n\nI\u2019ve had some pretty great seats over the years. I\u2019ve been in the front row, in the press box, in a luxury box, etc. All of those were cool to say I\u2019d done them but they\u2019re a bit too high brow for my taste. At least on a regular basis.\n\nInstead, I prefer to sit in View Reserve. Sure, it\u2019s a bit of a trek to get up there. And sure, I\u2019m afraid of heights so getting up to get snacks is terrifying.\n\nBut at the end of the day, nothing beats that view. Even the worst losses are made better by it. I\u2019ve spent multiple complete game shutout losses (wish I was exaggerating) up there and didn\u2019t mind one bit. Get me a hot chocolate and a radio while Jon Miller waxes poetic about the ships in the bay as I watch them go by too and that\u2019s a great night out.\n\nWhere is your favorite place to sit at the ballpark?",

            "content": "(Oracle's Steve Miranda talking AI agents)\n\nYesterday, at Oracle CloudWorld London, Oracle announced its new AI Agent Studio. My London-based colleague Phil Wainewright was on the case: CloudWorld London - Oracle debuts its AI Agent Studio and pledges $5bn for the UK. How does this news advance Oracle's AI narrative? Wainewright:\n\nUntil today, there had been no word of tooling to allow customers to build and customize their own agents. That changes as the CloudWorld caravan rolls into London, where Oracle is taking the wraps off its Agent Studio this morning.\n\nThis is the same type of Oracle agent tech, just exposed externally to customers (and partners). Wainewright adds:\n\nThe new AI Agent Studio, available at no extra cost to Oracle Fusion Apps customers, allows users to create new agents or modify pre-built agents, test them and then deploy and manage them across the enterprise. It's based on the tooling already used by Oracle product teams to create the [50+] pre-built agents announced so far.\n\nWhy does this announcement matter? Steve Miranda's take\n\nAnother notable detail: via the AI Agent Studio, Oracle's customers (and partners) can not only build their own agents, they can do it with a choice of external LLMs (check Wainewright's piece for more announcement info). This matters for AI agent governance as well as creation. As readers know, I have pretty strong views about what agents are good for, and what they are not - and how vendors should approach this with customers.\n\nHow would that clash with this news? Time to put Steve Miranda, EVP, Oracle Applications Development, in the hot seat once again. Miranda told me this announcement marks another phase in Oracle's AI timeline:\n\nA year and a half ago, at the 2023 Vegas CloudWorld, we announced our first set of generative AI-based features - and we announced 50 use cases that were coming. We subsequently delivered 100 and counting. Essentially every place within our applications where you generate text or could generate text, we have an 'AI Assist' button - everything from creating job posts to creating item descriptions, from draft emails to prospects within CX, to narrative reporting on financials. So that's a handful of the 100+ use cases that are out there, and that will continue every time we have any kind of text-to-creation... If you go back to last year at CloudWorld, roughly six months ago, we announced that we'd be building out the next step, which is agents. So 50+ agents, going from a tactical generative AI use case to a step in a business process. So we demoed AI agents around benefits. We have AI agents around supply chain planning. We demoed the AI agent around Document IO for automation of finance and payables, a general ledger agent for inquiry and drill down and audit - a host of these agents. And then, on stage in London, Chris Leone announced the next step in that evolution, if you will, which is the Oracle AI agent studio.\n\nWith Oracle's AI Agent Studio, you can build teams of smaller, discrete agents, adding human steps where needed - either as a precaution, or a more permanent workflow feature. Miranda explains:\n\nI think the term that's popular today is that you create teams of agents. Basically, these are the discrete agents, and you're allowed to put them into connective steps, either via workflow or with the step that's now called 'human in the middle,' where an agent does step one; a human does step two; an agent does step three. In addition to that, we have extensibility.\n\nThat's where customer choice in LLMs factors in:\n\nThis comes in two forms: the ability to for our customers or partners to take an agent that we've delivered, and that we will continue to deliver, and to modify that meaning, add prompts, or choose a different Large Language Model. There's sometimes settings within a Large Language Model on how aggressive or non-aggressive you want the Large Language Model to be. Or you can build a completely new agent.\n\nFor example?\n\nLet's take the case of a recruiting process. You can break down a recruiting process into several steps: source candidates, schedule interviews, schedule follow ups, negotiate an offer, do a background check, give an offer. Let's suppose that background check is something outside of the Oracle system. In fact, it probably is. Now, our customers, or our partners, on behalf of our customers, can build an agent that connects to a third party system, does a background check, and comes back into the AI Agent Studio to orchestrate a workflow.\n\nDifferentiating with AI agents - Oracle makes its case\n\nProgress? Definitely. But how is Oracle's approach to AI agents differentiated? Miranda makes the case.\n\nFirst, rewinding to the basic message you're hearing. Lots of our competitors nowadays talk about the need for centralized information in order to run AI. You'll hear terms like data lakes, and a lot of different offerings to bring data together. Again, we've been quite proud of the fact that we're the only SaaS application that really gives you end-to-end input into your data. We've always had it for business reporting. Now you have it for business process automation and/or better, AI, because all of your data is, in fact, in one place.\n\nMiranda says training the leading models on OCI infrastructure can't be underestimated:\n\nAlso notably: we're the only application that there's also in the technology business. As the application vendor sitting on top of that, we have direct access - so we call and test against Llama, against ChatGPT, against Cohere, and then, depending on which Large Language Model is best at the time for the use case, we choose that.\n\nMiranda cites another differentiator for agent building: a proven/compliant stack.\n\nThis isn't agents (and Agent Studio) built on top of a generic area. It's natively integrated to the Fusion Applications. So Agent Studio incorporates the agents that we build. It's native to the security model, the UI model, everything to help you best orchestrate your business processes.\n\nMy take - advice to customers on getting AI agents right\n\nMiranda has never seen an announcement that energized Oracle's partner community as much as this one. If he is right, that should be an asset to customers, because - let's face it - customers have a big learning curve here. Even if agents are easy to build, deploying them brings a ream of new considerations, from risk management to agentic evaluation to outcome metrics. So, Mr. Miranda, how should your customers get started?\n\nWhen I meet with customers today, what I tell them is, start using the 100 use cases that we've already given you now. Are those like, tremendous business payback? I'm not saying that, but it allows them to get used to what the AI is like. It allows them to go through all of their internal questioning on: what's your AI security posture, what's your AI privacy posture, what's your AI ethics posture?\n\nPre-built tools push users into hands-on mode:\n\nThis allows the end users to see, 'Here's my use case' - and get used to that. 'Well, wait a minute, if I press the button again, even though it's the same thing, it's going to generate slightly different text for me, because it's, a probabilistic model.' Getting their way of thinking around that certainly helps that transition process. Frankly, the way we built it is improving those use cases, improving those agent use cases. Now we'll improve the end-to-end workflow.\n\nFellow diginomica contributor Brian Sommer and I have an ongoing skirmish on practical versus imaginative AI use cases. Sommer is looking for the truly compelling AI scenarios, well beyond out-of-the-box starters like job description generation. Sommer isn't wrong, but with AI, customers do need to get used to a different approach to app building and use case design - not to mention risk management. Where does Miranda stand?\n\nI hear from customers. 'Hey, when am I going to have my close-your-books agent?' Let's say that's what we want to build. Let's say that's what we want to announce. How are we going to do that? Well, there's 1,000 steps in closing your books. You're paying invoices; you're matching the POS; you're creating journals; you're doing allocations; you're doing revaluations, currency adjustments. We're going to build that by building 1,000 discrete steps of these different agents, and then hooking them together. That's how it's going to come about.\n\nOracle's inclusive AI pricing and 'OCI-powered' aspects are different than most enterprise software vendors. I also don't hear the typical over-emphasis on \"autonomous agents.\" For now, building human supervision (and human steps) into agentic workflows is an important option. That said, customers should take risk profiles into account when getting started with agents.\n\nRecruitment is a good example of where the consequences of over-automation can be concerning, if not liability-inducing (granted, many companies have already taken the plunge with algorithmic screening tools, perhaps beyond where they should, so in that case, agents don't necessarily introduce a new risk factor. Still, that's no excuse for moving too fast in an area with higher consequences). On the other hand, getting agents involved in sales and service support/interactions is an example of a lower risk profile area where early lessons can be derived.\n\nOracle's emphasis on smaller, specialized agent roles is smart for use case design and accuracy. However, even those specialized agents are not always going to do what the user expects. That's life with probabilistic technologies, not to mention users getting a comfort level with prompts and agentic workflows.\n\nThis is where the use case selection and design comes in, as well as building in verification and auditing steps (LLMs as auditors are one aspect of this). Oracle has a chance to detail more on how they help customers measure and improve LLM and agent accuracy. It's a topic I will return to with just about every vendor, so Oracle hasn't heard the last of my questions on that.\n\nMiranda quipped about how we've moved on from \"hallucinations\" to \"probabilistic.\" I'm not sure if that's true in general, but it's certainly true for me. Hallucinations conjure up images of ChatGPT issuing a viral, outrageous response. Enterprise vendors can largely control that type of absurd output though narrower models, specialist agents etc. Whereas \"probabilistic\" is a characteristic you can mitigate, but not eliminate. Ultimately, you line up the right use cases, and avoid ones where the tech doesn't fit or the data quality is low. LLM agents work quite well when fused with more deterministic workflows, the ones I'm constantly told are legacy forms of automation. That's a big reason why the supposed \"death of SaaS\" is on the wrong track, but that's an argument for another time.\n\nMeanwhile, customers need advisory on the best business outcome metrics. Miranda shared several conversations with customers on how they arrived at their metrics, from financial services to HR/talent/recruitment. There isn't one right way to go about this; the point is to have these in place before you roll out. Miranda pared it down:\n\nIs AI moving the ball forward on the business metric that you care about?\n\nHe says to start there; you'll get no argument from me on that.",

            "content": "Last year, some of the biggest technology companies all made the same decision: They announced stock splits. From Nvidia to Broadcom and Super Micro Computer, the market was ripe with stock-split activity.\n\nWhy should we care about these moves? After all, they don't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. That's true, but they do signal something positive.\n\nThe announcement of such an operation suggests a company is confident about its future and the potential for its stock to soar from a new lower level. Stock splits, through the issuance of additional shares to current holders, decrease the stock price. And here's another plus: At a lower price, the stock becomes more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nSo it's not surprising investors are on the lookout for companies that may launch the next split. And the first place to look for potential candidates is among stocks that have delivered strong performance in recent years. One that qualifies right now is tech giant Oracle (ORCL -1.37%), a player that's climbed more than 200% in five years. Could it be the next to split its stock? Let's find out.\n\nWhy split a stock?\n\nFirst, though, let's talk a bit more about stock splits in general. As mentioned, they don't change the value of your holding if you're currently a shareholder, or the overall market value of the company. And they don't impact the valuation of a stock either, so even though the stock may look cheaper at its new price, it actually isn't. In fact, a stock split's only purpose is to lower a company's per-share price.\n\nStill, investors might be more inclined to buy a stock for $100, for example, instead of at a pre-split price of $1,000. Certain price levels -- such as $1,000 -- may be psychological barriers, with investors viewing the stock as expensive even if it's not. Some companies recognize this, and as their shares approach such a level, decide to launch an operation.\n\nFinally, the post-split price is determined by the ratio of the split, so a 10-for-1 split, with an original stock price of $1,000, would bring the price down to $100 post-split.\n\nOracle's string of past stock splits\n\nNow, let's consider Oracle. The company clearly isn't opposed to stock splits, since it's completed 10 of them in the past. And each time, the stock price was considerably lower than it is today. But the last split was quite a while ago -- back in 2000.\n\nSince that time, the stock has soared more than 300%, but most of the gains have come over the past few years as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom took off. Oracle once was most known for its database software, but in recent times, its cloud infrastructure business has been the biggest growth driver. In the most recent quarter, cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 49% year over year to $2.7 billion -- that's after climbing 52% and 45% in the two previous quarters.\n\nImportantly, remaining performance obligations, the value of services still to be delivered to customers, advanced 62% to $130 billion, offering investors reason to be optimistic about the coming quarters. And the company says customer demand has reached \"record levels,\" supporting plans to double data center capacity this year.\n\nIt's no surprise Oracle's stock price has followed over the past few years, leaving it trading at about $150 today, or 25x forward earnings estimates. Down from more than 30x estimates a few weeks ago, it looks reasonably priced in light of earnings performance and future prospects.\n\nIs another Oracle stock split on the horizon?\n\nConsidering all of these points, is Oracle on the road to a stock split? Not necessarily. The stock isn't trading at a level that puts it out of investors' reach, and amid recent declines in tech stocks, investors may easily opt to buy it at today's price. On top of that, Oracle might not immediately make a move to lower the stock price even further after it's already slipped.\n\nAnd Oracle doesn't need to announce such an operation to generate market excitement about the shares -- its recent gains in revenue and high demand for its services should do that job. Though it may not be reflected immediately in the stock price, it should lift this exciting AI player over the long term.",

Several senators have requested to be briefed on the talks, while one source described the discussions as moving toward a possible agreement.\n\nThe proposed deal comes amid ongoing concerns from lawmakers and national security officials about data security. TikTok\u2019s Chinese ties have been under scrutiny since Congress passed a bipartisan ban on the app last year, citing fears that ByteDance\u2019s control over the app\u2019s algorithm and user data could allow the Chinese government to access sensitive information or influence content.\n\nREAD NEXT Trump\u2019s TikTok revival: The 50-50 deal that could save the app\n\nOracle emerges as the leading contender\n\nOracle appears to have an advantage over other potential partners for TikTok\u2019s US operations. ByteDance reportedly favours Oracle for the role, and the company\u2019s existing involvement in managing TikTok\u2019s US data under \u201cProject Texas\u201d makes it a familiar player in the conversation.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, Oracle would be responsible for overseeing American users\u2019 data and ensuring that it is inaccessible to the Chinese government. However, a source involved in the negotiations stated that such guarantees could be difficult to enforce.\n\n\u201cIf the Oracle deal moves forward, you still have this [algorithm] controlled by the Chinese,\u201d the source familiar with the matter told POLITICO. \u201cThat means all you are doing is saying \u2018trust Oracle\u2019 to disseminate the data and guarantee there is no \u2018back door\u2019 to the data.\u201d\n\nThis raises questions about whether the US government would have meaningful oversight over TikTok\u2019s algorithm and data infrastructure \u2014 or whether the app\u2019s core technology would remain under the influence of ByteDance.\n\nModels for future TikTok operations\n\nSeveral situations could arise based on how the deal is structured:\n\nAlgorithm kept in China \u2013 If ByteDance keeps ownership of the algorithm, security concerns may persist even if Oracle handles the data.\n\nAlgorithm moved to Oracle Cloud \u2013 Moving the algorithm and data storage to Oracle servers could improve security , but it might disrupt TikTok\u2019s core functionality or hinder the app\u2019s capacity to adapt to global user trends.\n\nSeparate Chinese and US algorithms \u2013 If TikTok\u2019s algorithm is split between Chinese and US operations, the app\u2019s user experience could diverge between regions. However, this could also reduce the risk of cross-border data access.\n\nLawmakers are divided on whether Oracle\u2019s involvement would be enough to address national security concerns. The issue reflects broader tensions between the US and China over technology and data sovereignty.\n\nSecurity oversight and political pressure\n\nTikTok\u2019s data security has been monitored by HaystackID, an independent inspector, which reported in February that it found no evidence of unauthorised data access or internal threats. Concerns, however, remain over ByteDance\u2019s capacity to influence TikTok\u2019s algorithm and content recommendations.\n\nThe proposed deal has been compared to \u201cProject Texas 2.0,\u201d a reference to the original agreement in which TikTok agreed to store US user data on Oracle servers in Texas. That arrangement also gave Oracle the authority to look into TikTok\u2019s source code for security vulnerabilities. Despite those measures, lawmakers and the Biden administration expressed concerns that ByteDance\u2019s control over the app created ongoing security risks.\n\nPolitical dynamics and regulatory hurdles\n\nThe urgency to secure a deal stems from an executive order signed by President Trump in January, which gave ByteDance 75 days to divest its US operations or face a ban. TikTok briefly went offline in January after ByteDance failed to meet the initial deadline, and the Supreme Court later upheld the congressional ban.\n\nTrump has publicly supported Oracle\u2019s involvement, suggesting that Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s founder and a longtime Trump supporter, could play a key role in the deal. Ellison is also involved in \u201cProject Stargate,\u201d a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative that includes OpenAI, SoftBank, and MGX.\n\nTrump\u2019s position on TikTok has shifted over time. While his administration initially sought to ban the app over national security concerns, Trump later embraced TikTok as a campaign tool after gaining support from younger voters. The shift followed a meeting with Jeff Yass, a Republican donor and major ByteDance shareholder.\n\nVance has expressed confidence that a TikTok deal will be reached by the April 5 deadline. Trump has indicated that his administration is in discussions with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about a potential agreement.\n\nChina\u2019s position and influence over the deal\n\nByteDance\u2019s ability to finalise a deal ultimately rests with the Chinese government. Beijing has signalled opposition to any forced sale of TikTok\u2019s US operations. In March, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Shu Jueting said the government would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d any move to force ByteDance to divest its US business and that any transaction would require government approval.\n\nREAD NEXT Will TikTok survive the Supreme Court? Today\u2019s legal battle\n\nChinese officials have framed the issue as an attempt by the US to exert control over a successful Chinese tech company. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin accused Congress of using \u201chegemonic moves\u201d to target TikTok, while another official stated that any transaction should follow \u201cmarket principles.\u201d\n\nIf ByteDance retains any control over TikTok\u2019s algorithm or data infrastructure, it could weaken the perceived security benefits of the deal. On the other hand, giving Oracle complete authority could provoke Chinese regulators, who may see it as an attempt to weaken China\u2019s impact on the global tech market.\n\nBroader implications\n\nThe TikTok deal could have far-reaching repercussions for global tech governance and the future of cross-border data security. It also reflects broader US-China tensions over technological dominance and the role of state influence in regulating private tech companies.\n\nWhile lawmakers push for greater oversight, Oracle\u2019s potential involvement raises questions about whether entrusting a private US company with TikTok\u2019s data infrastructure would fully resolve security concerns \u2014 or simply shift control from one government to another.",

Another pointed out that services, such as AI, might be introduced as part of the package in the early days but charged for separately as things matures. \u00ae",

The sale price is about the same as what GBT paid for the 3.7-acre site in 2021, the outlet said.\n\nOracle\u2019s acquisition further cements its commitment to Nashville, where it made waves in 2021 with a $253.7 million purchase of over 65 acres for its future riverfront campus. Its latest acquisition is between the planned HQ site and the Landings at River North, MRP Realty\u2019s $220 million mixed-use project delivered in 2023.

HealthStream is offloading space amid a shift toward a hybrid work model; it is downsizing to about 30,000 square feet in the building.\n\nMemphis-based Boyle Investment Company owns the 300,000-square-foot building.\n\nOracle filled up the nearby Radius Building, at 601 11th Ave North, where it leases about 150,000 square feet. The company has steadily expanded within that space, adding a full floor last July and another 16,000 square feet earlier this year. With the sublease, Oracle\u2019s office footprint in Nashville now surpasses 200,000 square feet.\n\nThe building also houses the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce and CoStar Group, which recently leased 34,000 square feet.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nOracle\u2019s expansion comes as construction on its planned $1.35 billion East Bank campus has stalled. Nearly four years after securing incentives tied to its goal of employing 8,500 workers in Nashville by 2031, no start date has been announced. The company had roughly 700 employees in the city at the end of 2023, according to state records.\n\nOracle\u2019s East Bank project, the largest economic development deal in the history of the city and state, gained even greater significance last year when Chairman Larry Ellison announced the site would become the company\u2019s global headquarters. Nashville approved incentives of $175 million, and the state of Tennessee approved $65 million.\n\nArchitect Norman Foster has been tapped to design the campus, set on 70 acres that Oracle purchased for $277 million.\n\nTech sector investment has put Nashville at the top of North American office markets. It led net absorption in the United States and Canada, with a 2.3 percent increase between the third quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of last year, according to CBRE.\n\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

            "content": "Oracle announced the release of Java 24 today at JavaOne 2025, marking the 15th consecutive on-time release in the six-month cadence that has transformed the Java ecosystem since 2018. This milestone release comes as Java approaches its 30th anniversary, with Oracle emphasizing three key areas of innovation: AI integration, post-quantum cryptography and improved developer experience \u2014 especially for newcomers.\n\nAI-Ready Platform Enhancements\n\nJava 24 introduces several features to make the language more effective for AI workloads. Now in its ninth incubator iteration, the Vector API enables developers to express vector computations that compile to optimized CPU instructions \u2014 critical for performance-intensive AI inference tasks.\n\n\u201cWe are ensuring that Java is a contender for AI workloads, whether you are generating your code using a generative service or integrating them into your applications,\u201d said Chad Arimura, vice president of developer relations at Oracle, during the opening keynote.\n\nOther AI-focused improvements include primitive types in patterns and pattern-matching enhancements, which simplify the integration of business logic with primitive types from AI inference engines. Module import declarations also make incorporating AI services and libraries easier into Java applications.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography Foundations\n\nIn response to future threats from quantum computing, Java 24 adds three significant security features: A Key Derivation Function API, the Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) and the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA).\n\nThese implementations align with FIPS standards and establish foundational building blocks for quantum-safe applications. Donald Smith, vice president of Java product management, explained the approach: \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before with the migration from TLS 1.2 to 1.3. We will provide the implementation, ensure it\u2019s performant and ensure it\u2019s stable.\u201d\n\nOracle intends to backport these security features to long-term support releases as standards evolve, ensuring existing Java applications can be secured against \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks.\n\nSimplifying the Developer Experience\n\nOne of the most significant challenges addressed in Java 24 is improving the onboarding experience for new developers. The release makes several improvements to reduce initial complexity through its \u201cpaving the on-ramp\u201d initiative, including simple source files and instance main methods (in their fourth preview).\n\n\u201cTo write your first Java program, you needed to understand 32 distinct principles of object-oriented programming,\u201d said Georges Saab, senior vice president of Java at Oracle. \u201cWe just needed to find a way to make it easier.\u201d\n\nMark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform Group, demonstrated how a traditional \u201cHello World\u201d program requiring an understanding of classes, public modifiers, static methods and system outputs can now be simplified to just void main() { println(\u201cHello World!\u201d); }.\n\nOracle also announced Learn.java, a new website dedicated to teachers and students. This website complements Oracle\u2019s partnership with the College Board to improve computer science education through the AP CSA program.\n\nEnterprise Performance and Real-World Impact\n\nThe keynote featured testimonials from enterprise users, including Uber, which reported significant performance improvements after upgrading to newer JDK versions with the generational ZGC garbage collector. Mingmin Chen, head of Uber\u2019s real-time team, shared that the upgrade reduced memory footprint and CPU utilization and improved query latency in their log search and analytics systems.\n\nMitch Ashley, VP and Practice Lead, DevOps and Application Development, The Futurum Group, highlighted several key aspects of Oracle\u2019s Java 24 release. \u201cPart of maintaining a healthy community and ecosystem for Java is simplifying the onboarding of new developers to the language. Updating Java with Vector API for AI workloads and quantum-safe algorithms and backporting these improvements to support Java\u2019s extensive embedded base for years to come.\u201d These improvements align with Oracle\u2019s commitment to both innovation and backward compatibility.\n\nOracle emphasized that even without adopting new language features, upgrading to newer Java versions often delivers substantial performance benefits through continuous under-the-hood improvements.\n\n\u201cDevelopers are more excited about Java now than they\u2019ve been in a long, long time, possibly ever,\u201d said Saab. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really because the team can bring features to them very quickly, reliably.\u201d\n\nJava 24 is available for download today, and Java 25 \u2014 the next long-term support release \u2014 is scheduled for September 2025.",

Oracle's share price fell by 3% on the day, a steeper tumble than the 1.1% slip of the S&P 500 (^GSPC -1.07%).\n\nDancing with ByteDance?\n\nThat morning, citing unnamed \"people familiar with the matter,\" Bloomberg reported that Oracle is considering a proposal whereby it would provide security guarantees for TikTok's U.S. operations, in return for taking a small stake in a new TikTok entity based in this country. The site's vaunted algorithm would stay in the hands of its current owner, China-based ByteDance.\n\nThe financial news agency said the idea was floated last week within the Trump administration. The report did not specify by which person or people.\n\nAccording to the article's sources, Oracle would be the company responsible for vouching for the safety of users in this country. Among other duties, the veteran tech sector mainstay would have to guarantee that such users would not be exposed to a \"back door\" that could be exploited by bad actors in the Chinese government.\n\nThe report was published less than a month before the April 5 deadline Trump imposed on ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, on concerns that they put national security at risk. The aim is to effect a sale of these operations, presumably to a U.S.-based company or consortium of companies.\n\nOracle has not yet officially commented on the report.\n\nLittle reason to trade on speculation\n\nAs TikTok is a magnet for controversy -- and will likely continue to be so, no matter what happens with its American business -- investors likely think it's not wise for a major tech company to become involved with it.

Therefore, I would not trade either in or out of Oracle on the basis of this latest speculation.",

            "content": "Yet another update on the TikTok U.S. situation, which is now becoming a daily occurrence.\n\nAccording to reports, Oracle is indeed firming as the favorite to become TikTok\u2019s U.S. partner, with the company now weighing a proposal that would see it partner with TikTok, and parent company ByteDance, on security and operational elements, while the actual Tiktok algorithm, which powers its compelling \u201cFor You\u201d feed, would remain in full control of Chinese-owned ByteDance.\n\nThe main focus of this proposal, as reported by Bloomberg, would be U.S. user data security, addressing a key element of the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d.\n\nAs per Bloomberg:\n\n\u201cA proposal was circulated within the Trump administration last week that would have Oracle work with U.S. buyers to vouch for the safety of users\u2019 data. That would include guarantees that an updated US version of TikTok would not contain a back door that China\u2019s government could exploit.\u201d\n\nAs noted, this is one of the key concerns addressed within the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which went into law on January 19th.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t, however, fully address all elements of that bill, and may not pass more in-depth legal scrutiny, based on a more specific reading.\n\nAccording to the parameters of the new law, any deal that enables TikTok to remain in operation in the U.S. deal has to:\n\nEnsure that foreign-owned entities don\u2019t own more than 20% of the app\n\nEnsure that foreign-owned entities do not have direction or control over the platform\n\nEnsure that foreign-owned entities do not have an \u201co perational relationship\u201d in regards to its content recommendation algorithms, nor with respect to data sharing\n\nSo it seems that this current proposal wouldn\u2019t cut the mustard, with TikTok, based on this reporting, theoretically keeping control of the platform\u2019s algorithm, which would be in direct violation of the act.\n\nThis has also been a sticking point for the Chinese government, with CCP officials stating that they will not allow the sale of TikTok\u2019s algorithm as part of any deal with the U.S.\n\nAs such, U.S. officials seemingly still have some work to do on this front, but then again, maybe the threat of a full ban of the app, and the loss of many billions of dollars for the company, could be enough to convince Chinese officials to re-consider this element.\n\nThough that still wouldn\u2019t meet the above-noted legal requirements, while it\u2019ll also be difficult for ByteDance to maintain a critical stake in the app, given the 20% foreign-ownership threshold.\n\nBasically, it sounds like a deal is still a way off, even if the White House is getting close to a proposal that it prefers. It still seems like Chinese officials will have a significant say in what comes next, while the current discussions may not yet be meeting the legal specifics.\n\nWe\u2019ll soon find out. The government has till April 4th to come up with an alternative TikTok deal (though President Trump has already indicated that he will extend this if necessary).",

This includes sovereign AI solutions, multicloud capabilities, and generative AI innovations that are rapidly transforming industries.\n\nCommenting on the investment, the Rt Hon Peter Kyle MP, the UK\u2019s Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, said, \u201cThis $5 billion investment will accelerate our AI ambitions, providing businesses and public services with cutting-edge cloud infrastructure to drive productivity, enhance security, and unlock new opportunities for growth \u2013 driving forward our Plan for Change.\u201d\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nSiobhan Wilson, senior vice president and country leader for Oracle UK, echoed this sentiment. \u201cThe UK Government\u2019s vision is clear: use AI to help power the UK\u2019s future,\u201d she said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement cements Oracle\u2019s commitment to supporting this vision.\u201d\n\nA Diverse Presence\n\nOracle\u2019s expanded OCI presence in the UK will cater to both public and private sector organizations across healthcare, financial services, defense, retail, and manufacturing. This will enable them to seamlessly migrate various workloads to the cloud, modernize existing applications, and integrate innovative AI solutions into their operations. Organizations will also gain access to Oracle\u2019s robust multi-cloud capabilities and dedicated UK public and sovereign cloud regions, offering greater flexibility and control over their data and applications.\n\nRecent advancements, such as the introduction of over 50 AI agents within the Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite, demonstrate Oracle\u2019s commitment to practical AI applications. With this significant investment, Oracle aims to empower even more UK organizations to take advantage of the latest AI innovations such as AI agents, driving efficiency and fostering a new era of technological advancement.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nOracle\u2019s significant $5 billion investment in expanding its UK cloud infrastructure holds substantial implications for public sector organizations utilizing or considering Oracle\u2019s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions. This move directly aligns with the UK Government\u2019s AI-driven future and offers tangible benefits for public sector ERP users.\n\nEnhanced performance and scalability for mission-critical ERP workloads. With a larger local footprint, organizations can expect lower latency, faster processing times, and the ability to seamlessly scale their ERP environments to meet fluctuating demands. According to Wilson Oracle\u2019s cloud investment will ensure that customers can use AI to achieve new levels of productivity, unlock growth, and benefit from superior performance and security, all with improved cost savings. This robust infrastructure is crucial for managing complex public sector operations, from finance and procurement to HR and asset management, ensuring efficient service delivery.\n\nIncreased access to sovereign cloud and data security for sensitive information. This is a critical advantage for public sector ERP users handling sensitive citizen data and adhering to stringent regulatory requirements. Oracle\u2019s commitment to providing sovereign cloud options ensures that data resides within the UK, meeting data sovereignty mandates. Oracle operates separate UK Government Clouds, providing a full cloud and AI stack that customers can deploy as a Sovereign Cloud. This offers public sector ERP users the confidence that their critical data is managed within a secure and compliant environment.\n\nIntegration of cutting-edge AI innovations into ERP processes. Oracle\u2019s investment is intrinsically linked to its advancements in AI, including generative AI and AI agents. For the UK public sector, the introduction of 50+ AI agents within the Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite demonstrates Oracle\u2019s commitment to automating repetitive tasks across finance, supply chain, HR, and other ERP modules. This allows public sector employees to focus on more strategic and citizen-centric activities, ultimately driving efficiency and improving public services. The expanded cloud infrastructure will also facilitate wider adoption and utilization of these AI-powered ERP capabilities within the UK public sector.",

Among them:\n\nOracle is after all \u201cjust a software company\u201d and doesn\u2019t understand hardware;\n\nOracle is a \u201clegacy\u201d on-prem company that does not and will never \u201cget\u201d the cloud;\n\nOracle is \u201clate to the cloud\u201d and would never be able to catch AWS and Google Cloud and Microsoft; and\n\nLarry Ellison has finally met his match and should ride off into the sunset.\n\nMy big takeaway from all this is that for both tech vendors and their customers, all things are possible in the Cloud Wars.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

The deal would also potentially leave TikTok\u2019s influential algorithm under the control of its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, a key point of contention in the ongoing discussions.\n\nThis plan is emerging with increasing urgency, as the U.S. government faces a looming deadline to finalize a solution before April 5. Under the current law, TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership must divest to mitigate potential national security risks. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office, extending the deadline and providing additional time for negotiations.\n\nOracle\u2019s involvement is not new\u2014since 2020, Oracle has been collaborating with TikTok under a partnership called Project Texas, which focuses on securing U.S. user data. However, this latest proposal raises significant questions about the future structure of TikTok\u2019s relationship with its parent company and the Chinese government.\n\nPer Bloomberg, while Oracle\u2019s participation could help facilitate a deal with Chinese authorities, the proposal is still tentative and subject to change. If finalized, any deal would require approval from both the U.S. government and ByteDance, as well as the Chinese government.\n\nRead more: TikTok Urges US Appeals Court to Overturn Law Mandating Sale of US Assets\n\nA key sticking point is the retention of TikTok\u2019s algorithm by ByteDance. U.S. lawmakers and security officials have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could access sensitive data or use the platform for propaganda purposes\u2014a charge that both ByteDance and Chinese officials have repeatedly denied. According to sources, Chinese authorities are likely to accept Oracle\u2019s role in the deal as long as the algorithm remains in China\u2019s control, which may simplify negotiations with Beijing but complicate compliance with national security laws in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration, which inherited the national security concerns related to TikTok from the Trump administration, has yet to comment on the specifics of any proposal. Spokespersons for Oracle and the White House declined to respond to requests for comment, while TikTok and ByteDance also refrained from issuing statements.\n\nBloomberg also reports that the U.S. remains one of TikTok\u2019s most important markets, with estimates valuing TikTok\u2019s U.S. business at as much as $50 billion. While ByteDance\u2019s direct involvement in the ongoing talks remains unclear, the process has attracted several potential bidders. Publicly known parties include a consortium led by billionaire Frank McCourt and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, as well as a group featuring tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley and YouTube star MrBeast. San Francisco-based Perplexity AI has also proposed a merger.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has been mentioned as a possible bidder, though the company has not confirmed its interest. Similarly, while President Trump has suggested that Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison could be a key figure in any deal, and Chinese officials have reportedly explored the possibility of Elon Musk acquiring TikTok in the U.S., Musk himself has stated he is not interested in pursuing the acquisition.\n\nDespite its considerable role in the tech infrastructure sector, Oracle faces significant challenges in this deal. The company is currently focused on building data centers and is burdened with debt from previous acquisitions. A large-scale investment or full acquisition of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations may be outside the realm of possibility due to Oracle\u2019s financial commitments and strategic focus.",

That means all you are doing is saying \u2018trust Oracle\u2019 to disseminate the data and guarantee there is no \u2018back door\u2019 to the data,\u201d that person told Politico.\n\nFor example, if TikTok\u2019s algorithm isn\u2019t entirely rebuilt by its American owner or if TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent firm ByteDance maintains a role in its operations, the algorithm could still have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the Chinese government, the report said.\n\nThe proposed deal follows an effort from 2023 dubbed \u201cProject Texas\u201d in which TikTok gave Oracle access to its algorithm, source code and content moderation materials in a bid to ease national security concerns.\n\nBut those concerns were never eased, leading Congress to pass legislation last year requiring ByteDance to find a new owner for TikTok or find a new owner for the popular app by Jan. 19. That deadline came and went with no deal, leading TikTok to briefly go dark.\n\nThen Trump took office and halted the ban, giving ByteDance until April 5 to find a new owner for TikTok. Oracle\u2019s name had been floated as a possible owner soon after Trump extended the deadline. Last week, the president said TikTok had interest from four potential buyers.\n\nWriting about the ban earlier this year, PYMNTS noted the impact TikTok can have on driving revenue for businesses and entrepreneurs who use it to sell their wares.\n\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence shows that nearly 80% of millennials and Gen Z consumers turn to social media for financial advice, while shoppers from Generation Z are 117% more likely to purchase products from influencers.",

The two technologies are intrinsically bound in the U.K. investments.\n\n\u201cThis $5 billion investment will accelerate our AI ambitions, providing businesses and public services with cutting-edge cloud infrastructure to drive productivity, enhance security, and unlock new opportunities for growth,\u201d Peter Kyle, British Parliament member and U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, said in the announcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cementing the U.K.\u2019s position at the forefront of the AI revolution,\u201d Kyle added.\n\nThe data center investments come on the heels of a recent partnership Oracle cemented to provide four British governmental agencies, including the Home Office, with a shared services platform leveraging Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite to standardize finance, supply chain and HR data.\n\nDeloitte and IBM will be part of the joint implementation team, according to an October announcement.\n\nAs vendors rapidly populate ERPs and other enterprise software platforms with autonomous AI agents, Oracle is keeping pace. The provider launched a suite of cloud-based agentic fraud detection tools for financial services last week and added an array of agent capabilities to the NetSuite ERP in February.\n\n\u201cAll of our applications are becoming AI agents,\u201d Ellison said.",

            "content": "Oracle\u2019s stunning success in winning significant cloud-infrastructure market share from three of the world\u2019s most-powerful corporations is the fruit of technology innovation, go-to-market innovation, strategic differentiation, and an absolute refusal to play by the rules established by the incumbents.\n\nThat surging market momentum was quantified in stark detail last week as Oracle reported its total RPO jumped 63% to $130 billion in Q3 ended Feb. 28. One other related detail from Q3: In the quarter, Oracle signed customer contracts that contributed a whopping $48 billion to that RPO total.\n\nAnd as the AI Revolution morphs from shiny-object phenomenon to a worldwide business imperative, I\u2019d like to showcase 10 core factors behind that extraordinary achievement by Oracle, which achieved those stratospheric growth figures in spite of competing directly against global powerhouses Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.\n\nI\u2019ve extracted my 10 reasons for the RPO surge from commentary from Oracle CEO Safra Catz and chairman/CTO Larry Ellison on last week\u2019s fiscal-Q3 earnings call. You can check out my top-line analyses of key financial details from that call here:\n\nAs you peruse these 10 factors, keep in mind that while advanced-technology vision and innovation was indispensable for Oracle \u2014 and is always so within every company in the Cloud Wars Top 10 \u2014that 63% boom in RPO is also the result of some unprecedented new approaches to multi-cloud partnerships as well as an unflagging aversion to following the crowd.\n\n1. Differentiated architecture enables new deployment/delivery models\n\nOracle\u2019s Gen2 architecture allows its cloud infrastructure to go big, go very small, sit in Oracle data centers, and/or sit in customer data centers in whatever configuration the customer wants. Is this a technology feature or a go-to-market feature? In today\u2019s blindingly fast and turbulent world, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n2. Differentiated architecture enables superior performance and/or cost\n\nAsked to explain Oracle\u2019s big momentum in a savagely competitive market, Ellison said in part, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s actually very simple. The capability we have is to build these huge AI clusters with technology that actually runs faster and more economically than our competitors. So it really is a technology advantage we have over them. If you run faster and you pay by the hour, you cost less. So that technology advantage translates to an economic advantage, which allows us to win a lot of these huge deals.\u201d\n\n3. Data-center proliferation\n\n\u201cSpeaking of data centers, we marked a milestone this quarter as we crossed into triple digits with our 101st cloud region coming online,\u201d Catz said in her prepared remarks on the March 10 call. Warming to the subject, the Oracle CEO demonstrated her company\u2019s sharp strategic differentiation from that of the other hyperscalers by offering this perspective: \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before we have more cloud regions than all of our competitors combined, reflecting the strategic advantage of our Gen2 architecture, which offers our customers the most flexibility from a delivery standpoint.\u201d\n\n4. Oracle offers both the largest and the smallest cloud data centers\n\n\u201cWe can start our data centers smaller than our competitors, and then we grow based on demand. Building these data centers is expensive, and they\u2019re really expensive if they\u2019re not full or they\u2019re not at least half full. So we tend to start small and then add capacity as demand arises. And that allows us to have higher utilization,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cAnd the fact that we have a high degree of automation, which lowers our labor costs dramatically. By the way, more important than lowering our labor costs is that with no labor, there\u2019s no human error, there\u2019s no human mischief. So we\u2019re much more reliable and much more secure because we don\u2019t have a lot of human beings in our data centers.\u201d\n\n5. AI segment of infrastructure business growing extremely fast\n\nEllison offered a compelling perspective on the scale of AI training and of AI inferencing, and on why he believes the latter will be of enormous importance to Oracle\u2019s customers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just AI training that drove the RPO up \u2014 it\u2019s also AI inferencing, and the potential of AI inferencing,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThink about all of the Oracle databases out there and the data in those databases that are going to train AI models. Those AI models are only useful if they\u2019re familiar with the data that\u2019s your data. The AI models have to understand your products, your customers, your service requests, your financials. So you have to make all that data available to the AI models in those databases. This has not been possible, and we\u2019re right at the beginning of that.\u201d A few moments later, Ellison expanded on the value that AI inferencing offers to customers: \u201cThere are literally millions of Oracle Databases all over the world and all of those millions of databases and all of that data will be used to train AI models. And, and on top of that, they\u2019ll build agents and applications\u2026. There are hundreds of thousands of our customers that will be consuming those AI models and training those same AI models on their private data. And then running agents and applications on top of all of that. That\u2019s a much bigger market than AI training for us.\u201d\n\n6. Oracle\u2019s breakthrough multi-cloud agreements with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated a number of times in this past, I believe Ellison\u2019s ability to forge these agreements through which his three primary competitors \u2014 the original three giant hyperscalers \u2014 can in effect sell and support the Oracle Database must be regarded as one of Ellison\u2019s most-legendary achievements. On the earnings call, both Catz and Ellison were unreservedly bullish on the latest financial results for the multi-cloud database business as well as its future prospects. \u201cThat revenue is more than 10X what it was just a year ago, and the numbers are exploding. As I told you, we\u2019ve got 18 live, but 40 more coming online. So that is going unbelievably well.\u201d Later in the call, Catz offered a deeper insight into the competitive dynamics among the three original hyperscalers that will benefit not only customers, but also Oracle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s motivated to get [the new multi-cloud regions] up as quickly as possible because as you know, the way the revenue flows through is that it flows through to our partner or our host and then they pay us.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re very, very motivated to get it as quickly as possible because that is holding up revenue for them until they can deploy it\u2026. As you can imagine, there\u2019s some significant competition between those three hyperscalers to grab those workloads before their competitors take them\u2026.\n\n\u201cWhen those customers move, they often bring a lot of additional workloads connected to the database into that hyperscaler\u2019s cloud, and often directly into OCI because of course we are the fourth hyperscaler so we\u2019re a competitor for them.\u201d\n\n7. OCI customers are committing to bigger and longer-term contracts\n\nOracle\u2019s booming RPO backlog, Catz said, \u201creflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses further. Our cloud RPO grew over 90% and now represents more than 80% of total RPO, and approximately 31% of that total RPO number is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\n8. The AI Revolution will take no prisoners \u2014 and demand is exploding\n\nBusiness leaders realize they don\u2019t have a handful of years to sit on the sideline and monitor what others are doing before forming a committee to spend 18 months brainstorming \u2014 that\u2019s all a recipe for unmitigated disaster. So with lots of tech vendors eagerly touting their AI expertise, Oracle \u2014 for reasons outlined above and below \u2014 is winning the hearts, minds, and wallets of a rapidly escalating number of customers. \u201cGrowth in the AI segment of our infrastructure business was extraordinary,\u201d Catz said. And wrap your head around her framing of Oracle\u2019s aggressive buildout of data centers: \u201cThe growth of our power capacity under contract is even higher than the growth in the number of data centers, and we expect that our available power capacity will double this calendar year. And triple by the end of next fiscal year.\u201d Turning back to revenue, Catz explained that as those huge RPO numbers begin to convert to revenue, the cloud business will sharply lift the growth rate of the entire company for the next few years. \u201cWe now have a clear line of sight to our future revenue growth,\u201d Catz said, \u201cand we remain very confident and committed to total cloud infrastructure revenue for fiscal year 2025 growing faster than the 50% reported last year, and it will be even faster for fiscal year 2026 \u2014 likely a lot faster. Our confidence in meeting our $66 billion revenue target for FY26 is now stronger than ever, and represents around a 15% growth rate [companywide, not just for cloud]. And more importantly, I now expect that our [companywide] FY27 growth rate will be around 20%, which is even higher than I previously guided.\u201d\n\n9. Customers accelerate migrations of Oracle Database to the cloud\n\n\u201cCustomers can get our database everywhere: They can install an Oracle Cloud region on their premises, they can get Oracle Database from Azure, they can get Oracle Database from Google, they can get Oracle Database from AWS,\u201d Ellison said on the call. \u201cAnd that Oracle Database is becoming more and more capable. It already stores most of the world\u2019s most-valuable data and has by far the largest database installed base in the world, with nothing remotely close. And most of those databases are still on premise, but now they\u2019re beginning to migrate to the cloud. And one of the big drivers of them migrating to the cloud is the Autonomous version of the database.\n\n\u201cAnd now perhaps just as importantly we\u2019ve introduced the AI Data Platform, which allows you to take all of your existing data and make it available to any of the leading AI models \u2014 xAI Grok, ChatGPT, Llama. All of them can immediately take advantage of your existing data and your existing database and turn it into insights and actions and agents, acting directly on your private data while keeping that private data private. And that has been the missing link for companies and government agencies.\u201d\n\n10. Larry Ellison\u2019s vision\n\nExamples of Ellison\u2019s ability to see the future and then create it are legion: the acquisition of Sun 16 years ago which gave Oracle the hardware expertise that has become an indispensable foundation for its entire cloud-infrastructure business; the Autonomous Database; the willingness to go head-on against Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS; Cloud@Customer; Dedicated Cloud Regions; being willing and able to conceive and build the world\u2019s largest as well as smallest cloud data centers; and, among many others, the remarkable multi-cloud Database partnerships (with primary competitors!) outlined above in #6.\n\nIn times like these, which for business leaders are both wildly exhilarating and also fairly dangerous, the vision and track record of Larry Ellison can be a compelling factor in deciding which strategic cloud partner to run with into the AI Revolution.",

It\u2019s perfect for those who want high-quality coffee at home without the learning curve of a fully manual machine. From precision grinding to automatic milk frothing, every step is easy and enjoyable, with the device delivering top-notch espresso with minimal effort. While it\u2019s a hefty investment \u2013 and a hefty bit of kit \u2013 it\u2019s one of the best options for coffee enthusiasts who want cafe-quality drinks at home at the push of a button.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nSage Oracle Jet: two-minute review\n\nThe Sage Oracle Jet is a serious contender in the world of high-end espresso machines, offering an impressive mix of automation and precision. Designed to cater to both beginners and seasoned coffee enthusiasts, this high-tech machine helps simplify the often-fiddly process of making high-quality espresso, offering consistent results with minimal effort.\n\nOne of the Oracle Jet\u2019s standout features is its high-precision burr grinder. With 45 settings, it allows for ultra-fine adjustments to the grind size so that you can get the consistency you need from your coffee beans. This is a really valuable feature, especially since I\u2019ve found many of the best espresso machines require a lot of trial and error to get this right, which wastes time (and coffee). Sage\u2019s latest model really doubles down on this, providing real-time feedback on extraction, and guiding you in getting the perfect shot every time.\n\n(Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nWhile the automatic tamping system serves up a uniform coffee puck time and time again, I did find that the grinder could be a little messy, occasionally leaving stray grounds on the portafilter and even on the worktop around the machine, but nothing a quick wipe won\u2019t sort out.\n\nThe machine makes up for this minor inconvenience with its sizeable, intuitive touchscreen, which makes the entire brewing process not only feel super premium, but truly effortless. It walks you through drink selection, grinding, extraction and milk frothing in a really fluid and enjoyable way, making it almost impossible to get a bad coffee. And the Auto MilQ steam wand automatically textures milk to the right consistency for your drink of choice, even adjusting settings based on whether you're using dairy or plant-based alternatives \u2013 a rare but certainly welcome feature in the world of home espresso makers.\n\n(Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nDespite its many conveniences, Sage\u2019s impressive machine does have some drawbacks. It\u2019s quite bulky and heavy, so you\u2019ll need ample kitchen worktop space. And the lack of simultaneous brewing and milk steaming can slow things down a bit, especially when making multiple drinks. And, of course, the \u00a31,699.95 / $1,999.95 / AU$3,199 price tag makes it a serious investment.\n\nStill, for those who want top-tier espresso without the hassle, the Sage Oracle Jet delivers. It offers barista-level quality at the touch of a button, making it what I believe to be one of the most advanced and user-friendly coffee machines on the market today.\n\nSage Oracle Jet: price and availability\n\nAvailable to buy now, priced at \u00a31,699.95 / $1,999.95 / AU$3,199\n\nSold as Breville outside Europe\n\nMore expensive than most competitors\n\nSold under the name Breville outside of Europe and Sage in the UK, the Oracle Jet launched in October 2024, priced at \u00a31,699.95 / $1,999.95 / AU$3,199. Available from the brand's official web store as well as John Lewis and other major retailers, it comes in Truffle Black and Stainless Steel in the UK, while buyers in the US and Australia get an additional Sea Salt White option.\n\nCompared to Sage\u2019s other high-end models, the Oracle Jet sits between the Barista Touch Impress (\u00a31,199 / $1,499 / AU$2,299) and the flagship Oracle Touch (\u00a32,099 / $2,799.95 / AU$3,699), making it a solid high-range option.\n\nWhen stacked up against rival machines, the Oracle Jet holds its ground well. There\u2019s the Ninja Luxe Caf\u00e9 ($499 / \u00a3400 / AU$750), which offers a semi-automatic espresso setup with some smart features at a fraction of the price, but lacks the same precision and customization.\n\nMeanwhile, the ProCook Barista Elite Bean to Cup Espresso Coffee Machine (\u00a3599 / $775 / AU$1,225) is another alternative, offering a very similar experience at a much lower cost, but it doesn\u2019t feature the same level of automation, grind adjustment or cold brew functionality as the Oracle Jet.\n\nValue score: 4/5\n\nSage Oracle Jet: specs\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Dimensions 19.2 x 15 x 14.5 inches / 48.8 x 38.1 x 36.8cm Weight 26.9lbs / 12.2kg Grinder 45-setting burr grinder Drink options 11, including espresso, latte, cappuccino, cold brew, and hot chocolate Milk frothing Automatic, with presets for dairy and plant-based milks Water tank 2qt / 2.3l (front-fillable) Smart features Auto grind adjustment, Wi-Fi updates\n\nSage The Oracle Jet: design\n\nHigh-end build with sleek finish\n\nIntuitive touchscreen for easy navigation\n\nClever built-in features like hidden wheels\n\nThe Sage Oracle Jet is a serious piece of kit. Right out of the box, everything about it screams premium, and just shy of \u00a32,000, you\u2019d like to think so, too. With a brushed stainless steel finish, it has a sleek, pro feel that will certainly look the part in any kitchen, given it\u2019s got the space for it. That\u2019s the thing \u2013 this isn\u2019t some compact coffee maker you can tuck away in the corner of your kitchen. It\u2019s just under 50cm wide and 40cm deep, so you\u2019ll need plenty of free worktop space to fit this beast in comfortably. It's also pretty weighty, weighing in at over 12kg, so you might even need someone to help you lift it out of the box.\n\nOnce you've got it set up and pride of place, it\u2019ll be hard not to immediately fall in love with the 5-inch touchscreen, which dominates the front of the machine, and for good reason \u2013 it\u2019s your guide through the entire coffee-making process. Whether you\u2019re brewing a classic espresso or frothing milk for a cappuccino, the Oracle Jet serves clear, easy-to-follow instructions through text and images. It even has light and dark modes, which is a nice touch depending on your kitchen lighting. The interface is smooth and responsive, which is a relief since the screen on Sage\u2019s last machine, the Barista Touch Impress, was frustratingly sluggish. It now works as expected, making swiping between different drinks options a dream.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Lee Bell) (Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nOne of the Oracle Jet\u2019s most, let\u2019s say, thoughtful features is the front-fillable 2.3L water tank. If you\u2019ve ever had to awkwardly shuffle a big ol\u2019 espresso machine around just to access and refill the tank, you\u2019ll definitely appreciate this design feature, as it means you can just fill it up via the access point on the top with a jug straight from the tap. There\u2019s also a window just above the tray so you can peek at the water level, which is always welcome.\n\nAnother handy feature is the addition of hidden wheels. Given its size and weight, you might expect the Oracle Jet to be a hassle to move, but a simple swipe of the lever under the drip tray lifts the machine onto its 360-degree wheels, making it incredibly easy to reposition. It\u2019s a small detail, but one that shows Sage has really considered its usability for its customers.\n\nThe grinder and portafilter system also boast brilliant build quality, with automatic grinding and tamping, which take the guesswork (and the effort) out of making espresso, but I\u2019ll talk more about that in the performance section. The 58mm portafilter is barista-standard for even extraction, but it also feels well-built and weighty in the hand, like it should.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: Lee Bell) (Image credit: Lee Bell) (Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nThe Auto MilQ steam wand is another standout. It automatically textures milk to the consistency required for whichever type of drink you\u2019re making \u2013 and the neat thing here is that you can input which type of milk you\u2019re frothing, whether that\u2019s your standard dairy or plant-based alternatives like soya, oat or almond. Coffee-brewing control freaks will be pleased to hear they still have the option to steam manually, too.\n\nHowever, the machine\u2019s biggest drawback is perhaps that you can\u2019t brew and steam at the same time. If you\u2019re making multiple milk-based coffee drinks, you\u2019ll have to wait for one process to finish before starting the other, which can seriously slow things down. This is due to the machine\u2019s single ThermoJet heating system. Unlike dual-boiler machines, which have separate boilers for brewing and steaming, the Oracle Jet uses one heating element for both tasks. If it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you, Sage\u2019s slightly pricier (but not quote as smart) Oracle and Oracle Touch machines are the firm\u2019s only espresso makers that feature a dual heating system, so it might be worth considering those.\n\nDesign score: 4.5/5\n\nSage The Oracle Jet: performance\n\nAutomatic grind and tamping give top results, time and time again\n\nFast heating and smooth espresso extraction\n\nCold brew and iced coffee options\n\nThe Sage Oracle Jet is built to take the hassle out of home espresso, and after using it for just over a month, replacing my usual espresso maker, I can confidently say it delivers on that promise. From grinding to milk frothing, almost everything is automated, making it ideal for anyone who wants great coffee without the faff.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the grinder. It has 45 settings, which means you can seriously fine-tune your grind size to whatever beans you're using. The smart thing about this is that the machine even tells you if your shot is under- or over-extracted, so you know whether to adjust the grind next time. This is a game-changer if you\u2019ve ever struggled with dialling in a manual espresso machine and haven\u2019t been able to nail the extraction.\n\nThe automatic tamping system also works really well here as it means you don\u2019t have to worry about pressing too hard or too soft \u2013 you can just let the machine do the work. That said, it does have a habit of leaving a few stray coffee grounds behind, which isn\u2019t a huge deal but does mean a bit of extra clean-up.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Lee Bell) (Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nWhen it comes to pulling a shot, the dual ThermoJet system heats up almost instantly, so there\u2019s no waiting around like with cheaper machines. I found espresso extraction to be smooth and consistent, with rich, balanced flavours \u2013 whether you\u2019re using high-end beans or just grabbing something from the supermarket. I used Lidl\u2019s Deluxe range Colombian Supremo beans at one point (costly just over \u00a32 per bag) and these proved equally satisfying in my morning coffee, offering a lovely full-bodied and smooth taste. I suspect this was down to the machine making the most of how they were brewed.\n\nThe real-time shot timer on the touchscreen is also worth a mention. It\u2019s probably one of my favourite features on this machine\u2014turning green if your shot is timed perfectly and red if something\u2019s off, giving you immediate feedback. It\u2019s so impressive!\n\nThe Auto MilQ steam wand also adds to the top performance experience of the Oracle Jet. The milk textures it produces are always silky smooth, and ideal for making latte art if you\u2019re into that (not that I could produce anything worth looking at, but that\u2019s certainly down to my lack of skills). While manual milk frothing is an option, most people will probably prefer the automatic setting and it will produce great results.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: Lee Bell) (Image credit: Lee Bell)\n\nOne of the more unique features on the Oracle Jet is its cold brew and cold espresso modes. Cold espresso is perfect for iced lattes, keeping the flavours bold without melting the ice too quickly. The cold brew function isn\u2019t quite the same as traditional overnight steeping, but it still produces a smoother, less acidic coffee in a fraction of the time.\n\nCleaning is another area where the Oracle Jet makes life easy. Despite the mess the grinder can make, it has automatic cleaning cycles for the steam wand and internal components, so there\u2019s not much hands-on maintenance. You\u2019ll still need to rinse the portafilter and wipe down the drip tray, but overall, it\u2019s much lower effort than most espresso machines, I\u2019ve found.\n\nPerformance score: 4.5/5\n\nShould you buy the Sage Oracle Jet?\n\nBuy it if\n\nYou want barista-quality coffee without the effort The Oracle Jet automates most of the process, ensuring consistent results every time\n\nYou\u2019re happy to pay extra for a top quality appliance If you\u2019re one for appreciating the finer things in life and don\u2019t mind paying extra for the privilege of a well-built and stylish machine, then you\u2019ll be right at home with the Oracle Jet.\n\nYou love cold coffee\n\nThe cold brew and cold espresso functions are rare on machines of this type.\n\nYou want smart guidance The real-time extraction feedback and grind adjustment tips help you master espresso-making and makes you feel like a pro with very minimal effort.\n\nDon't buy it if\n\nYou\u2019re on a budget At nearly \u00a31,700, the Oracle Jet is certainly not a casual purchase. It\u2019s an investment that will last you years to come, so definitely more aimed at those who are serious about creating a barista-quality coffee at home.\n\nYou need a compact machine It\u2019s large and it\u2019s pretty heavy, so not ideal for smaller kitchens or those tight on space.\n\nYou want to brew and steam at the same time The single ThermoJet system means you have to wait between brewing and milk steaming, so not ideal for those who want to make a swift cup of coffee before dashing off to work.\n\nSage The Oracle Jet: also consider\n\nNinja Luxe Caf\u00e9 Price: \u00a3400 / $499 / AU$750 A more affordable bean-to-cup option that still offers some automation, including guided espresso pulls and an automatic frother. However, it lacks the fine-tuned grind settings and high-end build of the Oracle Jet.\n\n\n\nRead our full Ninja Luxe Caf\u00e9 review\n\nSage (Breville) Barista Touch Impress Price: \u00a31,199 / $1,499 / AU$2,299 A slightly less expensive alternative from Sage with many of the same automation features, including Auto MilQ milk frothing and guided espresso adjustments. However, it lacks the cold brew and cold espresso options and the digital display just isn\u2019t quite as swift as that on the Oracle Jet. Read our full Sage (Breville) Touch Impress review\n\nDe\u2019Longhi Eletta Explore Price: \u00a3999.99 / $1,899.99 / AU$1,799 An accomplished bean-to-cup coffee machine that\u2019s perfect for coffee lovers who don\u2019t have the time to maintain an espresso machine. Plus, it can make both hot and cold beverages and comes with everything you might need for a fully operational caffeination station. Read our full De\u2019Longhi Eletta Explore review\n\nHow I tested the Sage The Oracle Jet\n\nI used the Sage Oracle Jet for just over a month at home, making two coffee drinks per day using a mixture of high quality Lavazza decaf and fully caffeinated coffee beans. During testing, I noted flavors, consistency, temperature, time to brew, and noise levels. Beyond drinking the espresso and coffee black, I tried the different milk frother presets with both dairy and plant-based milk, observing the foam levels and differences between settings. In the end, I tested almost every setting on the machine and observed how it performed during every step.\n\nFirst reviewed: March 2025",

            "content": "Key Takeaways:\n\nThe RED token has seen a significant price increase after the announcement of the DRILL program.\n\nThe DRILL program aims to airdrop 4.5% of the total RED supply to early adopters and core users.\n\nThis initiative consists of five strategic pillars designed to foster the sustainable growth of the RedStone ecosystem.\n\nAs for the RedStone (RED) token, the price continues to take off, gaining almost $0.335 to hit a recent record high from just $0.4195 earlier this month. Today the token peaked at $0.7545, a level not seen since March 7, representing a nearly 80% gain from a pair of recent lows. This spike has pushed RedStone market cap to more than $204 million.\n\nDRILL Program Fuels Optimism in RedStone\u2019s Future\n\nIn the wake of the launch of the DRILL (Develop, Reinforce, Innovate, Launch, Learn) program, this trend of positive momentum serves as the primary catalyst. This program will reserve around 4.5% of the total RED token supply for early adopters and core RedStone platform users. This program aims to break away from the traditional token airdrops that only creates temporary hype and offers long-term support to create actual value for the DeFi ecosystem. The team sees that as providing an incentive mechanism for fast growth and consolidating RedStone\u2019s position in the crowded oracle market.\n\nDRILL program funds are allocated in a structured manner:\n\nDevelop (15%): This pillar focuses on promoting the rapid adoption of newer asset feeds such as Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), Bitcoin-based finance (BTCfi), and Real-World Assets (RWA). This is designed to incentivize early adopters of these emerging asset classes.\n\nReinforce (60%): This pillar focuses on strengthening the security and resilience of data feeds. Six months after the TGE, the funds will be deployed into the Eigen staking vault. These funds will enhance security while gradually redistributing proceeds to users of protected pools and providing insurance in case of a price feed failure.\n\nInnovate (20%): Supports the adoption of innovative products such as Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) or AI enhancements. For example, it will advocate for pools related to OEV or that help bootstrap the communication framework between CLARA AI Agents.\n\nLaunch (5%): This pillar aims to generate traction for new protocols by rewarding early adopters with additional yield. It also supports small-scale innovation by providing liquidity and traction to help new projects succeed.\n\nLearn: This pillar does not directly allocate tokens but instead creates research, dashboards, tools, and learning resources to raise awareness about the process of achieving high-quality data feeds and oracles in DeFi.\n\nRedStone\u2019s Emergence on the Oracle Landscape\n\nRedStone is one of the fastest-growing oracle providers in the space. According to currently available data from DeFiLlama, RedStone ranks as the fourth largest oracle provider after Chainlink, Pyth, and Chronicle, with a total value secured (TVS) of $4.9 billion. The platform protects major networks, including Spark, Cygnus Restake, Resolv, and Euler.\n\nA key condition is that eligible projects must airdrop their allocations to users of products being directly secured by RedStone. This ensures the benefits go right into the community. Allocation splits will vary based on factors such as the TVL secured, innovation, and relevance of a project to RedStone as an oracle provider.\n\nTechnical Analysis Points Towards Further Upward Trend\n\nA closer look at the RED token\u2019s price movements on the hourly chart reveals strong potential. The token hit a low of $0.4188 on March 11th before bouncing back strongly, with prices climbing above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.688. Meanwhile, the token has also pierced the key resistance, or at least it has repeatedly peaked at, $0.6817 (its intraday high on March 12) and the breakout point of a cup and handle pattern, a classic bullish continuation setup. Additionally, the price has been trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating continued bullish sentiment.\n\nBased on this technical analysis, RED token is set for additional increases. The next important resistance to monitor is $0.8432, ~20% above the current price.\n\nWith the focus on innovation and security and the strategic introduction of the platform\u2019s DRILL program, RedStone seems to be capturing the interest of both investors and users, setting the stage for further growth in the ever-evolving world of DeFi. Its case is further bulwarked by integrations from projects like Pendle, DeltaPrime, Morpho, Lido, Swell Network, and Renzo.\n\nMore News: Binance Tightens Token Listing Standards Amid Regulatory Shifts and Market Volatility",

We look forward to achieving new milestones together on and off the track and welcome Mobil to our family.\u201d\n\nOlly Hughes, CMO, Red Bull Technology said: \u201cSince 2017, ExxonMobil has been an integral part of Oracle Red Bull Racing\u2019s success, delivering world-class fuel and lubricants that have powered us to numerous race wins and championships. Their dedication to innovation and performance has been a key factor in our ability to push the limits on track. Now, as the company extends its partnership to Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, we\u2019re excited to see their expertise expand across the Red Bull family. This marks the next step in a collaboration built on excellence, and we look forward to achieving even greater success together.\u201d\n\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal, Visa Cash App Racing Bulls said: \u201cIt's fantastic news for the Team to extend our partnership with ExxonMobil. Formula One is becoming more technological every day and our competitiveness edge depends on strategic partnerships like this one. We will be using not only their world-class fuel and lubricants products all over the world, but also benefits from the incredible support of their laboratories at the racetrack and back at base, to push all the performance boundaries even further. It is a perfect example of how Formula One research leads the way to develop new technologies for broader mobility and society.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming the Fuel Partner to VCARB strengthens our dedication to pushing the limits of performance in motorsport.\u201d said Katy Howell, Global Sponsorship Manager at ExxonMobil. \u201cWe have a fantastic established relationship through Oracle Red Bull Racing, and this new partnership only further extends the collaboration we will foster together on the racetrack\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have invested in motorsport from the very beginning, 75 years ago, because Formula One provides us with the ultimate platform to push, test, and improve the products that we create for everyday drivers,\u201d said Nick Berthiaux, Regional VP Americas Fuels at ExxonMobil. \u201cWe\u2019re excited and proud to see our Mobil and Esso brands on the VCARB 02 car in the 2025 season.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Uber, Rivian, and Oracle look cheap relative to their growth potential.\n\nSome investors might be getting wary of buying new stocks given the news they are seeing these days. The Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs, sticky inflation, and elevated interest rates have been rattling the markets over the past month or so. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%), despite entering correction territory on Thursday, also still looks undeniably expensive at 28.8 times trailing earnings.\n\nBut if investors look beyond the market's hottest growth stocks, they can still spot a few bargains that look undervalued relative to their growth potential. If investors exploring this wobbly market have $3,000 in available cash that isn't needed for monthly bills, to pay down short-term debt, or to bolster an emergency fund, they might want to consider putting a portion (or all) of it toward buying shares of these three stocks: Uber Technologies (UBER 2.94%), Rivian Automotive (RIVN 1.32%), and Oracle (ORCL 1.09%). Here's why.\n\n1. Uber Technologies\n\nUber, one of the world's largest ride-hailing and food delivery services, has grown rapidly since its pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020. From 2020 to 2024, the trips logged by users over a year more than doubled from 5.03 billion to 11.27 billion, its monthly active platform customers (MAPCs) grew from 93 million to 171 million, and its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%.\n\nOn the bottom line, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2022 and rose at a CAGR of 95% over the following two years. It also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023, and its net income rose more than fivefold in 2024.\n\nUber's growth was largely driven by its market share gains; the expansion of its ecosystem with new enterprise, healthcare, and teen-oriented services; and its Uber One subscriptions -- which grew 60% to 30 million subscribers in 2024. Its profits rose as it divested its noncore businesses, downsized its freight and recruitment divisions, and executed several rounds of layoffs.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Uber's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 14% and 27%, respectively. Its business is maturing, but its enterprise value of $145 billion still looks like a bargain at 13 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\n2. Rivian Automotive\n\nRivian Automotive is an electric vehicle (EV) maker that sells three types of vehicles: the R1T pickup truck, the R1S SUV, and custom delivery vans for top investor Amazon (and recently other companies as well).\n\nRivian's deliveries more than doubled from 20,332 vehicles in 2022 to 50,122 vehicles in 2023, but that figure only rose 3% to 51,579 vehicles in 2024 as it temporarily shut down its main plant in Illinois for upgrades, grappled with supply chain challenges, faced tougher competition, and struggled to sell more vehicles as rising interest rates cooled the broader EV market.\n\nFor 2025, Rivian only expects to deliver 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles as it shuts down its Illinois plant again for additional upgrades; deals with its lost orders from the L.A. fires; and navigates a challenging demand environment and potential changes to federal incentives, regulations, and tariffs for EV makers.\n\nOn the bright side, it still expects to achieve a \"modest\" gross profit for the year as its material costs improve, it sells more of its regulatory credits to other automakers, and it expands its higher-margin software and services division. It also expects its deliveries to accelerate in 2026 after it launches its next vehicle, the R2 SUV.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Rivian's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 34% as it gradually narrows its net losses. With an enterprise value of $12.4 billion, it looks undervalued compared to other EV makers at just 2 times next year's sales.\n\n3. Oracle\n\nOracle, one of the world's top database software companies, was once a slow-growth tech stock. But over the past decade, it transformed its on-premises software into cloud-based services and expanded with bold acquisitions. Its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform also continued to grow in the shadow of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\n\nFor fiscal 2025 (which ends this May), Oracle expects to generate up to $27 billion in cloud revenue. That would represent nearly half of its projected revenue for the year.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Oracle's revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 12% and 20%, respectively. A lot of that growth should be driven by OCI, which is rolling out more tools for developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications and connecting its existing databases to large language models (LLMs).\n\nIts AI customers already include Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and OpenAI, and that list should keep growing as the cloud and AI markets expand. It also plans to keep returning most of its free cash flow (FCF) to its investors through buybacks and dividends.\n\nOracle still looks reasonably valued at 21 times its forward adjusted earnings, it pays a forward yield of 1.4%, and it has lots of irons in the fire. It might not be as exciting as Uber or Rivian, but it's a solid play on the growing cloud and AI markets.",

            "content": "By Prof Mike Ozekhome SAN\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn a landmark decision in ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION V. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ABIA STATE & ORS (2024) LPELR-62576(SC) last year, the Supreme Court gave the local government system full autonomy, warning governors to keep their political fingers off Local Government Councils (LGCs). The legal status of the LGCs in Osun State has however been the subject of intense political and judicial debate following the 2022 local government elections. The matter has seen multiple judicial determinations, culminating in two critical Federal High Court judgements; one obtained by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the other by the Action Peoples Party (APP). While both judgements invalidated the elections conducted by the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission (OSSIEC), the judgement secured by APP remains the extant, binding, and subsisting legal authority, as no superior court has set it aside.\n\nDISTORTION OF THE ESSENCE OF THE JUDGMENTS\n\nIn recent times, misinterpretations and misinformation have sought to distort the legal position, with some claiming that a recent Court of Appeal judgement reinstated the sacked local government officials. However, a critical examination of the Court of Appeal\u2019s latest decision shows that it merely struck out the PDP\u2019s appeal on the ground that no cause of action had arisen at the time of its filing. The position of the law in this regard is that when judgements are not to the substance of a case, they do not change the rights and liabilities of parties. See the case of IGBUNBOR V. AFOLABI (2001) FWLR (Pt. 59) 1284 at 165. Importantly, the Court of Appeal did not nullify or overturn the subsisting Federal High Court judgement granted in favour of APP, which therefore remains the authoritative and binding authority affecting the rights of the parties.\n\nIt is therefore meet that we clarify the foggy situation by analyzing the relevant judgements, applicable laws, and legal principles that govern the status of the 2022 Osun local government elections. This analysis will demonstrate that the local government councils were legally dissolved and that no subsequent judicial pronouncement had restored them. It will also demonstrate that the latest foiled invasion of many LGCs across Osun State by some APC persons is unconstitutional, illegal and amounted to self-help.\n\nTHE 2022 OSUN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS HALLMARKED LEGAL CHALLENGES\n\nThe dispute over the Osun local government elections actually commenced in 2022, following the conduct of the elections by OSSIEC. The elections were challenged in court on the basis that OSSIEC had failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, specifically sections 28, 29, 32, 98, and 150 thereof.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Action Peoples Party (APP) had separately instituted legal actions at the Federal High Court, seeking to have the elections nullified. The basis of these suits was OSSIEC\u2019s alleged non-compliance with statutory provisions and constitutional violations.\n\nTHE PDP SUIT IN BRIEF\n\nIn the case of PDP, it was alleged that OSSIEC was planning to conduct local government election in Osun State in violation of the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, specifically sections 28, 29, 30 and 150 thereof. PDP also called on the Federal High Court to apply the decision of the Supreme Court in OSSIEC & ANOR V. ACTION CONGRESS & ORS (2010) LLJR-SC (delivered in 2010), to the effect that any notice of a local government election which is not in compliance with the Electoral Act is null and void. The law in existence as at the time of filing the said suit was the OSSIEC Law, 2015 (as amended).\n\nWhile the suit was pending, the Osun State House of Assembly repealed the existing 2015 amended OSSIEC Law, and enacted the new OSSIEC Law, 2022, which prescribed 360 days\u2019 notice for election, same as contained in the Electoral Act, 2022. OSSIEC then, during the pendency of the action, published a notice of election prescribing only 60 days as against the 360 days specified by the OSSIEC Law and the Electoral Act.\n\nPDP, then, by an order of court, amended its processes to bring in the new development. OSSIEC still went ahead with the conduct of the election and the All Progressives Congress (APC) participated despite the pendency of the suit at the Federal High Court. It was after the election that the APC and some of its candidates brought a joinder application to the suit in a representative capacity, for all its candidates who reportedly participated at the election. The Federal High Court granted their application for joinder and the whole court processes were amended to reflect all the parties and issues. On 25th November, 2022, the Federal High Court delivered a judgment in the suit, nullifying the election and consequentially sacking all the purported elected officials.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE APP SUIT\n\nThe APP\u2019s suit was similar to the PDP suit in all respects; the only difference being that the APP\u2019s suit was filed after the enactment of the OSSIEC Law 2022 and after the publication of the 60-day election notice by OSSIEC, as against 360 days provided by the OSSIEC Law and the Electoral Act.\n\nWhile both parties obtained favourable judgements, the judgement in the APP suit has become the legally binding decision, as APC\u2019s appeal against it was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the 13th of January, 2025, for want of diligent prosecution. This dismissal rendered the APP judgement the final and only subsisting authority on the matter.\n\nJUDICIAL INTERVENTION ON THE VALIDITY OF THE ELECTIONS\n\nA. The FHC Judgement in APP v. OSIEC (Suit No. FHC/OS/CS/75/2022)\n\nIn this case filed by the Action Peoples Party (APP), the Federal High Court (FHC), delivered a landmark judgement that rendered the October 15, 2022, Osun Statw local government elections null and void. The court held that the elections violated the Electoral Act, 2022, and were also inconsistent with the 1999 Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe FHC in the APP case held as follows:\n\n\u2013 \u201cThe election into local government councils across Osun State held on the 15th of October 2022, pursuant to the notice of election issued on the 15th of August 2022, is hereby declared unconstitutional, invalid, null, and void for violation of the Constitution and breach of Sections 28, 29, 32, 98, and 150 of the Electoral Act, 2022.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cAll persons or individuals occupying offices in the state local government councils by virtue of the said election are accordingly sacked from holding such offices.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cSections 25 and 26 of the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission Law, 2022, having been enacted in contravention of Paragraph 12 of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Constitution and being inconsistent with Sections 29 and 32 of the Electoral Act, 2022, are hereby struck down.\u201d\n\nI agree with the decision of the FHC because it is trite law that any law that is inconsistent with the Constitution is null and void and must be struck down because the Constitution is the grundnorm of the land (see section 1(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 [as amended]). The Supreme Court, Per JAURO, JSC, pronounced on the supremacy of the Constitution in NPF & ORS V POLICE SERVICE COMMISSION (2023) LPELR-60782(SC) (P.154, paras. A-F), thus:\n\n\u201cIt is equally imperative to restate the elementary principle of the supremacy of the Constitution. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the grundnorm, the basic law of the land. It stands head and shoulders above any other law or instrument enacted by the National Assembly, State House of Assembly or any other person or authority empowered in that regard. It is from the Constitution that every other enactment or instrument derive their validity and binding force. The doctrine of the Supremacy of the Nigerian Constitution is traceable to Section 1(1) and (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as altered), which provides thus: \u201c1. Supremacy of the Constitution (1) This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. (3) If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.\u201d\n\nConsequently, as was decided by the Supreme Court in the case of PEENOK INVESTMENTS LIMITED V HOTEL PRESIDENTIAL (1982) 12 SC 1, there is undoubted power in the Court to declare null and void any law that conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution\u201d. See also the cases of HON. INAJOKU & ORS V. ADELEKE & ORS (2007) ALL FWLR; OLAFISOYE V. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA (2004) ALL FWLR 1106; AINABEBHOLO V. EDO STATE UNIVERSITY WORKERS FARMERS MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD (2007) ALL FWLR 712; PDP v. EDEDE & ANOR (2022) LPELR-57480(CA); PRESIDENT OF THE FRN & ORS v. ISA & ORS (2015) LPELR-25981(CA); and, AG FEDERATION & ORS v. ABUBAKAR & ORS (2007) LPELR-3(SC).\n\nThe legal implication of this judgement cannot be overstated. By declaring the 2022 Osun State LG elections unconstitutional, null and void, the court completely erased any legal foundation for the existence of the local government councils elected through that flawed process. The said APP judgement was also a judgement in rem, meaning that it applied to the whole world, all parties and stakeholders, and non-parties alike, irrespective of whether or not they participated in the litigation. In DIKE & ORS V. NZEKA II & ORS (1986) LPELR-945 (SC), the Supreme Court underscored this point most lucidly when it held:\n\n\u201c\u2026 A judgment is said to be in rem when it is an adjudication pronounced upon the status of some particular thing or subject matter by a Tribunal having the jurisdiction and the competence to pronounce on that Status. Such a judgment is usually and invariably founded on proceedings instituted against or on something or subject-matter whose status or condition is to be determined. It is thus a solemn declaration on the status of some persons or thing. It is therefore binding on all persons in so far as their interests in the status of the property or person are concerned. That is why a judgment in rem is a judgment contra mundum \u2013 binding on the whole world \u2013 parties as well as non-parties. \u2026.\u201d\n\nSee also the cases of OYETOLA & ANOR v. INEC & ORS (2023) LPELR-60392(SC); and, A.G. ABIA STATE & ORS V. A.G. OF THE FEDERATION (2022) LPELR-57010 (SC).\n\nB. The Dismissal of APC\u2019s Subsequent Appeal and the Finality of the APP Judgement\n\nFollowing the Federal High Court\u2019s judgement, the All Progressives Congress (APC), which had benefited from the October 2022 elections, appealed the judgement in the case filed by APP. However, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the 13th of January, 2025, for want of diligent prosecution.\n\nThe legal implication of that dismissal is that the FHC\u2019s judgement in the APP case remains the extant and binding position of the law. Under section 287(3) of the 1999 Constitution, all authorities and persons within Nigeria, including government institutions, political parties, and law enforcement agencies are obligated to enforce and abide by the said judgement, the appeal arising therefrom having been dismissed.\n\nThe current legal position on the status of the Osun State LGCs following these decisions of both the FHC, Oshogbo, and the Court of Appeal is that the earlier judgment of the FHC, which nullified the local government elections conducted on October 15, 2022, remains binding and validly subsisting. The election conducted by OSSIEC in 2022 therefore stands nullified, while all candidates in that election remain sacked. This will continue to be the position of the law until the judgment is set aside by the apex court of the land at the instance of the APP.\n\nC. The PDP Case and the Court of Appeal\u2019s Technical Dismissal of Same\n\nThe PDP had in a separate case similar to APP\u2019s, also challenged the legality of the OSSIEC conducted elections. The FHC sitting in Oshogbo had held in its favour. However, upon appeal, the Court of Appeal sitting at Akure struck it out on technical grounds. The court held that the PDP\u2019s case was premature and speculative, having been filed prematurely when notice of the election had not yet been issued at the time of filing. This, in the intermediate Court\u2019s view, deprived the FHC of jurisdiction to entertain the case. It is respectfully submitted that the Court of Appeal was right as is trite that where a matter is instituted when no cause of action has arisen, the doctrine of ripeness applies and such a matter becomes merely speculative and amounts to an academic exercise. This position of the law was upheld in the cases of EDEVIE V. OROHWEDOR & ORS (2022) LPELR-58931 (SC); OGBIMI V. OLOLO & ORS (1993) LPELR-2280(SC); and, UWAZURUONYE v. GOVERNOR OF IMO STATE & ORS (2012) LPELR-20604(SC).\n\nIt must be understood that this judgement did not invalidate the decision earlier obtained by APP at the FHC. Rather, it was a purely procedural decision that had no bearing whatsoever on the substantive matter \u2013 the validity or invalidity of the Osun State LG elections. The Court of Appeal held as follows:\n\n\u201cAs at the time the PDP brought the suit, the cause of action had not arisen because the notice of election had not been issued. The suit was therefore premature.\u201d\n\nThis judgement merely struck out the PDP\u2019s appeal without ruling on the legality or otherwise of the elections. Nor were consequential orders made. More significantly, no declaration or consequential orders were made reinstating the ousted local government officials. When no consequential orders are made in a suit, the status quo remains as contained in the judgement appealed against. See the cases of AKINBOBOLA V. PLISSON FISKO (NIG) LTD & ORS (1991) LPELR-343(SC) and FCDA STAFF MULTI-PURPOSE (COOP) SOCIETY & ORS V. SAMCHI & ANOR (2018) LPELR-444380(CA). The fundamental issues that could have propelled the Court of Appeal to pronounce on the validity or otherwise of the notice of election and the propriety or otherwise of sacking the APC purported elected council officials who had participated in the said election were never considered by the Court of Appeal as they were treated as academic.\n\nLEGAL IMPLICATIONS: THE INCONTROVERTIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS\n\n1. The 2022 Osun State LG Elections Were Null and Void\n\nBy virtue of the APP FHC judgement, the 2022 Osun local government elections were clearly unconstitutional and void from the outset. As a matter of law, a void act confers no legal right. When an act is void, it is void for all times and is not required to be set aside. In the case of OYENEYIN & ANOR V. AKINKUGBE & ANOR (2010) LPELR-2875 (SC), the apex court held that:\n\n\u201cIn law, a void act is an act which has no legal effect or consequence. It does not confer any legal right or title whatsoever, and it does not impose any legal obligation or liability on any one or make any party liable to suffer any penalty or disadvantage.\u201d\n\nIn simple terms, one cannot put something upon nothing and expect it to stand. It will collapse. See the cases of LEONARD MACFOY V. UAC LIMITED (1962) AC 152; OKWUOSA V. GOMWALK & ORS (2017) LPELR-41736 (SC); IFEANYI V. OGBA & ORS (2022) LPELR-58787(SC); and, MUSTAPHA & ORS V. ADENOPO & ORS (2020) LPELR-51409(CA). Consequently, no political party, individual or group can lay any valid claim to any Osun State local government offices based on the voided election.\n\n2. All Purported Local Government Officials Remain Legally Removed from Office\n\nSince the FHC in the APP case had expressly sacked all persons occupying the local government positions and no appellate court has reversed that judgement, all the said officials remain legally removed from office. The said judgement remains binding on all parties and the whole world until set aside.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court had upheld this position of the law in NGERE & ANOR v. OKURUKET & ORS (2014) LPELR-22883(SC), where it held:\n\n\u201c\u2026The judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction subsists until upset on appeal. While the judgment subsists, every person affected by it or against whom an order is made must obey it even if it appears wrong. Judgments take effect immediately they are delivered and every Court has inherent power to proceed to enforce judgments at once. The enforcements on delivery can only be interrupted by a stay of execution provided there is an appeal.\u201d\n\n3. The Court of Appeal\u2019s Judgement in the PDP Appeal Did Not Reinstate Anyone\n\nContrary to the position of the sacked LG officials who had sought to forcibly gate-crash into their offices, the Court of Appeal never reinstated any sacked LG officials. It merely struck out the PDP\u2019s case without considering or commenting on the validity or otherwise of the voided elections. Consequently, any claim that the Court of Appeal reinstated the ousted chairmen is a deliberate distortion of facts and a result to sophistry.\n\n4. The APP Judgement Is Binding on All Parties\n\nSince APC\u2019s appeal against the APP FHC judgement was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, that judgement remains final and binding on all political parties, individuals and institutions in Osun State. See the case of NOEKOER V. EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF PLATEAU STATE & ORS (2018) LPELR-44350(SC), where the apex court held that:\n\n\u201cit is well settled law that the judgement of a competent court subsists and remains binding until it is set aside on appeal\u201d.\n\n5. Any Attempt to Reoccupy Local Government Offices Is Unconstitutional and Amounts to Self Help\n\nAny action taken by political actors to forcefully invade and reoccupy LG offices as was witnessed few days ago is not only illegal but also constitutes a contemptuous disregard of a valid and subsisting court judgement; and indeed a resort to self help, viet armis. The law forbids such resort to self-help by parties in a pending matter with a view to usurping the functions of a court of law. The Supreme Court in AGBAI & ORS V. OKOGBUE (1991) LPELR-225 (SC) 69-70, F-A, trenchantly cautioned that:\n\n\u201cThe ratio decidendi of the decision of this Court in Ojukwu\u2019s case is that once there is lis inter partes and the Courts of law are seised with the dispute, no person or authority, whether parties to the lis or not, is allowed by the Constitution to usurp the functions of the Court of law. It is the duty of every person or authority not to interfere with the legal and judicial process from taking its due course.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court further confirms this position in NWAKIRE v COP (1992) LPELR-2097 (SC) 42-43, A-D, where it held thus:\n\n\u201cThat self-help is not allowed in adjudication has been firmly ensconced in the jurisprudence of this nation like the Rock of Gibraltar, which position remains as constant, in Caesar\u2019s words in Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar, \u201cas the Northern Star\u201d.\n\nSee the causa celere case of MILITARY GOVERNOR OF LAGOS STATE V. OJUKWU & ANOR (1986) LPELR-3186 (SC). See also GARBA V. FCSC (1988) LPELR-1304 (SC) 28-29.\n\n6. The Court of Appeal did not make any consequential Order of Re-instatement of the Sacked LG Officials\n\nIt must again be emphasised for the umpteenth time that the Court of Appeal in the PDP appeal decision never validated the election conducted by OSSIEC in 2022 under any guise as the issues on the validity of the election that could have led to a pronouncement on whether or not the APC candidates were rightly sacked were never considered. As a result, there was no consequential order for reinstatement by the Court of Appeal. The only consequential order by the Court of Appeal was an order directing PDP to pay a cost of N250,000 to the Appellants. NO MORE, NO LESS!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW\n\nThe Judiciary\u2019s intervention in both the PDP and APP cases rather than show a Judiciary that is complicit, actually underscored the supremacy of the Electoral Act over state laws in regulating local government elections. Under Nigerian legal jurisprudence, the doctrine of \u201ccovering the field\u201d applies here, which provides that all state laws which are inconsistent with federal laws are to the extent of those inconsistencies, null and void. In the case of A.G LAGOS STATE V. EKO HOTELS (2017) LPELR-43713(SC), the apex court expounded on the doctrine of covering the field thus:\n\n\u201cIf any law enacted by the House of Assembly of a State is inconsistent with any law validly made by the National Assembly, the Law made by the National Assembly will prevail, and that other law shall to the extent of its inconsistency be void\u201d \u2013 Section 4(5) CFRN 1999 {As Amended}. This, in clear language, means that only the law validly enacted by the federal legislature will prevail on that which is also validly made by the state house of assembly but this is only where that State Law is inconsistent with that of the Federal law.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in FRIDAY & ORS v. GOV OF ONDO STATE & ANOR (2012) LPELR-7886(CA), the appellate court held thus:\n\n\u201c\u2026It is thus legal and legitimate for both the National Assembly and a State House of Assembly to legislate on same subject matter provided there is no inconsistency from the State law. Where there is inconsistency however, the State law will be declared null and void to the extent of its inconsistency, and in order not to create any vacuum, resort will be had to the old jurisprudential principle of covering the field, that is to say, that since there is a Federal Legislation on the subject matter, it is not necessary for a Federating State to legislate on that area and the provision made by the National Assembly covers the subject matter in question.\u201d\n\nSee also the cases of O.S.I.E.C. V. A.C (2010) 19 NWLR (Pt. 1226) 273; NPF & ORS V. POLICE SERVICE COMMISSION (2023) LPELR-60782 (SC); INEC V. MUSA (2003) LPELR-24927 (SC); and, AIRTEL NETWORKS LTD V. AG OF KWARA STATE & ANOR (2014) LPELR-23790 (CA).\n\nAll the judgements involved in these cases actually reaffirmed the necessity for electoral bodies to adhere strictly to established legal frameworks, ensuring transparency and compliance in the electoral process. See the cases of AUGUSTINE & ANOR V. INEC & ORS (2024) LPELR-61876(SC) and BUHARI Vs. INEC (2008) 19 NWLR (1120) 246. Such a judgement serves as a significant precedent for future electoral disputes in Nigeria, thus emphasizing the importance of lawful conduct in the governance process. The Court of Appeal in the PDP appeal having struck out the suit without considering the merit of the decision as regards the validity or otherwise of the election conducted by OSSIEC in 2022, the effect is that the suit filed by the PDP never existed in the eyes of the law.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal in the PDP case did not strike down the judgment of the FHC in the APP case, nor did it validate the 2022 LG election and re-instate the sacked LG officials. The FHC\u2019s decision in the APP case thus remains the only definitive legal authority on the status of the 2022 Osun State LG elections. Until and unless the Supreme Court decides otherwise, the said elections remain null, void, and of no effect whatsoever. No person elected in that flawed process can lay any lawful claim to any office.\n\nAny claim to the contrary is a deliberate misinterpretation of the legal position and constitutes an attempt to undermine the rule of law and subvert the judicial process. Such would also serve as a subterfuge to the powers and decisions of arguably the most important arm of government \u2013 the Judiciary.\n\nTHE COURT\u2019S DECISION IN THE OSUN LG BROUHAHA MUST BE EXECUTED\n\nIt is now the duty of law enforcement agencies and government institutions to ensure that all judicial decisions involved in these cases are respected and upheld. It is trite that all persons and authorities must obey judgements of courts and parties are not permitted to pick and choose which judgements to obey, or which to disobey. This legal principle was emphasised in the case of PDP v. LALONG & ORS (2023) LPELR-61629(CA), where the intermediate court held thus:\n\n\u201cBy the provision of Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all authorities and persons, including this Court, are expected to observe and ensure the compliance of order/judgments of the Court including High Court particularly orders/judgments that are in rem\u2026An order of a competent Court of law, no matter its nature, is absolute and binding on all and sundry without question until it is legally and legitimately set aside by a competent Court of appellate jurisdiction. The fact of its being final or interim does not therefore affect its application and effectiveness. It remains valid and enforceable and must be obeyed\u201d.\n\nSee also the cases of NGERE & ANOR v. OKURUKET & ORS (2014) LPELR-22883(SC); SHUGABA V. U.B.N. PLC (1999) LPELR \u2013 3068 (SC); and, OBOH & ANOR V. NFL & ORS (2016) LPELR-50559 (CA).\n\nTHE LAW MUST BE VISITED ON THOSE WHO RESORTED TO SELF-HELP\n\nI watched with dismay and disgust the act of certain LG officials who forcefully barged into the LG headquarters, attempting to reclaim office in the false and erroneous belief that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the PDP case had re-instated them to their official positions, such was nothing short of brigandage and crude resort to self help. It must be condemned in the strongest terms and I so condemn it. It was selfish and uncalled for. In the same vein, all those who aided and abetted this democratic aberration must be fished out and charged before the law courts, however highly placed they are.\n\nANY AVAILABLE REMEDY?\n\nMy above take is not to say that there is no remedy available to the sacked officials; they still have a right of appeal to the Supreme Court in the APP case. But until the Supreme Court overturns the valid and subsisting judgment in rem of the FHC in the APP case, the said judgment remains binding on all parties.\n\nThe irresistible conclusion to be drawn from these events is that all LG offices across Osun State remain vacant and that the sacked APC officials cannot lay claim to the benefit of any judgement to occupy the council offices until they obtain a different outcome, if any, from the apex court. This is the LAW.\n\nTHE WAY FORWARD\n\nTo save themselves from needless orchestrated violence, all the political parties in Osun State should go for fresh polls and test their popularity in a free, fair and credible election. Politicians should leave the Judiciary alone by playing clean politics. As to the title of this piece, my humble submission is that the Judiciary was not in any way complicit in the Osun State LG imbroglio. Rather, it acted in good faith, striving fiercely to defend the rule of law and uphold electoral integrity.",

            "content": "In his debut as a full-time Formula 1 driver, Liam Lawson was thrown into a whirl of uncertainty as he battled with power unit issues, threatening his participation in the Australian Grand Prix qualifying session. The young Kiwi driver, who has joined the ranks of Red Bull Racing, pairing with Max Verstappen, was gearing up for a race that is as close to home as it gets for him. However, his hopes of making a mark were severely hampered by these technical glitches.\n\nThe issues with the power unit put Lawson on the back burner even before the qualifying round could commence. The situation escalated when Lawson was out on the track for the third practice session, only to be called back into the pits. He was left questioning the severity of the technical issues plaguing his RB21, which, as it turned out, were serious enough to bar him from setting a lap time.\n\nRed Bull Racing, ahead of the qualifying session, identified the problem as a \u201cPU or PU system problem on the air side.\u201d The team\u2019s mechanics were in a race against time, working tirelessly to rectify the issue. The clock was ticking, and Lawson\u2019s car was still under the mechanics\u2019 expert hands when qualifying was about to begin.\n\nRed Bull Racing\u2019s team boss, Christian Horner, confirmed to Sky F1 that Lawson would be able to participate in the qualifying session. However, he also acknowledged the uphill battle Lawson was up against, having lost a precious hour of track time at a circuit he had never driven before in any category.\n\nDespite the tumultuous situation, Lawson remained cool as a cucumber. Horner confirmed that the young driver was entirely \u201cchilled\u201d and had the right mindset to kick off the session. When the qualifying session started, Lawson was able to join the line-up of cars and participate in Q1.\n\nThe power unit issue, while resolved in time for Lawson to hit the track, still had an impact on his performance. Despite Lawson making it onto the track, he could not secure a place in Q2. A stray final lap led him to abort and return to the pits, marking a rocky start to his full-time Formula 1 career.",

TikTok has until April to finalize a sale to a US-based buyer, or the short-form video platform will once again go dark across the country.\n\nSources close to the matter, including investors, told The Information that ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, favors Oracle over other cloud providers. TikTok has been utilizing Oracle servers to store US data since 2022, which makes it a likely option.\n\nThe report also suggests that ByteDance will still want to have a \u201chands-on role\u201d in TikTok\u2019s US operations, with Oracle as a partner. Whether this will pan out remains to be seen; ByteDance has been staunchly opposed to a sale to a US-based company. But the China-based company\u2019s involvement in TikTok is precisely what led to the US government seeking a US-based buyer for the platform, citing national security concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, as TikTok\u2019s future in the United States remains uncertain, the platform is trying to address safety concerns cited by tech experts and government officials. The company has released a new reminder that tells teens to stop using TikTok at night, with more parental controls available.\n\nIf a teen under 16 is using the app after 10 PM, TikTok will interrupt their feed with a full-screen reminder to \u201cwind down.\u201d The reminder will play \u201ccalming music to help teens relax and be mindful of the time.\u201d Users can ignore the initial 10 PM reminder, but TikTok will display another harder-to-dismiss prompt. The company plans to expand the \u201cwind-down\u201d feature in the future, with tests incorporating meditation exercises \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nThis accompanies TikTok\u2019s new updates to its Family Pairing feature, which has already enabled parents to put restrictions on their child\u2019s account. Soon, a new Time Away feature will allow parents or guardians to prevent their child from visiting TikTok during specific times, and to set a recurring schedule.

For the 2025 F1 season, Oracle Red Bull Racing will leverage the new OCI Compute A2 and OCI Compute A4 Flex shapes to increase simulation speeds by 10 percent, enabling the team to run even more simulations each week to test a wider variety of scenarios and improve race-day decisions. Since moving its race strategy infrastructure to OCI in 2021, Oracle Red Bull Racing has already increased the speed of its simulations by 25 percent, giving the team a significant strategic advantage on race day.\n\nIn addition to using Oracle Cloud to strengthen its race strategy in the 2025 F1 season, Oracle Red Bull Racing will also use Oracle technology to:\n\nUnlock generative AI-powered insights: In a groundbreaking pilot, Oracle is helping Oracle Red Bull Racing bring GenAI to the pit wall.

Rimini was ordered to pay Oracle $90 million following a 2015 jury verdict, including $58.1 million in damages and $31.9 million in attorneys' fees and costs.Rimini in a separate 2014 lawsuit asked a judge to rule that it had stopped infringing Oracle's copyrights. The judge found in a bench ruling in 2023 that Oracle prevailed on some of its copyright allegations, though the 9th Circuit vacated most of that decision in December.Weil's Mark Perry, a lead appellate lawyer for Rimini, argued in the company's latest appeal that Oracle had failed \"after more than a decade of scorched-earth litigation\" to succeed on copyright claims for which it once sought more than $1.4 billion in damages.\"It is exceptionally clear that Oracle is not the prevailing party and is not entitled to an award of the tens of millions of dollars it spent losing this case,\" Rimini told the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.Rimini said the case produced \"a mixed-result\" that does not warrant awarding fees to either side. In the least, Rimini argued, the appeals court should find that Oracle's fee award was \"dramatically excessive\" and should be significantly reduced.Oracle and Rimini did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Eight U.S. states and the District of Columbia have asked a federal judge to award them legal fees for winning an order in federal court blocking Kroger's now-abandoned $25 billion deal for grocery rival Albertsons.U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson will weigh the fee request. The states did not ask for a specific amount, but the total could reach millions of dollars.President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Jonathan Gould of Jones Day, disclosed $1.6 million in salary on an ethics form submitted as part of his nomination. Gould said he provided legal services to banking and financial clients including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.In another filing, William Kimmitt, a nonequity partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, disclosed $254,000 in salary on an ethics form submitted as part of his nomination to a post at the U.S. Treasury Department. Kimmitt said he provided legal services to BASF and Dell, among other clients.Trump has turned to some of the country's biggest law firms to fill key slots, including Jones Day; Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; and WilmerHale.",

            "content": "launched its AI Centre of Excellence in Singapore last week, aiming to bolster AI adoption across Southeast Asia. Despite this development, Oracle's shares experienced a 2% decline over the same period. The market saw a tech sector rally, with companies like Nvidia and Palantir posting significant gains, reflecting investor confidence in tech stocks following a general market rebound. The broader market, however, was volatile, with the S&P 500 dropping and then partially recovering from steep losses driven by economic uncertainties. This environment might have overshadowed Oracle's positive earnings report where revenue and net income showed year-over-year growth, along with a substantial dividend increase. Despite these fundamentals, Oracle's stock price movement may have been influenced more by broader market sentiment rather than the company's specific developments. The divergent trends between Oracle's performance and overall market gains highlight the complexity of market conditions amidst global economic uncertainties.\n\nNYSE:ORCL Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nIn the last five years, Oracle Corporation achieved a total shareholder return of 253.20%, reflecting a combination of share price appreciation and dividends. This period saw Oracle foster innovation and expand its global presence. Notable developments included the launch of Oracle's Enterprise Communications Platform in February 2024, which enhanced connectivity across IoT devices, and a significant partnership with NVIDIA in March 2024 to deliver AI solutions. Furthermore, Oracle has engaged in sound financial management, marked by steady increases in dividends, such as the recent rise to $0.50 per share announced in March 2025.\n\nDespite these achievements, Oracle's earnings had a slow recovery over the five-year period, initially showing a 0.9% annual decline before pivoting to an impressive 14.3% growth recently. This growth outpaced the US Software industry's 4.3% return, underscoring Oracle's resilience. Additionally, cost-efficient product innovations like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI services introduced in July 2022, played a vital role in maintaining its competitive edge.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

From the factory to the podium, Oracle Cloud and AI technologies continue to provide the insights that help make Oracle Red Bull Racing one of the most successful teams in Formula One history.\u201d\n\nOracle Red Bull Racing relies on Oracle Cloud to drive performance on and off the track. For example, Oracle Red Bull Racing runs billions of simulations on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) before and during each race to ensure it has the best data-driven strategy in place to quickly react to variations in car performance, track conditions, and competitor actions. For the 2025 F1 season, Oracle Red Bull Racing will leverage the new OCI Compute A2 and OCI Compute A4 Flex shapes to increase simulation speeds by 10 percent, enabling the team to run even more simulations each week to test a wider variety of scenarios and improve race-day decisions. Since moving its race strategy infrastructure to OCI in 2021, Oracle Red Bull Racing has already increased the speed of its simulations by 25 percent, giving the team a significant strategic advantage on race day.\n\nIn addition to using Oracle Cloud to strengthen its race strategy in the 2025 F1 season, Oracle Red Bull Racing will also use Oracle technology to:\n\nUnlock generative AI-powered insights: In a groundbreaking pilot, Oracle is helping Oracle Red Bull Racing bring GenAI to the pit wall. After a race concludes, teams only have 30 minutes to protest a penalty. In that brief window of time, each team must review thousands of pages of historical regulatory rulings and build a case for a protest. The GenAI solution from Oracle\u2014consisting of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with a large language model (LLM)\u2014will enable Oracle Red Bull Racing to query all historical regulations and generate responses in real time, dramatically improving its ability to efficiently query and adapt to sporting regulations over a race weekend.\n\nIn a groundbreaking pilot, Oracle is helping Oracle Red Bull Racing bring GenAI to the pit wall.

Optimize powertrain development: Red Bull Ford Powertrains, the future supplier of hybrid power units for Oracle Red Bull Racing for the 2026 F1 season and beyond, is building its next-gen sustainable fuel engine with OCI. By running its most complex simulations on OCI, the Red Bull Ford Powertrain\u2019s engineering team is taking advantage of the latest cloud technologies to help overcome the challenge of building a sophisticated new engine development business from the ground up. This year, OCI will help power the refinements that optimize performance and reliability as the powertrain moves from prototype to production.\n\nRed Bull Ford Powertrains, the future supplier of hybrid power units for Oracle Red Bull Racing for the 2026 F1 season and beyond, is building its next-gen sustainable fuel engine with OCI.

Standardize infrastructure from factory to trackside: Starting this season, all Oracle Red Bull Racing trackside infrastructure\u2014including car sensor monitors, dashboard displays, and garage computers\u2014will run on Oracle Virtualization, Oracle Linux, and Oracle Cloud Native Environment. By using Oracle Linux, Oracle Red Bull Racing is running the same operating system used by thousands of Oracle customers on-premises and in the cloud, and used by Oracle to run OCI. As a result of this standardization, Oracle Red Bull Racing\u2019s IT team members can run the same code on the same operating system in OCI as well as locally, easily transitioning their work between any location\u2014trackside, factory, or remote\u2014using the same operating environment. This will deliver significant cost and time savings by eliminating work duplication and improving flexibility.\n\n\u201cOracle Red Bull Racing has approached its technology strategy with the same relentless focus on performance that has underpinned its dominance on the track,\u201d said Karan Batta, senior vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cOur collective success is a testament to the performance and flexibility of Oracle Cloud and our teams\u2019 collaborative effort to push the boundaries of innovation.\u201d\n\nThe 2025 F1 season begins March 14-16 with the Louis Vuitton Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.\n\nAdditional resources",

Or is there some lesson to be learned from our younger selves: the selves that cared, trusted and dreamed harder than we ever will again?\n\nGirlhood allowed us to be unapologetically ourselves, before we began to see the expectations and judgments present for us in society in womanhood, and it taught us to see no problem in others doing the same. We don\u2019t realize the beauty in ingenuity before it is gone.\n\nAnother key factor of girlhood is the way we loved both ourselves and our friends. When I think about the friends I held close and the self I was when I was younger, I can\u2019t think of anything but unconditional, whole-hearted love. The only thing we expected out of our friends was loyalty and laughter. We friendship-bracelet knotted our soul ties so tight that no harm could ever come and gave grace to simple mistakes, because we didn\u2019t know how to judge our faults. So what if we never lost that? What if we all cared about each other and ourselves the way we cared about our best friend when we were 13? There is no greater love than this: a love fastened with eternal care and sealed with a pinky promise. Loving and caring is harder when the world we live in doesn\u2019t value these ideas, and therefore it is especially important that we reclaim our girlhood now, for a continued connection and support between women.\n\nIf society as a whole claimed the values we had in girlhood, I sincerely believe we\u2019d be in a much different place. Women have felt the force of oppression for lifetimes, and today we face a scary reality. We have grown to understand that the world does not put us first, or even close to it, but seems to thrive off stripping the rights and freedoms that women have fought for, harrowingly and endlessly.\n\nCarol Gilligan, an ethicist and psychologist, has researched and developed a framework called \u201cThe Ethics of Care.\u201d This framework centers around the idea that as humans, we relate. We all have human experiences and therefore should care about others\u2019 human experience. This correlates to women and feminism, as it incorporates emotion into reasoning. Over time, women have been deemed too emotional, too confessional. But doesn\u2019t emotion and the ability to respond to problems with kindness and empathy sound like a good start? I am not suggesting a divide but rather a unification of everyone on the basis of these ideals.\n\nThis Women\u2019s History Month, my heart is heavy but hopeful. As girls grow into women, we have to become stronger and more brave to combat the decreasing care and protection of us and our rights. I have witnessed first-hand the impact of women who care and believe in each other, themselves and the future of us. I see it in our history, in bar bathrooms and in clusters on street corners. It is evident that sisterhood and solidarity is not lost among us, and we must fight to keep it this way and to grow our strength together. Our girlhood has given us a foundation for the way we treat others and see problems. It stands for unity and individuality, for care and beauty, which is present in all of us.\n\nFemale influence and connection is powerful. We don\u2019t ever have to lose the beauty that girlhood gave us, and we can\u2019t afford to. The freedom, fun, mystique and kindness it offers to us and our lives is far too important to let go of.\n\nThis Women\u2019s History Month, remember the girls and women who shaped our lives: mothers, sisters, trailblazers and fighters who cared.",

Photo: Susan Morse/Healthcare Finance News/HIMSS\n\nLAS VEGAS - Seema Verma, executive vice president and general manager of Oracle Health and Life Sciences, gave an update of her company's work on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Electronic Health Records Modernization project.\n\nAt HIMSS25 last week, Verma told HIMSS President and CEO Hal Wolf she is \"excited about progress\" of the largest implementation in the world with the Department of Defense.\n\nWhere it has been implemented, patient satisfaction has increased, she said.\n\nThe project aims to replace the VA's current Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) with a modern, interoperable EHR system.\n\nIn 2018, the Department of Veterans Affairs chose Cerner to implement the EHR system with the reported goal of making it interoperable with the Pentagon's health record system. In 2022, Cerner was bought by Oracle. The $28.3 billion deal was first announced in 2021.\n\nHowever, delays and outages have plagued implementation.\n\nLast week, VA's Oracle Health EHR experienced a widespread outage.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, along with other agencies using federal EHRs, experienced a system outage just weeks after assuring lawmakers about the success of ongoing improvement efforts.\n\nThe problems have been a management issue, not a software issue, Verma told Wolf.\n\nConversations on Capitol Hill last month centered on delays while the Government Accountability Office added three new recommendations for cost estimating, schedule and system metrics, bringing its total recommendations to 18.\n\nIn 2024, the VA extended its contract with Oracle Health for 11 months.\n\nComplete deployment of the EHR at all VA medical facilities is expected in 2031.\n\nVerma told lawmakers in February the company is in the process of migrating the Oracle Health EHR to the cloud. The first phase will be completed later this year, and the company anticipates full migration of the EHR to the cloud to be completed next year.\n\nThe VA also recently announced the deployment of the Oracle Health EHR to nine additional sites next year.\n\nVerma discussed artificial intelligence, which she said is in the design of Oracle. This spring, Oracle will launch a product on longitudinal health records using data from wearables and other digital devices, she said. This data will be layered by AI.\n\nWolf asked about any issues with data sharing, saying there seems to be a retreat back to hesitation over the view that data is sovereign.\n\nOracle will build the infrastructure for data sharing, Verma said, but it's up to countries, providers and patients to decide whether that data is shared.\n\nVerma served as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2017 to 2021.\n\nHer work at Oracle is a continuation of her work at CMS on interoperability, she said.\n\nBut Oracle is not just an EHR company, Verma said.\n\nOracle's work in healthcare extends to clinical research and care. But the problems of healthcare won't be solved without payers, she said. The vast sets of data and applied AI must all come together, she said.\n\nWolf asked about what's currently going on in Washington.\n\nEven during Trump's first administration, the president was \"committed to addressing big issues and big problems,\" said Verma, who worked for CMS during the first administration. Now, she said, he's \"even not more afraid. He's not running for another term.\"\n\nThe larger issue is the financial solvency of the country, she said.\n\n\"What is fueling the deficit is our healthcare system, at a rate that is unsustainable,\" she said.\n\nShe added, technology is playing a role in lowering the cost trajectory.\n\nEmail the writer: SMorse@himss.org",

The agents help improve the overall quality and speed of reviewing suspicious activity by using generative AI-driven narratives to supplement investigators' own analysis. This can save valuable time and resources by offloading many traditionally manual tasks and enabling investigators to focus their time on the most pressing leads. These new capabilities are available globally for financial institutions of all sizes using the Investigation Hub crime and case management solution.\n\n\"The addition of agentic AI capabilities to our Investigation Hub Cloud Service represents a paradigm shift in financial crime investigations,\" said Jason Somrak, head of financial crime product strategy, Oracle Financial Services. \"Our unique generative AI approach follows investigative plans, collects evidence, and recommends actions while providing investigators with robust narratives documenting the findings. This enables firms to drive consistency in decision making and thoroughly investigate all risks automatically while realizing massive operational efficiencies.\"\n\nCombatting crime with agentic AI\n\nFinancial institutions face mounting pressure to identify and combat increasingly sophisticated financial crime schemes while managing regulatory scrutiny. Traditional investigative processes often rely on tedious manual data collection and analysis that can be slow, resource-intensive, and prone to human error.\n\nWhile some solutions employ AI chatbots that require investigators to ask the right questions in the right way, Oracle Financial Services delivers multiple AI agents that are designed to surface key insights, collect evidence, recommend decisions, and generate comprehensive alert narratives. This automated approach helps eliminate inconsistencies caused by variations in user queries and helps deliver more consistent and reliable information for investigative analysts.\n\nThese agents, driven by generative AI, can be leveraged to analyze alert information, including matches between customer data and sanction lists. From there, they can be used to automatically create compelling narratives that summarize the key details of each alert, providing financial crime and compliance investigators with relevant information to better conduct a thorough analysis and make data-informed decisions.\n\nThese new capabilities are part of the larger set of Oracle financial crime and compliance management solutions focused on making financial investigations more predictable, reliable, and credible using generative AI.

            "content": "Oracle\u2019s cloud may be been in the running to be the host of a massive AI training system for Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup, with a purported $10 billion in rentals at stake. But what is clear from Oracle\u2019s latest financials is that the company never needed the xAI deal at all.\n\nSo when the that deal went sour and Dell and Supermicro were tapped to build the \u201cColossus\u201d cluster that ended up on premises in an old Electrolux vacuum cleaner factory outside of Memphis, Tennessee, Larry Ellison just shrugged it off.\n\nAnd only six months later, Ellison was at the White House along with OpenAI co-founder and chief executive officer, Sam Altman, and Masayoshi Son, founder and chief executive officer of SoftBank, which is some of the moneybags behind Altman\u2019s Stargate Project to spend $500 billion over the next four years to advance the state of the art in AI training hardware. (The United Arab Emirates, which have $1.4 trillion in invest in various funds to diversify their country outside of the oil industry, are very likely ponying up most of the dough. Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI are the \u201ckey initial technology partners\u201d as the announcement put it, and we see this week that CoreWeave has been added to the Stargate partner fold.\n\nTo us, it looks like Oracle and CoreWeave, and possibly Microsoft, will be hosting some of the Stargate systems. But as we said above, Oracle seems to be doing just fine with its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cloud business without either xAI or OpenAI, which are bitter rivals.\n\nNone of that matters. What does matter \u2013 and it matters very much, as it turns out \u2013 is that an AI model can be trained anywhere, but to be useful, it has to be trained on and have access to your own corporate data. Which, for 400,000 enterprises worldwide, are stored in Oracle databases or Oracle ERP applications (which may or may not use Oracle databases). Nvidia has made a fortune off of dozens of very large customers. Knowing Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, as we do, Oracle is going to make its next large fortune \u2013 perhaps rivaling Nvidia in the longest of runs \u2013 selling GPU compute services and AI hooks into those applications and databases. The Oracle 23ai database already speaks native vector data formats and can RAG with the best of them with your corporate info.\n\nThis is where the $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems back in 2010 \u2013 wasn\u2019t that a long time ago? \u2013 was prophetic. Somewhere between in late 2008 and early 2009, Ellison got hardware religion and beat out IBM to acquiring the innovative but then-struggling maker of superb Unix systems that were the backbone of the early commercial Internet. And since that time the company has launched thirteen generations of Exadata database machines, which are essentially database supercomputers. (The latest, the Exadata X11M, debuted in January of this year.)\n\nIt was this experience with hardware and software co-design as well as that vast installed base of enterprises and government, academic, and research institutions that gives Oracle a very good chance to build a very big cloud business, just like the vast base of Windows Server users and the popularity of its SQL Server database and other systems software made Microsoft from a wannabe to Number Two Cloud in less than a decade.\n\nNot for nothing \u2013 and this being Ellison, certainly not for nothing \u2013 Oracle has another advantage. It\u2019s database is so entrenched at organizations that its largest customers do not want AWS, Microsoft, or Google running Oracle databases on their homegrown hyperscale iron. They want to run Oracle databases, and then applications, on Oracle engineered systems that are inside of the AWS, Microsoft, and Google clouds. And starting last year, this is precisely what those three big clouds did despite the fact that they do not like hardware they did not design themselves. With OCI giving customers that option, they had two choices: Do it Larry\u2019s way, or lose the business to Larry. They chose the former, which will allow Oracle to keep its monopoly on high-end relational databases for enterprises.\n\nOracle has one more advantage when it comes to cloud: It is happy to make you your own personal region if you want that. No fuss, no muss. No: Well, it is almost the same as what we have in our cloud. What Oracle puts in its cloud is exactly what you put on premises, so the boundaries of who is managing what and where the gear is located is flexible. The company is happy to bill you for services rendered, and to manage the infrastructure itself based on the management telemetry of countless other customers. This is one of the hallmarks of Sun\u2019s engineered systems, and it persists to this day.\n\nPainting Clouds By The Numbers\n\nIn the quarter ended in February, Oracle posted $14.13 billion in sales, up 6.4 percent year on year and just a tad bit above flat sequentially. (This was the company\u2019s third quarter of fiscal 2025.) Net income rose much faster, increasing 22.3 percent to $2.94 billion, which works out to 20.8 percent of revenues. This is pretty good for a software maker that now has some pretty large infrastructure manufacturing costs, but it is on the low end of the average rate of profitability since the Great Recession, which is where we did a reset and started counting from. (You could argue that March 2020, the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, was another reset point, as was the Dot-Com boon that started in 1995 and ended in the Dot-Com Bust in early 2000.)\n\nOracle\u2019s cash hoard kept rising and rising even as the business kept plugging along in the 2010s. The big hit came when it repatriated overseas profits and paid taxes on it, as many tech titans did at the time. And then, Oracle used cash to aggressively buy back shares, which had the effect of boosting earnings per share, while it made some acquisitions and started to build a cloud business from scratch.\n\nTo be specific: Oracle did not blow its cash hoard building a cloud. It has been conservative and thoughtful in its rollout, and it builds when customers commit. Right now, GPU demand is much larger than supply and even Oracle wishes it could build out AI training and inference infrastructure faster. It builds at the speed it can, pairing customers with what it can get its hands on. Which is why the company\u2019s capital expenses are, by the standards of hyperscalers and the big cloud builders, fairly modest:\n\nOracle spent just a smidgen under $8.7 billion on capital expenses in fiscal 2023 ended in May of that year, and fell by 21 percent to $6.87 billion in fiscal 2024. For this 2025 fiscal year, spending is expected to be about $16 billion, as Safra Catz, chief executive officer at the company, explained on a call with Wall Street analysts going over the quarter.\n\nOracle is on track to book $57.4 billion in revenues this year if all goes as expected, and Catz added that Oracle expects to grow by around 15 percent in fiscal 2026 to around $66 billion and raised its guidance for growth in fiscal 2027 for 20 percent growth, which works out to just shy of $80 billion. So by fiscal 2028 or so, depending on how aggressive the Stargate Project of OpenAI and SoftBank is and how much of the hosting pie Oracle gets for the Stargate systems, Oracle could be the fifth company in IT history to break $100 billion in sales into the datacenters of the world. (IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, and Nvidia are the other four.)\n\nIt certainly looks like Oracle is on track to do that. Without any Stargate bookings whatsoever, Oracle now has $130 billion in remaining purchase obligations, or RPOs, which is money that a service vendor has on the books. That is up 62.5 percent from Q3 F2024 and up 34 percent sequentially from Q2 F2025.\n\nWe are not going to spend a lot of time drilling into the ins and outs of the Oracle application, database, and middleware software businesses. This is a huge business and among the largest enterprise customer bases in the world that actually spend big bucks. This is the foundation on which Oracle\u2019s AI business will be built, and in fact, as Ellison put it on the call, eventually Oracle\u2019s applications will just be a collection of agents \u2013 we would say that this will be added to some legacy transaction processing application that do not need to be changed.\n\nSome interesting things to call out for the fans of Sun Microsystems and Oracle engineered systems. Oracle doesn\u2019t sell a huge amount of hardware, and this business is trending down as customer move to OCI, but it still sold nearly $3 billion in hardware in the trailing twelve months. In Q3 F2025, Oracle pushed $703 million in iron, down 6.8 percent, and we calculate that Oracle had operating income of $506 million on this iron, which is 72 percent of revenue. Which is not too shabby. Those margins are as good as Oracle is getting on cloud services, as you can see in the table below:\n\nOracle describes its quarterly results in two different ways. The first is by product divisions: Cloud Services, License Support, Cloud License and On Premise License, Hardware, and Services. It also talks about them by product groups: Applications Cloud Services and License Support and Infrastructure Cloud Services and License Support, which is another way to break cloud and license but by where they are vertically in the IT stack.\n\nThe point is this: Oracle\u2019s infrastructure software business \u2013 operating systems are bundled with the hardware and so are not part of this segment \u2013 is now growing faster than its application software business on its cloud (or for software sold to run on other clouds). In the quarter, the application part of the cloud business (Oracle Fusion and NetSuite application suites and their predecessors) brought in $4.81 billion in Q3 F2025, up 5 percent. But the infrastructure cloud business grew by 15.2 percent to just a tad under $6.2 billion. Infrastructure is growing five times faster sequentially as applications. And we see no reason why this trend will not persist for a while as companies go to OCI to do the AI processing they cannot hope to easily build because they do not have the skills or the GPUs. AI will pull customers out of their on premises datacenters and onto an Oracle cloud region \u2013 even if it is a personal one among the Global 5,000 or 10,000.\n\nOracle mixes cloud and license revenues in its financial presentations, which we have consolidated and tweaked to get operating income in the table above. But when it talks in the statements it puts out with the numbers, it gives a set of pure revenue figures for true cloud IaaS capacity and SaaS capacity sold. Here is what it looks like:\n\nThis way of talking about the business is only a few years old, and we estimated the breakdown of Cloud IaaS versus Cloud SaaS for fiscal 2021 based on trends from fiscal 2022 to the present. A bit more than 80 percent of the pure cloud revenues at Oracle was for SaaS in fiscal 2021, but IaaS has been growing steadily as Oracle builds out the OCI cloud. IaaS has grown from under 20 percent to more than 40 percent of revenues from August 2020 to today. Oracle is interesting in that it is a SaaS vendor building an IaaS cloud, whereas Amazon Web Services was an IaaS that had to build a SaaS stack and partner with others to build that up to more than half of the business. (Microsoft was more like Oracle, for both datacenter and desktop applications, and started a decade earlier to build Azure.)\n\nIt will not be long before IaaS will be bigger than SaaS, but if GPU capacity constraints abate and supply can balance demand, prices for GPU capacity should moderate and SaaS should retake the lead from IaaS. But, then again, GenAI is doing the work of programmers, analysts, and knowledge workers, so maybe it won\u2019t. . . .\n\nOn the call with Wall Street, Ellison said that Oracle was building a cluster based on Nvidia GB200 compute engines \u2013 that\u2019s two \u201cBlackwell\u201d B200s coupled to one \u201cGrace\u201d CG100 processor \u2013 and having a total of 64,000 GPUs. He added that Oracle signed a multi-billion dollar contract with AMD in Q3 to build a cluster with 30,000 Instinct MI355X GPU accelerators. As we reported back in February, AMD is moving the launch of the MI355X up to the middle of the year; it was previously set for sometime in the second half of 2025. It is designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s \u201cBlackwell Ultra\u201d B300 accelerators, about which we expect to hear more next week at the 2025 GPU Technical Conference in San Jose.",

            "content": "Ellison revealed that the company has seen $130 billion in remaining performance obligation (RPO) this quarter, despite not yet signing a contract with Stargate, adding that the company expects to sign its first \"large Stargate contract fairly soon.\"\n\nOracle has yet to sign any contracts related to the Stargate project, said CTO and chairman Larry Ellison during the company's Q3 2025 earnings call.\n\nThat RPO - contracted revenue for products or services yet to be delivered to the customer - is up from $97bn last quarter and up from $80bn last year, a 63 percent increase year over year (YoY).\n\nSafra Catz, CEO of Oracle, said that the company expects this RPO to \"help drive a 15 percent increase in Oracle's overall revenue in our next fiscal year beginning this June. And we expect RPO to continue to grow rapidly - as we look forward to signing our first Stargate contract - yet another big opportunity for Oracle to expand both its AI training and AI inferencing businesses in the near future.\"\n\nStargate is a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's MGX to deploy a number of large data centers across the US. The partners are investing an initial $100 billion, with funding for the rest of the project yet to be secured. As a first step, Oracle is set to deploy 64,000 Nvidia GB200s for OpenAI at a data center in Abilene, Texas, which it leases from Crusoe.\n\nOutside of Stargate updates, Oracle revealed its revenue for the quarter was $14.1 billion, up six percent YoY, while net income reached $2.9 billion, up 22 percent YoY. The previous quarter saw revenue of $14bn, and net income $3.15bn.\n\nThe Q3 revenue can be broken further down, with cloud revenue including IaaS and SaaS at $6.2 billion, up 23 percent YoY.\n\nMeanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) rose 20 percent to $1.02, less than analyst expectations. Catz noted that the non-GAAP tax rate was 19.9 percent, higher than her 19 percent guidance, which lowered EPS by two cents. Oracle shares took a hit following the quarterly results, from $154.25 per share, to $139.28. They have since risen to around $144.\n\nCatz noted that this quarter saw the company cross into triple digits for its total number of cloud regions, and expects its available power capacity to double this calendar year and triple by the end of the next fiscal year.\n\nThe company has also expanded its Oracle Database@ offerings, which launched with Amazon Web Services and Google last year and with Microsoft in 2023. That offering sees Oracle hardware colocated in other cloud providers' data centers. Catz said that the offering is now live in 18 cloud regions with the partners, and Oracle has \"another 40 planned with Azure, Google, and AWS.\" Ellison estimated that this number could be reached in the next 12 months, though noted it was not entirely in Oracle's control.\n\nEllison added that the company's multicloud revenue is up 92 percent in the last three months alone.\n\nCapex is predictably expected to remain high. This quarter saw $5.9bn in capex, with Catz adding that the company \"front loaded some purchases into the quarter.\" Capex in the previous quarter was $3.97bn.\n\n\"Given the demand that you see in our RPO growth and the additional demand we see in our pipeline, I expect fiscal year 2025 capex will be a little more than double what it was last year at around $16 billion,\" said Catz. For comparison, Microsoft's capex for the last quarter alone was $22.6bn, and it said it would spend $80bn on AI data centers this year.\n\nWhen asked why Oracle's capex is so much lower than its competitors, Ellison noted that the company can \"start our data centers smaller than our competitors, and then grow based on demand.\" He also puts some of this down to the company's high degree of standardization and automation in its cloud, which gives the company \"better margins\" and lowers labor costs.\n\nOn the AI side, Oracle has seen significant demand, with GPU consumption for AI training growing 244 percent in the last 12 months.\n\nEllison added that the company is seeing a lot of demand for AI inferencing as well.\n\nAs a result, the company is launching a new AI inferencing offering. \"We are connecting OpenAI ChatGPT, xAI Grok, and Meta Llama directly to Version 23ai of the Oracle Database with advanced vector capabilities. This new product, called the Oracle AI Data Platform, makes it easy for customers to use any of the world's leading AI models to analyze all of their private data\u2014while keeping all their data private and secure,\" said Ellison.",

            "content": "Potential business and tech benefits\n\nThough customers may be pleased to have features like Exadata and Real Application Clusters (RAC) available on AWS, Oracle Database@AWS offers even more benefits. First, customers can use their existing AWS commitments to purchase this offering. Many times organizations make ambitious commitments to cloud providers, but often struggle to meet them for any number of reasons outside of their control. This can give those organizations a new way to consume their cloud credits and take advantage of the cloud. Second, because this offering uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) behind the scenes in the AWS data centers, customers can take advantage of Oracle Support Rewards to get a discount on their annual Oracle license support bill. For instance, if a customer purchases $1 million of Oracle Database@AWS on an annual basis, they will receive a discount on their license support bill of $250,000 to $330,000. That\u2019s like getting a 25%-33% discount.\n\nMany organizations are planning to transition to cloud-native database solutions because they previously had limited options for moving their complex databases to cloud. Oracle Database@AWS gives them a chance to pause and consider a different path. But, why should they change course now?\n\nAn enormous amount of work goes into changing the underlying data layer of any application. The sheer amount of discovery, planning, modification, and testing can be tremendous and quite expensive. In the end, they may arrive at a cloud-native solution, but at what cost? In comparison, consider a lift-and-shift approach for that data. It could free up precious funding to do more important things with that data, such as implementing predictive analytics solutions for better insights, feeding stronger AI/ML models, or simply enhancing access for business users. Suddenly the IT organization becomes a hero to the business. Data is the life blood of nearly every organization today. Unlocking that value more quickly and for less money equals greater business benefit.\n\nNetworking and other considerations\n\nOracle Database@AWS is an exciting option, but as with all things cloud, there are considerations to take into account. As usual, networking is a big topic. It is incredibly important to thoroughly understand the network requirements of Oracle Database@AWS and how it fits into an organization\u2019s unique cloud configuration. For instance, a certain number of IP addresses need to be reserved for various configurations of the service, and there are particular address ranges that are reserved and cannot be used. Also, the connectivity is setup using network peering, which poses questions about routing and address NATing.\n\nOn top of these network considerations, it is also important to understand that while this option is available through the AWS marketplace, organizations must have a Cloud Services Agreement (CSA) with Oracle, and they must execute an order with Oracle for the capacity needed. This is important because it can take time to negotiate the contracts, so organizations need to plan ahead.\n\nSuccess takes two views\n\nIn the end, planning and design are critical to the success of an Oracle Database@AWS implementation. That\u2019s where Deloitte comes in. With more than 100,000 people in its global AWS and Oracle technology practices, Deloitte is one of the few service providers that has the breadth and depth to support such a critical advancement.\n\nImplementing Oracle Database@AWS takes skills and knowledge from both the AWS and Oracle perspectives. One without the other is like an airplane without engines, it just won\u2019t work. Through strong alliance relationships with both Oracle and AWS, Deloitte can provide clients with direct access to the product engineers who built Oracle Database@AWS\u2014and even more, serve as a champion who can bring everybody to the table to achieve the desired outcomes.",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL) offered an upbeat spin on its recent quarter: AI is powering strong demand for its cloud business. And that's even before any contributions from Stargate, the massive project that some analysts expect to give Oracle stock a lift.\n\nIt was a little over six weeks ago that Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House along with President Donald Trump, OpenAI leader Sam Altman and SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to tout Stargate. The massive infrastructure project could spend $500 billion on data centers over the next five years that will focus on powering AI systems, with Nvidia (NVDA) among other partners.\n\nOn Monday's earnings call, Ellison said Wall Street can expect the first contract from the Stargate effort \"fairly soon.\" He also touted Stargate as the \"biggest AI training project out there.\"\n\nStill, industry experts are puzzling over the details as the buzzy project remains in its early stages.\n\n\"The 'media-to-revenue' ratio on Stargate feels high to me right now given that Oracle does not yet have a contract,\" International Data Corp. President Crawford Del Prete told Investor's Business Daily. \"I think that will change as contracts get awarded, but it's a lot of funds to count on.\"\n\nAnd, in the meantime, a Q3 earnings miss added to a recent slump for Oracle stock.\n\nOracle Stock: Waiting For First Contract\n\nOracle stock rallied 13% over a two-day period in late January when the project was revealed. The tech giant was once considered left behind by the cloud era. Stargate showed how Oracle had won a seat at the table in the race to offer AI services.\n\nBut a slumping stock market and concerns about AI spending brought on by DeepSeek have caused Oracle to slump for nearly two months.\n\nAn earnings and sales miss with Oracle's February-quarter didn't help, pushing Oracle stock lower. Oracle has a backlog of AI-related cloud work. But it has posted underwhelming recent results as it races to meet that demand.\n\nStargate is still early in its buildout. Construction is underway in Abilene, Texas on the first data center that is part of the project.\n\nThe data center will house 64,000 GPUs from Nvidia (NVDA), according to a Bloomberg report last week. Oracle will be in charge of operating the supercomputer at the data center but OpenAI is contributing to the design, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump ally Elon Musk, a known rival of OpenAI's Altman, has cast doubt on the project's finances.\n\nSoftBank and OpenAI are contributing $19 billion each, according to a report by The Information in January. Oracle and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based fund, would contribute a combined $7 billion. Altman also told colleagues that Stargate will operate similar to a venture fund, according to The Information.\n\nMonness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White upgraded Oracle stock to neutral from a sell call in a client note last week. But he was skeptical about Stargate.\n\n\"In the spirit of shortcomings that have come to pass throughout American history with the suffix 'gate' attached, combined with Elon Musk's view of the project, we believe Stargate's moniker may be more apropos than the market fully appreciates,\" White wrote.\n\nOracle Cloud Grows\n\nOracle envisions the Stargate project boosting AI demand for its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business. OCI rents computing power \u2014 including access to graphics processing units necessary for training AI algorithms \u2014 to enterprises. Oracle is a smaller player in a cloud field dominated by hyperscalers Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.\n\nOracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said the company signed sales contracts worth more than $48 billion in its third quarter alone. Its remaining performance obligations \u2014 a measure of cloud contracts not yet delivered to customers \u2014 grew 63% year-over-year to $130 billion.\n\nOracle projected sales growth to accelerate from an estimated 8% for its May-ending 2025 fiscal year to 15% in fiscal 2026 and 20% in fiscal 2027. Those estimates don't include Stargate revenue.\n\nCatz added in Oracle's press release that \"we expect RPO to continue to grow rapidly \u2014 as we look forward to signing our first Stargate contract \u2014 yet another big opportunity for Oracle to expand both its AI training and AI inferencing businesses in the near future.\"\n\nOracle Stock: How Will Stargate Revenue Work?\n\nAnother question is how the revenue from Stargate will be recognized. Oracle is both a reported technology partner and financial backer of the initiative.\n\n\"We expect Oracle is likely to receive a revenue share from the Stargate project,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a February client note. \"What we do not know is how the Stargate entity is structured from an accounting perspective, what Oracle's economics are related to Stargate, and what further impacts the potential asset transfer and investment might have.\"\n\nCatz was asked by analysts on Monday how Stargate would \"flow through\" to Oracle's financials.\n\n\"I'll be explaining it to you once it's fully laid out, but it's not going to make your work harder,\" Catz said. \"We're going to be very, very clear on (it) as the contracts come through us, it won't be as much of a change as you think. It's just going to be even larger numbers.\"\n\nCan Oracle Stock Break Out Of Funk?\n\nOn the other hand, investors are growing more cautious about AI spending in general. The sell-off sparked by the DeepSeek news underlined this. With its earnings report letdown, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote Tuesday he expects Oracle stock will remain \"range\u200b-\u200bbound\" for at least a little while.\n\nOracle stock's Relative Strength rating has slumped to 76 out of 99, compared to 89 three weeks ago. Shares also broke significantly below Oracle's 200-day moving average earlier this month, according to IBD MarketSurge.\n\nThe performance is a letdown after Oracle's 60% rally in 2024 marked its best year since 1999. For some of its quarterly reports last year, investors overlooked near-term results to focus on the company's backlog and cloud momentum. That trend appears to have passed. So it is all the more important that Oracle deliver on the Stargate and AI hype.\n\n\"Bottom line, Oracle has work to do in convincing investors of the long-term value of their building RPO balance,\" Morgan Stanley's Weiss wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nHow To Know It's Time To Sell Your Favorite Stock\n\nHow To Spot Stock Market Tops",

            "content": "Oracle\u2019s Q3 2025 results showed mixed performance, with revenue and earnings missing expectations. However, the company saw strong cloud growth, securing major AI-driven deals with OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia. At the same time, Oracle is making strides in sustainability, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. Despite a recent stock dip, Oracle\u2019s cloud expansion and green initiatives position it as a long-term tech leader. Oracle\u2019s Cloud Growth and Financial Hurdles\n\nIn its fiscal third quarter of 2025, Oracle reported a revenue of $14.13 billion. This was slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations of $14.38 billion. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share were $1.47, missing the anticipated $1.49.\n\nDespite these misses, Oracle\u2019s cloud services and license support revenue grew by 10%, reaching $11 billion. However, this was still under the expected $11.21 billion.\n\nThe company announced a 25% increase in its quarterly dividend, raising it to 50 cents per share.\n\nOracle also secured significant cloud agreements with major tech firms, including OpenAI, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia. These deals are expected to boost Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure and AI initiatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s remaining performance obligations (RPOs) increased by 62%. They now total $130 billion. This exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations and indicates strong future demand.\n\nOracle projects a 15% revenue growth for the next fiscal year, driven by its cloud infrastructure and AI initiatives. However, the cloud giant\u2019s stock experienced a decline in pre-market trading following these results.\n\nOracle stock has dropped 4.1% amid broader market selloffs and is down 11% this year. Nevertheless, it has gained 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmid its financial hits and misses, Oracle continues to push forward with its sustainability and net-zero promises.\n\nOracle\u2019s Sustainability Initiatives and Path to Net Zero\n\nOracle Corporation has established itself as a leader in integrating sustainable practices into its operations, aiming to minimize environmental impact and promote a circular economy. The company\u2019s sustainability strategy includes:\n\nSetting ambitious goals,\n\nCreative cloud solutions, and\n\nTeamwork with suppliers and customers.\n\nAmbitious Sustainability Goals\n\nOracle has set clear targets to guide its sustainability initiatives. The company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations and supply chain by 2050.\n\nAs an intermediate goal, Oracle plans to halve its GHG emissions by 2030, relative to a 2020 baseline. It has pledged to use 100% renewable energy for all its global operations, including cloud data centers, by 2025.\n\nThe IT company wants all its key suppliers to have environmental programs. It also aims for 80% of them to set emissions reduction targets by 2025.\n\nThe company aims for a 33% cut in both drinking water use and landfill waste per square foot. It also targets a 25% reduction in employee air travel emissions by 2025. Oracle shows its commitment to the environment by aligning its operations with these goals for a greener future.\n\nGreener Data Centers, Smarter AI\n\nOracle is making great strides in lessening the environmental impact of its cloud services. The company has put a lot of money into energy-efficient data centers. It uses advanced cooling tech and AI for better power management.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) aims to deliver high-performance computing. It does this while using less energy than traditional on-premises systems. In 2023, OCI sourced 86% of its energy from renewables. Data centers in Europe and Latin America reached 100% renewable energy use.\n\nAlso, Oracle helps businesses track and manage their carbon footprint. Their cloud solutions guide customers in making smart sustainability choices. The company is setting the standard for responsible computing by making sustainability a key part of its cloud services.\n\nInnovative Sustainability Solutions and Supply Chain Management\n\nOracle has introduced solutions to help organizations manage and report on their sustainability initiatives:\n\nOracle Fusion Cloud Sustainability : Launched in September 2024, this app helps organizations capture and analyze key sustainability data. It streamlines reporting and boosts decision-making, all at no extra cost.\n\nOracle Cloud EPM for Sustainability : Launched in March 2024, this tool helps organizations track and manage sustainability efforts. It links data, plans, and goals, making it easier to comply with new reporting standards.\n\nThe tech company emphasizes sustainability throughout its supply chain:\n\nDesign and Sourcing : The company creates eco-friendly products. It also sources materials responsibly to lessen environmental impacts.\n\nManufacturing and Transportation : Oracle focuses on making and moving products in a sustainable way. They aim to save costs while also providing better service.\n\nOracle\u2019s Green Milestones: Progress, Wins, and What\u2019s Next\n\nOracle has made significant strides toward its sustainability goals. The company has already transitioned all European cloud regions to 100% renewable energy, setting a precedent for other regions to follow.\n\nMore than 50 facilities worldwide now run on renewable energy. This shift helps cut corporate emissions. The company has cut total emissions by 47% since 2020. This shows strong progress toward its targets for 2030 and 2050.\n\nOracle also has a strong hardware recycling program. They collect and repurpose millions of pounds of old IT assets. Nearly all of these items are reused or recycled.\n\nThe tech company also partners with its suppliers to promote sustainability. It aims for all key suppliers to have environmental programs by 2025. It reports that 80% of its key suppliers have emissions reduction targets in place, aligning with the company\u2019s sustainability objectives.\n\nThe company cut potable water use and waste to landfills by 33% per square foot. It also reduced employee air travel emissions by 25%. These achievements will meet the 2025 targets early.\n\nThese efforts highlight Oracle\u2019s proactive approach to reducing its environmental footprint. The company\u2019s steps in renewable energy, cutting emissions, and saving resources show its commitment to a sustainable future.\n\nWith a push toward 100% renewable energy and net-zero emissions by 2050, Oracle is balancing innovation with environmental responsibility. As the company expands its cloud infrastructure and green initiatives, it remains a key player in both the tech and sustainability space.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nOracle\u2019s global cloud estate grew to 101 regions as the company\u2019s infrastructure and software services revenues increased 23% year over year during the quarter to $6.2 billion, CEO Safra Catz said Monday, speaking during a Q3 2025 earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe marked a milestone this quarter as we crossed into triple digits,\u201d Catz said of the cloud expansion. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before we have more cloud regions than all of our competitors combined.\u201d\n\nOracle embarked on an aggressive buildout a year ago, pledging to invest $10 billion in infrastructure to support cloud as the technology became the provider\u2019s dominant revenue stream. The company had 68 active cloud regions during Q3 2024, generating $5.1 billion in revenue.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDespite the large capital investment in infrastructure, Oracle\u2019s cloud market share is dwarfed by that of the three largest hyperscale providers. The company held just 3% of the massive $330 billion market last year, as AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud together consumed nearly two-thirds of global cloud revenues, according to Synergy Research Group.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of revenue to go around in a market that sustained year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 20% or more in 2024. But gaining market share is a heavy lift.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to seriously compete with AWS, Microsoft and Google unless you are constantly investing many billions of dollars into expanding and enhancing data center infrastructure,\u201d SRG Chief Analyst John Dinsdale said in an email. \u201cJust ask Oracle: They didn't invest at similar levels, they couldn't meaningfully compete and now they are trying to play catch up.\u201d\n\nAWS alone reported $26.3 billion in capital expenditures for the final three months of last year, more than doubling in one quarter Oracle\u2019s full-year commitment.\n\nMicrosoft laid out plans to spend $80 billion on data centers to meet surging demand for AI compute during its current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and Google nearly matched that number, pledging $75 billion this year to expand AI and cloud capacity.\n\nCapacity constraints riddled the hyperscalers, as AI usage drained cloud resources. Oracle felt the pinch but anticipates some easing later this year.\n\nThe company is pushing to double its capacity in 2025 as demand for AI compute \u201ccontinues to dramatically outstrip supply,\u201d Catz said. \u201cWe do expect that the component delays that have slowed cloud capacity expansion this year should ease in Q1 2026.\u201d\n\nAs part of its expansion strategy, Oracle tethered its cloud database business to its hyperscale competitors through partnerships cemented with AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud over the last two years. In January, the company added eight regions and cross-region disaster recovery services to the Oracle Database@Google Cloud pact.\n\nOracle\u2019s multicloud database deployments are now live in 18 regions with an additional 40 in the build phase. Business generated by the alliances grew 200% during the quarter, Oracle Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison said.\n\nWhile the company has yet to see any revenue from a $500 billion infrastructure building push called Stargate announced in January, Ellison said the first large contract from the project should be coming in \u201cfairly soon.\u201d",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL) stock dipped in early trading Tuesday after posting quarterly results with what an Evercore ISI analyst said had \"a lot of moving parts.\" Fiscal third-quarter earnings and sales missed Wall Street forecasts but the database software company said strong cloud and AI demand is accelerating sales growth.\n\n\"Oracle served up something for both bulls and bears last night,\" wrote Evercore ISI's Kirk Materne, who rates Oracle stock as outperform. \"While revenue/earnings-per-share came in a bit shy of forecasts, the company blew away expectations for RPO (remaining performance obligations) \u2013 $130 billion vs. roughly $105 billion estimates \u2013 and guided to 15% revenue growth in fiscal year 2026.\"\n\nOracle on Monday reported that it earned an adjusted $1.47 per share on sales of $14.1 billion for the February-ended quarter. Both numbers missed estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet projected Oracle would earn an adjusted $1.49 per share on sales of $14.4 billion. Adjusted earnings rose 4% while sales gained 6% year over year.\n\nBut Oracle's leadership encouraged investors to focus on its potential for its cloud business to benefit from enterprise AI spending.\n\n\"What we are seeing in the market is that we are the destination of choice for both AI training and inferencing,\" Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said on company's earnings call.\n\nA growing backlog for cloud services is giving the company \"clear line of sight to our future revenue growth.\" That includes a projection of 15% growth in its June-beginning fiscal 2026 and 20% growth in fiscal 2027. That would mark a major acceleration from the 6% average growth of Oracle's previous five fiscal years.\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle stock is down more than 2% at 144.70 in premarket trading.\n\nOracle's Stargate Contracts Coming 'Fairly Soon'\n\nMeanwhile, sales of Oracle's closely watched cloud-infrastructure business increased 49%, compared with 52% growth for the segment in Oracle's November-ended quarter. Oracle's guidance for the May-ending quarter of 9% revenue growth missed previous forecasts of 9.5% growth.\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure business is racing to build out computing capacity for AI startups and other users of the cloud. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business rents computing power to other companies, competing against much larger hyperscalers Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.\n\nChairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said in the press release that Oracle is on track to double data-center capacity during the calendar year. The company now expects capital expenditures to grow to $16 billion for its May-ending fiscal 2025, roughly doubling from a year earlier.\n\nEllison appeared at the White House in late January with President Donald Trump, OpenAI leader Sam Altman and SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to announce an AI infrastructure effort called Stargate. The $100 billion project \u2014 which could grow up to $500 billion over the next four years \u2014 features Oracle as an initial equity backer.\n\nInvestors were anxious for Stargate updates heading into the report.\n\nCatz said in Oracle's press release that \"we expect RPO to continue to grow rapidly \u2014 as we look forward to signing our first Stargate contract \u2014 yet another big opportunity for Oracle to expand both its AI training and AI inferencing businesses in the near future.\"\n\nOn the earnings call, Ellison added that \"Stargate looks to be the biggest AI training project out there. And we expect that will allow us to grow our RPO even higher in the coming quarters. And we do expect our first large Stargate contract fairly soon.\"\n\nOracle Stock Analyst View On Earnings Report\n\nFollowing the report, analysts appeared more focused on Oracle's commentary for future demand.\n\n\"Q3 in itself was not stellar but Q3 is a seasonally small quarter and often disappoints,\" wrote Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow in a client note following the report. \"What is more important for the long\u200b-\u200bterm investment case is the very strong RPO growth, in our view, which does not even seem to include benefits from the large Stargate initiative, and the 15% year-over-year growth guidance for FY26 (fiscal year 2026), which both confirm the revenue acceleration story.\"\n\nLenschow holds a positive overweight call on Oracle stock.\n\n\"While tight data center capacity has demanded some patience from investors, we believe that as we move past some of the capacity constraints in the second half of this calendar year,\" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji in a client note Tuesday. Naji rates Oracle stock as outperform.\n\nFurther, Oracle said it was increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, up from 40 cents per share.\n\nOracle Stock Down 10% This Year\n\nPrior to the earnings report, Oracle fell 4% in Monday trading. Shares have lost 10.5% so far this year, not including early Tuesday's action, after Oracle stock rallied nearly 60% in 2024 for the company's biggest annual gain since 1999.\n\nLike many stocks that benefited from last year's AI enthusiasm, Oracle stock has been hit by concerns about the returns for its large technology infrastructure investments.\n\nAhead of the report, Oracle stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nOracle's IBD Relative Strength Rating is 78 out of 99. The RS Rating means that Oracle has outperformed 78% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year. But the score is down from 88 just a week earlier.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nMeta Stock Falls As Analyst Warns Of 'Another DeepSeek Moment.'\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nTop Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy",

Analysts, on average, projected $14.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue from Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure also missed estimates.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell as much as 7.5% after markets opened in New York on Tuesday, touching their lowest level since Aug. 2024.\n\nStill, Oracle trumpeted a surge in bookings and said its growing cloud infrastructure business will boost revenue over the next two fiscal years. Remaining performance obligations \u2014 a measure of bookings \u2014 were $130 billion in the period ended Feb. 28, compared with $97.3 billion in the previous quarter. The company projected sales will increase 15% in the fiscal year beginning in June and 20% in fiscal year 2027. Analysts, on average, estimated increases of 13% and 14%, respectively.\n\nMuch of the future sales bump was attributed to Oracle\u2019s growing cloud infrastructure business, which has been fueled by demand for computing power to run artificial intelligence workloads. The company\u2019s strategy to become a major player in the competitive industry of renting out computing power and storage was validated in January when it announced a joint venture with OpenAI and Softbank Group Corp. on a $100 billion project to build data centers for the AI startup.\n\n\u201cWe have now signed cloud agreements with several world leading technology companies including: OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia and AMD,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz in the statement.\n\nWhile the campus for the joint venture is taking shape in Abilene, Texas, Catz said Oracle\u2019s $130 billion in remaining performance obligations didn\u2019t include any business from the project, dubbed Stargate. Bookings will \u201ccontinue to grow rapidly \u2014 as we look forward to signing our first Stargate contract,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestors are closely tracking data center spending across the industry for any signs of a pullback. Chinese upstart DeepSeek released a new open-source AI model that it claims rivals the abilities of US technology at a fraction of the cost, which triggered concerns that companies are investing too much on building data centers.",

Total Remaining Performance Obligations were up 62% year-over-year in USD, and up 63% in constant currency, to $130 billion. Total quarterly revenues were up 6% year-over-year in USD, and up 8% in constant currency, to $14.1 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 10% year-over-year in USD, and up 12% in constant currency, to $11.0 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were down 10% in USD and down 8% in constant currency, to $1.1 billion.\n\nQ3 GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 7% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 44%. GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 22% in USD, and up 27% in constant currency. Non-GAAP net income was $4.2 billion, up 6% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. Q3 GAAP earnings per share was $1.02, up 20% in USD and up 25% in constant currency, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 4% in USD, and up 7% in constant currency.\n\nShort-term deferred revenues were $9.0 billion. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow was $20.7 billion and free cash flow was $5.8 billion.\n\n\"Oracle signed sales contracts for more than $48 billion in Q3,\" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. \"This record sales number pushed our Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, up 63% to over $130 billion. We have now signed cloud agreements with several world leading technology companies including: OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD. We expect that our huge $130 billion sales backlog will help drive a 15% increase in Oracle's overall revenue in our next fiscal year beginning this June. And we expect RPO to continue to grow rapidly\u2014as we look forward to signing our first Stargate contract\u2014yet another big opportunity for Oracle to expand both its AI training and AI inferencing businesses in the near future.\"\n\n\"We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,\" said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. \"Customer demand is at record levels. Our Database MultiCloud revenue from Microsoft, Google and Amazon is up 92% in the last three months alone. GPU consumption for AI training grew 244% in the last 12 months. And we are seeing enormous demand for AI inferencing on our customers' private data. So, we are connecting OpenAI ChatGPT, xAI Grok and Meta Llama directly to Version 23ai of the Oracle Database with advanced vector capabilities. This new product, called the Oracle AI Data Platform, makes it easy for customers to use any of the world's leading AI models to analyze all of their private data\u2014while keeping all their data private and secure.\"\n\nOracle also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of outstanding common stock, reflecting a 25% increase over the current quarterly dividend of $0.40. Larry Ellison, Oracle's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer, and largest stockholder, did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter. This increased dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 10, 2025, with a payment date of April 23, 2025.\n\nA sample list of customers which purchased Oracle Cloud services during the quarter will be available at www.oracle.com/customers/earnings/.\n\nA list of recent technical innovations and announcements is available at www.oracle.com/news/.\n\nTo learn what industry analysts have been saying about Oracle's products and services see www.oracle.com/corporate/analyst-reports/.\n\nEarnings Conference Call and Webcast\n\nOracle will hold a conference call and webcast today to discuss these results at 4:00 p.m. Central.

The difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in each of the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to the net tax effects related to\n\nstock-based compensation expense; acquisition related and other items, including the tax effects on amortization of intangible assets; and restructuring expense, partially offset by the net deferred tax effects related\n\nto an income tax benefit that was previously recorded due to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure.\n\n* Not meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3 FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ($ in millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 28,\n\n2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 31,\n\n2024 ASSETS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Assets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents $ 17,406\n\n$ 10,454\n\n\n\nMarketable securities 417\n\n207\n\n\n\nTrade receivables, net 8,051\n\n7,874\n\n\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,242\n\n4,019\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Current Assets 30,116\n\n22,554\n\nNon-Current Assets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 31,970\n\n21,536\n\n\n\nIntangible assets, net 5,131\n\n6,890\n\n\n\nGoodwill, net 62,171\n\n62,230\n\n\n\nDeferred tax assets 11,799\n\n12,273\n\n\n\nOther non-current assets 20,191\n\n15,493\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Non-Current Assets 131,262\n\n118,422\n\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 161,378\n\n$ 140,976\n\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Liabilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes payable and other borrowings, current $ 8,167\n\n$ 10,605\n\n\n\nAccounts payable 2,423\n\n2,357\n\n\n\nAccrued compensation and related benefits 1,839\n\n1,916\n\n\n\nDeferred revenues 9,019\n\n9,313\n\n\n\nOther current liabilities 8,175\n\n7,353\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Current Liabilities 29,623\n\n31,544\n\nNon-Current Liabilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes payable and other borrowings, non-current 88,109\n\n76,264\n\n\n\nIncome taxes payable 9,813\n\n10,817\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities 2,208\n\n3,692\n\n\n\nOther non-current liabilities 14,364\n\n9,420\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Non-Current Liabilities 114,494\n\n100,193\n\nStockholders' Equity 17,261\n\n9,239\n\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY $ 161,378\n\n$ 140,976\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nORACLE CORPORATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3 FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS ($ in millions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n\nFebruary 28,\n\n2025 February 29,\n\n2024 Cash Flows From Operating Activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income $ 9,016\n\n$ 7,323\n\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation 2,715\n\n2,318\n\nAmortization of intangible assets 1,763\n\n2,267\n\nDeferred income taxes (1,097)\n\n(1,755)\n\nStock-based compensation 3,374\n\n2,927\n\nOther, net 422\n\n631\n\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease in trade receivables, net (312)\n\n(409)\n\nDecrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 603\n\n457\n\nDecrease in accounts payable and other liabilities (633)\n\n(682)\n\nDecrease in income taxes payable (1,222)\n\n(788)\n\nIncrease in deferred revenues 35\n\n303\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities 14,664\n\n12,592\n\nCash Flows From Investing Activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and other investments (838)\n\n(674)\n\nProceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments 444\n\n207\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired -\n\n(59)\n\nCapital expenditures (12,135)\n\n(4,068)\n\nNet cash used for investing activities (12,529)\n\n(4,594)\n\nCash Flows From Financing Activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments for repurchases of common stock (450)\n\n(1,050)\n\nProceeds from issuances of common stock 520\n\n454\n\nShares repurchased for tax withholdings upon vesting of restricted stock-based awards (900)\n\n(1,865)\n\nPayments of dividends to stockholders (3,340)\n\n(3,289)\n\n(Repayments of) proceeds from issuances of commercial paper, net (396)\n\n936\n\nProceeds from issuances of senior notes and term loan credit agreements, net of issuance costs 19,548\n\n-\n\nRepayments of senior notes and term loan credit agreements (9,771)\n\n(3,500)\n\nOther, net (299)\n\n34\n\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities 4,912\n\n(8,280)\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (95)\n\n(2)\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 6,952\n\n(284)\n\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 10,454\n\n9,765\n\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 17,406\n\n$ 9,481\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nORACLE CORPORATION Q3 FISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS FREE CASH FLOW -

Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\n\nStock-based compensation expenses : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, and we believe such compensation contributed to the revenues earned during the periods presented and also believe it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.\n\n: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP operating expenses, income tax effects and net income measures.

            "content": "Larry Ellison, chairman and co-founder of Oracle Corp., speaks during the Oracle OpenWorld 2017 conference in San Francisco on Oct. 1, 2017.\n\nOracle issued quarterly results on Monday that trailed analysts' estimates and gave a forecast that came up short of expectations.\n\nHere is how Oracle did compared to LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.49 expected\n\n$1.47 adjusted vs. $1.49 expected Revenue: $14.13 billion vs. $14.39 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased 6% from $13.3 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose 22% to $2.94 billion, or $1.02 a share, from $2.4 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle's cloud services business jumped 10% from a year earlier to $11.01 billion, accounting for 78% of total sales.\n\nThe company's cloud infrastructure segment, which helps businesses move workloads out of their own data centers, has been booming due to demand for computing power that can support artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit increased 49% from a year earlier to $2.7 billion.\n\n\"We are on schedule to double our data center capacity this calendar year,\" Oracle Chair Larry Ellison said in a release. \"Customer demand is at record levels.\"\n\nIn January, President Donald Trump announced plans to invest billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the U.S. in collaboration with Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. The first initiative of the joint venture, called Stargate, will be to construct data centers in Texas, an effort that is already underway, Ellison said during the announcement at the White House.\n\nOracle said it has more than $130 billion in remaining performance obligations after signing $48 billion in contracts during the period. That excludes contracts related to Stargate, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on the call with analysts.\n\nOracle will spend around $16 billion in capital expenditures this year, which is a little more than double the total from last year, Catz added.\n\n\"As always, we remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends,\" Catz said.\n\nFor the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue to grow of between 8% and 10%. Analysts were expecting growth of about 11% to $15.91 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.65 per share. Analysts were calling for adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.\n\nCatz said Oracle's fourth quarter adjusted earnings projections were negatively impacted by losses from an investment in another company.\n\nOracle's cloud and on-premises licenses business contributed $1.1 billion in revenue during the quarter, down 10% year over year.\n\nThe company also said it is increasing its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Oracle's stock is down almost 11% year to date.",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL) will report earnings later today, with the database software giant hoping to reignite its AI-powered rally. Oracle stock opened lower Monday, coming off four weeks of losses.\n\nShares of Oracle are down about 12% year-to-date after rallying nearly 60% in 2024, Oracle stock's best year since 1999. The company's focus on offering AI computing power helped boost its cloud infrastructure business to ignite the rally, while Oracle's overall push toward offering cloud-based software is gaining momentum.\n\nBut Oracle's shares slumped starting in December after Oracle's fiscal Q2 earnings came in a touch below estimates. Oracle's involvement in the buzzy Stargate AI project in late January helped reignite excitement about the company's AI potential. But then Chinese startup DeepSeek popped up with a lower-cost AI model that took the shine off Oracle and other AI stocks barely one week after the White House hosted a Stargate announcement.\n\nThose factors have has left Oracle needing a positive earnings reaction to restart momentum. Here's what to watch from the report.\n\nOracle Earnings Preview: By The Numbers\n\nFor its February-ended quarter, analysts expect Oracle's adjusted earnings to increase 11% to $1.49 per share while sales increase 8% to $14.4 billion, according to FactSet. Revenue growth is expected to slow from 9% in the previous quarter.\n\nInvestors will likely focus on Oracle's cloud infrastructure sales. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who rates Oracle stock a buy, wrote in a client note late last week that the company will need to show cloud infrastructure growth above 50% to show the business is still accelerating. Oracle's cloud infrastructure sales increased 52% in the November-ended quarter.\n\n\"For the acceleration narrative to play out, we believe Oracle needs to 1) sustain high levels of OCI demand; 2) turn on data center capacity in a bigger way; 3) convert AI backlog into AI revenue,\" Thill wrote.\n\nStargate Watch\n\nIt has been nearly two months since Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House with President Donald Trump, OpenAI leader Sam Altman and SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son to announce the Stargate AI effort.\n\nStargate calls for $100 billion in initial investment, with plans for up to $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure. SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX are the initial equity funders.\n\nBut there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the project. Oracle could use the earnings report to update investors on the project.\n\nBNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski wrote Friday that he views Stargate as an \"important (and underappreciated) driver\" for Oracle's growth but he expects it will have lumpy timing in its rollout.\n\n\"We expect management to comment on Oracle's role in the Stargate project, where the company potentially stands to benefit from OpenAI's rapidly rising compute requirements,\" Slowinski said in a client note.\n\nSlowinski rates Oracle a buy.\n\nMonness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White, meanwhile, upgraded Oracle stock to neutral from a sell call in a client note last Monday. But he was skeptical about the Stargate effort.\n\n\"Oracle reveled under the limelight cast upon it by the Stargate Project announcement in January but soon found itself on the ropes with the innovations unveiled by DeepSeek,\" White wrote. \"In the spirit of shortcomings that have come to pass throughout American history with the suffix 'gate' attached, combined with Elon Musk's view of the project, we believe Stargate's moniker may be more apropos than the market fully appreciates.\"\n\nOracle Stock Falls Below 200-Day Moving Average\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle stock is down 4% at 148.59. Major indexes slumped Monday after President Donald Trump declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle stock last week slumped below its 200-day moving average. The stock's Relative Strength rating has fallen to 78 out of a best-possible 99. Oracle's RS score was at 88 one week ago.\n\nOracle stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. Further, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIPO Market Slump Drags On As Unicorns Multiply.

Net income of $2.9 billion represented a 22 percent bump.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) rose 20 percent to reach $1.02 \u2013 but Wall Street expected a couple of cents more and also hoped for higher revenue and profit.\n\nOn the company\u2019s earnings call, CEO Safra Catz explained poor forecasting may have cost Oracle a shot at an EPS beat.\n\n\u201cThe non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.9 percent, which was higher than my 19 percent guidance and lowered EPS by $0.02,\u201d she admitted. \u201cEPS currency headwind ended up at $0.04, more than I thought would be hurt by currency as currency continued to strengthen,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s some irony in those admissions because Catz proudly pointed out that Oracle\u2019s use of its own Fusion ERP means it was able to report earnings just ten days into its new quarter. \u201cWe continue to file our quarterly and annual financial statements faster than any other company in the S&P 500,\u201d she said. Those statements just reflect the result of incorrect forecasts.\n\nOracle shares started the day at $150.34 and after its earnings announcement briefly spiked to $153, sank to $141.74, before settling at around $144.\n\nThe company predicted lovely numbers in the future as that $48 billion in cloudy bookings means it now has $130 billion of remaining performance obligation (RPO) on its books \u2013 that\u2019s stuff customers have committed to pay for, but which Oracle hasn\u2019t yet delivered.\n\n\u201cThe RPO figure is the leading indicator of demand for our cloud services, while our live data center count and power capacity is the leading indicator of the conversion of RPO to revenue,\u201d Catz said. The CEO told investors the quarter past saw Oracle\u2019s 101st cloud region come online and shared the expectation that Oracle\u2019s available power capacity will double this calendar year and triple by the end of its next fiscal year \u2013 meaning mid-2027.\n\n\u201cAs we bring more capacity online, our revenues will clearly accelerate,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of that revenue will come from the Stargate Project, the OpenAI-led $500 billion project to build giant AI datacenters that Oracle has already started building datacenters to host but which is yet to produce any revenue or bookings.\n\nOracle\u2019s chair and CTO Larry Ellison let on that Big Red is yet to sign a contract to participate in the project.\n\n\u201cWe do expect \u2026 our first large Stargate contract fairly soon,\u201d he said, despite previously saying work on datacenters for the project has already commenced.\n\nWhenever the deal is done, it will further boost RPO.\n\nEllison talked up Oracle\u2019s datacenter architecture, praising its \u201chigh degree of automation, which lowers our labor costs dramatically.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore important than lowering our labor costs with no labor, there's no human error.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no human mischief. So, we're much more reliable and much more secure because we don't have a lot of human beings in our data centers.\u201d\n\nOne interesting number in the quarterly results was 49 percent year on year growth in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue, making it Oracle\u2019s fastest-growing segment. NetSuite and cloudy ERP each grew 16 percent, and other SaaS grew nine percent.\n\nEllison described Oracle\u2019s AI training and multi-cloud database as experiencing \u201chyper-growth\u201d, with Oracle\u2019s offerings hosted at AWS, Google and Microsoft growing 200 percent in the last three months.\n\nHe also revealed Oracle is building \u201ca gigantic 64,000 GPU liquid-cooled NVIDIA GB200 cluster for AI training.\u201d\n\nThe cost of that rig is almost certainly included in the $16 billion annual capex expenditure forecast by Catz, $5.9 billion of which came in Q3.\n\nThe CEO wrapped things by stating \u201cOur confidence in meeting our $66 billion revenue target for FY '26 is now stronger than ever and represents around a 15 percent growth rate. And more importantly, I now expect that our fiscal year '27 growth rate will be around 20 percent, which is even higher than I previously guided.\u201d",

Ultimately, everyone's going to come to it, and it should be motivating them, because it is such a massive not only productivity improvement\u2013and as a result, lower cost\u2013but it also gives you incredible insight into your business. It's really amazing.\u201d\n\nCatz\u2019s comments were among the highlights of the Austin, Texas-based database products giant\u2019s third fiscal quarter earnings call held Monday. The call covered the three months ended Feb. 28.\n\n[RELATED: AWS, Microsoft, Google Fight For $90B Q4 2024 Cloud Market Share]\n\nOracle Q3 2025\n\nOracle NetSuite is part of CRN\u2019s 2024 Partner Program Guide.\n\nCatz told analysts on the call that the vendor\u2019s recent partnerships with the three hyperscalers\u2013Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google\u2013has positioned Oracle to get revenue whether customers come in through a hyperscaler or through Oracle itself.\n\nDuring the quarter, Oracle\u2019s 101st cloud region came online, Catz said. The vendor expects its available power capacity will double this calendar year and triple by the end of its next fiscal year. Oracle has 40 cloud regions planned the hyperscalers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before we have more cloud regions than all of our competitors combined,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the destination of choice for both AI training and inferencing.\u201d\n\nOracle In The Agent Era\n\nOracle Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Larry Ellison said that the quality of the vendor\u2019s AI agents have helped to separate it from the competition.\n\nHe said that agents are so integral to this next AI wave that vendors won\u2019t have the ability to separate the money made on agents compared to the money made on applications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re selling more and more health care systems because we have a lot of the agents embedded in them, which helps doctors, which produces better outcomes for patients and saves governments and payers money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe applications themselves will migrate to be basically a bunch of connected AI agents. You're not going to be able to separate how much did you make on the AI agents and how much did you make on the rest of the application. All of our applications are becoming AI agents.\u201d\n\nEllison said that AI inferencing \u201cis a much bigger opportunity\u201d for the vendor compared to AI training. Not many organizations will need to build frontier models, but hundreds of thousands of Oracle customers will consume AI models and train AI models on private data and run agents and applications on top.\n\nEllison told analysts that Oracle is \u201cbuilding a gigantic 64,000 GPU, liquid-cooled Nvidia GB200 cluster for AI training\u201d to meet increased demand, as well as a multibillion-dollar contract with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) \u201cto build a cluster of 30,000 of their latest MI355X GPUs.\u201d\n\nQ3 In Depth\n\nOracle saw $14.1 billion in total revenue during the quarter, up 8 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.\n\nCloud revenue accounted for $6.2 billion during the quarter, up 25 percent year over year. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) was $2.7 billion, up 51 percent. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue was $3.6 billion, up 10 percent.\n\nThe Fusion Cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) offer brought in $900 million during the quarter, up 18 percent year over year. NetSuite Cloud ERP brought in the same amount, up 18 percent year over year.\n\nCloud services and license support revenues grew 12 percent year over year to $11 billion, according to the vendor. Cloud license and on-premises license revenues fell 8 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange to $1.1 billion.\n\nCloud database services have an annualized revenue of $2.3 billion and grew 28 percent year over year. Autonomous Database consumption revenue grew 42 percent year over year.\n\nThe vendor\u2019s remaining performance obligations (RPO) was $130 billion, up 63 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange. That backlog should help increase Oracle\u2019s overall revenue in the next fiscal year by 15 percent, according to the vendor.\n\nThe backlog also doesn\u2019t include any business from the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure venture planned by Oracle, OpenAI and Softbank.\n\nOracle\u2019s multi-cloud database revenue from the hyperscalers grew 92 percent in the last three months. Graphics processing unit (GPU) training consumption for AI training more than tripled year over year.\n\nOracle\u2019s capital expenditures (CapEx) for the 2025 fiscal year should be more than double year over year, around $16 billion, Catz said on the call. \u201cWe remain careful to pace and align our CapEx investments appropriately and in line with booking trends.\u201d\n\nOracle\u2019s stock traded at about $154 a share after market close Monday, up about 5 percent.\n\nCatz forecasted that cloud infrastructure revenue for fiscal year 2025 will grow faster than the 50 percent reported last year. \u201cIt will be even faster for fiscal year 2026\u2013likely a lot faster,\u201d she said. \u201cOur confidence in meeting our $66 billion revenue target for FY26 is now stronger than ever and represents around a 15 percent growth rate.\u201d\n\nCatz took the fiscal year 2027 growth rate up to 20 percent during the call.\n\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter, Catz said to expect total revenues to 9 percent to 11 percent ignoring foreign exchange. Total cloud revenue should grow 24 percent to 28 percent year over year.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs will roll out the Oracle electronic health record at nine more medical facilities next year, with the goal of completing the turbulent EHR deployment as early as 2031, the agency said Thursday.\n\nturbulent EHR deployment as early as 2031, the agency said Thursday. The update brings the total number of deployments planned for next year to 13. In December, the VA said it was taking steps to resume the project after a long pause, starting with four facilities in Michigan in 2026.\n\nThe nine facilities will be announced later this year, following planning sessions with VA officials, clinicians and Oracle, the agency said in a press release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe VA will select the next sites in the deployment schedule based on market, allowing staff to work more efficiently and increasing the number of rollouts that can be conducted at the same time, the agency said.\n\nIt also plans to adopt a standard base of products, workflows and integrations, which will accelerate deployments and simplify decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe can and will move faster on this important priority. But we\u2019re going to listen to our doctors, nurses and vendor partners along the way in order to ensure patient safety, quality and customer service,\u201d VA Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement.\n\nThe troubled EHR rollout has been a slow and challenging process for the agency. EHR vendor Cerner \u2014 later acquired by technology giant Oracle \u2014 first received the contract to replace the VA\u2019s aging medical record system in 2018.\n\nBut seven years later, only six medical centers have gone live with the new EHR. Meanwhile, the project has been plagued with patient safety risks and technical problems that frustrate providers.\n\nAnother challenge for the project is its unclear price tag. Cost projections range from the VA\u2019s 2019 estimate of about $16 billion to an independent evaluation of nearly $50 billion, Carol Harris, director for information technology and cybersecurity at the Government Accountability Office, told lawmakers at an oversight hearing last month.\n\nStill, neither estimate reflects the many changes to the rollout, including the pause in deployments, in recent years, she said.\n\nThe VA largely paused deployments of the EHR in April 2023, as part of an effort to improve system performance and get the project back on track.\n\nRepresentatives from the VA and Oracle have told lawmakers the system improved during the pause. Still, the EHR experienced an outage last week, disrupting access VA care sites for hours.\n\nSoon, Oracle and the VA will restart deployments. In December, the VA said it was beginning early-stage work to roll out the record to four Michigan facilities \u2014 VA Battle Creek Medical Center, VA Detroit Healthcare System, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System and VA Saginaw Healthcare System \u2014 in mid-2026.\n\nCollins, who was sworn in as head of the agency last month, promised to prioritize the rollout during a confirmation hearing.\n\nThe VA is facing other potential disruption under the Trump administration. The agency is planning a reorganization that would cut about 80,000 jobs, returning the VA to 2019 staffing levels.",

Investor enthusiasm has begun waning for semiconductor stocks due to tariff-driven volatility and the emergence of lower cost AI models from China\u2019s DeepSeek.

Dr. Rundquist was appointed as the Interim Provost in July of 2021. Dr. Kathleen Murray is Hamline\u2019s 21st president and took office in January 2024.\n\nThe proposal also eliminates the Creative Writing Programs\u2019 (CWP) Programs Coordinator, effective July 1, 2025. CWP includes both Hamline\u2019s graduate and undergraduate writing programs.\n\nBefore the CWP can be fully eliminated, however, Murray and Rundquist would need faculty approval. Without a coordinator, the CWP can\u2019t operate, which faculty say would shutter the program even without the necessary approval.\n\nMeghan Maloney-Vinz, Executive/Managing Editor of the Water~Stone Review, says that she has had to weather the threat of cuts to her position as Programs Coordinator throughout her 18-year tenure.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat has saved me every time is that a bigger fire starts somewhere else, and they forget about me. And I\u2019m just left up to my own devices, so I keep on going,\u201d Maloney-Vinz said. \u201cThis was the year where we were the fire.\u201d\n\nSubstantial staff support is necessary to continue CWP\u2019s far-reaching community events, and Maloney-Vinz organizes these efforts, handles all in and out-of-house communications for the MFA and BFA programs and oversees the weekly newsletter for the Arts, Media and Culture (AMC) unit at Hamline. She is also the first point of contact for contingent/adjunct faculty of the CWP department.\n\n\u201cI have been around the [CWP] building for over 20 years. I\u2019m sort of the archivist and the institutional memory of this place,\u201d Maloney-Vinz said.\n\nHamline has been eliminating staff positions for the past decade, leading to loss of institutional memory and institutional readiness. Other High Impact Practices (HIPs) that have been eliminated include Model UN, Mock Trial and massive cuts to the Global Engagement Center.\n\nWhat happens when a coordinator leaves?\n\nMaloney-Vinz is also the Editor-in-Chief of \u201cWater~Stone Review,\u201d a nationally recognized journal published annually by the MFA program, and the undergraduate journal \u201cRunestone.\u201d Along with her position, Water~Stone Review will be wholly defunded, effective July, despite carrying a 28-year-long history of literary excellence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a writer, especially in the Twin Cities community, who hasn\u2019t heard of or wanted to be published in \u2018Water~Stone Review,\u2019\u201d Maloney-Vinz said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pinnacle of our community.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Mariah Sletten, a new MFA student at Hamline, Water~Stone Review was a powerful incentive for enrollment in the program.\n\n\u201cIf they take \u201cWater~Stone\u201d away, they won\u2019t be fulfilling a promise that was made when I joined the program,\u201d Sletten said. \u201cBeing able to venture out into the world will have its impact as I gain new experiences that I wouldn\u2019t have been brave enough to have otherwise. [The MFA Program] is a holistic experience.\u201d\n\nInterim Provost Dr. Rundquist could not comment by press time.\n\nThe Administration\u2019s responses.\n\nAn automated email response to those who wrote to Interim Provost Dr. Rundquist in favor of the MFA program emphasized that no decision on its future had been made.\n\nHowever, Richard Pelster-Wiebe, the Director of CWP at Hamline, reiterates that terminating Maloney-Vinz\u2019s instrumental position is effectively killing the MFA program, no matter if the shared governance practices at Hamline are followed.\n\n\u201cWe may or may not win the bureaucratic process of saving the MFA, but all of it will have been moot if [Maloney-Vinz] is not given her position back,\u201d Richard Pelster-Wiebe said. \u201cWe need her to continue the program, or we need her to sunset the program. Unfortunately, [her position] is not something that we can advocate for through these processes.\u201d\n\nMurray and Rundquist have not attended a CWP-sponsored event, contends Richard Pelster-Wiebe and Angela Pelster-Wiebe, a CWP professor at Hamline.\n\n\u201cEvery event that we do, the attendance is incredible; it\u2019s having a cultural impact,\u201d Richard Pelster-Wiebe said. \u201cAll this time, looking back and looking forward, is being destroyed by two interim leaders in the last days of their leadership. It does not have to happen this way.\u201d\n\n\n\nLooking to the future \u2014 with uncertainty.\n\n\n\nThis coming July, Dr. Mayme Hostetter and Dr. Wesley Kisting will step into their roles as Hamline\u2019s 22nd president and as the newest provost, respectively.\n\nRichard Pelster-Wiebe says that the MFA program stands out for its multi-genre approach to creative writing and is ultimately rooted in the vibrant Twin Cities community.\n\n\u201cWhat is unequivocally unique about our program is the way in which we are community-centered,\u201d Richard Pelster-Wiebe said. \u201cThe life of a writer is not just solitary; it\u2019s also about living as an activist, an advocate, and a community member. And you will not find that in other programs.\u201d\n\nRichard Pelster-Wiebe also says that the collision between Hamline undergraduate and graduate students through CWP remains an irrevocable asset.\n\n\u201cIf that recruiting tool is gone, we\u2019re going to see BFA enrollment decline as well. The people to blame for that will be our interim leaders,\u201d Richard Pelster-Wiebe said.\n\nAngela Pelster-Wiebe says that in less than two years, the MFA program has doubled its incoming students, and there is reason to believe that that positive direction will continue.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come back with this renewed desire,\u201d said Angela Pelster-Wiebe. \u201cEvery university has to ask: are they willing to invest in the arts in order to give back to the community? And these administrators are saying, no, they\u2019re not willing to give back to the community in this way.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe recommendation to sunset the MFA program is yet another addition to the long list of program cuts that undermine Hamline\u2019s distinctiveness, including Mock Trial and the Model United Nations.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, is a time to support a program that is providing a place of refuge for our students in the community,\u201d said Richard Pelster-Wiebe. \u201c[The MFA program] is trying to speak articulately, creatively, and persuasively about how to challenge the huge issues that our world\u2019s facing right now.\u201d\n\nHamline\u2019s Creative Writing Programs urges anyone who strongly supports the MFA program to write their concerns to the Acting/Interim President, Interim Provost and Board of Trustees.",

Oracle\u2019s report comes as the cloud software provider joined a $500 billion joint venture with OpenAI and other tech firms to help build out AI infrastructure.\n\nCreative software leader Adobe is expected to follow Wednesday, with investors likely to be watching for signs its AI efforts are paying off, after reporting lower-than-expected revenue in the prior quarter and offering an underwhelming sales outlook.\n\nRetailers will also be in focus with several chains scheduled to report this week, including Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Kohl\u2019s, Ulta Beauty, Casey's General Stores, and Dollar General. The results come as market participants watch for the impact of shifting trade policies and waning consumer confidence.\n\nCoreWeave, a cloud computing company backed by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), could also go public as soon as this week, in what is expected to be one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years.",

On the earnings front, software giant Oracle is the biggest US company by market capitalisation scheduled to report quarterly results in the coming week.\n\nOracle Q3 results\n\nMonday 10 March\n\nOracle\u2019s shares have come under pressure recently, falling more than 20% since November\u2019s record high to current levels just above $150 as the AI trade has faltered. This makes the computer technology company\u2019s upcoming earnings report an important one. Analysts estimate that third-quarter earnings grew 5.9% to $1.49 a share as revenue increased 8.4% to $14.4bn. Looking ahead to Q4, analysts expect Oracle to guide earnings of $1.79 a share on revenue of $15.9bn. The options market is pricing in a roughly 8% move in the stock post-Q3 earnings.\n\nOptions positioning has turned somewhat bearish on the shares, which means hedging flows could push the stock higher after the results are released, potentially sending it back to $161. As for downside risk, a break below support at $150 could send the stock down to fill the gap near $143 that was created in September last year, a move that may be supported by negative momentum on the relative strength index (RSI), which has fallen to a reading of 35.\n\nOracle share price, May 2024 - present",

According to a Bloomberg report, the work to get that data center up and running will begin in months, with OpenAI and Oracle placing tens of thousands of powerful semiconductors into the facility about 150 miles west of Fort Worth. Specifically, Bloomberg reports through an anonymous source that 64,000 of Nvidia Corp.'s GB200 semiconductors will be added to the data center's hallways, with 16,000 going in first over the summer. The work is supposed to be finished by the end of 2026.\n\nThe Nvidia GB200 NVL72, a rack of powerful semiconductors, is displayed during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024.

Oracle, which reportedly will operate the supercomputer at the data center site, is already in the area and leasing a 200-megawatt (MW) facility in Abilene. The supercomputer at the new Abilene data center would be used to boost AI capabilities in the U.S. Trump has said the Stargate Project would create more than 100,000 U.S. jobs.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile Trump has endorsed the Stargate Project, billionaire Elon Musk has been doubtful about its future, publicly speaking out about an alleged lack of funding in January.

The disruption of the federal EHR system's function also extended to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nOn December 20, when the VA announced it would begin to plan for resuming EHR deployments in mid-2026, the agency noted that it had been more than 200 days since the last system outage.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government Accountability Office said on February 21 that while the VA's EHR Modernization Program had made incremental improvements to the system, much more remained to be done. The GAO said that 1,800 requested configuration changes were still outstanding.\n\nThen on February 24, Dr. Neil Evans, acting program executive director for the VA's EHR Modernization Integration Office, updated the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Technology Modernization about improvement efforts during the most recent pause on system deployment.\n\nThe VA's new EHR rollout has experienced numerous delays since the first component went live at the VA Central Ohio Healthcare System in Columbus, Ohio, in August 2020.\n\nSeema Verma, Oracle Health and Oracle Life Sciences executive vice president, joined Evans to provide lawmakers with an update. She said that during the latest reset period, the company completed more than 3,000 changes that improved system stability, added enhancements and streamlined certain functions.\n\nVerma also laid out plans to rapidly scale deployment of the EHR at the VA's remaining 164 healthcare facilities.\n\n\"Maintaining the current pace will take decades, which is not acceptable to anyone,\" she said.\n\nWe have reached out the VA and Oracle for statements about the new outage and will update this story if they are provided.\n\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\n\nEmail: afox@himss.org\n\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

            "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Oracle Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its third-quarter financial results, after the closing bell, on Monday, March 10.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $1.49 per share, up from $1.41 per share in the year-ago period. Oracle projects quarterly revenue of $14.4 billion, compared to $13.28 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn March 5, Guggenheim analyst John Difucci reiterated Oracle with a Buy and maintained a $220 price target.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Oracle, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Oracle offers an annual dividend yield of 1.06%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 40 cents per share ($1.60 a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $566,025 or around 3,750 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $113,205 or around 750 shares.\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.60 = 3,750 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.60 = 750 shares ($100 per month).\n\nView more earnings on ORCL\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nORCL Price Action: Shares of Oracle dipped 6.6% to close at $150.94 on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More:\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Affected VA medical facilities followed standard contingency procedures during the outage to ensure continuity of care for Veterans. Oracle Health is conducting a full root cause analysis to determine what triggered this outage.\"\n\nThe tech giant has not yet responded to our queries.\n\nMeanwhile, the VA has announced it is set to expand its rollout of Oracle health records software, which it acquired through the $28.3 billion Cerner buyout in June 2022.\n\nIn a statement, the VA said it plans to add nine additional medical facilities to the 2026 HER rollout plan, bringing the total to go live this year to 13. It intends to complete deployment of the EHR at all VA medical facilities as early as 2031, and said it would announce more details later this year.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins said: \"America's Veterans deserve a medical records system that's integrated across all VA and DOD components, and that is exactly what we will deliver. We can and will move faster on this important priority. But we're going to listen to our doctors, nurses and vendor partners along the way in order to ensure patient safety, quality and customer service.\"\n\nThe reboot of the project follows a two-and-a-half year hiatus after software implemented in Washington state led to computer errors that are estimated to have harmed 150 patients.

It's crucial software within the U.S. health-care system, and outages can cause serious disruptions to patient care.\n\nOracle is one of the largest EHR vendors thanks to it's $28 billion acquisition of medical records giant Cerner in 2022.\n\nThe company's federal EHR initially started experiencing issues at around 8:37 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, the VA said.

            "content": "The hot artificial intelligence (AI) sector caused many stocks to soar. Among these are veteran tech firm Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nOracle shares are up about 54% over the past 12 months through Feb. 26. Nvidia stock gained 70% over that time. Both are poised to rise higher since each company was chosen to participate in the U.S. government's Stargate program, which plans to invest half a trillion dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nBut if you had to choose just one of these AI success stories, which company makes for a superior long-term investment? Let's dive into Oracle and Nvidia to arrive at a verdict.\n\nA look at Oracle's AI success\n\nOracle has been a staple of the tech sector since its inception in 1977 with its database offerings. But the company's fortunes went into overdrive after the AI frenzy began in late 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT.\n\nFor example, Oracle's revenue rose 9% year over year to $14.1 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30, 2024. Its sales growth was due to the company's cloud computing business, which enjoyed a 24% year-over-year increase in Q2 revenue to $5.9 billion.\n\nWhat caused its cloud division to see explosive growth? Businesses building AI need computing infrastructure to train the software to correctly execute tasks and are leveraging Oracle's global footprint of data centers to do so.\n\nThe company's cloud infrastructure makes sense for training AI. Oracle's history with databases, where AI data is stored, coupled with fast, low-cost cloud services, make AI training on Oracle's platform a compelling proposition. Consequently, the firm has become one of the top five largest cloud providers in the world.\n\nThis has not only meant higher sales. Oracle's fiscal Q2 earnings per share (EPS) rose 24% year over year to $1.10, showing the company's AI success translated into gains for shareholders.\n\nOracle is capitalizing on its AI prosperity by expanding its footprint of more than 150 data centers. The greater the number of facilities it owns, the more customer business it can support, thereby increasing income. The firm's founder and CTO Larry Ellison sees the possibility of eventually operating thousands of data centers as the path to future revenue growth.\n\nReasons to consider Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. The firm reported record quarterly revenue for the last seven quarters. The latest was its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 26, where it made $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe reason for Nvidia's success is its products for data centers. The company provides components necessary for AI systems to process the vast amounts of data required by the software, such as for AI training. That's why Nvidia counts Oracle among its customers.\n\nBecause its products are critical for AI, Nvidia's Q4 sales to data centers grew a whopping 93% from a year ago to $35.6 billion. The company's strong performance translated into EPS of $0.89 in Q4, up 82% year over year.\n\nNvidia expects its sales success to continue thanks to the demand it's seeing for its new Blackwell computing platform, which was specifically designed for AI. As a result, the firm forecasted Q1 revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to come in around $43 billion. That's an impressive 65% increase from the prior year's Q1 sales of $26 billion.\n\nMaking the call between Oracle and Nvidia stocks\n\nThe strong financial performances Oracle and Nvidia are delivering, combined with customer demand for their products and services, mean choosing between the pair is a tough call.\n\nOne consideration is to look at their stock valuations using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on estimates for the next 12 months.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nNvidia's forward P/E multiple had been far higher than Oracle's, but plunged toward the end of January. The decline occurred after Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek shocked Wall Street on Jan. 27 with a reported lower-cost AI solution, prompting fears Nvidia's pricey products would see a drop in sales. This caused Nvidia's stock price to fall.\n\nNow, Nvidia's forward P/E is close to Oracle's, meaning neither possess a significant advantage over the other from a valuation perspective. But it does mean Nvidia shares have become more reasonably priced at the time of writing.\n\nThis, combined with its new Blackwell platform, make Nvidia a compelling AI stock to buy. According to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, Blackwell sales represented \"the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale.\"\n\nThe platform contributed $11 billion to Nvidia's $39.3 billion in Q4 revenue, and as a new product, Blackwell sales are just getting started. As a result, the company edges out Oracle as the better AI investment for the long term.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The data center, to be situated in Abilene, Texas, is expected to house 64,000 Nvidia GB200 microchips by the end of 2026.\n\nThe rollout will occur in phases, with an initial 16,000 Nvidia microchips expected to be in place this summer, according to multiple media reports. OpenAI and Oracle reportedly plan to operate a supercomputer at the site of the Texas data center.\n\nGood News for NVDA Shareholders\n\nNews that the data center will use thousands of Nvidia chips and processors is good news for the technology company and its shareholders. NVDA stock has been trending lower in recent weeks on concerns about demand for its chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and models.\n\nNews that Nvidia\u2019s chips will be used in the Texas data center comes more than a month after OpenAI, Oracle and Japan\u2019s SoftBank unveiled the Stargate project at a White House event. Nvidia\u2019s powerful GB200 microchips cost between $60,000 and $70,000 each. Based on the $65,000 midrange of this price, Oracle and OpenAI could spend $4.16 billion buying Nvidia GB200 chips.\n\nNVDA stock has risen 20% over the last 12 months.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock currently has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 42 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 39 Buy and three Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average NVDA price target of $177.41 implies 59.64% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on NVDA stock",

For example, tracking and accounting for the proper spending of grants that the university receives as a state-funded institution was a lengthy process. With automated billing, TWU saved 29 hours of work per month for that one process.\n\nOracle Cloud HCM helped the HR department automate hiring workflows. \u201cThere were a lot of paper processes and no visibility between departments for this paperwork,\u201d Trevino says.

Oracle Cloud HCM\u2019s automation allowed anyone who is part of the approval process to access the needed information. With this visibility, the finance and HR departments erased unnecessary steps in the hiring process, increased hiring efficiency, and eliminated the need for hundreds of paper documents that were difficult to track.\n\nAfter adopting Oracle Cloud HCM for all three campuses, the university moved from monthly paychecks to biweekly payments. \u201cFrom a recruiting perspective, when you're competing against other employers that pay weekly or biweekly, you're at a disadvantage,\u201d Tomlinson says.",

Every day I remain on guard in the #ask-the-question channel to provide answers and guidance for the greatest mysteries that DC fans across the world have to offer. Why do I do this? For the money? Some kind of brain disease? No, it\u2019s all because I love this world of superheroes and the people who love it. And every month, in seeking answers on your behalf, I unfailingly learn more myself. Here are just a few highlights of the many cases brought to my office over the past month.\n\n\n\nPopthebop101 asks:\n\n\n\nIn what issues are Cluemaster\u2019s game show origin mentioned? Because I\u2019ve been hearing about it, but I have no clue what issues or comics it\u2019s mentioned in.\n\nIn fairness to you, Pop, Cluemaster\u2019s origins are pretty easy to miss if you don\u2019t know where to look. As a villain, he already appears fully formed in 1966\u2019s Detective Comics #351. And in the modern era, where most of his appearances tend to be in the context of his daughter, Stephanie Brown, it rarely comes up at all.\n\nThe game show host angle actually comes from the small window in Post-Crisis continuity between Cluemaster\u2019s introduction and Stephanie\u2019s debut, during his tenure with the \u201cInjustice League\u201d in scattered issues of the \u201cJustice League International\u201d era. The backstory first comes up during a story in 1991\u2019s Justice League Quarterly #4. But we don\u2019t get to see what actually happened to Arthur Brown\u2019s game show hosting career for ourselves until more than twenty years later, in 2014\u2019s Batman Eternal #11.\n\n\n\nGarra asks:\n\nBarbara Gordon\u2019s transition from Batgirl to Oracle. What book does that happen in after The Killing Joke?\n\nWould you be surprised if I told you that the first time we see Barbara in her role as Oracle, it isn\u2019t even in a Batman comic? The identity of the world\u2019s most well-connected information broker actually began as a recurring mystery in John Ostrander\u2019s 1987 run on Suicide Squad, eventually revealed in 1990\u2019s Suicide Squad #38. How that transformation occurred, though, would only come to light six years later. We get the full story of how the former Batgirl reinvented herself in the deeply stirring \u201cOracle: Year One,\u201d a short story by Ostrander and his partner Kim Yale that picks up the pieces from The Killing Joke.\n\n\n\nZac asks:\n\nAre nonbinary people allowed to visit and live on Themyscira? Has this ever been explored in any comics?\n\nWhile recent Wonder Woman comics have made it clear that trans women are welcome on Themyscira, we\u2019ve yet to see any real source address the topic of other identities across the gender spectrum. I believe this is a worthy question that warrants exploring, though. So, for some perspective, I reached out to some of the leading authorities on Wonder Woman and the Amazons for their opinions.\n\nFormer Wonder Woman co-writer Michael Conrad told me that in his honest opinion, there were already nonbinary Amazons we just haven\u2019t seen on panel. Nubia and the Amazons co-writer Vita Ayala confirmed for me that their understanding was that the culture of Themyscira is not \u201cwomen only,\u201d so much as \u201cno men.\u201d Here\u2019s an answer I got from Kelly Sue DeConnick, who literally wrote the book on Amazon history, Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons.\n\nMy short answer is yes, but I still find myself bristling at the question like I bristle at \u2018who wins in X vs X fight.\u2019 I need to think on why. Something about the bloodlessness? Takes the stories out of the stories and reduces complexities to rules and stats.\n\nLike, do I imagine there is a rule book somewhere that says who can be an Amazon? I do not. And since I can only speak with authority on the world of Historia, remember that Hippolyta\u2014eventual Queen\u2014was told in no uncertain terms that she could not be an Amazon. No more than a bear can will itself a bird, or words to that effect. And yet.\n\nSo who can be an Amazon? Whomever needs to be. And when? When they remember who they are already.\n\nI want to be clear, I\u2019m not bristling at the reader asking the question either. Something about my own inability to make anything easy. If the reader asking is NB and wants permission to imagine themselves as an Amazon, please tell them they need no permission, but if it helps: permission granted.\n\nOn the other hand, if the person asking is looking to create some kind of headcanon where the 7th would turn away someone who needed their community, then Historia\u2019s Hippolyta would like to have a word.\n\n\n\nRod, Lord of the Dance asks:\n\nAre some of the international metahumans from Doomsday Clock new characters? There are some phenomenal deep pulls in there, but I can't find anything on the Blacksmith of Tehran, for instance.\n\nSome of them are, yes. Many of those new heroes are based on real world regional folklore. The Blacksmith of Tehran, for example, is based on an actual Iranian mythological figure dating back to the 10th century, whom writer Geoff Johns incorporated specifically for this feature. One of the intended themes of Doomsday Clock, like some of Johns\u2019 previous work, was bringing attention to an international community of superheroes where most of our focus has historically been on the United States. That gave Johns the opportunity to revisit some historical non-American heroes who have already been established, but also to create many more intended to draw from their own local cultures, just as American heroes are so often informed by American folklore.\n\n\n\nSeraph asks:\n\nI purchased and read New Teen Titans Annual #2 yesterday and one key detail stood out to me as odd. Is it ever explained why the Monitor is working with H.I.V.E. assassins to provide them with work such as the Anthony Scarapelli job at the center of the issue? It seems so out of place from what I'd read of him in the first few issues of Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nThe Monitor\u2019s intentions are indeed a mystery in his first appearances. In the two years leading up to Crisis, as Wolfman and P\u00e9rez were at work planning the event, the Monitor was making cryptic appearances like this one throughout DC\u2019s titles as a benefactor to various super-villains. Why? Because the heroes of the DC Universe were about to face the greatest threat to existence they had ever known. Upping the ante on behalf of their enemies was the Monitor\u2019s way of challenging our heroes to step up their game in preparation of the threat to come.\n\n\n\nPaul J Rabin asks:\n\nWho is the oldest character to have an on-screen adaptation?\n\nDC\u2019s oldest significant recurring character, mystic mystery man Doctor Occult (debuting in 1935\u2019s New Fun #6), makes a couple of small appearances in video games, including DC Universe Online and Scribblenauts Unmasked. But if we\u2019re talking specifically about film and television, then the crown goes to detective Slam Bradley\u2014one of the original protagonists of Detective Comics, from 1937\u2019s issue #1. Bradley makes an appearance in the 2008 animated film Justice League: The New Frontier and debuted in live action as played by Kurt Szarka in a first season episode of The CW\u2019s Batwoman, \u201cHow Queer Everything Is Today!\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s all the space we have this month for ASK\u2026THE QUESTION here on DC.com. I\u2019ll be back in thirty (give or take) with more. But until then, you can catch me at your leisure by lighting up the Q-Signal on our Discord server.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Trending News on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other top AI trending news on Wall Street.\n\nChina and the US have been at a crossroads over the past year over access to advanced chips and semiconductor equipment as technological rivalry heats up. While the US has been the most aggressive, it might have to rethink its export controls amid reports that Chinese buyers have found a way around them. Therefore, gaining access to its advanced artificial intelligence chips.\n\nIn order to limit China\u2019s access to semiconductors for training and powering cutting-edge artificial intelligence, Washington has enforced export controls since 2022. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration issued several directives and export controls that sought to stop China from acquiring the most cutting-edge chips. In the interest of national security, it also prevented China from obtaining sophisticated semiconductor equipment.\n\nHowever, according to the Wall Street Journal, a clandestine network of brokers has emerged and is increasingly circumventing the restrictions. The report indicates that Chinese buyers might have the upper hand on routing advanced chips through third parties. The report further indicates that six AI servers with restricted Hopper chips have been delivered to at least two Chinese universities in Shenzhen and Wuhan since December.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has already charged three men in a case that involves the sale of semiconductors that may violate US export laws. \u201cWe will not tolerate individuals and companies violating our laws or taking advantage of their association with Singapore to circumvent export controls of other countries,\u201d Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told a press briefing.\n\nAs it stands, the new administration under President Donald Trump faces an uphill task of finding ways to curb access to advanced technologies through third parties as the technological rivalry heats up. In a research note to investors, analysts at Jefferies reiterated that the US could tighten chip export controls, a development that could escalate the US-China tech war.\n\nThe analysts said that Trump has specifically instructed them to use export controls to close any gaps in existing regulations and guarantee and improve the U.S. technological edge. According to Jefferies, this sets the stage for the United States to impose more stringent export regulations on China.\n\nThe push for stringent and aggressive restrictions comes as China changes its approach from employing symbolic legal and regulatory changes to investing in advanced technologies. According to an analysis at the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), China is currently producing the majority of the fundamental research that may support future computer hardware. If those efforts become commercially viable, the US may soon be unable to use export restrictions to maintain its competitive edge in the design and manufacturing of high-performance microchips.\n\nBy doing this, Beijing is indicating that it has taken the time to assess its own economic advantages, disadvantages, and vulnerability to US sanctions and is now more assured of its ability to compete on an equal footing with the US. There are some distinctive features to China\u2019s strategy, such as the establishment of an economic early-warning system, even though some of it can be viewed as mimicking US export restrictions against Chinese tech firms.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds in Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a computer technology company that creates software and hardware products and offers services to help businesses manage data. It also integrates artificial intelligence capabilities into its cloud platform and various business applications, allowing companies to leverage AI for tasks like data analysis. The company unveiled new AI agent capabilities on March 3, focusing on providing real-time support to help subcontractors with payment applications.\n\nThe integrated AI agents should allow subcontractors to quickly check payment status, access required forms, and complete necessary documentation through simple text queries. In addition to offering contextualized answers, the system helps users with follow-up tasks like locating particular projects and finishing outstanding compliance paperwork. The implementation aligns with Oracle Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) overarching enterprise strategy of integrating functional AI capabilities into workflow applications.\n\n\u201cBy adding agentic AI capabilities, we are taking even more time and hassle out of the payment process, especially in that vital subcontractor \u2018draw weeks.\u2019 With the ability to get in-app, real-time assistance 24/7, we are helping our general contractor customers improve the relationships with their subcontractors while reducing costly support calls,\u201d said Mike Antis, global vice president of Textura.\n\nOverall, ORCL ranks 2nd on our list of top AI trending news on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Cyber-resilience dominates the latest Rubrik features, with a dozen new protection points in its latest rollout that it says will help detect, repel, and recover from cyberattacks.\n\nThe company is moving its protection product line across more environments, including the public cloud, SaaS and on-prem apps, and enhancing its ability to detect threats and verify user identities.\n\nArvind Nithrakashyap, Rubrik CTO and co-founder, stated: \u201cWe are seamlessly integrating new technologies across the world\u2019s major cloud platforms, SaaS offerings, and on-premises so our customers can better detect compromised data, enhance the speed of identifying affected data, and accelerate the discovery of clean entry points.\u201d\n\nThe new capabilities in the public cloud include:\n\nCloud Posture Risk Management (CPR), which automatically discovers and inventories cloud data assets, identifying unprotected or sensitive data en route.\n\nOracle Cloud Protection: Rubrik Security Cloud (RSC) will support data protection for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) beginning with Oracle databases and Oracle Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS).\n\nAzure DevOps and GitHub Backup: Rubrik now protects Azure DevOps and GitHub with automated backups, granular recovery, extended retention, and compliance coverage.\n\nRubrik Cloud Vault (RCV) for AWS provides a secure off-site archival location, with flexible policies and/or regions, and immutable, isolated, logically air-gapped off-site backups, role-based access controls, encryption, and retention locks.\n\nThe SaaS area has two items, enhanced protection for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Sandbox Seeding for Salesforce, which is planned for later this year. Users can select objects and records depending on specific criteria to prevent seeding errors by analyzing data selection size versus destination size availability before moving data to the sandbox environment. Users will be able to save queries for future repetitive use.\n\nThe on-prem world gets Identity Recovery across Entra ID and Active Directory (AD). It includes orchestrated Active Directory Forest Recovery to restore entire identity environments without reintroducing malware or misconfigurations.\n\nRubrik now protects PostgreSQL with data backup, availability, and recoverability. It has also added Red Hat OpenShift support with automated, and immutable backups and fast recovery.\n\nThe company has extended its anti-malware functionality:\n\nNew security features for Azure and AWS, which use machine learning and automation, include Anomaly Detection, Data Discovery, and Classification, and soon, Threat Hunting and Threat Monitoring. They are all designed to work together \u201cto proactively detect and mitigate cyber threats, accelerate recovery, and ensure sensitive data remains protected and compliant.\u201d\n\nRubrik is planning to extend its Orchestrated Recovery capabilities to the cloud beginning with Azure VM and featuring automated recovery sequences, regular test recovery scheduling, and recovery reports to reduce human error.\n\nTurbo Threat Hunting scans at scale by using pre-computed hashes in Rubrik\u2019s metadata, with no need for file-by-file scanning. It claims clean recovery points can be found in seconds. Testing found Turbo Threat Hunting scans 75,000 backups in up to 60 seconds.\n\nEnterprise Edition for Microsoft 365 is covered with Sensitive Data Discovery, to identify and protect high-risk data before an attack happens, and Prioritized Recovery, which restores critical data first. Coming soon are Anomaly Detection, Threat Monitoring, Threat Hunting, and Self-Service Recovery capabilities.\n\nNithrakashyap says: \u201cCybercriminals won\u2019t stop innovating, and neither will we. Our utmost priority is the security, safety, and appropriate accessibility of our customers\u2019 data, regardless of where the data lives.\u201d\n\nAs long as cybercriminals invent new methods and attacks, Rubrik can respond with new features to keep its subscription-paying customers feeling safe and ready to repel attacks.\n\nBootnote\n\nRubrik itself suffered a security intrusion last month. A February note by Nithrakashyap says the company \u201crecently discovered anomalous activity on a server that contained log files.\u201d It took the server offline. \u201cAn unauthorized actor accessed a small number of log files, most of which contained non-sensitive information. One file contained some limited access information \u2026 We have rotated keys to mitigate any residual risk, even though we found no evidence that access information was misused.\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes that \u201cafter a detailed analysis with the third party partner, we have found no evidence of unauthorized access to any data we secure on behalf of our customers or our internal code.\u201d",

The launch window will open at 5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nIn our first Flight 8 update, we reported that SpaceX has backup launch windows until 6th March. However, since this is the new NET date now, SpaceX must have set up backup windows in case of a flight delay for any reason.\n\nElon Musk said that the Flight 8 Starship would be destacked to inspect the issues it faced just seconds before liftoff on Monday. SpaceX not utilizing today\u2019s launch window is a sign that the SpaceX engineering staff is not 100% confident in launching it today.\n\nAs of this writing, the stacking of the Flight 8 Starship is in progress. The hot-staging ring has been installed on the Super Heavy booster and the Starship upper stage is close to being mounted on it.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nFlight 8 Starship getting stacked again on Wednesday 5th March after getting scrubbed on Monday at the SpaceX Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.

Despite these innovations, Oracle's share price declined by 4.67% over the past week, a larger drop than the 2.5% overall market downturn. This decline coincided with heightened market volatility prompted by new U.S. tariffs, which affected many technology and financial stocks. These tariffs have resulted in widespread investor concern regarding inflationary pressures and potential impacts on global trade, likely overshadowing Oracle's positive product announcements. The broader market decline, sparked by economic uncertainty and shifts in trade policies, has had a significant impact on tech stocks, including Oracle. While the company's recent strategic initiatives indicate promising developments, the immediate investor focus appears to have been shifted by the broader economic developments and their potential long-term implications.\n\nGet an in-depth perspective on Oracle's performance by reading our analysis here.\n\nNYSE:ORCL Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, Oracle's total shareholder return, including share price gains and dividends, was an impressive 279.64%. This substantial increase reflects Oracle's robust growth and strategic initiatives that have enhanced shareholder value. Although its earnings growth over the past year at 14.7% did not outpace the broader software industry's 28.2%, Oracle's longer-term performance has been strong relative to the industry's recent performance. Despite some volatility, Oracle outperformed both the US market and the US Software industry in the one-year period leading up to today.\n\nSeveral key developments have contributed to Oracle's performance. In recent years, Oracle has consistently increased its quarterly dividends, benefiting long-term shareholders. Strategic partnerships, such as collaborations with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Google Cloud, have expanded its service capabilities and market presence. Furthermore, expansions like new Oracle Cloud regions and innovations like AI capabilities in its services have strengthened Oracle's competitive position, supporting its overall return on investment.",

Therefore, the expansion of Rubrik\u2019s portfolio should better protect organizations from cyber attacks, regardless of where their data resides.\n\nAccording to Rubrik, identity is currently one of the most critical vulnerabilities, and it is not alone with that statement. The majority of cyber attacks worldwide use compromised login credentials, with 50 percent of companies experiencing an Active Directory attack in the past two years. Identity Recovery should help organizations better protect their hybrid identity environments.\n\nIdentity Recovery answers threat pattern\n\nRubrik Security Cloud will gradually expand to cover parts of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This will commence with protection for Oracle Cloud VMware workloads and self-managed Oracle DB workloads running OCI VMs. OpenShift will also receive support, with the intention of providing protection for the 60% of organizations running Kubernetes that often opt for Red Hat\u2019s solution.\n\nAnother recent announcement is the availability of Rubrik Cloud Vault (RCV) for AWS. This service, previously available only for Azure, provides organizations with a secure, isolated storage location for their backups. On Azure itself, Rubrik now also protects Azure DevOps and GitHub with automated backups, granular recovery, extended retention and compliance coverage for critical data stores.\n\nAs usual, the company uses AI functionality to detect threats. This not only increases the complexity of threats that can be detected, but also works at lightning speed. For example, the company is introducing Turbo Threat Hunting, which, according to internal tests, can scan up to 75,000 backups within 60 seconds.\n\nThe new features will be demonstrated at Rubrik\u2019s annual Cyber Resilience Summit on March 5.",

            "content": "The hot artificial intelligence (AI) sector caused many stocks to soar. Among these are veteran tech firm Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) and semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%).\n\nOracle shares are up about 54% over the past 12 months through Feb. 26. Nvidia stock gained 70% over that time. Both are poised to rise higher since each company was chosen to participate in the U.S. government's Stargate program, which plans to invest half a trillion dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nBut if you had to choose just one of these AI success stories, which company makes for a superior long-term investment? Let's dive into Oracle and Nvidia to arrive at a verdict.\n\nA look at Oracle's AI success\n\nOracle has been a staple of the tech sector since its inception in 1977 with its database offerings. But the company's fortunes went into overdrive after the AI frenzy began in late 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT.\n\nFor example, Oracle's revenue rose 9% year over year to $14.1 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30, 2024. Its sales growth was due to the company's cloud computing business, which enjoyed a 24% year-over-year increase in Q2 revenue to $5.9 billion.\n\nWhat caused its cloud division to see explosive growth? Businesses building AI need computing infrastructure to train the software to correctly execute tasks and are leveraging Oracle's global footprint of data centers to do so.\n\nThe company's cloud infrastructure makes sense for training AI. Oracle's history with databases, where AI data is stored, coupled with fast, low-cost cloud services, make AI training on Oracle's platform a compelling proposition. Consequently, the firm has become one of the top five largest cloud providers in the world.\n\nThis has not only meant higher sales. Oracle's fiscal Q2 earnings per share (EPS) rose 24% year over year to $1.10, showing the company's AI success translated into gains for shareholders.\n\nOracle is capitalizing on its AI prosperity by expanding its footprint of more than 150 data centers. The greater the number of facilities it owns, the more customer business it can support, thereby increasing income. The firm's founder and CTO Larry Ellison sees the possibility of eventually operating thousands of data centers as the path to future revenue growth.\n\nReasons to consider Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. The firm reported record quarterly revenue for the last seven quarters. The latest was its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 26, where it made $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe reason for Nvidia's success is its products for data centers. The company provides components necessary for AI systems to process the vast amounts of data required by the software, such as for AI training. That's why Nvidia counts Oracle among its customers.\n\nBecause its products are critical for AI, Nvidia's Q4 sales to data centers grew a whopping 93% from a year ago to $35.6 billion. The company's strong performance translated into EPS of $0.89 in Q4, up 82% year over year.\n\nNvidia expects its sales success to continue thanks to the demand it's seeing for its new Blackwell computing platform, which was specifically designed for AI. As a result, the firm forecasted Q1 revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to come in around $43 billion. That's an impressive 65% increase from the prior year's Q1 sales of $26 billion.\n\nMaking the call between Oracle and Nvidia stocks\n\nThe strong financial performances Oracle and Nvidia are delivering, combined with customer demand for their products and services, mean choosing between the pair is a tough call.\n\nOne consideration is to look at their stock valuations using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This metric tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on estimates for the next 12 months.\n\nNvidia's forward P/E multiple had been far higher than Oracle's, but plunged toward the end of January. The decline occurred after Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek shocked Wall Street on Jan. 27 with a reported lower-cost AI solution, prompting fears Nvidia's pricey products would see a drop in sales. This caused Nvidia's stock price to fall.\n\nNow, Nvidia's forward P/E is close to Oracle's, meaning neither possess a significant advantage over the other from a valuation perspective. But it does mean Nvidia shares have become more reasonably priced at the time of writing.\n\nThis, combined with its new Blackwell platform, make Nvidia a compelling AI stock to buy. According to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, Blackwell sales represented \"the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale.\"\n\nThe platform contributed $11 billion to Nvidia's $39.3 billion in Q4 revenue, and as a new product, Blackwell sales are just getting started. As a result, the company edges out Oracle as the better AI investment for the long term.",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL) stock rallied on excitement about its role in the $100 billion Stargate AI project, before the emergence of DeepSeek's cheaper algorithm caused investors to question that type of big spending. Now with Oracle's fiscal third-quarter results expected next week, analysts are debating whether the report can help the stock break out of its slump.\n\nMonness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White upgraded Oracle stock to neutral from a sell call in a client note Monday.\n\n\"In our view, Oracle represents a high quality company with the opportunity to participate in a cloud transformation and benefit from the gen AI trend,\" White wrote. \"However, valuation is stretched, capex spending unsustainable, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said Q3 is a \"seasonally small\" quarter but shares could react positively if Oracle's guidance is strong and the company provides positive commentary on the Stargate project. He reiterated an outperform call for Oracle stock in a client note Monday.\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle is down about 1% at 164.89 in recent action. Shares are down 1% on the year after rallying nearly 60% in 2024, Oracle stock's best year since 1999.\n\nOracle Stock: DeepSeek Blues\n\nWhite described Oracle stock's rocky recent trading as the \"euphoria of Stargate\" giving way to \"DeepSeek blues.\"\n\nOracle stock surged nearly 15% on news that it would join OpenAI and SoftBank as initial funders of a $100 billion Stargate AI investment plan, which was touted in a press conference by President Donald Trump on Jan. 22. The spending could reach $500 billion long-term, according to the announcement.\n\nBut less than a week after the White House press conference, AI stocks sank after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a high-performing large language model for what it said was a significantly lower cost than industry leaders such as OpenAI. Oracle stock lost 14% within a broader market sell-off on Jan. 27.\n\nAfter an up-and-down February, Oracle stock is more than 10% below the highs it reached after the Stargate project and even further from a 198.31 all-time high from early December.\n\nOracle Earnings Preview: Seeking Stargate Updates\n\nOverall, analysts expect Oracle will post adjusted earnings growth of 11% to $1.49 per share for the February-ended quarter, according to FactSet. Sales are seen rising 8% to $14.4 billion.\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue growth helped power its strong 2024. The database software giant is pushing to becoming a cloud alternative to the \"big three\" of Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nThe business will remain in focus for investors with this report. Barclays' Lenschow projects Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue will rise 53% year over year for the quarter, a slight acceleration from 52% growth in the November-ended quarter.\n\nBut Lenschow said investors are likely to focus on commentary around longer-term AI demand.\n\n\"The big unknown for the Q3 results is around Oracle's Stargate opportunity as this has the potential to have a meaningful impact on the company and with that, trump any noise from the quarterly numbers,\" Lenschow wrote. \"With $500 billion in planned investments (over the coming four years) for the Stargate Project and Oracle earmarked to build and operate the computing system together with OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA), we could see management discuss numbers that will simply change the Oracle AI story once again.\"\n\nOracle Stock In Consolidation Pattern\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle stock has formed a consolidation pattern with a buy point of 198.31, according to MarketSurge pattern recognition.\n\nOracle stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. Further, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle's IBD Relative Strength Rating is 88 out of 99. The RS Rating means that Oracle has outperformed 88% of all stocks over the past 12 months.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIPO Market Slump Drags On As Unicorns Multiply.

It also can standardize and cleanse public data sources such as the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Census Bureau, and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for further intelligence.\n\nThe solution is built on the security, performance, and scalability of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and takes advantage of a number of OCI services. For example, Data Exchange natively synchronizes with OCI Integration Services to connect any application and data source for automated end-to-end processes, centralized management, and simplified migration to the cloud.\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange also leverages the built-in AI Vector Search and in-database machine learning capabilities of Oracle Database 23ai to help eliminate the complexity and cost of integrating and managing multiple databases. This helps maintain data consistency across areas such as smart meters, distribution assets, and utility grids. Unique, language-based semantic representations also make it easy to create embeddings for data, feed GenAI engines, and enhance applications such as smart chatbots.\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange is ideal for IT teams, consultants, integration specialists, and solution architects who have been tasked with integrating multiple data sources across an enterprise. The solution makes it easier to manage data quality across sources, enable smooth integration between disparate systems, and address inconsistencies and information misalignments. This helps lead to faster integrations, fewer errors during data migration or system updates, and enhanced solution performance for higher client satisfaction. Oracle plans to expand the solution to include a data sharing framework, enabling secure and efficient sharing of validated data across teams and external partners.\n\nSee Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange in action at Oracle Customer Edge Summit or learn more at Oracle.com/utilities or LinkedIn.\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

            "content": "Entering Ramadan at a predominantly white institution comes with challenges that many of my peers don\u2019t realize exist. While fasting from sunrise to sunset is often the most visible aspect of Ramadan, it is far from the only one. Ramadan is about change, discipline, prayer, community and reflection.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is constantly having to explain what Ramadan is, why I\u2019m not eating, and yes \u2014 \u201cnot even water.\u201d The question itself isn\u2019t offensive, but hearing it over and over, sometimes from the same people, gets exhausting. There is an expectation that I should always be willing to educate others, but the reality is that I just want to go about my day without having to explain myself.\n\nEven the most well-meaning comments can be frustrating. People will tell me, \u201cI could never do that,\u201d or act as if fasting is some kind of extreme hardship rather than an act of devotion that millions of people observe every year. While I appreciate curiosity, it can be isolating to feel like a spectacle rather than a student just trying to get through a long day of classes like everyone else.\n\nBeyond the social aspects, the physical campus itself isn\u2019t always accommodating. The university has one designated prayer room, but it isn\u2019t always accessible, especially for students with back-to-back classes in buildings on the opposite side of campus. Many of us end up praying in empty classrooms, halls, or wherever we can find a quiet space. At a school that prides itself on diversity and inclusion, this is a simple yet important change that could make a real difference.\n\nMicroaggressions don\u2019t stop during Ramadan either. If anything, they seem to increase. Wearing clothing like an abaya, during Ramadan or not, sometimes invites stares or unsolicited comments. I\u2019ve had people tell me I look \u201cso fancy\u201d or \u201cso different today,\u201d as if any other clothing I wear isn\u2019t just another expression of myself. Fasting also seems to bring out strange remarks. People commenting on how \"miserable\" I must be, or worse, making jokes about eating in front of me as if it\u2019s some great challenge to my willpower. These interactions are not new to me. They have followed me through high school and now into college. At a certain point, it is not just about curiosity \u2014 it is about how little effort people put into understanding the world beyond their own experiences.\n\nDespite all of this, Ramadan remains a grounding force. It is something important to me and a month I look forward to each year. I will always continue to practice my faith, even in spaces where it sometimes feels invisible. Accommodations like additional prayer spaces, and better cultural awareness wouldn\u2019t just make Ramadan easier for Muslim students \u2014 they would signal that diversity here goes beyond numbers and actually translates into meaningful inclusion.\n\nAt the end of the day, people need to recognize that I, and many others, exist \u2014 and that our experiences, needs, culture, religion and traditions matter just as much as anyone else\u2019s.\n\nStory continues below advertisement",

            "content": "Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange standardizes disparate information into logical formats to help speed advanced AI use cases and data sharing\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn., March 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle Customer Edge Summit -- Oracle today announced Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange, a new cloud-based solution designed to streamline data integration, sharing, and preparation for AI use cases. Applying an intelligent semantic layer, the offering translates complex raw enterprise and third-party information into a standardized industry model with natural language meaning for easier interpretation and action. This often overlooked, but critical, data preparation step helps ensure that information is not only accessible but also meaningfully contextualized for analytics and AI-driven insights. With the Data Exchange, cloud developers, data scientists, and analysts can significantly fast-track priority projects, including data mining, predictive analytics, and cutting-edge generative AI (GenAI) applications.\n\n\"Utilities are under increasing pressure to accelerate digital transformation, however, many struggle with fragmented, siloed, and inconsistently labeled data spread across multiple sources. This makes it difficult to unify information and use effectively to innovate and improve utility operations,\" said Hillary Martin, vice president of analytics and innovation, Oracle Infrastructure. \"By cleansing, organizing, and adding the appropriate meaning to an organization's data, Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange makes data easier to find, understand, and leverage for AI and advanced analytics use cases that can transform raw data into actionable insights.\"\n\nPreparing data for action\n\nMany utilities have invested in industry solutions that promise to centralize and unlock the value of data only to be stifled by inconsistent, hard-to-find, and unstructured data. Unlike other solutions, Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange addresses these foundational problems by focusing on data quality and meaning. Through a series of validation checks, error reporting, cleansing, deduplication, and synchronization processes, the offering helps ensure that data is accurate, easy-to-understand, and ready for analysis, replication, or AI application use.\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange features an industry data model that unifies multiple standards\u2014including IEEE and IEC\u2014which helps ensure that when data is ready for production, it can be securely shared across partners to streamline integration, enhance interoperability, and drive operational efficiency. With this clean, validated data, utilities can expedite analytics-based decisions and priority use cases, such as connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to grid and customer devices to provide a comprehensive view of grid conditions across EV charging locations in a specific area.\n\nAI-ready data\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange is focused on unifying data from Oracle and other third-party industry applications. It also can standardize and cleanse public data sources such as the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Census Bureau, and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for further intelligence.\n\nThe solution is built on the security, performance, and scalability of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and takes advantage of a number of OCI services. For example, Data Exchange natively synchronizes with OCI Integration Services to connect any application and data source for automated end-to-end processes, centralized management, and simplified migration to the cloud.\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange also leverages the built-in AI Vector Search and in-database machine learning capabilities of Oracle Database 23ai to help eliminate the complexity and cost of integrating and managing multiple databases. This helps maintain data consistency across areas such as smart meters, distribution assets, and utility grids. Unique, language-based semantic representations also make it easy to create embeddings for data, feed GenAI engines, and enhance applications such as smart chatbots.\n\nOracle Energy and Water Data Exchange is ideal for IT teams, consultants, integration specialists, and solution architects who have been tasked with integrating multiple data sources across an enterprise. The solution makes it easier to manage data quality across sources, enable smooth integration between disparate systems, and address inconsistencies and information misalignments. This helps lead to faster integrations, fewer errors during data migration or system updates, and enhanced solution performance for higher client satisfaction. Oracle plans to expand the solution to include a data sharing framework, enabling secure and efficient sharing of validated data across teams and external partners.\n\nSee Oracle Energy and Water Data Exchange in action at Oracle Customer Edge Summit or learn more at Oracle.com/utilities or LinkedIn.\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

            "content": "In this exclusive interview, Andrew De La Torre, Group Vice President at Oracle Communications, shares key trends shaping the industry. From AI-powered automation to new 5G monetization strategies, businesses are embracing cutting-edge solutions to enhance customer experiences and drive growth. Oracle\u2019s focus on open industry standards and end-to-end automation is helping service providers and enterprises simplify IT complexity and unlock new revenue streams.\n\nThis year, Oracle highlights the power of AI and real-time communications. From mission-critical enterprise solutions to AI-driven voice network transformation, these innovations are redefining connectivity across industries. With strategic partnerships, including AT&T, Vodafone, and Starlink, Oracle continues to enable seamless, intelligent communications that accelerate digital transformation.\n\nBy leveraging AI-native capabilities and cloud-based solutions, Oracle is empowering businesses to innovate faster, enhance customer engagement, and streamline operations. With a strong emphasis on industry collaboration and emerging technologies, Oracle is shaping the next era of communications.\n\n\n\nAlejandro Pi\u00f1ero:\n\nAll right, Andrew, here we are once again at MWC. Now, last year you talked about enabling new business models and B2B revenue. What's new this year? What can we look forward to hearing from you guys?\n\nAndrew De La Torre:\n\nYeah, I mean, we've had a pretty consistent theme of maybe probably three topics over the last few years. One was really around industrializing the deployment of cloud native. The second one was around the whole kind of API ecosystem, and thirdly, around automation. Now, what's really different this year is that there is a big fixation around AI, particularly in the application of the automation solutions. We're also seeing a real doubling down on the whole next generation opportunities in the carrier industry, the evolutions of the business models, and that's putting a lot of attention into the enterprise space as well from a communications solutions perspective. Then, finally, I think big themes are around customer experience, customer engagement, and IT is starting to come back. 5G has been really consuming at the moment, but IT simplification and kind of having really integrated solutions is the top theme right now.\n\nAlejandro Pi\u00f1ero:\n\nGreat, and in terms of MWC '25, what are your key messages? You've hinted on some of those. What are you talking about?\n\nAndrew De La Torre:\n\nYeah, I mean, look, we've got some really cool stuff that we're going to be talking about here. There's Oracle. I think one of the themes you're going to see is how we're bringing Oracle and Oracle Communications much more to the front. There's a lot of work we've been doing around bringing our cloud technologies and particularly our AI capabilities into the product, so lots of things around Vision AI, around speech translation, sentiment activities. That's pervasive across all of the products that we're going to be talking about, be that in the network space where we have our 5G offerings, be it in the IT space where we've got automation solutions, we've got billing, we've got our digital BSS solution, or in enterprise applications. That's a really cool area where we've been doing a lot of work.\n\nAlejandro Pi\u00f1ero:\n\nExcellent, so Andrew, we're here. The show is starting tomorrow, but why don't you give us a bit of a preview as to what folks will be seeing on your stand?\n\nAndrew De La Torre:\n\nAll right. Well, listen, why don't we start with enterprise applications? If I take you over here, I guess here's wow factor number one, which is what a cool car. This is really sort of around a lot of the work we've been doing in the public safety space. What the users can actually expect when they come to see Oracle is we're going to actually be running some demos, which you can see here in the background. Our first one is going to be around the enterprise applications. We've been developing public safety is a big one, but actually we've also been looking at areas of healthcare. We've been looking at food and beverage, and so we'll be able to take people through the work we've been doing there, which is really about communications-enabled enterprise capabilities.\n\nThe second thing that we're doing is we're looking at how we can bring voice together with the AI systems that we now have as Oracle. This is doing a lot from a CX perspective and from a transformation around particularly the call center and be it efficiencies or be it better customer experience. Then, the final thing is, as I said, this new focus that we're seeing on the IT space and the transformation programs. We have to make sure that all of these new opportunities actually are things that can be monetized and can be implemented in the networks. This new digital BSS solution that we announced just last June, this is really bringing that together and it's, again, bringing AI and integrated capabilities into the fore to really be a game changer, so lots of good stuff to see here.\n\nAlejandro Pi\u00f1ero:\n\nExcellent. Well, Andrew, look forward to seeing it all in action.\n\nAndrew De La Torre:\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nAlejandro Pi\u00f1ero:\n\nHave a great show.\n\nAndrew De La Torre:\n\nThank you so much. Great to see you.",

            "content": "According to the Zhitong Finance APP, Warren Buffett, known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" has created returns for long-term shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A.US)(BRK.B.US) that could change their fortunes. Even after sixty years, this tireless \"Omaha prophet\" continues to generate excess returns for shareholders of this $1.1 trillion investment empire. With a holding size of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds larger than that of the Federal Reserve, along with record cash and cash equivalents reserves, and a stock portfolio with a strong risk-averse character, the \"Oracle\" successfully avoided the continuous decline of U.S. stocks since February and achieved significant excess returns through his risk-averse portfolio and reserves of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nBuffett continues to advocate the \"cash is king\" strategy with practical actions, as Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have reached a historic high again. The world's most famous stock investor has shown an immense preference for cash since 2024, interpreted by the market as a bet that the U.S. economy and U.S. stocks will face turmoil. It has proven that the \"Oracle\" indeed has foresight; at the beginning of 2025, the shadow of \"stagflation\" loomed over the U.S. economy, causing the S&P 500 index to underperform most emerging markets and European stock indices this year, while the Nasdaq 100 index has given back all its gains for the year.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's latest financial report shows that the insurance profits in the fourth quarter surged, driving operating profits up by 71%. While continuing to reduce stock holdings, cash reserves reached a record $334.2 billion, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of growth. Notably, cash now accounts for 29% of total assets, a new high in decades.\n\nBuffett's shareholder letter states that he significantly increased the holdings of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds in 2024, and most of the aforementioned cash reserves likely belong to the short-term U.S. Treasury bond portfolio, which has seen a foreseeable substantial increase in investment returns. In terms of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds (i.e., those with a maturity of one year or less), Berkshire has continuously expanded its holdings of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds since 2024, with a holding size much larger than that of the Federal Reserve's short-term U.S. Treasury bond holdings. Moreover, since the beginning of this year, the massive returns from the soaring short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, driven by bond price spreads and interest, may rival the returns from Buffett's stock investment portfolio.\n\nShort-term, highly liquid financial instruments, such as short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity of one year or less, commercial paper, and bank deposits, are often viewed by the investment community as cash equivalents that can be quickly liquidated due to their high liquidity, extremely low risk, and price stability, meeting investors' needs for immediate redemption.\n\nLooking ahead, the term \"high volatility\" is likely to be a keyword in the stock market during the Trump 2.0 era. If one wishes to dance with the legendary investment master while attempting to avoid the severe declines brought about by high volatility, the following three \"hedging stocks\" from Berkshire are worth paying attention to: Visa (V.US), Coca-Cola (KO.US), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY.US) Compared to the frequently reduced holdings in American banks and Apple by Warren Buffett, the positions of these three companies have remained \"steadfast\" for a long time.\n\nOne cannot help but admire Buffett's almost \"prophetic\" investment vision and extremely sensitive capital instincts. The short-term U.S. Treasury bonds heavily held by Buffett, along with the aforementioned three stocks, significantly outperformed the global stock market benchmark index during the recent turmoil in the global stock market, and their comprehensive performance this year has greatly surpassed the so-called \"tech stock barometer\" \u2014 the Nasdaq 100 index, which has been in a continuous decline since February, highlighting the \"hedging investment value\" of achieving excess returns amid a stock market crash.\n\nDue to Trump's insistence on imposing tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, the global stock market has experienced severe downturns, and concerns about broader future tariffs have intensified. The \"momentum trading\" driven by animal spirits was completely reversed last Thursday, with the technology and communication services sectors that led the way in 2023-2024 becoming the worst-performing sectors in 2025. Meanwhile, traditional defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples surged overnight. Visa, Coca-Cola, and Occidental Petroleum remained strong and closed higher last Thursday amid declines in the three major U.S. stock indices.\n\nVisa: The global digital payment artery, with steady performance growth over the long term, is known as an \"invisible cash printing machine.\"\n\nThis well-deserved fintech giant, although only accounting for 1% of Berkshire's nearly $300 billion stock portfolio, has demonstrated astonishing investment return capabilities, with Visa's stock price rising by 15% this year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index.\n\nVisa's exclusive digital payment network covers over 200 countries and regions, connecting 4.7 billion debit and credit card bank accounts with up to 150 million merchants worldwide, processing an astonishing 31 billion transactions in 2024, totaling nearly $16 trillion.\n\nAs the digital \"artery\" of global economic transactions, its meager transaction fees accumulate to an annual net profit of $19.7 billion (for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024). Visa's solid position as a fast and secure payment service provider allows it to benefit from the long-term growth of the global economy. According to analysts' general expectations, double-digit revenue and net profit growth in the coming years will support its 17-year dividend growth legend and the profit growth pace that can be described as an \"invisible cash printing machine.\"\n\nCoca-Cola: The \"liquid gold\" with 63 years of dividend growth.\n\nCoca-Cola, in which Buffett has held shares for over 30 years, is not only synonymous with carbonated beverage brands but also encompasses a full range of beverage empire including bottled water, dairy products, coffee, and juice. With its global beverage distribution network and incredibly strong brand appeal, this global beverage leader has continuously transformed company profits into new product innovations and shareholder returns, having a Coca-Cola holding worth $28 billion for Berkshire. With the growth potential in both domestic and international markets, this holding still has appreciation potential.\n\nFor over thirty years, Coca-Cola has been one of the core holdings in Buffett's Berkshire. Given the substantial potential for growth in both the U.S. and international markets, Berkshire Hathaway's $28 billion stake in this global beverage leader may further appreciate in the coming years, which is why Buffett has not made any reductions in his holdings for a long time\n\nOccidental Petroleum: A Dual-Track Maverick in Traditional Energy and Carbon Capture\n\nAs a new favorite of Buffett, Occidental Petroleum has recently seen Berkshire Hathaway significantly increase its holdings, bringing Berkshire's stake close to $13 billion. This energy company, which controls high-quality oil wells in the U.S. Permian Basin, not only occupies an important position in the crude oil extraction market due to its scale and infrastructure advantages, but also possesses expertise in enhanced oil recovery techniques that utilize carbon dioxide to improve production efficiency, giving it an edge over competitors. It completely crushes small and medium-sized crude oil market rivals and, under the leadership of CEO Vicki Hollub, is positioning itself in the trillion-dollar carbon capture market\u2014having already established carbon management partnerships with Microsoft and AT&T, with plans to build a thousand carbon storage facilities globally. This dual-engine model of \"traditional energy cash flow + emerging decarbonization business\" is reshaping the logic of energy investment",

Each image is scanned from the catalog and contains only one oracle bone character. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we can see that the OBC306 dataset is class imbalanced. The most numerous class contains over twenty thousand images, while the least represented class has only one image. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the size of each image varies. To make the image size uniform, bilinear interpolation is employed to uniformly resize all images to 128 \u00d7 128 pixels as depicted in Fig. 4b. Finally, we reprocess the dataset to obtain three new sub-datasets for the balanced (OBIR-10, OBIR-100) and imbalanced (OBIR-ID) tasks.\n\nFig. 4: Process of resizing and generating OBIR samples. a Original OBIR image. b Standardize OBIR image with bilinear interpolation. c Generated OBIR samples by GAN. Full size image\n\nOBIR-10: For the balanced data context task, the OBC306 dataset is reverse sorted, and the top 10 categories are selected based on the amount of data. 5800 OBIR samples are randomly selected for each category and divided into training and test sets with an 8:2 ratio, thus providing a robust framework for assessment. Table 1 shows some of the labels and images.\n\nTable 1 Class labels, example images and the number of test images in OBIR-10 Full size table\n\nOBIR-100: Similarly, a reverse sorting process is performed for the OBC306 dataset, and the top 100 classes are selected based on data quantity. For each class, 1000 samples are chosen. For classes with over 1000 samples, 1000 samples are randomly selected. For classes with fewer than 1000 samples, GAN is employed to generate additional samples to reach 1000 per class, the generated samples are illustrated as Fig. 4c. The generated samples account for only 8% of the total samples.\n\nOBIR-ID: For the imbalanced data context task, the top 196 classes are selected based on data quantity for the training dataset. 110 samples are randomly selected for the testing set within each class, with the remaining samples designated for training. Following Liu et al.48, the number of OBIR samples per class in the training set is categorized as follows: classes with fewer than 100 samples are termed \u201cOBIR-Few\", those with between 100 and 1000 samples are termed \u201cOBIR-Medium\", and those with over 1000 samples are termed \u201cOBIR-Many\". The details of the OBI sub-dataset are illustrated in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Details of our constructed OBIR datasets Full size table\n\nImplementation details\n\nWe utilize ViT-base/16 as the backbone and apply a circular mask with a radius of 8 to the frequency images. Then, Our OBI-CMF is trained on the three sub-dataset of the OBC306: OBIR-10, OBIR-100, and OBIR-ID. Our network is implemented with PyTorch V2.1.2 using a single GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for all experiments. A pre-training phase for 300 epochs is conducted on the training set, following the ViT structure settings like BEiT27. The training process involves resizing images to a resolution of 128 \u00d7 128, with a batch size of 128. For optimization, the AdamW optimizer is employed with betas (0.9, 0.95) and a weight decay of 0.05. The base learning rate is 3 \u00d7 104. After pre-training, we finetune the trained student encoder for 100 epochs on the OBIR classification task.\n\nEvaluation for OBI classification\n\nOBI classification on balanced datasets\n\nOBI classification on OBIR-10\n\nTo evaluate the classification performance of our model, the performance comparison between our OBI-CMF with some supervised and self-supervised methods is depicted in Table 3. Among them, the self-supervised learning methods we compare include contrastive learning methods (e.g., SimSiam32, MoCov333) and masked reconstruction-based methods (e.g., MAE26, MFM30). As suggested in Table 3, our model achieves the best results with 99.57% at Top-1 and 99.98% at Top-5, surpassing the best-supervised model, DenseNet19, which achieves 99.46%, as well as outperforming all self-supervised methods listed in Table 3. The experimental results indicate that our OBI-CMF effectively captures essential features, excelling particularly on small, balanced datasets, emphasizing the importance of contrastive learning and frequency domain reconstruction.\n\nTable 3 Comparison of the OBI classification accuracy of different methods on OBIR-10 (%) Full size table\n\nTo better understand the capability of our proposed model, the confusion matrix of our OBI-CMF classification performance on OBIR-10 is presented in Fig. 5. As exhibited in Fig. 5, most of the samples are correctly categorized into the true category to which they belonged. For example, 1160 of the samples with a true label of 0 and 8 ( and ) were correctly predicted to be in category 0 and 8 ( and ), which indicates a better overall performance of the OBI-CMF. Meanwhile, we show the learning curve of the training results in Fig. 6. Figure 6 shows that although the test loss is high initially, the loss of our method decreases quickly, and the final result is optimal. This suggests that our model effectively learns more adequate features in the pre-training phase, improving the ability to recognize complex OBIR samples accurately.\n\nFig. 5 Confusion matrix of OBI-CMF classification performance. Full size image\n\nFig. 6 Learning curve during fine-tuning. Full size image\n\nOBI classification on OBIR-100\n\nCompare our method with the existing methods using the OBIR-100. We can measure the performance of our OBI-CMF on a larger dataset. After pre-training on the training set, the trained student encoder is fine-tuned on the test set for the OBI classification task. To make the MFM30 better suited to our task, we reduced the radius of the frequency-domain circular mask from 16 to 8.\n\nAs depicted in Table 4, our OBI-CMF achieves the highest Top-1 accuracy of 95.08%, which suggests our method can boost the ability of the feature extractor. Our method achieves the best fine-tuned performance on OBIR-100. Specifically, it outperforms the supervised method DenseNet19 by 0.68% and the self-supervised method MFM30 by 0.22% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. The results indicate that our method can attain a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art supervised methods and self-supervised methods. Through this series of experiments, the superior performance of our method can be demonstrated when dealing with large balanced datasets, and its potential can be shown in OBI classification tasks.\n\nTable 4 Comparison of the OBI classification accuracy of different models on OBIR-100 (%) Full size table\n\nTo evaluate its performance on difficult samples with large inter-class differences and noise, we compared our OBI-CMF with MAE26 and MFM30, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The experimental results show that OBI-CMF is able to capture the global details better than MAE26 and MFM30, and exhibits stronger feature extraction capabilities. Especially when facing images with large inter-class differences, our model is able to distinguish different classes effectively. The analysis of the combined accuracy shows that OBI-CMF still maintains a high performance when dealing with these difficult samples, and successfully distinguishes the input OBIR (Fig. 7a). Ultimately, the prediction results of OBI-CMF (Fig. 7e) are highly consistent with the real labels (Fig. 7b), which further proves that our model is still able to extract accurate and representative features despite the significant noise and inter-class differences. However, when dealing with OBIRs that are heavily affected by noise achieving better differentiation poses a significant challenge for the model.\n\nFig. 7: Visualization of OBI classification results. a The easy-to-distinguish samples in the class. b the hard-to-distinguish samples in the class. c\u2013e represents the classification results of MFM, MAE, and our model. Full size image\n\nOBI classification on imbalanced dataset\n\nSelf-supervised learning consists of two stages. Not relying on labeled data in the pre-training phase can effectively alleviate the trouble caused by label imbalance. We compare our OBI-CMF with previous supervised and self-supervised methods on the OBIR-ID to validate the features learned by the model, based on the imbalanced nature that exists in the OBI dataset.\n\nThe results are illustrated in Table 5, our method achieves 88.66% in overall accuracy, which outperforms the supervised method DenseNet19 by 0.89% and all self-supervised methods listed in Table 5. In more detailed metrics, our method achieves 95.12%, 90.07%, and 71.17% in OBIR-Many, OBIR-Medium, OBIR-Few, respectively. From the above results, it can be seen that our method improves the accuracy of OBIR-Few without losing the accuracy of OBIR-Many at the same time. This shows that our OBI-CMF not only learns adequate feature representation but also takes into account the imbalance that exists in the dataset.\n\nTable 5 Result of different models on OBIR-ID (%) Full size table\n\nAblation study\n\nIn this section, we conduct detailed experiments on each module and parameter of the OBI-CMF to further analyze and validate its performance. These experiments are conducted based on the OBIR-100 dataset. By tuning and testing different modules and parameters, we can study the impact of each component on the overall model performance. Our model structure and parameter settings are then optimized to obtain the best classification results.\n\nEffectiveness of module\n\nTo validate the impact of each module on the performance, we conduct several experiments to test the effects of different modules individually. As depicted in Table 6, the Top-1 accuracy of our model improved by 0.1% each after adding the HOG reconstruction task and the comparison learning task, respectively. This indicates that these two modules positively contribute to our model.\n\nTable 6 Effect of different modules (%) Full size table\n\nTherefore, we integrate both the HOG reconstruction task and the contrastive learning task into the model. The experimental results confirm that our approach achieves the highest accuracy, which further validates the importance of these two modules in improving model performance. In summary, these experimental results demonstrate the contribution of each module to the model performance and the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.\n\nEffectiveness of different targets\n\nPixels have been widely used to reconstruct targets in previous studies due to their intuitive and easy implementation. Similarly, we compare the results of reconstructing pixels and reconstructing HOG features. The results show that pixel reconstruction leads to a decrease in model performance. This is due to the large amount of noise present in the OBI image. Restoring the pixels alone interferes with the learning process of our OBI-CMF.\n\nAs shown in Table 7, HOG features can mitigate noise and other distractions in the image and provide a more robust feature representation. Therefore, we choose HOG features as the reconstruction target. This choice improves the learning efficiency and classification accuracy of the model and further validates the superiority of HOG features in processing OBI images.\n\nTable 7 Comparison of different reconstructed targets(%) Full size table\n\nEffectiveness of balance parameter \u03bc\n\nThe reconstruction task and contrastive learning in self-supervised learning are applied simultaneously in our OBI-CMF. Therefore, we introduce the hyperparameter \u03bc to balance these two losses in Eq.10. We set \u03bc to 0.1,0.3,0.5 in our experiments.\n\nAs depicted in Table 8, our OBI-CMF performs best with a \u03bc value of 0.3. Either we are increasing or decreasing \u03bc leads to a decline in model accuracy. This observation emphasizes the importance of a balanced integration of contrastive learning and reconstruction tasks to effectively enhance the feature learning capabilities of our model from OBI images. Then, we identify optimal parameter settings that allow the model to achieve optimal performance by effectively balancing these two tasks.\n\nTable 8 Effect of balance parameters (%) Full size table\n\nEffectiveness of mask radius\n\nIn previous image classification tasks, a common practice is to use an image size of 224 \u00d7 224. However, we have adopted a smaller image size of 128 \u00d7 128 for our study. Consequently, we adjust the masking radius in the frequency domain to accommodate this change in resolution.\n\nTable 9 reveals that a masking radius of 16 significantly reduces the model accuracy. This indicates that a masking radius that is too large can damage the integrity of the image content and hinder the model\u2019s ability to learn features. On the other hand, a masking radius of 4 also reduces the accuracy of the model, suggesting that the task might be too easy for the model to extract sufficient features. Therefore, we chose a more moderate masking radius to ensure our model can adequately capture essential features in the OBIR images, thereby improving classification accuracy. Following this adjustment, the performance of our model in processing OBIR images is optimized and ensured by the effectiveness of our OBI-CMF in OBI classification tasks.\n\nTable 9 Effect of different mask radius (%) Full size table\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we present a simple yet effective self-supervised OBI recognition method named OBI-CMF. Our OBI-CMF integrates HOG feature reconstruction to mitigate the effect of image noise on the model\u2019s ability to learn image features. In addition, the model performance is significantly enhanced by employing a mutual supervision mechanism between the frequency and spatial domain information. To further enhance this performance, our approach is complemented by contrastive learning, specifically aimed at improving the model\u2019s capability to discriminate between intra-class variants of OBI images. Our OBI-CMF demonstrates excellent robustness and achieves compelling results under diverse conditions by comprehensively evaluating balanced and imbalanced datasets. Although our OBI-CMF achieves excellent performance, there are still some factors that need to be further investigated. In the future, we will deal with the problem of the large amount of noise in the image of the OBIR. The existing Oracle knowledge will then be utilized to migrate to unrecognized OBI to help decipher unknown rubbings. Finally, we hope that our work can provide a valuable tool for Oracle interpretation work.",

Snow Maria Guardado Share share-square-67334 This story was excerpted from Maria Guardado\u2019s Giants Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here.

Snow prior to last week, but he was aware of the six-time Gold Glove winner\u2019s reputation for defensive excellence. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard, that he\u2019s a first base guru,\u201d said Eldridge, the club\u2019s No. 1 prospect. \u201cThat\u2019s something I could really use in my life right now.\u201d See the Giants in 2025: Tickets for all games on sale now! The Giants figured as much, which was why the club decided to invite Snow to spend a week serving as a guest instructor at Scottsdale Stadium this spring. Since arriving in camp on Feb. 22, Snow has been working closely with Eldridge and sharing his expertise to help speed along the highly touted slugger\u2019s development at first base. The first thing that struck Snow about Eldridge? \u201cHe\u2019s 20 years old,\u201d Snow said Monday. \u201cI told him, \u2018You can\u2019t even buy me a beer after a workout.\u2019 I said, \u2018When I was your age, I was a sophomore in college.\u2019 He\u2019s a great kid. He\u2019s a great listener. He wants to listen and learn, and he\u2019s engaging. He asks good questions.\u201d There aren\u2019t a ton of questions about Eldridge\u2019s bat, which offers tremendous raw power and helped fuel his meteoric rise from Single-A San Jose to Triple-A Sacramento last season. But Eldridge isn\u2019t quite as advanced with the glove as he is at the plate. Before being selected by the Giants with the 16th overall pick of the 2023 MLB Draft, Eldridge mostly pitched and served as a designated hitter while starring as a two-way player in high school. He got some looks at first base, but he didn\u2019t start to play the position regularly until his first full season in pro ball. The inexperience showed, as he committed 18 errors over 100 games at first last year. Now that he\u2019s in big league camp for the first time, Eldridge is working hard to shore up his defensive skills and soak up all the guidance Snow can offer. \u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Eldridge said Friday. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s super knowledgeable over there. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been super helpful for me this past week. I\u2019ve learned a lot just with him being here and how he goes about his routines and all that. He\u2019s a great guy. Me and him get along well. He\u2019s great at explaining his mindset and his thinking process over there, so it\u2019s been good.\u201d Eldridge has been doing early work on the back fields every morning with Snow, third-base coach Matt Williams and special assistant to the front office Ron Wotus, drilling down on fundamentals such as bunt plays, picks, relays, cutoffs, positioning and footwork. Eldridge said one of Snow\u2019s biggest tips was to try to get his glove closer to the ground on his pre-step to help keep his 6-foot-7 frame as low as possible. \u201cI told him, \u2018You\u2019re at a disadvantage with some things because you\u2019re so tall,\u2019\u201d Snow said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to get down. You\u2019re taller, lankier. You might have to work a little harder than guys that are 6\u20191\u201d to get down with the ball.\u2019 But he\u2019s athletic. I\u2019m impressed with his athleticism. We\u2019ve been positioning the bag. We did some balls in the dirt. The big thing now is just repetitions.\u201d Get the latest from the Giants Have the latest news, ticket information, and more from the Giants and MLB delivered right to your inbox. Sign up \u201cThese guys have been telling me, I\u2019ve got to use my advantages, but I\u2019ve also got to play like I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cI\u2019m getting better there. That\u2019s the thing, is staying in my legs. That\u2019s why J.T. gave me that cue of kind of getting my glove in the dirt on my pre-step when the pitch is coming in. It\u2019s been good for me.\u201d Snow believes Eldridge\u2019s size will eventually help him nab more throws and gain the trust of his infielders, though that process will likely take some time. Eldridge made his first four Cactus League appearances at DH before finally seeing some game action at first base in Thursday\u2019s 4-4 tie against the Cubs at Scottsdale Stadium. He came in as a defensive substitute for Wilmer Flores, but he misplayed a routine grounder down the first-base line in the top of the seventh inning, allowing it to roll into right field for a generously scored double. \u201cI think patience is the biggest thing,\u201d Snow said. \u201cHe\u2019s young and learning a position. But he\u2019s farther along than I thought. \u2026 He\u2019s kind of like a clean slate, which is good. You can kind of mold him and get him to do things. Maybe he doesn\u2019t have any bad habits yet. If someone already has some bad habits, you have to break those. He doesn\u2019t have any of those, so you can look at that as a positive.\u201d",

            "content": "A Tesla (TSLA) application to start ride-hailing services in California has surfaced online. Bloomberg first reported the application which was submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) by Tesla back in November.\n\nI tried to search the CPUC website but there is no public information available on this Tesla application. The State of California requires ride-sharing providers like Tesla to apply for a Transportation Charter-Party (TCP) permit.\n\nA TCP permit is the first step in starting a ride-hailing service in California. According to TechCrunch, the approval of Tesla\u2019s TCP permit is still pending after almost 4 months.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nA Tesla Cybercab robotaxi parked in a metro environment at nighttime, possibly waiting to pick up its ride-hailing guests. Credit: Courtesy of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n\nAfter Tesla acquires the TCP permit, it would be directly competing with ride-sharing transportation services providers like Uber and Lyft in California.\n\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s business model of ride-hailing services is different from other providers like Uber and Lyft. The tech & AI automaker aims to own the fleet of cars providing the ride-sharing services in California.\n\n\u2013 Sponsored \u2013\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has been teasing a ride-hailing service. But Musk\u2019s plans have always been wrapped around an autonomous ride-hailing service. At one point, he stated that Tesla will keep/buy back all the leased Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and later use them as autonomous robotaxis.\n\nLast year during the Q1 2024 Earnings Call, Musk said that Tesla\u2019s ride-hailing business model will be better than Uber and Lyft.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s current application with the CPUC isn\u2019t sufficient to allow Tesla to operate driverless taxis in California. The automaker will need a few more regulatory approvals before it can actually launch its Cybercab robotaxi service in the state of its origin.\n\nElon Musk announced last year that Unsupervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) will be first launched in Texas and California. Recently, Musk confirmed that the launch of Usupervised FSD in Austin, TX is on schedule, i.e. June 2025.\n\nFor the last few years, Elon Musk and the State of California haven\u2019t been on good terms. During Covid-19, Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory was shut down despite following the government regulations. This created a rift that ended in Tesla\u2019s HQ moving to Texas and Musk also relocated to the lonestar state.\n\nCalifornia is still the most populas state when it comes to the number of Tesla electric cars. Launching an online Tesla ride-hailing service will surely be an interesting story \u2014 so stay tuned.\n\nA preview screenshot of Tesla\u2019s ride-sharing app released by the automaker to give an idea of its UI and functionality.

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a boon for a number of businesses, including Oracle (ORCL 1.09%). AI energized the tech company's fortunes, sending its shares soaring 50% over the past 12 months through the week ending Feb. 21.\n\nOne factor that drove the stock higher is the company's participation in the U.S. government's Stargate program. This project plans to invest $500 billion into the nation's AI infrastructure, providing a tailwind to Oracle's revenue growth.\n\nBut the stock is down from the 52-week high of $198.31 reached in December. Does this present an opportunity to buy shares? Here's an analysis of the tech company to arrive at an answer.\n\nFactors in Oracle's AI success\n\nOracle has strengths that make it a compelling investment. Its origins lie in databases, which is where digital information is stored, including the data needed for AI. So its success in the AI sector is a natural extension of its roots.\n\nBut what ended up supercharging the AI business was its cloud computing infrastructure. Chief technology officer Larry Ellison said, \"Oracle continues to win large AI training workloads because we're faster and less expensive than the other infrastructure clouds.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence isn't like a software program that runs on your computer. After the AI model is built, it must be trained to make correct decisions by analyzing mountains of data stored in databases.\n\nThe training is costly, requiring an army of fast, powerful computers, such as the ones in Oracle's cloud. This has led businesses to use the company to train their AI.\n\nConsequently, cloud revenue rose 24% year over year to $5.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended Nov. 30. That strong performance helped the company's total second-quarter sales to grow 9% year over year to $14.1 billion.\n\nOracle's rising AI revenue\n\nCEO Safra Catz says the company is experiencing a record level AI demand, and that its growth \"will continue to climb even higher.\"\n\nThat's likely because Oracle captured Meta Platforms, which is investing aggressively in AI, as a customer in its fiscal third quarter, so the social media giant's revenue contributions aren't part of the second-quarter numbers.\n\nSpecifically, management anticipates fiscal 2025 revenue to grow by double digits over the prior year. That would be impressive considering fiscal 2024's $53 billion in sales, a 6% year-over-year increase.\n\nOracle's AI-fueled sales growth enabled it to increase fiscal second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) by 24% year over year to $1.10. This was the latest quarter of rising EPS since the AI boom began with the arrival of ChatGPT in late 2022, converting its success in the technology into gains for shareholders.\n\nHowever, that could change in upcoming quarters since management expects fiscal 2025 capital expenditures (capex) to double the $6.9 billion spent in 2024. To keep up with customer demand, Oracle is expanding its cloud infrastructure. One facility is so large, there are permits to build three small modular nuclear reactors to power it.\n\nAlthough capex is rising, the company's financials give it the bandwidth to support this. Its operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months totaled $20.3 billion.\n\nTo buy or not to buy Oracle stock\n\nOracle's AI success and solid financials make the company a great investment. This leads to the question of whether now is the right time to buy shares.\n\nOne consideration is valuation. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is the highest among some of its key competitors in the cloud computing space.\n\nThis indicates Oracle shares are more expensive than the competition, suggesting its stock is still overpriced despite dropping from its 52-week high. So now is not the best time to buy. Wait for it to fall further before grabbing shares.\n\nAlternatively, you can buy a few shares now and use dollar-cost averaging to build your position over time -- purchasing equal dollar amounts at regular intervals takes some of the guesswork out of which direction Oracle shares will go from their current price, while allowing you to own a piece of this successful AI tech company.",

            "content": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 For his last interview of the day, Stephen Curry took a seat and handed his phone to a friend. He wanted a picture of this moment.\n\nIt was his old locker. The one assigned to him as a rookie for the Golden State Warriors, with Anthony Randolph next to him on the right, and Corey Maggette occupying the coveted corner way to his left, with Stephen Jackson and Monta Ellis owning the two corner lockers across from Curry. This was where it all began. In this spot. The locker that once bore his name is now painted black. The seat was just a standard issue folding chair, not the special thickly padded chairs that served as his throne. Until he became such a big star, he couldn\u2019t do interviews at that locker anymore. The Warriors built a new locker in a new $2 billion arena in San Francisco.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaturday, Curry was back home. At the old Oracle Arena. The NBA had its annual All-Stars practice at the Warriors\u2019 former arena of 47 years, including the first 10 years of his career. A time-machine trip to romanticized memories. Now called the Oakland Arena, primarily a concert venue, it still seemed to be just as the NBA left it in 2019. The Warriors\u2019 branding was gone. Spaces were repurposed. But the concrete bones looked the same. The aura of history and intensity hovered the same. The pathways and sightlines were familiar enough to stoke memories and emotions.\n\n\u201cIt feels weird being back here.\u201d A common refrain uttered by many who still have particles of Oracle in their DNA.\n\nCurry misses those days. Oracle fit his worldview. He\u2019s a billionaire in training, so Chase Center does as well. That\u2019s the dichotomy of someone underrated becoming a global icon. But extravagance hasn\u2019t rid his palette of a taste for rusty charm. Fulfilling his wildest dreams only makes him appreciate the grimy origins.\n\nThat\u2019s why he wants to play in this arena again.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love the idea of coming back to play a game here,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt should be a regular-season game.\u201d\n\nStephen Curry throws a t-shirt to fans during Saturday\u2019s All-Star practice. His Warriors won three titles while in Oakland, transforming the franchise. (Darren Yamashita / Imagn Images)\n\nThe nostalgia was palpable on Saturday. A reminder of a time when the Warriors, when the NBA, when basketball, was an event of intimacy. This was before millions became billions. Before luxury quartered off the community and gentrified the kinship. Before suites turned ticket prices into mortgages. When arenas had a soul and hugged their guests. When its greatest moments were communal experiences. When hierarchy didn\u2019t prohibit tangibility.\n\nThe business of sports escalated to such massiveness that it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the uniqueness of places like Oracle is lost forever. Smothered by cash. Suffocated by opulence. Edifices costing billions of dollars don\u2019t turn a profit on vibes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Saturday \u2014 especially for Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s squad of OGs \u2014 being in Oracle was a reminder of what they had, how far they\u2019ve come and how long they\u2019ve been at this. And just how different this all is now.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d said Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard, \u201cthe Warriors team was so bad that \u2026 me and my brother used to walk through the tunnel, walk in the back, eat food in the media room. Now that I\u2019m in the NBA, I know it was the media room. So it was like hot dogs and sodas and stuff like that \u2026 then walked out where the players walked out at. We would just stand there. They\u2019d be coming out of the locker room. We\u2019d get autographs. Walking up to their cars. It was just like, \u2018How were we ever able to do that?\u2019 That\u2019s one memory that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget, especially today walking in and seeing that exact spot.\u201d\n\nCurry, the champion of Oracle, and Lillard, the Oakland kid who grew up within walking distance of the arena, weren\u2019t alone in their sentimentality on Saturday. Truth is, this arena was special for many people.\n\nKevin Durant said he took the same route to the arena, a ride he remembered from his three seasons with the Warriors. He recalls fondly the significance of basketball in these parts. His favorite memory at Oracle?\n\n\u201cGame 5, 2017,\u201d he said, referencing the Warriors\u2019 NBA Finals win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. \u201cWinning the championship here, celebrating in the locker room, celebrating on the floor. I think that was the only time we did that. Out of the four championships the Warriors won in this era, I think that\u2019s the only time they celebrated at home. So that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nStephen Curry and Kyrie Irving chat in the Oakland Arena locker room, now painted black. The two had three Finals showdowns in the building. (Candice Ward / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nCurry said that clinching game was his favorite moment for the same reasons.\n\nOf course, in the last NBA game in this building, Pascal Siakam celebrated a championship with the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\u201cGood times,\u201d Siakam, now an Indiana Pacer, said with a full grin. \u201cThe locker room was crazy. Champagne everywhere. It was awesome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBron James for sure loves Oracle. He had some monster games under this roof. None bigger than Game 7 in 2016, when his Cavaliers won the title on the hardwood in East Oakland.\n\nThat game, this arena, was the site of the greatest shot in Kyrie Irving\u2019s life.\n\nThat game, this arena, was the site of the greatest game Draymond Green ever played: 32 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists in 47 minutes of a Game 7.\n\n\u201cF\u2014 that game,\u201d Green said. \u201cI hate that game.\u201d\n\nInstead, he chose to focus on Game 3 against Denver in 2013. His first playoff game in Oracle and the Warriors\u2019 first home postseason game since 2007.\n\n\u201cWhen we ran out in Game 3, you couldn\u2019t hear. You could not hear. They had to turn the music off because the crowd was so loud. That\u2019s my favorite Oracle moment.\u201d\n\nWhat made Oracle special was the people. It\u2019s prime attracted the most rambunctious. Before the modern sports landscape worked its magic trick of exclusivity.\n\nIt featured an environment conducive to creating and fostering relationships. The concourse was for networking and reunions as much as for vending. The parking lot a stage for long walks and chats. The hallways outside the locker room, where people congregated behind the scenes, trafficked in relationships. A mesh of players, owners and executives, agents and managers, friends and families, lucky fans and entourages, entrepreneurs and corporate types.\n\nFor old-time\u2019s sake, Curry revived the \u201cJones\u2019 BBQ and foot massage\u201d dance he did with Oracle security before games.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by GSWALLDAY (@gsw.all.day)\n\nYeah, Oracle was special. It was by no means state-of-the-art. But it was a state of the people.\n\n\u201cWe had a run where we created opportunities for memories to happen,\u201d Curry said. \u201cBut anybody who came here before we won in 2015 could feel how unique this place was. It became more of a national, international arena because of the winning. Hosting that many finals and the whole deal. But it was always here. My rookie year, it was talked about differently than other arenas. Because it was just raw and you only came here for the game. Wasn\u2019t no bells and whistles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey still didn\u2019t exist when Curry returned Saturday. The Warriors\u2019 new digs felt especially lavish on the return to their old haunts. But that ol\u2019 feeling, that essence, that personality, it didn\u2019t make it to Chase Center. For it still remains in Oracle. In the concrete bones. In the aura the hovers. In the soul that hugs.\n\nGO DEEPER NBA All-Star Game 2025, explained: New format, rosters and how we got here\n\n(Top photo of Stephen Curry with fans Saturday during the All-Star Game practice at Oakland Arena: AAron Ontiveroz / The Denver Post via Getty Images)",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dividend Stock Portfolio For Income: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAnalysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 24.04\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is an American software company, based in Texas. The company is well known for its cutting-edge data center infrastructure, which is essential for AI development. Demand for its services currently exceeds supply, as it continues to be a key partner for major AI firms such as OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. While the company operates efficiently, it is still striving to keep pace with rising demand. As of fiscal Q1 2025, Oracle had 162 data centers either operational or under construction. To address this shortage, the company has ambitious expansion plans, aiming to grow its data center network to between 1,000 and 2,000 in the future. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 55%.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) posted solid financial results for fiscal Q2 2025, with revenue reaching $14.06 billion, marking a 9% year-over-year increase. Its cloud services segment, which includes Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), brought in $5.9 billion, reflecting a 24% increase in both USD and constant currency. Cloud infrastructure revenue (IaaS) saw particularly strong growth, surging 52% to $2.4 billion. At this pace, Oracle\u2019s cloud revenue is projected to surpass $25 billion for the fiscal year.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has also gained investor interest due to its consistent dividend payments. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.93%, as of February 26. The company has been distributing dividends since 2009 and has increased payouts at an average annual rate of nearly 11% over the past five years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list.\n\nOverall, ORCL ranks 3rd on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Tetairoa McMillan | Rob Gray-Imagn Images\n\nFinding better weapons for quarterback Bryce Young is high on the Carolina Panthers' list of priorities this offseason. Given they've only got $29.86 million in available salary-cap space right now, going down the NFL Draft route might be the best way to accomplish this feat.\n\nThis starts in the wide receiver room. There is perhaps a more pressing need at the tight-end spot with Ian Thomas departing and Tommy Tremble testing the market . Still, every productive signal-caller needs a legitimate No. 1 weapon to depend upon in key moments.\n\nOne prospect is catching the eye more than most during the assessment process. Tetairoa McMillan is perceived by most analysts as the best wide receiver emerging from the college ranks this year. His size, explosiveness, and playmaking ability make him a first-round lock. However, one respected draft guru believes the Arizona standout could go lower than some anticipate.\n\nCarolina Panthers should watch Tetairoa McMillan's closely after Mel Kiper Jr.'s projection\n\nMel Kiper Jr. from ESPN threw cold water on McMillan's chances of being a top 10 pick based on conversations with people around the league. He placed him at No. 22 overall to the Los Angeles Chargers in his latest mock draft, citing concern about whether the wideout can replicate his contested catch prowess versus elite-level cornerbacks in the pros.\n\nWe talk about contested [catch]. That was against college corners. Most of those guys aren't going to be in the NFL. In the NFL, will he be as effective in those types of situations against the best in the world? That's still to be determined. There's a range for Tetairoa McMillan. Top 10's a little rich right now, talking to people in the league. Somewhere 12-to-22 is the range and not top 10 when you have conversations with the NFL. So it's going to be really interesting with Tetairoa McMillan. Mel Kiper Jr.\n\nThis development shouldn't go unnoticed by the Panthers. They have the No. 8 overall selection and an obvious need to find defensive reinforcements. But if general manager Dan Morgan can rectify some glaring complications in free agency , it could give him the luxury needed to take a swing with McMillan in the first round.\n\nIf Kiper's conversations with people in the league are accurate, the Panthers could also get McMillan with a trade back. It's a deep draft class for edge rushers, defensive linemen, and tight ends. That's not the case at wide receiver, so adding arguably the premier guy while accumulating more picks by moving back represents a win-win scenario.\n\nOf course, this is also smoke and mirrors season. Teams use the media to their advantage at this time of year. Taking everything with a pinch of salt, especially at this early stage, is crucial.\n\nMorgan seemed happy enough when discussing his wide receiver options. He wants more playmakers, but the Panthers have faith in Xavier Legette and Jalen Coker. Both flashed as rookies and could increase their respective contributions with the correct development during the preparation period.\n\nNothing can be dismissed right now. But if Morgan puts the resources available to good use defensively from the veteran pool, the chances of an offensive player in the first round increase.\n\nWhether it's McMillan or someone else, that'll be great news for Young entering a crucial third season .\n\nMore Carolina Panthers news and analysis",

The office maintains that the VA still needs to address more than 1,800 requested configuration changes, update the cost estimate, and schedule \"to reflect the pause and work that remains\" and address continued user dissatisfaction with the new system.\n\n\"We have multiple recommendations that VA still needs to implement to improve its [EHR] system,\" the report said.\n\n\"GAO's preliminary results show that VA is making incremental improvements,\" such as more than 1,500 system configuration changes and \"initiating projects to address user challenges.\"\n\nThe office added that as of this February, \"VA had not addressed approximately 1,800 complex configuration change requests,\" and reiterated concerns about the overall cost and lack of clarity on the total amount at present.\n\n\"Existing EHRM life cycle cost estimates range from VA's $16.1 billion to an independent estimate of $49.8 billion,\" GAO said.\n\n\"Updating the independent life cycle cost estimate is imperative to understanding the full magnitude of VA's investment,\" the office said in a statement Monday.\n\nHowever, trouble ticket resolution timeliness thresholds were met since the implementation of financial consequences in September 2023, GAO said.\n\nMany \"but not all\" patient safety and pharmacy enhancement issues were closed and should be before future deployments, according to the office.\n\nPrior to this new report, GAO issued four reports on the VA's EHR modernization program from June 2020 to May 2023, which offered 15 total recommendations.\n\nTackling the VA's 'Big Rocks'\n\nOn Monday, Dr. Neil Evans, acting program executive director for the VA's EHRM Integration Office, assured lawmakers that throughout the project's reset period, improvements to the system were made.\n\nThe agency \"took steps to understand the issues, updated our contracts to better hold Oracle Health accountable, made hundreds of improvements to the system and instituted a simpler and more effective process to address concerns when they arise,\" Evans said in his testimony.\n\nA series of complex projects to improve the VA's EHR \u2013 \"referred to as 'Big Rocks' \u2013 are in motion,\" said Evans.\n\nThey include standardizing user roles, improving new EHR user training for new users, and addressing coordination between clinicians and pharmacists, he said.\n\nIn her testimony, Verma provided the lawmakers with plans to rapidly scale system deployment to the remaining 164 VA healthcare facilities.\n\nDuring the reset, Oracle completed more than 3,000 functional changes to the formerly Cerner EHR that improved its stability, added enhancements and simplified functions, Verma said in her testimony to the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization.\n\nHowever, \"Maintaining the current pace will take decades, which is not acceptable to anyone, and which is why we recommend the path of acceleration,\" Verma told lawmakers ahead of laying out seven key initiatives for completing the VA's EHR modernization program.\n\nIn addition to developing a standard for a robust change management process across all users of the VA EHR, Oracle Health is investing in a series of automated implementations, which Verma said would shorten the testing phase by reducing manual testing efforts, user onboarding and training.\n\n\"Automation ensures that each deployment is thoroughly tested in less time, enabling us to support a higher volume of simultaneous deployments without compromising quality,\" she said.\n\nThe EHR vendor also recommends using a \"web-based tool to collect site-specific data more efficiently,\" Verma said.\n\nFor the \"Big Rocks\" projects, Oracle's efforts focused on pharmacy, referrals, Quick Orders, and other aspects of the EHR.\n\n\"We have greatly enhanced the process and procedures used for patient safety,\" Verma said.\n\n\"Notably, an important part of the planned pharmacy improvements, known as 'pharmacy 3b,' is scheduled for release this month as part of a bi-annual software code update,\" Evans also told the subcommittee.\n\nAccording to GAO's new report, the agency delivered six of seven pharmacy enhancements identified by pharmacists and providers. In June 2024, VA said the remaining pharmacy enhancement for synchronization between the pharmacists' module and the healthcare team's pharmacy module would be delivered with the planned February 2025 system update.\n\nAlso of significance, Evans noted, is the development of a tool called the Federal EHR system baseline, which provides data on more than 2,300 functional and technology components that are used to better standardize the VA's healthcare delivery and is expected to increase efficiencies and prevent future user delays.\n\n\"Using the baseline to better conform to national VA standards in advance of go-live will help avoid staff frustration, deployment delays and increased cost,\" he told the subcommittee.\n\nInterviewing the EHR's next 'COO'\n\nIn a prepared statement to the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at a Feb. 19 hearing on his pending nomination for VA deputy secretary, Lawrence pledged to work with lawmakers to \"get VA\u2019s [EHR] modernization effort back on track.\"\n\nIf confirmed, Lawrence would effectively be the chief operating officer of the VA's EHR implementation.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, asked what he would do about the agency's past mistakes.\n\nLawrence answered that he would \"foot stomp urgency\" and noted that driving accountability with measurement helped him in his past role as the under-secretary for benefits leading the Veterans Benefits Administration.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said that because the VA announced in December that it would resume planned EHR deployments in mid-2026, she wanted to know what Lawrence would do differently to hold Oracle accountable.\n\n\"I need your commitment that it's not just 'convene people' and take a look at it, that they are going to make changes to it and demand changes and get those fixed,\" because the system continues to jeopardize veterans' care and frustrate VA clinicians, she said.\n\nLawrence responded that the difference he brings is he implemented effective technology improvements in his previous role at the VBA. He then pledged to get the VA's EHR \"done.\"\n\nSen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, asked Lawrence why he thought the EHR project had gone \"so off the rails.\"\n\n\"There are too many unanswered questions,\" Lawrence said, which he said that he intends to ask, if confirmed.\n\nTillis asked Lawrence if he could report on the EHR implementation within 90 days and outline \"what practices got us into the ditch\" that has to be stopped, what actions need to be taken and what is going well.\n\nLawrence said he would commit to such a review, as it was something the new VA Secretary Doug Collins has prioritized, but added he could not commit to the timeframe.\n\n\"Anybody worth their salt can figure out what's wrong with a project within 90 days,\" Tillis said.\n\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\n\nEmail: afox@himss.org\n\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

            "content": "CrowdStrike is integrating its powerful Falcon Cloud Security platform into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to address the growing need for robust, unified cloud protection. The move comes amid organizations increasingly leveraging OCI for their enterprise-grade performance and security.\n\nAccording to a blog by CrowdStrike, the integration of CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security with OCI empowers users to break down security silos and gain comprehensive visibility across their cloud environments. This expansion provides OCI customers with access to a suite of advanced features, including unified security posture management (USPM), cloud workload protection (CWP), and streamlined deployment capabilities.\n\nKey benefits\n\nThe integration of Falcon Cloud Security on OCI provides some crucial advantages to users. They include:\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nProactive threat mitigation through USPM, by leveraging AI and threat intelligence to drastically reduce alert noise and prioritize critical risks\n\nRuntime protection capabilities that offer real-time detection and prevention of active attacks, ensuring immediate security across OCI, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments\n\nUnified security across multiple cloud providers for a holistic view of an organization\u2019s security posture, helping to proactively address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nSimplified compliance management through automated assessments against industry standards like CIS benchmarks\n\nIntuitive workflows and centralized policy enforcement to streamline risk remediation and enhance collaboration between security and DevOps teams\n\nDeployment and management of the integrated platform are also simplified. A new registration process and an OCI Resource Manager template automate configuration, enabling rapid implementation. This ease of use and streamlined management allows organizations to focus on their core business objectives while maintaining a strong security posture.\n\nSimplifying security\n\nThis collaboration between CrowdStrike and Oracle aims to simplify and scale cloud security for OCI\u2019s global customer base. By offering a single, AI-powered platform, organizations can effectively combat cloud breaches, reduce risk, and ensure compliance, while benefiting from the optimized performance and deep integration within OCI. Thus, Falcon Cloud Security on OCI empowers businesses to stay ahead of evolving threats and maintain a robust, simplified security strategy.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nERP users must prioritize proactive security measures. ERP systems, like those from Oracle, hold highly sensitive data, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. Reports indicate a significant rise in attacks specifically targeting ERP platforms. For example, research indicates that a very high percentage of companies that have experienced ransomware attacks have had their ERP systems affected, highlighting cybercriminals are aware that attacking ERP systems causes massive business disruption.\n\nTimely patching and updates mitigate cyber risks. Vulnerabilities in ERP systems often stem from unpatched software. Studies have shown that a large percentage of ERP systems have known vulnerabilities due to missing security patches. This leaves the door open for exploits. ERP users must ensure timely patching to mitigate these risks. By maintaining up-to-date security protocols, ERP users can stay protected from ransomware and other cyberattacks.\n\nProtect ERP data held within cloud environments with new solutions. As more ERP systems migrate to the cloud, securing these environments becomes paramount. Reports show that cloud data breaches are becoming increasingly common. This underscores the need for ERP users to adopt comprehensive cloud security solutions, like those offered by CrowdStrike, that provide real-time threat detection and unified security posture management.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other stocks that are linked to data centers.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, highlighted the growing significance of data centers as a major theme in the technology sector during Tuesday\u2019s episode. He pointed out that although it might not always be immediately visible in the broader market indices, data centers have become a significant investment focus.\n\n\u201cThe data center has been the single biggest investment story for months on end, even if it\u2019s not always obvious from the averages\u2026 This sea-change, one that we are undergoing in real time, with the data center theme suddenly going from positive to negative, is buried within the broader indices, but it\u2019s like a living, breathing, seething animal, a snorting bull turned into a grizzly, scratching and clawing back the gains in your portfolio.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer on 10 Stocks With The Biggest Declines Last Week and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer offered a historical perspective, tracing the rise of NVIDIA, a graphics and gaming chip maker, as pivotal to the development of modern data centers. He explained that the company\u2019s invention of a semiconductor capable of enabling both accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence became foundational to a wide range of technologies.\n\n\u201cThis semiconductor becomes the backbone of electric vehicles, of robots, and most important, of the data centers themselves\u2026 Huge warehouses full of servers. No large tech company worth its salt can afford to do without these data centers.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cramer revealed that the situation took a dramatic turn when a Chinese company found a way to achieve similar results with fewer, less expensive chips, throwing the entire data center industry into turmoil.\n\nDescribing the company as \"the odd man out of the Magnificent Seven,\" Cramer emphasized the company's central role in the tech market, noting that its products are essential to the operations of numerous tech companies. Cramer pointed out that President Trump's administration may impose tighter export controls on Chinese technology, which could further complicate the company\u2019s market position.\n\nAmong the companies most at risk from these changes, Cramer singled out semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment players, with the GPU kingpin standing out as the most exposed. He concluded by suggesting that some people even argue that the company\u2019s performance could be decisive to the future fortunes of major momentum stocks in the tech sector.",

The accounts could be wrong.\"\n\nAnyone reading such a statement about the impacts of a vital computer system going live might think twice before pressing the button. The problem for Europe's largest local authority is that the right people did not read it or act on it.\n\nOn April 11, 2022, Birmingham City Council went live with a new Oracle ERP system set to manage its \u00a33 billion ($3.8 billion) taxpayer funding and multibillion-pound spending. Within weeks, it was aware that the replacement for its aging SAP system was posting errors in cash transactions and by autumn of 2023, Birmingham City Council was effectively bankrupt in part because of the new software.\n\nIt has since emerged that no audit trail for fraud detection was in place for an 18-month period and the council is not likely to have reliable, auditable accounts until the reimplementation of Oracle is completed in 2026.\n\nLarge-scale IT projects often face delays and overspending. But it's rare for management to press the go-live button on a system that is so woefully unfit for purpose. In 2023, auditors Grant Thornton issued a statutory recommendations report, which said Birmingham's Oracle system implementation was rated as \"red\" before going live, but it did not explain why and how the council's management, officers, and members made such a decision.\n\nA report from auditor Grant Thornton published earlier this month sheds some light on the details and provides salutary lessons for anyone considering flicking the switch on new software.\n\nThe list of mistakes is long, but one obvious error leaps out. The above quote describes the status of issues with the Oracle system and bespoke software the council built around it in answer to the question of the business impact of those problems.\n\nHowever, the right people did not read the Financial Impact Assessment it was written in. Published on March 24, 2022, the assessment could have been included in an update to the Steering Committee, which met on March 25 and would ultimately make the go-live decision.\n\n\"Items in this report, not identifiable in the Steering Committee Update, relate to issues across the several modules, for example, testing and user training,\" the Grant Thornton report says.\n\n\"It is not clear how this report was used and there is no evidence of it being discussed in the minutes of the meeting,\" it adds.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of testing did not fully come to the attention of the Steering Committee. In fact, some of the testing was incomplete because the system was not stable enough.\n\nThe bank reconciliation system (BRS) and cash management module was at the heart of the ERP disaster. The council has spent millions of pounds on manual workarounds, and is waiting for the implementation of third-party software it hopes will fix the problem.\n\n\"Emails exchanged between council officers responsible for testing, the systems integrator Evosys and the Programme Director \u2013 29 to 31 March 2022 \u2013 indicate that council staff testing BRS were unable to fully test the solution because the first step in the process, loading the bank files, and key consolidation reports were failing. Additionally new errors were occurring in functionality that had worked previously,\" the report says.\n\n\"At the time, council staff expressed their concerns about going live with a solution that was not stable and that the issues were not being given sufficient priority. Despite this, cash management was given a 'Green' rating in reports to the Steering Committee.\"\n\nDespite their deep involvement in the project, suppliers also gave a green light to the go-live. The report notes that while the suppliers \u2013 Evosys, consultancy Socitm Advisory (now Civiteq), and data migration specialist Egress \u2013 provided caveats to their opinion, these misgivings were \"only identified in the supporting detail to Steering Committee reports.\"\n\nThe latest public interest report reveals the council's various meetings \"failed to adequately scrutinize available information as part of their decision-making process\" before going live.\n\n\"Whether officers did not review, or did not understand, the information provided, they ultimately placed reliance upon their suppliers,\" it states.\n\nHowever, the reporting by the suppliers and the council's testing teams was overly positive. Minutes to the Steering Committee's April 1 meeting show that the suppliers supported the go-live decision, but there was \"no evidence of suppliers adequately drawing the Steering Committee's attention to a) the level of uncertainty in the position being presented or b) the inherent risk that still existed within the solution.\"\n\nThe committee was also presented with overly optimistic information, particularly in hearing that the BRS had \"no open defects except intermittent issues.\"\n\nTony Summers, CEO of Civiteq, formerly Socitm Advisory, told The Register: \"We supported Birmingham City Council through their implementation of Oracle Cloud from the preparation of the initial business case through to go-live, with a primary focus on business change. It was a highly complex programme against the backdrop of a lot of organizational change.\n\n\"We worked with the council to deliver effective change management and our support was valued and commented on positively throughout. We were transparent with the council on our views on the programme and delivered to the requirements set out by them. \"We were not engaged to manage the overall programme timetable and spend.\"\n\nIn its auditor'S report, Grant Thornton details many other reasons the Oracle implementation was a disaster. They include poor governance, lack of ownership among senior officers, poor business case design, a failure to stick to the adopt-not-adapt plan, lack of timely engagement with key users, a failure by the design authority to control the solution, combined with key officers facing conflicting priorities regarding adherence to budgets, timelines, and the protection of both the council's and their own reputations.\n\nNonetheless, the council could have avoided making a bad situation worse by delaying its go-live, paying to continue to support the existing SAP system, and taking the time to redesign the Oracle program. It might have cost the council, but it might be less than the potential \u00a3130 million bill the council currently faces for the completion of its ERP replacement \u2013 from an initial estimate of around \u00a320 million.\n\n\"If information on the quality and completeness of testing had been presented more clearly and more effectively assessed by the Steering Committee ... it is unlikely that the program would have approved the decision to go live,\" Grant Thornton's report says.\n\nBirmingham City Council has to live with these failures. Other vital IT projects don't have to. \u00ae",

            "content": "The Backbone Of Clouds\n\nIn the tech industry, any company worth half a trillion dollars is obviously doing something right. When the same company is being put in charge of managing how to deploy half a trillion in cash to boost AI development in the US, it also clearly has solid credentials and influence. Still, many non-tech specialists would be hard-pressed to explain exactly what Oracle, the company discussed here, does.\n\nOracle Corporation ORCL +1.17% )\n\nThis is because Oracle is mostly an IT infrastructure company, working with large corporations to build the tools for their cloud systems, including sales, inventory management, supply chain, human resources, etc.\n\nSo even when tens of millions of office workers use an Oracle product, they often do not know the company behind it; they see only the internal software used at their company.\n\nThis nevertheless means that Oracle is at the core of almost every IT infrastructure, including cloud systems and most AI deployment.\n\nOracle Overview\n\nHistory\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, selling the early computing systems \u201crelational database management systems (RDBMS).\u201d\n\nIn 1983, Oracle Version 3 was released, and it was the first commercially available RDBMS to support SQL, still today the main programming language for handling large databases.\n\nOver the years, Oracle kept growing with the ever-expanding role of IT in businesses, and become a key component of a large portion of the world's databases. This goes as far as 94% of Fortune 100 companies running on Oracle.\n\nOracle's clients include countless large corporations, especially tech companies, R&D-driven companies, and large manufacturing corporations.\n\nIn 2024, it can fairly be said that Oracle's business exploded, especially with cloud infrastructure revenues, up 51% year-to-year and 42% growth in customers with an annualized spend above $5M.\n\nOracle by Numbers\n\nOracle is a large company with 160,000+ employees, of which 18,000 are in customer support and 29,000 are consulting experts.\n\nIt made $53B in revenues in 2024 and has spent $80B in R&D since 2012. Revenues are forecasted to reach >$66B in 2026 and >104B in 2029, with >20% CAGR earning per share growth for the 2024-2029 period.\n\nThe company has been steadily raising its dividends in the past decade.\n\nOracle Infrastructure\n\nOracle IT infrastructure is built around 2 central strategies to deploy its database management software.\n\nThe first one is partnering with almost every existing cloud provider so that Oracle products can easily be deployed to their hardware and servers. This includes Amazon \u2019s AWS (AMZN +1.75%), Microsoft \u2018s Azure (MSFT +2.2%), and Google \u2018s Cloud (GOOGL +1.17%).\n\nThe second one is keeping up with other tech companies by building its own large-scale cloud infrastructure, with a focus on high geographical diversity to help create quick and localized data storage. The company has moved from just 5 services and 1,000 customers in 2016 to 192 services and 25,000 customers in 2024.\n\nAn important recent development in that strategy is a multi-cloud partnership with the 3 tech giants that gives the final customers direct access to Oracle Database services running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and deployed in AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure data centers.\n\nThe company is planning to keep expanding its cloud capacities through a large $15B capital expenditure in 2025.\n\nOracle Products\n\nOracle products and services include a mix of internally developed solutions (especially databases) and acquired products.\n\nDatabases\n\nAs a pioneer in database management and RDBMS, Oracle had a head start over its competitors and managed to maintain it 40 years later.\n\nThis was done through constant development to push forward the industry, including with popular third-party tools, for example, dbForge Studio .\n\nThis gives Oracle's users a whole array of database products for enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and analysis, for a wide range of different industries and organizations.\n\nCloud\n\nThe cloud segment is for cloud computing and hosting services, in contrast to just licensing software installed on someone else's cloud (internal, or provided by a tech company).\n\nThis includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), with software as a service included in the other categories.\n\nIn 2023, cloud service generated 13% of Oracle\u2019s total revenues . This is a segment that exploded in 2024, with 51% year-to-year growth.\n\nIn the long run, this might be a major driver of revenue growth for Oracle, as this is a quickly growing market and the company's reputation in cloud services is unmatched.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that would Oracle become a little too successful in this segment, it might endanger some of the recently established multi-cloud partnerships with the 3 biggest and largest providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google).\n\nERP: Netsuite\n\nAcquired by Oracle in 2016, NetSuite is the #1 cloud ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software designed to integrate into a coherent and unified whole finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and procurement.\n\nSince 2011, 62% of tech companies doing an IPO were a customer of NetSuite. 83% of Forces Cloud 100 list are NetSuite customers.\n\nNetSuite is partnering with many third-party developers to make the ERP a platform on which to develop independent businesses providing extra value, like for example maintenance planning management tools, on top of the core functionalities.\n\nNetSuite is maybe one of the most important software for Oracle, as it works as the articulation point for its other offers in specific enterprise activity. For example, it connects together:\n\nThe way all of these services are sold is through a series of modules, which can be individually subscribed to, so that a company interested in adding e-commerce can add the matching NetSuite Commerce module to its pre-existing NetSuite ERP.\n\nNetSuite's service starts around $1,500/month ( Starter Edition ) and then goes on to add more functionality and user accounts for larger companies, at an increasing price.\n\nBecause usually, a given company will already have a system in place, NetSuite offers custom integration of new companies, with pricing ranging from \u20ac9,000 to \u20ac230,000 depending on the size of the business, complexity, and modules selected.\n\nOracle's largest competition in the ERP segment is German SAP (SAP +3.39%), which has a stronger presence in smaller companies and on-site ERP, while Oracle is much more focused on large corporations and cloud-based solutions. Intuit (INTU +2.19%) is also a large presence in the cloud-ERP market.\n\nCRM\n\nWhile CRM (Customer Relation Management) is a part of NetSuite's offer, the leader of this segment is Salesforce (CRM +2.26%), followed by a rather long series of competitors with a larger presence than Oracle.\n\nSo this is more often than not a segment where companies use a non-Oracle CRM solution and pay for custom integration into their own ERP, including NetSuite.\n\nIndustry-Specific Softwares\n\nWhile database, cloud, and ERP systems can be adapted for almost any industry, Oracle has made special progress in a few segments, often through the acquisition of smaller competitors or service providers, that are worth mentioning in particular.\n\nCerner / Oracle Health\n\nWith the acquisition of Cerner in 2022, Oracle suddenly grew in the digital health sector.\n\nToday, Oracle is responsible for the world\u2019s largest HER (Electronic Health Record) implementation, serving more than 9.5 million beneficiaries spanning the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nIt is also the largest revenue cycle management (RCM) leader providing predictive, and actionable health insights.\n\nThis activity covers public and private healthcare, life science research, and governmental health organizations.\n\nThe company also introduced its AI-powered clinical agent in June 2024 . It is able to perform conversation-based note generation (in mere minutes) and the Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant for quicker access to essential data during consultations.\n\n\u201cPractitioners spend upwards of 20-35% of their time on administrative work. Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant is the most important EHR technology update that I am going to see in my career. Since the 1990s, EHRs have turned physicians into keyboard junkies. This will change that.\u201d James Little, MD, primary care physician, St. John\u2019s Health\n\nPoint Of Sales\n\nThis segment was reinforced in 2014 by the acquisition of MICROS Systems in 2014 and FarApp and GloriaFood in 2021.\n\nPOS systems can be performed by Oracle Symphony for restaurants, hotels, resorts, casinos, stadiums, arenas, cruise ships, train stations, and retail stores.\n\nThis includes solutions for online ordering and delivery, management of tables in real-time, gift and loyalty programs, inventory, employees, menus, and reporting and analytics.\n\nUtilities\n\nWith the acquisition in 2020 of LiveData Utilities, Oracle grew its preexisting activity in power and water utilities.\n\nIt provides \u201cleading operational technology (OT) middleware solutions and SCADA capabilities to monitor and control utility equipment while reducing the complexity of real-time systems.\u201d\n\nThis level of data integration is crucial for the deployment of smart grids, and overall much more connected monitoring equipment and IoT (Internet of Things) systems.\n\nDefense & Intelligence\n\nOracle provides dedicated solutions for databases in strategic and critical applications. This includes military systems requiring extra security, robustness, and the ability to work in isolation.\n\nAnd, of course, an extensive 45+ years of experience in dealing with required accreditations and secrecy levels.\n\nThe company offers its services at the same price as commercial services, making it a successful bidder in many tenders where defense contractors might be more expensive.\n\nProject Stargate & AI\n\nIt is maybe the combination of its massive scale & experience with its in-road in military intelligence systems that have put Oracle at the forefront of the newly announced Trump administration push on AI.\n\nDubbed \u201c Project Stargate \u201c, this will be a $500B initiative for building data centers, making it, according to the US president, \u201cthe largest AI infrastructure project, by far, in history.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was made with Trump, Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, and Sam Altman of OpenAI on the side of the US President.\n\nEllison pointed out that the data centers are already under construction, with 10 being built so far. In total, 20 are planned, and the initiative should create 100,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cWe just signed an agreement with Meta\u2014for them to use Oracle\u2019s AI Cloud Infrastructure\u2014and collaborate with Oracle on the development of AI Agents based on Meta\u2019s Llama models. The Oracle Cloud trains dozens of specialized AI models and embeds hundreds of AI Agents in cloud applications. Larry Ellison, Oracle Chairman and CTO.\n\nThis comes in the context of Trump overturning the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content.\n\nTo be Clarified\n\nWho Does What?\n\nDetails are not there yet about exactly who will pay for what, and how much Oracle is expected to benefit from this project. But this has, anyway, been seen as very good news by the market regarding Oracle's relevancy in the AI age.\n\nOverall, financing seems to be provided by SoftBank(SFTBY +3.52%), OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX.\n\nArm, Microsoft, NVIDIA (NVDA +4.11%), Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners.\n\nIs It Realistic?\n\nProject Stargate might not go without any hiccups, at least according to Elon Musk, who quickly criticized it for not being actually financed properly and has a well-known (mutual) dislike of Sam Altman.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority,\u201d Elon Musk\n\nThis tension with Altman is apparently also viewed as the origin of this comment by Musk at the White House:\n\n\u201cWhen asked by a reporter whether Musk\u2019s public criticism of the project upset him, Trump shrugged off the question. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cHe hates one of the people in the deal.\u201d Fortune\n\nAnother big interrogation point is how such massive data centers will be powered. This has been a major concern for Big Tech recently, with all of them scrambling to secure nuclear power for existing power plants, partnering with SMR companies (Small Modular Reactors) , or even restarting closed nuclear power plants like Microsoft .\n\nQualified personnel might also be in short supply, especially as the Trump administration might struggle with its MAGA voting base in regard to H1b visas for foreign workers, after a rather intense public debate with Musk during the Christmas holidays .\n\nPushing Progress Faster\n\nAmong the expected outcomes of Project Stargate is not only a strong lead of the USA in AI technology, but plenty of new technologies as well.\n\nOracle's AI Agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual-factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools. Larry Ellison, Oracle Chairman and CTO.\n\nFor example, mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccines could be created for patients within 48 hours of analysis of their cancer. These vaccines could then be produced using robotic systems, speeding up the treatment even further.\n\n(We already discussed this concept of cancer detection and customized treatment in our article \u201c Best Early Cancer Detection And Liquid Biopsy Stocks \u201d)\n\nThe DeepSeek Threat\n\nA Blow Coming From Nowhere\n\nAnother, probably much more serious issue with Project Stargate is that some are already calling it obsolete barely a few days after it was announced. This is because a Chinese financial trading / quantitative hedge fund, High-Flyer , has released its own LLM (Large Language Model) AI called DeepSeek.\n\nIt came with performances similar to or maybe even superior to the latest and best model of OpenAI and other top AI companies, including the just released and acclaimed as a potential AGI o3 .\n\nExcept, there is a problem for the American AI industry.\n\nDeepSeek has apparently been developed with a budget of only $6M . Mere millions of dollars, not billions nor trillions, the scale of required investments for AI development according to OpenAI and all the Big Tech companies.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the model has been released as open source and has even been described as a \u201cside project\u201d by the quant team responsible for its development.\n\nBreaking AI Stocks?\n\nThe release of DeepSeek has sent an earthquake throughout Silicon Valley and the damages are still to be determined. Everyone expected AI technology to move fast, but maybe no one expected it to move that fast.\n\nDeepSeek could seriously threaten the business model of all AI companies, counting on massive hundreds of billions of revenues to pay off the expensive AI data center they built and are building.\n\nDeepSeek offers its ChatGPT and o3-like LLM for only a few percent (around 3%) of the normal price for OpenAI LLMs, making its cost almost trivial.\n\nAs of the writing of this article, Nvidia's stock, a darling of AI investors, had fallen by as much as 14.5% in a day in reaction to the news, with Oracle's stock down 9%.\n\nChanging Our Collective Mind About AI Investing?\n\nDeepSeek's achievements have been acclaimed by heavyweights in the tech industry. One of them is Marc Andreessen, the co-author of the first web browser (Netscape), a serial tech founder and major investor, calling it \u2018AI\u2019s Sputnik moment\u2019\n\nAnother voice is Chamath Palihapitiya, an influential venture capitalist and SPAC sponsor.\n\nHe worries that AI model building might be so exposed to disruption that massive hardware build-up might be a \u201cmoney trap\u201d. And it could be true if massive computing power turns out to not be needed after all.\n\nIt is definitely still too soon to decide, and also to be sure of what is behind DeepSeek's success, with many already suspecting a nefarious conspiracy of secret funding from the Chinese government and the use of sanctioned import of advanced AI chips.\n\nIn the context of the not-banned-after-all TikTok and market volatility, no wonder tempers run hot.\n\nConclusion\n\nOracle is the database company, with its cloud databases the core of every IT infrastructure of almost every large corporation and institution on Earth. This makes the company a central part of the trend of digitalization.\n\nIts presence in the ERP market with NetSuite reinforced this position, as this type of software / SaaS is where business data are getting centralized. It also has a strong position in niche industries like, for example, healthcare.\n\nLastly, Oracle is growing quickly its cloud hardware infrastructure and will likely be a winner from the growth of the cloud market, directly and indirectly.\n\nIt is unclear how advancement in AI like DeepSeek could impact Oracle in the short term, potentially throwing a wrench into Project Stargate\u2019s gears. But in the long term, if LLMs and other AI tools become widespread, low-cost, and open source, the utilization of AI will certainly explode.\n\nThis, in turn, should dramatically increase the need to digitalize business data in a coherent and connected way, with ultra-reactive and real-time localized cloud solutions.\n\nIf so, who else than Oracle, the \u201cdatabase & ERP\u201d company, with a side serving of cloud infrastructure, would benefit more from that trend in the long term?\n\nLatest on Oracle",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs needs to figure out an updated \u2014 and potentially much higher \u2014 cost estimate for the rollout of an Oracle electronic health record across its facilities, witnesses and lawmakers said at a House subcommittee hearing on Monday.\n\nCost projections for the embattled EHR deployment range from the VA\u2019s 2019 estimate of about $16 billion to an independent evaluation of nearly $50 billion, testified Carol Harris, director for information technology and cybersecurity at the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThough the nearly $50 billion price tag is likely more realistic, neither estimate reflects the many changes to the program over the past two years \u2014 including a period when new EHR deployments were largely put on hold, she added. \u201cCost of this is an unknown at this point,\u201d said Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Mich. \u201cWe have to make this work, but we also have to be mindful, knowledgeable about the costs that that\u2019s going to take.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEHR vendor Cerner, which was later acquired by technology giant Oracle, first scored the contract to replace the VA\u2019s aging medical record system in 2018. About two years later, the new EHR went live at the first VA facility, Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington.\n\nBut the project has faced a score of shortfalls, including patient safety issues, technology challenges and system reliability concerns. Only six medical centers out of 170 are currently using the Oracle record \u2014 and the program has already cost about $12.7 billion, according to Harris\u2019 written testimony from the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs meeting on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the VA\u2019s 2019 cost projection of around $16 billion is \u201cseverely outdated and incomplete\u201d and doesn\u2019t include changes to the program over the past six years, according to Harris\u2019 written testimony.\n\nAn independent cost assessment, issued by the nonprofit Institute for Defense Analyses in 2022, assumes $32.7 billion for a 13-year implementation phase and $17.1 billion for 15 years of continuing operations and maintenance.\n\nBut neither earlier estimate reflect the full impact of delays, system change and updated processes, according to Harris\u2019 written testimony.\n\nNeil Evans, acting program executive director of the Electronic Health Record Modernization Integration Office at the VA, said the agency is committed to building out a master schedule for new deployments as well as a cost estimate for the project.\n\nFirst, the office will build a schedule to resume deployments at four facilities in Michigan in mid-2026, which will inform the build of a larger lineup, he said. The master schedule will serve as a foundation for the cost estimate.\n\nRepresentatives from the VA and Oracle said the program is now at a turning point.\n\nSeema Verma, executive vice president of Oracle Health and Life Sciences and CMS administrator during Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, said the new Trump administration is committed to accelerating the rollout and that the company has completed \u201ccountless\u201d system improvements.\n\n\u201cThe totality of updates, enhancements, investments and innovations to the EHR show that this is a dramatically improved system from what was originally deployed in Spokane in 2020,\u201d she said.\n\nThe VA is also exiting a long pause on new EHR deployments, after the agency largely halted the rollout in 2023 to focus on improvements at sites that were already using the Oracle record, except for a deployment at Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois.\n\nHowever, even if the project continues in Michigan as scheduled, it\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d to deploy the record to the remaining approximately 160 VA facilities before the initial contract with Oracle ends in 2028, Harris said.\n\nAdditionally, job cuts at the VA, part of a larger cull of the federal government workforce, is also a concern for the EHR rollout, said Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill.\n\nEight probationary staffers at the EHRM office were let go, Evans said. Additionally, 16 staff members signed up for \u201cdeferred resignations,\u201d which allows them to leave while receiving pay and benefits through September.\n\nThe office\u2019s organizational chart is approved for about 330 workers, and it employs around 250 people, Evans said. However, he noted the EHR modernization project is a \u201cpriority\u201d for the VA, and other workers \u2014 including other government employees and vendor staff \u2014 contribute to the program.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been major market movers in recent quarters -- and for good reason. AI promises to join many other discoveries and technologies that have been game changers. JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon has said AI could be as transformational as electricity and the internet. So, it's no surprise that investors have been piling into potential AI winners.\n\nBut, there are so many AI stocks out there that you may be wondering how to choose those that will indeed score an AI victory. The good news is there's room for more than one success story in this space, and that means there are plenty of moves investors can make today that should lead to portfolio growth over the long term. You don't have to worry about making one key decision or investing in just one stock.\n\nStill, it's a great idea to consider what experts are doing these days, as sometimes we can add some of their ideas to our own investment plan. And with this in mind, I'm taking a look at recent moves by billionaire David Tepper. The founder of Appaloosa Management has proven his strengths over time with the fund delivering an annualized average return of 28% since its launch back in the early 1990s. How is Tepper investing right now to win in AI? Let's find out.\n\nA big investor in tech stocks\n\nThe billionaire is a big investor in technology stocks, with a particular focus on well diversified e-commerce companies: Appaloosa Management's two biggest holdings as of the end of the latest quarter were Alibaba and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). But in the quarter, the fund slightly lowered its positions in certain tech stocks -- including Amazon -- in favor of one stock that's been roaring ahead in the AI race and led gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year.\n\nHere are the details of Tepper's sells, according to a summary of its trades in the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\nTepper cut his fund's olding in Amazon by 18% and now holds 2.6 million shares.\n\nHe decreased his holding in Meta Platforms by 21% and now holds 490,000 shares.\n\nby 21% and now holds 490,000 shares. The billionaire reduced his holding in Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) by 11% and now owns 1.4 million shares.\n\nAnd here's the AI buy in the most recently reported quarter:\n\nThis top investor increased his fund's position in Nvidia NVDA 5.27% )\n\nOf course, Tepper's biggest AI bets remain Amazon and Oracle as they make up a larger part of his portfolio. But the move to increase his position in Nvidia signals he sees more potential ahead for this AI leader, even though the stock has soared about 800% over the past two years.\n\nShould you follow David Tepper's moves?\n\nSo, should you follow Tepper's move and buy Nvdia shares? I think so.\n\nWhat I like about Tepper's AI strategy is that he's invested across many top players that already are benefiting from AI. For example, Amazon's cloud business recently reached a $115 billion revenue run rate thanks to its AI products and services. And Oracle says \"record\" AI demand drove its cloud infrastructure revenue up more than 50% in the latest quarter.\n\nEven though Tepper reduced some of these positions, he's still well diversified across these high-potential companies and isn't betting on just one player. But the move to increase the Nvidia stake was a smart one -- and the tech giant makes a great buy for any investor looking to potentially score an AI win.\n\nNvidia dominates the AI chip market and also is a powerhouse across the industry as it offers a broad range of related products and services. This has been driving double- and triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter, and Nvidia's focus on innovation suggest this could continue well into the future. And right now, the stock is trading for a particularly low valuation, at only 29 times forward earnings estimates, offering investors a fantastic entry point.\n\nAll of this means it's a great idea to follow billionaire David Tepper by holding a variety of strong AI players...and picking up more shares of Nvidia.",

Raised in Chicago by his aunt and uncle, Ellison dropped out of college twice\u2014first from the University of Illinois and then from the University of Chicago. Despite never earning a degree, he had a natural talent for programming and problem-solving.\n\nIn the 1970s, while working at tech companies like Ampex and Amdahl, he became fascinated with relational databases after reading an IBM research paper. He saw an opportunity that others overlooked and, in 1977, co-founded Software Development Laboratories, later renamed Oracle Corporation. The company revolutionized how businesses managed and stored data, making Oracle one of the most powerful software companies in the world.\n\nRelated: Larry Ellison\u2019s Rollercoaster Love Life: Marriages, Divorces, and Relationships\n\nHis First Job\n\nBefore becoming a tech giant, Ellison started out writing computer code for various clients, including Ampex, where he worked on a project for the CIA (code-named \"Oracle\"). This project inspired him to create a commercial version of relational database software, which became the foundation of Oracle Corporation.\n\nRelated: Karen S. Lynch\u2019s Daily Routine & Habits for Success\n\nRelated: Jamie Dimon\u2019s Career Timeline: How He Became a Banking Icon\n\nHow Much Has He Made from His Career?\n\nEllison\u2019s wealth has skyrocketed over the years, largely due to Oracle's success. He has consistently been one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of over $140 billion as of 2025. He has made billions through Oracle stock, real estate investments, and stakes in companies like Tesla.\n\nWhat Does Larry Ellison Do Now?\n\nDespite stepping down as Oracle\u2019s CEO in 2014, Ellison remains heavily involved in the company as its Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). He continues to shape Oracle\u2019s strategy, particularly in cloud computing and AI-driven enterprise software.\n\nOutside of Oracle, Ellison is known for his extravagant lifestyle. He owns Lanai, a Hawaiian island, multiple luxury estates, a massive yacht collection, and even a private jet. He\u2019s also a passionate investor in medical research and owns a stake in Tesla.",

AI has opened a whole new growth opportunity for Oracle as customers have been renting its cloud infrastructure to train and deploy AI models and applications. As a result, Oracle has been able to build a massive revenue pipeline that should allow it to deliver strong growth over the next five years.\n\nIt is worth noting that Oracle's impressive run on the stock market over the past couple of years has brought its market cap to $492 billion, recently making it the 15th most valuable company in the U.S. However, there's another company that has significantly outpaced Oracle's returns in the past couple of years thanks to AI.\n\nLet's take a closer look at that name and see why it may be able to overtake Oracle's market cap in the next five years.\n\nBooming AI software demand has supercharged this tech stock\n\nSoftware specialist Palantir Technologies (PLTR 8.31%) delivered phenomenal returns of 1,150% over the past couple of years, which is way higher than the gains clocked by Oracle. This remarkable run brought Palantir's market cap to $249 billion as of this writing. Not surprisingly, Palantir's market cap growth has outpaced Oracle's by a massive margin.\n\nAI played a central role in this massive jump in Palantir's stock price over the past couple of years. Customers looking to integrate AI software into their operations have been flocking toward Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), leading to an acceleration in the company's growth. This is evident in the chart below.\n\nThe good part is that Palantir's growth likely will keep getting better over the next five years considering the huge end-market opportunity the company is tapping. According to one estimate, the global generative AI software market could jump fourfold between 2024 and 2030, generating an annual revenue of $391 billion.\n\nPalantir reported 29% revenue growth in 2024 to $2.87 billion, indicating that it has massive room for growth over the next five years. More importantly, Palantir is on its way to making the most of this huge opportunity thanks to its fast-growing customer base and its ability to win more business from existing customers.\n\nFor example, the company's overall customer base shot up by an impressive 43% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Even better, the increasing size of the contracts that Palantir signed led to an impressive 40% year-over-year jump in its remaining deal value (RDV) last quarter to $5.4 billion. That number is well ahead of the company's $3.75 billion revenue estimate for 2025, suggesting that it could deliver better-than-expected results going forward.\n\nAlso, Palantir's existing customers tend to increase their adoption of AIP after signing the initial contract. That's one of the reasons why there was a 56% year-over-year increase in the company's total contract value (TCV) last quarter to $1.8 billion. So, it won't be surprising to see Palantir's RDV growth remaining solid over the next few years as more companies adopt generative AI software and sign bigger deals with the company.\n\nOne key reason why Palantir has been able to attract customers toward its AIP is because the company has been ranked as the top provider of AI software by third-party research firms. So, the stage seems set for Palantir to keep growing at an incredible pace over the next five years, but will it be able to deliver enough upside to overtake Oracle?\n\nCan this red-hot stock become more valuable than Oracle?\n\nIf Palantir manages to sustain its remarkable rally on the back of outstanding growth, it may not take five years for the software specialist to overtake Oracle's market cap. After all, Palantir's market cap would have to grow by 97% to reach Oracle's levels, and Palantir has reduced the gap between their value by a huge margin in 2025 already.\n\nOf course, some might point out Palantir is trading at extremely lofty multiples right now when compared to Oracle, and that could limit the former's upside.\n\nHowever, if you look past the valuation, compare the growth rates of the two companies, and take into consideration Palantir's leading position in the AI software platforms market, there is a strong possibility that it may be able to justify its valuation in the long term. Palantir's earnings growth, for instance, is expected to be triple Oracle's in the current fiscal year. That trend is expected to continue in the future as well.\n\nSo, the market could reward Palantir's stronger earnings growth with more upside when compared to Oracle stock over the next five years, and that could help Palantir become a more valuable company.",

The authority has since been unable to provide compliant financial management and now plans to reimplement the product.\n\nThe estimated total cost has gone from around \u00a319 million ($24.07 million) to \u00a3108 million ($137 million), with schools taken out of scope.\n\nA report from independent auditors Grant Thornton shows council officers and the digital department did not have a sufficient understanding of the Oracle Fusion solution they had selected in a procurement process in 2019.\n\nOfficers' understanding of the system was \"limited,\" meaning they relied on external partners to design the solution and manage the program, the report says. At the same time, the Digital and Customer Services directorate's lack of Oracle knowledge meant it struggled to act as an \"intelligent customer\" and critique the work of systems integrator Evosys or other suppliers.\n\n\"The failure to properly invest in ERP implementation capacity and capability and to manage the turnover of staff in key positions within the program was a significant weakness in arrangements,\" the Value for Money report states.\n\n\"The failed implementation of the ERP system has fundamentally impacted the Council's financial management and its operations. In our view the council has failed to fulfil its duty to deliver best value and did not put in place proper arrangements to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources in relation to this project\".\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, a council spokesperson said the authority will \"take on board\" its findings and that it was making significant progress in reimplementing Oracle and \"getting our finances back on track.\"\n\n\"We have worked to significantly strengthen governance, to understand the issues within the system, and to learn lessons from what went wrong,\" they said.\n\nThe disastrous ERP project contributed to the council becoming effectively bankrupt in September 2023, with unsettled equal pay liabilities also a factor.\n\nAn earlier report from the auditors found that, two-and-a-half years after going live, the Oracle system was still not \"safe and compliant\" and had \"effectively crippled the council's ability to manage and report on finances.\"\n\nGrant Thornton's assessment says the council had not fully resolved the design of the solution before it went live. At the same time, the council is \"unlikely to have a fully functioning finance system until at least 2026,\" when the reimplementation is scheduled to go live.\n\nIn April last year, it emerged that the council did not have an audit trail in the accounting system for nearly 18 months, meaning that from April 2022 until August or September 2023, it was unable to determine whether any financial fraud had taken place using the system.\n\nBirmingham City Council is responsible for a budget of around \u00a33.2 billion ($3.98 billion), which covers spending on social care, schools, refuse collection, and other services. \u00ae",

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this software maker have returned +7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.8% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has lost 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOracle is expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.22 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.89 indicates a change of +10.7% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Oracle.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",

But in this case, that one person happens to be one of the world\u2019s leading achievers, thinkers, and visionaries, and someone who has compounded that ability to see over the horizon with a 50-year track record of consistently turning his dreams into wildly successful outcomes.\n\nSo any business executive who\u2019s still undecided about whether AI is simply the latest ultra-luminescent high-tech shiny object that\u2019ll be largely forgotten in a year or two might very well want to reconsider that do-nothing stance.\n\nAnd Ellison\u2019s second big message was also utterly unequivocal: The road to AI nirvana is paved with large quantities of high-quality and fully accessible data.\n\nHere\u2019s my favorite excerpt from Ellison\u2019s video interview because here Ellison provides the evidence for his whole-hearted belief that AI solutions will \u2014 more than any innovation in human history \u2014 transform and improve life for billions of people around the world :\n\n\u201cWe will have incredible reasoning power, the ability to discover things that would elude the human mind because this next generation of AI is going to reason so much faster and discover insights so much faster, whether it\u2019s being able to diagnose cancer in early stages or design therapies, custom-design vaccines for those cancers that are custom-made for your genomics and your specific tumor antigens. So in medicine, we\u2019ll see revolutions in diagnostics and in therapeutics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started a project where we\u2019re gathering satellite imagery from Kenya to California. And we can predict crop yields \u2014 so we could actually tell a farmer or an entire country whether they\u2019re going to exceed what they expect from this year\u2019s harvest or they\u2019re going to have a shortfall and need to start preparing for that. We can tell individual farmers that a part of their field needs more irrigation, or part of their field needs additional fertilizer. So we can improve yields on an individual farm, and also on a much larger scale where we can improve yields across countries and even across entire regions of the world.\n\n\u201cI can go on and on, but AI will fundamentally change our lives in medicine, agriculture, and robotics across the board.\u201d\n\nBut to turn all that extraordinary potential into reality, Ellison said, people must recognize the essential role of data, which Ellison referred to as \u201cthe missing link.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Ellison said, the world\u2019s data is \u201cfragmented \u2014 it\u2019s not easily accessible by these AI models. We have to take all of this data we have in our countries and move it into a single, if you will, \u2018unified data platform\u2019 so that when we want to ask a question, we\u2019ve provided that AI model with all the data it needs to understand our country.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big step \u2014 that\u2019s the missing link \u2014 we need to unify all of the national data, put it into a database where it\u2019s easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like,\u201d Ellison said.\n\n\u201cThe secret is to get all that data in one place. Without having the basic data, the AI model doesn\u2019t have the context and cannot answer the [specific] questions about your country.\u201d\n\nEllison offered two broad examples of where this unification of data can enable AI to drive unprecedented innovation and advances: healthcare and agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe will have incredible reasoning power, the ability to discover things that would elude the human mind because this next generation of AI is going to reason so much faster and discover insights so much faster, whether it\u2019s being able to diagnose cancer in early stages or design therapies, custom-design vaccines for those cancers that are custom-made for your genomics and your specific tumor antigens. So in medicine, we\u2019ll see revolutions in diagnostics and in therapeutics,\u201d Ellison said.\n\nTurning to the potential for farmers to use AI to dramatically boost yields, Ellison described the power of blending high-level data with country-specific and even farm-specific data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started a project where we\u2019re gathering satellite imagery from Kenya to California,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd with it we can predict crop yields \u2014 so we could actually tell a farmer or an entire country whether they\u2019re going to exceed what they expect from this year\u2019s harvest, or if they\u2019re going to have a shortfall and need to start preparing for that. We can tell individual farmers that a part of their field needs more irrigation, or part of their field needs additional fertilizer. So we can improve yields on an individual farm, and also on a much larger scale where we can improve yields across countries and even across entire regions of the world.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty big dream to dream: boosting food production not only for individual farms or even for specific countries, but indeed across entire regions of the globe \u2014 entire continents! That\u2019s a scale of achievement that truly reveals the promise that Ellison believes AI holds.\n\nAnd the path forward, he said, moving beyond the original large language models that stunned the world a couple of years ago to providing smaller and purpose-built models that provide new and high-value insights into countries or parts of countries.\n\n\u201cEverybody talks about the big AI models and they are astonishing, but how do you provide a context? Such as, \u2018I want to ask a question about my country. What\u2019s going on in my country? What\u2019s happening with my farmers? I need to give it my climate data!\u2019,\u201d Ellison said\n\n\u201cWell, the model probably has your climate data already. But you need to know exactly what crops are growing on which farms to predict the output. So I have to take those satellite images from my country and feed that into a database that is accessible by the AI model. And I have to tell the AI model as much about my country as I can. You tell part of the story with these satellite images \u2014they give you a huge amount of information \u2014 and then you add to that by telling the model where roads are, where borders are, where utilities are.\u201d\n\nFinal Thought\n\nThat approach \u2014 from the very large to the very small \u2014 seems perfectly obvious to us today, but that great clarity was certainly not the case a couple of years ago when OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was released and shocked the world. (As Ellison so elegantly described it, \u201cThe newborn baby talked.\u201d)\n\nIn the seminal 1962 masterpiece The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn describes the foundational changes that disrupt how we view the world around us, and the processes by which those new visions arise. Writing as he did more than 60 years ago, Kuhn says these upheavals can take decades to come to fruition as various traditions and institutions and dogmas must be confronted, challenged, and overcome.\n\nBut today, rather than durations of many years or even decades, we\u2019re seeing such revolutions take mere months. And when a dreamer and achiever of Larry Ellison\u2019s stature can be convinced in just 18 months that the greatest achievement in human history is at hand, I would suggest we all ask ourselves if this is a revolution that we\u2019re going to choose to sit out.\n\nAnd I hope we all answer, \u201cHell, no.\u201d\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

At the same time, tech giant Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) is bouncing all around. Up nearly 4% earlier in the day, it's currently in the red, down 0.2%.\n\nAnd I think you can blame investment bank TD Cowen for all of this.\n\nTD Cowen's bombshell AI news\n\nIn a report over the weekend, analysts from TD Cowen noted that Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%), an early investor in AI and in OpenAI in particular, has recently canceled \"a couple of hundred MWs\" worth of data center leases in the United States, and has \"pulled back\" on projects that would have resulted in further new data center leases.\n\nCowen notes that Microsoft is citing construction delays and lack of access to power as excuses for trying to get out of its leases. Also, Microsoft seems to be particularly reluctant to enter into new data center leases outside the U.S., add the analysts.\n\nAnd why is this important? \"Microsoft was the most active lessee of capacity in 2023 and 1H24, at which time it was procuring capacity [to service] OpenAI workloads,\" says TD, and had announced plans to invest $80 billion in data centers in 2025. But Microsoft also appears to be having second thoughts about how many data centers it really needs, and \"the company may have excess data center capacity relative to its new forecast.\"\n\nBigger picture, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted in an interview last week that AI infrastructure appears to be on a path toward overcapacity, which may be why Microsoft adopted a strategy of entering into leases of data centers, rather than owning them outright (because a lease is temporary, and can be abandoned once no longer needed).\n\nWhat all this means for C3, NuScale, and Oracle\n\nThe strange thing is that Microsoft already seems to be thinking it may not need all the data center capacity that it thought it did need as early as last month. That would explain why NuScale stock is declining, for example.\n\nIf there's less need for data centers, then there will be less need for nuclear energy to power them -- Microsoft's excuses about lacking access to sufficient power notwithstanding. (In fact, if lack of power were the real reason Microsoft is backing out of leases, you'd think that would be bullish for NuScale's business.)\n\nA decline in Microsoft's interest in AI and data centers would also explain weakness in C3.ai's stock price today. If Microsoft is becoming less enthusiastic about growth in demand for AI services, that would be bearish for C3.\n\nWhere I think investors might be getting things wrong, though, is on Oracle, which as you'll recall is taking on a big role in President Donald Trump's $500 billion Stargate AI project, in alliance with Japan's Softbank and OpenAI. On the one hand, yes, decreased optimism from Microsoft about AI demand might imply bad things for Oracle. On the other hand, though, if part of the reason Microsoft is easing up on the gas in AI is because Oracle will be providing data center services to OpenAI going forward, lessening demand for Microsoft to provide these services, and therefore lessening Microsoft's need for data centers... well, that would make a lot of sense.\n\nIt wouldn't be bad news for Oracle at all. It wouldn't even be \"new\" news for Oracle, but rather just the logical consequence of Oracle's own news.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not super optimistic about Oracle stock in any case, not at its present valuation of 41 times earnings and nearly 9 times trailing sales. Those numbers alone might be a good reason to sell some Oracle stock. I just don't think TD Cowen's report adds a second reason to sell Oracle.",

Eight years and more than $500 million later, the project is still floundering.\n\nEllison dreamed of AI-powered greenhouses and robot harvesters feeding the world sustainably. Instead, Sensei has been tripped up by tech snarls \u2014 like Wi-Fi issues and solar panels battered by Lanai\u2019s winds \u2014 and rookie mistakes. Think greenhouses designed for Israel\u2019s desert climate, when L\u0101na\u2019i is typically muggy.

Its lettuce and cherry tomatoes now appear at the island\u2019s few local markets and restaurants.

            "content": "What happens when you take a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, swap in a 575-horsepower HEMI V8, and then completely reimagine it as a high-performance, open-air supertruck? Well, you get the SoFlo Speedster. It\u2019s one of the latest creations from SoFlo Customs, a Florida-based company known for pushing the boundaries of off-road vehicle modification.\n\nThe Speedster isn\u2019t just a lifted Jeep with a big engine. It\u2019s a ground-up re-engineering project. While it starts life as a four-door Wrangler Rubicon, the transformation is quite radical.\n\nThe rear of the vehicle is converted into an almost 5-foot pickup bed, complete with a custom steel rollcage and a hidden 2 by 2-foot storage compartment. The doors, \u201ctee-tops,\u201d and even the rear glass are removable, offering a true open-air driving experience.\n\nBut the heart of the Speedster is its powerplant. SoFlo Customs replaced the standard engine with a tuned 392 6.4-liter HEMI V8, pumping out a monstrous 575 horsepower. The upgraded power is due in part to a performance chip tune and an upgraded exhaust. The company also paired this with a low center of gravity, a sports-tuned suspension, and massive 40 x 15.50-inch Nitto tires on 22-inch Fuel Off Road SFJ rims. As a result, according to SoFlo Customs, this 4\u00d74 beast can handle complex terrains and can thrash American legends like the Chevy Corvette and Ford Mustang.\n\nThe Speedster\u2019s aggressive looks also match its performance. It features an armored coating, a HellFire Grumper 2.0, and custom accents throughout. Its interior is fully weatherproofed and features modern amenities like Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, heated seats, and an advanced surround sound system.\n\nThe underlying Jeep Rubicon platform also provides additional features like adaptive cruise control, front and rear lockers, and an electronically disconnecting front sway bar.\n\n\u201cThe Speedster\u2019s drive bests a Corvette, without the driver ever worrying about curbing the rims or even caring if it starts raining when the top is off,\u201d said Joseph Ghattas, Founder and CEO of SoFlo Customs.\n\nFor off-road enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies looking for something truly unique, the SoFlo Speedster might be a good choice. It offers a blend of open-air freedom, extreme performance, and undeniable presence. Is this the ultimate go-anywhere, do-anything machine? Well, it certainly makes a strong case.",

            "content": "Howard Marks. The name resonates with value investors and knowledge about distressed debt. He is someone who appreciates a clear, level-headed perspective in the often-turbulent world of finance. He is a co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. It is a firm renowned for its expertise in navigating troubled waters. Similarly, Marks has built a reputation for identifying opportunities where others see only risk. So, what exactly is he betting on these days?\n\nLet\u2019s pull back the curtain and take a closer look at the portfolio Howard Marks steering at Oaktree.\n\nForget chasing the latest tech fad or meme stock frenzy. Marks\u2019 approach is fundamentally about unearthing value, managing risk, and understanding the cyclical nature of markets. He\u2019s not afraid to wade into less glamorous sectors. He can sniff opportunities where irrational fear or market inefficiencies have created mispriced assets.\n\nNow, you won\u2019t get a complete, real-time picture of everything Oaktree holds. But SEC 13F filings, which are our primary source of publicly available data, only offer a snapshot of certain equity holdings.\n\nThink of it as a glimpse through a keyhole, rather than a full panoramic view. However, even this partial view provides valuable insights into Howard Marks\u2019 thinking. Here is a brief glimps into his stock portfolio.\n\nHoward Marks Stock Portfolio\n\nStock Name Ticker Shares Held Portfolio Weight (%) Value (USD) Notes TORM PLC TRMD 40,581,120 25.97% $1,443,063,000 Reduced by 8% (-3.53M shares) Expand Energy Corp (formerly Chesapeake Energy) EXE (CHK) 6,900,000 10.61% $566,000,000 Steady holding, no recent buy Garrett Motion Inc GTX 35,881,000 6.77% $361,000,000 No significant change Sitio Royalties Corp STR 12,000,000 5.06% $270,000,000 Steady holding Infinera Corp INFN 25,000,000 3.19% $170,000,000 No significant change Star Bulk Carriers Corp SBLK 6,500,000 2.53% $135,000,000 No significant change Talen Energy Corp TLN 699,000 2.37% $125,000,000 New buy in Q3 2024 Runway Growth Finance Corp RWAY 10,800,000 2.36% $125,000,000 Reduced by 30% (-4.7M shares) Vistra Corp VST 1,000,000 2.03% $112,000,000 Steady holding Ally Financial Inc ALLY 3,000,000 1.93% $107,000,000 No significant change California Resources Corp CRC 2,050,000 1.92% $106,000,000 New buy in Q3 2024 EnLink Midstream LLC ENLC 2,530,000 0.61% $33,800,000 New buy in Q3 2024 Indivior PLC INDV 1,800,000 0.50% $27,500,000 Increased by 111.92% (+950K shares) Liberty Global Ltd-A LBTYA 3,801,637 1.15% $66,260,000 Increased by 57.12% (+1.38M shares) Yum China Holdings Inc YUMC 500,000 0.32% $17,500,000 New buy in Q3 2024\n\nAs of the most recent filings (Q3 2024), Oaktree\u2019s portfolio, managed under Marks\u2019 watchful eye, reveals a strategic blend of sectors. It shows a definite lean towards industries that generate consistent cash flows or present undervalued prospects.\n\nThe firm manages a substantial portfolio worth around $5.55 billion, while total assets under management exceed $180 billion.\n\nTop Holdings\n\nLet\u2019s zoom in on the top positions. Right off the bat, TORM PLC, a shipping company specializing in refined oil products, jumps out. With over 25% of the portfolio allocated to this single company, it\u2019s clear Marks sees compelling value in the shipping sector. Perhaps he believes in the resilience of global energy demand, the ongoing need for refined product transportation, or a combination of both.\n\nNext up, we have Expand Energy Corp, formerly known as Chesapeake Energy, clocking in at around 10.6% of the portfolio. This suggests a continued bullishness on the energy sector, especially companies that have undergone restructuring and emerged with stronger fundamentals. Marks isn\u2019t necessarily chasing the latest renewable energy hype. He\u2019s betting on the enduring importance of energy production, particularly from companies that have weathered past storms.\n\nThen there\u2019s Garrett Motion Inc., an automotive technology firm focusing on turbochargers, which occupies about 6.8% of the portfolio. This is a fascinating play on innovation within the automotive industry. Even as the world shifts towards electric vehicles, improving the efficiency of traditional combustion engines remains crucial, particularly for hybrid models and for markets where EV adoption is slower.\n\nRounding out the top five, we find Sitio Royalties Corp (5%) and Infinera Corp (smaller stake). Sitio Royalties offers exposure to oil and gas royalties, providing a stream of income tied to commodity prices without the operational complexities of actually drilling for oil. Infinera, a telecommunications equipment company, suggests a strategic bet on the ongoing expansion of digital infrastructure.\n\nFresh Bets\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Q3 2024?\n\nThe beauty of analyzing these filings isn\u2019t just in the static snapshot; it\u2019s in tracking the changes over time.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Oaktree was actively adjusting its positions. While reducing its TORM stake by about 8%, possibly to lock in gains or rebalance the portfolio, the firm was also adding some intriguing new names.\n\nOne significant addition was Talen Energy Corp . Oaktree scooped up nearly 700,000 shares, making it a sizable holding. Talen, with its nuclear assets, aligns with Marks\u2019 interest in the energy sector.\n\n. Oaktree scooped up nearly 700,000 shares, making it a sizable holding. Talen, with its nuclear assets, aligns with Marks\u2019 interest in the energy sector. Other new energy plays include California Resources Corp and EnLink Midstream .\n\nand . Oaktree also increased its stakes in Indivior PLC and Liberty Global Ltd-A .\n\nand . And also took a position in Yum China Holdings Inc.\n\nBeyond Equities\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that 13F filings only paint a partial picture.\n\nOaktree\u2019s roots lie in distressed investing, and the firm maintains a significant presence in the following asset classes as well:\n\nDebt instruments,\n\nPreferred stocks, and\n\nConvertible bonds.\n\nMarks has also recently hinted at opportunities in private equity and real estate, particularly in areas where high interest rates are putting pressure on leveraged assets. These areas are not transparently reported.\n\nThe Marks Mindset\n\nUltimately, Howard Marks\u2019 portfolio at Oaktree reflects a disciplined, value-driven strategy. It\u2019s about finding opportunities in cyclical or out-of-favor industries, often where others see only risk.\n\nThe portfolio isn\u2019t static; it\u2019s constantly being re-evaluated and adjusted based on market conditions. With a turnover rate around 11%, Oaktree balances conviction with flexibility.\n\nIn a world often driven by hype and short-term speculation, Howard Marks offers a refreshing dose of long-term thinking and disciplined value investing.\n\nBy carefully studying his portfolio, we can gain valuable insights into his approach and potentially identify opportunities that others might be overlooking.\n\nIt\u2019s not about blindly copying his moves, but about learning from his methodology and applying it to our own investment decisions. After all, as Marks himself often says, \u201cInvesting is a thinking man\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nHave a happy investing.",

This resulted in the implementation failing at a significant cost to the council, contributing to a breakdown of financial control such that it has been unable to adequately control its finances throughout 2022/23, 2023/24 and into 2024/25.\n\n\u201cThe governance and programme management for the Oracle programme had fundamental weaknesses that were never effectively remedied and were further exposed by high turnover of staff in both senior and operational roles,\u201d they said.\n\nBirmingham City Council implemented an SAP ERP system, ECC6, in 1999, for finance, procurement, HR and payroll purposes. Over the years, it was customised to fit the organisation\u2019s business processes. In 2006, Capita was engaged to provide council services, including the hosting of the SAP instance.\n\nAnd then came SAP\u2019s ERP system based on its reportedly high-speed, columnar, in-memory database, Hana, S/4 Hana, in 2015. SAP also announced end of support for the older ERP by 2025, later extended to 2027.\n\nLike many other SAP customers, Birmingham had a choice to make. It opted to switch to cloud-based Oracle Fusion, following advice from Socitm Advisory, and announced its decision in July 2019.\n\nIt also announced programme support contracts for Insight UK Ltd, in partnership with Evosys for systems integration; Socitm Advisory, for programme and change management; and Egress, for data migration services.\n\nRead more about the failed Oracle implementation at Birmingham City Council Birmingham City Council\u2019s Oracle system \u2013 the biggest of its kind in Europe \u2013 went live in April 2022, resulting in a catastrophic IT failure. Cliff Saran investigates.\n\nRead how the council swapped out a heavily customised SAP ERP system for Oracle Cloud; but after going live, it had numerous technical challenges. Cliff Saran explains what went wrong with Birmingham City Council\u2019s Oracle implementation.\n\nBirmingham sets aside \u00a325m for Oracle transformation.\n\nAmeo Professional Services was appointed to provide programme management and assurance to the council from January 2021. The effectiveness of Ameo and the other suppliers is the subject of another report commissioned by the council, Grant Thornton says. Its findings are legally privileged, according to the auditor, and they are not included in the 11 February 2025 report.\n\nAs previously reported in Computer Weekly, the financial business case for the upgrade showed that the SAP system, run by Capita, was costing the council \u00a35.1m per year. Over the nine years between 2022/2023 and 2031/2032, this would amount to \u00a346m. For the same period, the Oracle system was meant to save \u00a3563k in 2022/23 and \u00a3788k in 2023/2024, with the savings accumulating over the nine years to \u00a310.9m.\n\nIn August 2019, the council ended its contract with Capita and the majority of IT services were transitioned to an in-house team, including 300-plus Capita staff, for the most part not Oracle specialists. Building in-house Oracle capability proved to be \u201cvery challenging\u201d, according to the report.\n\nAs previously reported in Computer Weekly, after the go-live in 2022, the Oracle system required manual remediation to fix accounting issues. The council\u2019s 2024 financial report showed a budget of \u00a35.3m for continued support and manual intervention on the Oracle system.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors do note that the failure of the implementation of Oracle Fusion has been a \u201ccontributory factor to the council\u2019s financial position rather than being a fundamental factor\u201d. Birmingham City Council effectively went bankrupt in 2023.\n\nIt also notes that the implementation programme failed to adhere to its design principles to adopt Oracle-standard functionality, instead choosing to adapt it to align with the council\u2019s existing processes.",

This is for a number of reasons: first the deadline for Canada to enter as a state is coming up soon - the end of June.\n\nAnd second, the Canada market is two-pronged: to resolve \u201cyes,\u201d Canada must be annexed by the US and some portion of it must be admitted as a US state. Given longstanding Republican resistance to admitting left-leaning DC and Puerto Rico, it\u2019s likely that the statehood condition is doing a lot of work in keeping the odds down.\n\nThe first spike in the chart to ~4% occurred before Trump\u2019s inauguration when Trump said he was willing to use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to bring Canada into the fold on January 7.\n\nBluff?\n\nThe dominant reaction on both sides of the border has been to call it a bluff, for example comments made by former Republican anti-Trump congressman Adam Kinzinger on Canadian TV\n\nOn the other hand, people closer to MAGA world like Steve Bannon, say Trump is deadly serious about hemispheric control, reaching for the Arctic towards a north-south economic and military corridor.\n\nAnd as president, Trump continues his rhetoric, calling the Canadian Prime Minister \u201cGovernor Trudeau\u201d at his recent announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs.\n\nTrump also mentioned it this week in reference to the 4 Nations Face-Off hockey game between the two countries on Truth Social, where three fights broke out between the US and Canadian teams in the first nine seconds.\n\nHow Could the US Annex Canada?\n\nBut hey, 2% ain\u2019t nothing. And if you\u2019re right, you could turn $100 into a decently spec\u2019d Macbook Pro. So let\u2019s look at what it would actually take for the market to resolve \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nAccording to Canadian law, Canada could peacefully join the union with unanimous support from the Canadian Senate, House of Commons, and all 10 provincial legislatures.\n\nTrump would then need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to acquire Canada as a territory through a treaty. Then he would need a House majority and 60 votes in the Senate to make Canada a state.\n\nBut a military invasion of Canada is a different story.\n\nCanada last faced threats of annexation in the 1860s, when it was still known as British North America, with looming sentiments of American \u2018manifest destiny\u2019 bringing in dreams of northward expansion. Politicians in now-Canadian territories freaked out, got their shit together, unified, and created what we now know as Canada in 1867.\n\nThere is also War Plan Red, a 1930s war strategy drafted by the US to prepare for a war with the UK, which they assumed would probably ally with Canada.\n\nThe closest thing to an actual invasion took place during the War of 1812 when American armies invaded what is now Canada in three failed campaigns. British army forces burned the White House, while American forces set what is now Toronto ablaze.\n\nThis put an end to America\u2019s first attempts at northward expansion.\n\nWhat Canadian Leaders Say\n\nTrudeau's response to the threat of annexation was that there was not a \u201csnowball's chance in hell\u201d that Trump could annex Canada, prompting Elon Musk to clap back on X:\n\nDespite Trudeau's firm stance, he was heard privately telling business leaders behind closed doors that Trump's annexation threats were real.\n\nOn the other hand, Canada\u2019s likely next Prime Minister (\ud83d\udd2e73% odds), Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre has also rejected annexation.\n\nPublic Opinion\n\nThis past Saturday was Flag Day in Canada, and stores were surprised to see a surge in sales of the red maple leaf.\n\nCanadians are taking the threat seriously. Just 1 in 10 believe that Trump is joking about annexation threats.\n\nNine out of 10 polled Canadians are against the idea of joining their neighbours in the South. Young people seemed more open to the idea, with 30% of those 18-34 saying they would be open to it if they could get U.S. citizenship and convert their Canadian assets to USD.\n\nAnd while more Americans oppose the idea of having Canada join the US, 36% of Americans still support it.\n\nEconomic Force?\n\nAll this discussion comes against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s trade pressure against Canada.\n\nAlthough Trump initially promised 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Day 1, he backtracked and pushed for a new deadline of February 1. Canada and Mexico, however, got a last-minute reprieve.\n\nTariffs could be a sign of Trump\u2019s plans to use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to annex Canada. Unless further delays are implemented, tariffs will be in place by March 4. But it seems that further negotiations are on the table: on Polymarket there\u2019s only a 45% chance a general tariff is in effect against Canada by May 1.\n\nSome in Canada\u2019s business community see upside from closer economic, if not political ties with the US. Perhaps the highest profile of these voices is Kevin O\u2019Leary, AKA \u201cMr. Wonderful,\u201d famous for his role on Shark Tank, who spoke out in favour of an \u201ceconomic union\u201d with the United States.\n\nHe and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith went to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump in early January.\n\nNext Canadian Governor Prime Minister?\n\nThe Trump plan to annex Canada may be affecting Canadian politics at a fundamental level.\n\nCanada is set for a new leader this year, with its next election scheduled for October 20, 2025. A few months ago, conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre was the 90% favorite for Prime Minister, but there has been slippage in his odds beginning around the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThis likely reflects that Canadians will have to judge which candidate is best equipped to face Trump\u2019s pressure campaign from the south. And that Canada is not just facing threats, but an existential crisis.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nConnect With The Oracle\n\nTips? Feedback? Story ideas?

The intention is to improve the functionality and scalability of prediction markets and blockchain data. By collaborating with EigenLayer, the infrastructure provided by EigenLayer, such as the restake mechanism and EIGEN token, will be used to develop our Oracle system, aiming at higher reliability and scalability.\n\nFocus on Community-Driven Consensus\n\nAn \u201cintersubjective truth\u201d will be the core feature of the new oracle system. This concept is based on facts agreed upon by society and does not solely depend on objective data like mathematical proof. This approach makes sense regarding prediction markets since it is based on consensus within the community about an outcome.\n\nWe\u2019re working with @UMAprotocol and @Polymarket to research a next-gen oracle utilizing the intersubjective security uniquely enabled by EigenLayer and the EIGEN token.\n\n\n\nMore details \u2193 https://t.co/1LmZgf8Uk3 \u2014 EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) February 19, 2025\n\nIn blockchain ecosystems, oracles are very important as they provide real-world data to smart contracts. These mechanisms are essential for decentralized applications (dApps) where one might need to get external information such as price, weather, event results, etc. In the prediction markets realm, community dispute resolutions are key, and collaboration between EigenLayer, Polymarket, and UMA aims to improve the acceleration and scaling of oracles.\n\nIntegration of EigenLayer\u2019s Restaking Mechanism\n\nEigenLayer offers a unique restaking mechanism allowing users to reuse staked ETH or liquid staking tokens to secure services like oracles. This innovation strengthens the security of decentralized platforms by leveraging Ethereum\u2019s security infrastructure. With this collaboration Ethereum stakers can help secure the new oracle, providing additional layers of economic security.\n\nUMA\u2019s existing Optimistic Oracle system, which Polymarket uses to settle its markets, will also be integrated into the new Oracle framework. In the current UMA system, a dispute involving a challenge to a market outcome is resolved through a decentralized voting mechanism. The new system will build upon this foundation to handle more scenarios and increase the capacity to manage prediction markets as they grow.\n\nThe three organizations are partnering to develop a blockchain oracle that has the potential to scale and power the community. Utilizing EigenLayer\u2019s restaking mechanism and augmenting UMA\u2019s decentralized oracle system, this collaboration aims to ensure that the oracle can satisfy the increasing needs of prediction markets and other decentralized applications.\n\nUMA and Polymarket\u2019s Role in the Oracle Development\n\nPolymarket has long used UMA\u2019s oracle system to settle prediction market outcomes. The current system allows a proposer to submit the outcome of an event, such as a political election or sports match. UMA\u2019s decentralized voting mechanism resolves disagreements if the outcome is disputed.\n\nWith the addition of EigenLayer\u2019s infrastructure, the new Oracle system will offer enhanced security and capacity, addressing the growing need for reliable data in decentralized platforms. The collaboration aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of prediction markets while enabling them to scale more effectively.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve had quite a few dreams and aspirations in my adult life thus far. One of them was owning an espresso machine. As someone who would typically choose a cappuccino over a cup of drip coffee, the idea of waking up every morning and enjoying the perfect mug of milky espresso from the comfort of my own home seemed like the pinnacle of luxury.\n\nBesides the obvious barriers to entry of price and counter space, one of the main reasons I waited so long to make my dream a reality was that, well, I was intimidated. The world of coffee\u2014and espresso in particular\u2014is one that intrigues me, but I\u2019m admittedly no expert. And while the science nerd in me feels somewhat compelled to spend time delving deep into grind size and ratios and extraction times, the reality is I\u2019ve always felt daunted at the prospect of actually doing so\u2014and wary of investing in a machine that would be so complicated to use, I\u2019d end up forgoing it anyway. At the same time, I shied away from the idea of fully automatic machines that operate at the push of a button, because the wannabe barista in me wants to feel like I\u2019m doing something as I make my morning cup. That, and I\u2019ve never found the espresso those kinds of machines make to be all that good.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when I got wind that Breville was launching a new top of the line, not-quite automatic espresso machine that promised to guide me through all of the processes I was intimidated by, I was immediately intrigued. The machine in question? The Oracle Jet, the latest in Breville\u2019s Oracle line after 2017\u2019s Oracle Touch. The Jet shares many of the same features that made contributor Carina Finn fall in love with the Oracle Touch when she tested it\u2014namely, an easy-to-use touchscreen display with a multitude of drink programs, automatic grinding, dosing, and tamping, and an automatic milk frother. But the newer machine has several key improvements that make it an even better pick for home espresso drinkers\u2014and after months of testing, I can say quite confidently that there is no other machine I\u2019d rather own.\n\nHow does the Breville Oracle Jet work?\n\nThe Oracle Jet is about as close to a super-automatic machine as you can get without actually being super-automatic. That is to say, you still have to complete a few steps along the way to your latte.\n\nAfter unboxing my machine on its arrival, I was delighted to find that there was no need to flip through a physical manual. The entire setup process was explained (very clearly, I\u2019ll add) via the touchscreen display, and the steps were laid out in a logical order, which I really appreciated.\n\nAfter the initial set up, the display guided me through making my first drink and calibrating the grind size for the beans I had on hand. I had to make several rounds of espresso to get the ideal grind size (which the machine suggests based on extraction speed). As someone with no espresso machine experience but who likes to know why and how things work, I found this process fun and helpful, a great jumping off point in my own espresso journey.\n\nWithin 30 minutes of receiving my machine in the mail, I had set it all up and made a pretty damn good cappuccino\u2014far better than the $6 ones I get from my local coffee shop, that\u2019s for sure. To make a coffee drink, you\u2019ll start by selecting from a catalogue of options (12+ at the time of writing) and inserting the portafilter under the grinder chute. Press the grind icon to begin the grinding process, after which it will automatically be tamped down. Then you\u2019ll move the portafilter over to the group head, twist it into place, and press the brew icon to start the extraction process. The display will count the extraction time for you, and even suggest adjusting the grind size for next time if it notices the extraction taking too long or too short. If you\u2019re making a milk-based drink, the last step is to add your milk of choice to the included stainless steel pitcher, place it under the steam wand, and press the milk frothing icon. The wand will steam the milk to whatever temperature and foam level you\u2019ve selected (and according to which type of milk you used, be it animal or plant-based). After you\u2019ve removed the pitcher, you\u2019ll wipe down the wand and lower it back into place, where it\u2019ll shoot out hot water to purge any remaining milk from the system.",

With deep integration into OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion Stargate Project, ORCL has all the resources needed to dominate the high-stakes world of AI infrastructure. Of course, there are plenty of risks along the way, but with a growing list of federal contracts, strong revenue growth, and a compelling track record, I\u2019m confident the company can outperform the market.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving strong buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nOracle Takes Aim at Market Peers\n\nThe company functions across three distinct areas, complementing each other as part of the growing enthusiasm for AI architecture. Cloud and Licence are the primary revenue drivers. Still, the Hardware division provides the essential computational backbone for this emerging revolution, supporting a dynamic range of AI-driven workloads and enterprise needs. Meanwhile, the Services unit ensures businesses can optimize and integrate these technologies effectively, also informing future strategic decisions for the company.\n\nOracle (ORCL) price history over the past 12 months\n\nWith the company\u2019s market capitalization now over $486 billion and revenues growing double-digits for the first time in well over a decade, it seems like management has been able to recover from a period when it was simply trying to keep up and is now accelerating past the competition.

Many will consider this a milestone in the AI development story, but some will suggest it is a political move by the new president to capitalize on the work already underway. It represents a considerable investment in developing cutting-edge data centers over the next four years, building enormous capacity and sophistication for future work. Oracle\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) will be crucial in handling the immense processing needs of OpenAI\u2019s models, leading to reliable income in a growing area.\n\nThe first of these data centers is well underway in Texas. Oracle\u2019s strategy of optimizing smaller, regional cloud centers is significant in maintaining a cost-effective edge over competitors.

            "content": "Written by Anna Porter. Graphic by Anna Porter.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day was a big day for new music, including releases from Sabrina Carpenter, ROLE MODEL, and The Lumineers. Flying a bit more under the radar was Parisian-based band, Oracle Sisters, with the release of their second album, titled \u201cDivinations.\u201d Not only did I want to highlight them because I love their music, but they also offered me frozen strawberries at a Declan McKenna gig, so I feel like I owe them a review.\n\nOracle Sisters, despite what you may guess, is not a band made up of sisters. The band is actually composed of three members who were childhood friends, all originating from different countries. Now, the band resides in Paris, where they create bright, lush music that will tickle your sense of sound. While their first album has a good number of upbeat indie-pop songs, I would say this second album strips it back a little bit. The lyrics feel more poetic to me and focused on the aesthetic sensation you feel when a sequence of words comes together to make something new.\n\nUnder the surface of these beautiful lyrics is a deeper storyline, hinted at by the circular album art. At first, listen, I was already relating this album to seasons\u2013 the music felt like the perfect \u201cspring morning\u201d to me. After reading more of the lyrics, I noticed that the first half of the songs have imagery related to mornings, and the second half has songs pertaining to the night. Additionally, there seems to be a central \u201cnarrator\u201d that progresses in age as the album moves along, and the seasons described go from spring to winter as the narrator progresses through his life. I\u2019m sure this was a purposeful decision, partly because the album cover is a wheel split up into different colors, which could represent the cycle of a day, a year, or a lifetime.\n\nThe opening song, \u201cRiverside,\u201d opens with a slow, twangy instrumental and the lyrics, \u201cearly in the morning // open up the window \\\\ set songbirds free.\u201d This song has a very nice build and feels like a great entrance into the descriptive world that Oracle Sisters are painting. The next track, titled \u201cMarseille,\u201d is one of my favorite songs (maybe because I\u2019m weirdly attached to it since I went to Lacoste,) but most likely because it\u2019s one of the more upbeat and groovy songs on the album. The sound of this is true to Oracle Sisters\u2019 already established style.\n\n\u201cAlouette\u201d is one of my favorite songs as well, because of the beautiful writing. It is vague enough to where I can\u2019t quite interpret if there is an underlying storyline, but I like it all the same. Some of the lines such as \u201cThe pirates sing their song // The owls and the artists // And they all sing along\u201d make me lean towards the idea that the narrator is playing outside on a beautiful day as a child.\n\nThe album begins to temporally progress in \u201cBlue Left Hand,\u201d as the narrator establishes that he is now a young adult. In the song \u201cVelveteen,\u201d there is a line that explains that the future is unfolding and that they want to look into the future, referencing the album title\u2013 divination is a way of using magic to see the future.\n\nIn the song \u201cRodeo,\u201d the narrator seeks a different life by joining the rodeo, but the album settles down again in the song \u201cMoon On The Water.\u201d This one is another favorite of mine, again because of the pretty lyrics, and the way they are delivered in almost a sing-songy, simplistic way. \u201cHail Mary // Wild honey pie // Who\u2019s your robin hood? // She\u2019s running with the wolves.\u201d Near the end of the song are the lines, \u201cSunday singer // Elementary boy // Take it from me // You\u2019re not the only one.\u201d At this point in the album, I\u2019ve gathered that the narrator has now had children and fallen in love, and this love interest is mentioned more in the next two songs.\n\nAccording to the way I have interpreted this album as a progression of someone\u2019s life, there are two paths that the final song, \u201cDivinations,\u201d can take. The line \u201cHigh on the clouds // He\u2019s been pulling those powers\u201d seems to mention a God-like figure. Throughout the song, the words \u201cIn a dream // Bye bye // It\u2019s all been a dream\u201d make me think that either the character is dying, or has finished their process of looking into the future through divination and nothing that happened in this album was actually real. I think the latter concept is most likely because of the album title, giving us a clue into what the overall album is about. Sonically, I love this song, and it reminds me of MGMT\u2019s record, \u201cLoss of Life.\u201d The falsetto vocals and descending harpsichord tie directly to MGMT\u2019s style, as do the lyrics that reflect deeply on the meaning of life.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve decoded the rather ambiguous lyrics of this album into a more holistic storyline, I\u2019m looking forward to digging deeper and more fully understanding the narrator\u2019s story. If my theories are true, I am very impressed by Oracle Sisters\u2019 deep album, both sonically and lyrically, and can safely say that they didn\u2019t fall into the sophomore album curse. My next task is to find a crystal ball to see what their musical future holds!",

Unlike the serial grade-avoiders, I\u2019ve become an expert in hiding viewed assignments and testing scores to see what I need on the next exam. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m obsessed with my grades \u2014 rather, checking Aeries is an instinct.\n\nThroughout the four years I\u2019ve been at MVHS, the school has been closing down the grading portal during and after finals week, both in the winter and summer. Students aren\u2019t able to see what scores they received on the final exam, let alone their ultimate grade in the class.\n\nWhile I understand and applaud the fact that the administration desires to lessen both our stress and the stress of its staff members through locking Aeries, I believe that it does more harm than good.\n\nMany students, like myself, are left with even more stress due to not being able to see their grades in a class or on a final exam. This stress doesn\u2019t solely stem from curiosity or a desire for instant gratification. As students, our grades often determine next steps we must take, whether that be rethinking study strategies or making the decision to remain in an accelerated course. Without access to this information, students are left in a sort of limbo, unable to make informed choices for their academic future or evaluate their past performance.\n\nThis uncertainty can only grow and linger throughout break periods, undermining the intended goal of providing us with a stress-free respite from the demands of high school. The locking of Aeries creates unnecessary anxiety \u2014 many of us have specific GPA goals or needs for college admissions, scholarships, personal benchmarks and more. Without timely information, students are simply left wondering in the two-week period that\u2019s supposed to be a break. Every single year of high school, I\u2019ve had multiple conversations with friends and classmates about final grades, speculating when the portal will open and lamenting about the stress its closing causes. Even if the administration\u2019s goal is to ease our stress, the result is often the opposite.\n\nI am sympathetic, of course, to the fact that the ability to see final grades may prompt students to email their teachers about rounding their scores, or other things of the like. Teachers deserve a break too, one without constant student inquiry and interruption. However, the solution to this is relatively simple.\n\nAdministrators could leave the portal open for students to see their grades, but make clear that teachers \u2014 unless they desire to \u2014 will not be responding to any student communication until the end of the break. That way, teachers wouldn\u2019t be pressured to respond to barrages of emails because a prior expectation is already set.\n\nA compromise might be to let students see what they received on the final, but not in the class, allowing staff members ample time to finalize and tweak grades. This way, students are not left wondering if they passed a class or stressed about meeting a certain personal benchmark. Those that may be stressed by the thought of seeing their grades early simply need not look at the platform.\n\nUltimately, the key to reducing students\u2019 stress lies in communication. Locking Aeries for two weeks only fuels anxiety and pressure. By acknowledging many students\u2019 desires to see their grades through this period, the administration can work toward supporting student and teacher well-being, while also upholding a commitment to reduce stress during finals season.",

Murray also pressed him on whether he supports the decision by Trump and Musk last week to fire en masse VA researchers in the middle of research on everything from burn pit exposure to mental health, opioid addiction, and preventing veteran suicide, among much else.\n\n\u201cEHR started in 2018 under President Trump and in 2020, it deployed to two Washington state VA hospitals. Instead of helping to improve our veterans\u2019 health care, the rollout ending up being a complete disaster, and it endangered veteran patients,\u201d Murray said at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cUnfortunately, the system still is not working the way that the VA doctors and nurses need\u2014and veterans are continuing to suffer. Last month, the VA announced that it would be moving forward with pre-deployment activities at the next four sites for this Electronic Health Record.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will oversee the EHR program\u2014so if confirmed, I want to know what you are going to do differently to hold Oracle accountable and to make sure we get this system right for our veterans?\u201d\n\nDr. Lawrence replied that he would aim to better understand why VA did not listen to employees earlier when they raised issued with the EHR system, and that he would work with the team Secretary Collins plans to convene with \u201ceverybody involved\u201d to figure out the best path going forward for EHR. \u201cIf confirmed, I want to work on that and figure out what the plan should be in terms of holding everybody accountable for what\u2019s supposed to take place, right, to get the most benefits as quickly as possible to our veterans within the amount of money we have,\u201d Dr. Lawrence said.\n\n\u201cWell let me make this very clear: we have heard that answer from every VA person that\u2019s come before this committee for a number of years now,\u201d Murray pushed back. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looked at it, everybody\u2019s considered it, everybody\u2019s talked about it, everybody\u2019s convened panels. It is not working. So, I need your commitment that it\u2019s not just\u2014convene people and take a look at, but that you are going to make changes to it and demand changes, and get those fixed. Because we have spent, literally, millions and millions of dollars\u2014and worse, veterans are still in jeopardy in their care, and doctors and nurses and VA facilities are really frustrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked you a really important question: what are you going to do differently? The answer you gave me\u2014I understand where you\u2019re coming from\u2014but it is the same one I\u2019ve heard over and over,\u201d Murray said.\n\nDr. Lawrence responded that the Secretary conveyed a \u201cstrong sense of urgency that it should be done much sooner than later,\u201d and that, in his previous tenure at VA as Under Secretary for Benefits, he dealt with technology problems around the GI Bill, appeals modernization, and other issues, and implemented technology: \u201cI\u2019ve actually done this, and so that\u2019s the difference I will bring to this. And I understand the frustration, and I pledge to work as best, as hard as I can to get this done,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence.\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t want to be sitting here again, two years from now, same conversation, new person,\u201d Murray said.\n\nMurray continued her questioning by pressing Dr. Lawrence on Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s unprecedented firings of VA researchers\u2014last week the administration abruptly refused to honor researchers\u2019 three-year \u201cNot to Exceed\u201d term limits (NTEs) by rolling them over as is standard. Instead, the Trump administration immediately dismissing researchers, including at VA Puget Sound, who were in the middle of research on topics including mental health, alcohol and opioid withdrawal, cancer treatments, burn pit exposure, prosthetics, diabetic ulcers, and so much else.\n\n\u201cLast week, my office\u2019s phones were ringing off the hook\u2014as I assume a lot of people\u2019s were\u2014with really panicked calls from researchers at the VA. They had been laid off with ZERO justification, ZERO warning,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u201cAnd in fact, up until then, the VA had assured them that they were protected from Trump and Musk\u2019s mass firings. VA research shouldn\u2019t be political. And firing VA researchers who are in the middle of a process to find life-saving treatment for veterans with conditions like PTSD, or opioid addiction, or cancer from toxic exposure is really cruel and wasteful. Some veterans are literally in the middle of receiving breakthrough treatment through these clinical trials. What will happen to them and their care when their lead researcher was just fired?\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you aware of the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to fire these VA researchers?,\u201d Murray asked.Dr. Lawrence responded that he was \u201cnot engaged\u201d in anything at the Department now.\n\n\u201cDo you support it?,\u201d Murray pressed.Dr. Lawrence replied: \u201cIf confirmed, I will look into this to better understand what took place\u2014I don\u2019t have enough information to comment on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t commit to restoring these VA researchers\u2019 positions so they can continue that research on PTSD, and opioid addiction, and cancer that was caused by their exposure to toxic chemicals?\u201d Murray pressed again.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, I commit to looking in to understand what happened and why,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence. \u201cWell, I hope that\u2019s not like every other answer we get from people that we are hearing from that they\u2019ll look into it and no action is taken\u2014you\u2019ve just promised to look into it; this is critical,\u201d said Senator Murray.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence.\n\nSenator Murray was the first woman to join the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee and the first woman to chair the Committee\u2014as the daughter of a World War II veteran, supporting veterans and their families has always been an important priority for her. Senator Murray has fought throughout her career for increased benefits for veterans, housing assistance, better access to veterans\u2019 clinics throughout Washington state, and more accountability from the VA.\n\nSenator Murray has spoken out forcefully against President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s mass firing of VA employees across the country. Just yesterday, Murray and her colleagues sent a letter to VA Secretary Doug Collins pressing him to protect veterans, their families, and VA staff from unprecedented access to sensitive information by Elon Musk and his \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (DOGE). Earlier this month, Senator Murray sounded the alarm over reports of DOGE at the VA and voted against Doug Collins\u2019s nomination to be VA Secretary, making clear that the Trump administration\u2019s lawlessness was putting our national security and our veterans at risk. Alongside 25 of her colleagues, Murray sent another letter earlier this month to Secretary Collins, demanding that he deny and sever Musk and DOGE\u2019s access to any VA or other government system with information about veterans, and to delete any veterans\u2019 information in their possession.\n\nSenator Murray has been conducting oversight on the flawed EHR rollout in Washington state since the Trump Administration first negotiated the contract with Cerner (later acquired by Oracle), and at every point in the process since then. Murray has consistently pushed VA on its failed implementation of EHR\u2014conducting oversight, holding the administration accountable, and calling on VA to halt deployment of EHR until they get it right in Washington state. In March 2023, Murray introduced comprehensive legislation that would require VA to implement a series of EHR reforms to better serve veterans, medical personnel, and taxpayers. In the Fiscal Year 2024 funding bills, Senator Murray negotiated and passed as Chair of the Appropriations Committee stronger language to hold VA and Cerner accountable for the rollout of the EHR system, and in May 2024, she sent a letter urging VA to consider feedback on the system from providers and veterans in Spokane and Walla Walla and reiterating that VA must not move forward on the rollout of EHR until the myriad issues that have plagued the system in the locations where it has been launched are fixed.\n\n###",

As of 2022, Oracle offered Premier Support until April 2024 and Extended Support until April 2027 for 19c. In 2023, Oracle waived Extended Support fees for 19c until April 30, 2026.\n\nOracle did not explain why it is offering five more years of Premier Support for 19c.\n\nBig Red ditched the \"c\" lineage in May last year when it launched 23ai, which introduced new features, including a native VECTOR datatype and \"optimized\" vector similarity search indexing.\n\nAt the time, Oracle made no commitment to an on-prem version of the database, other than the relatively niche Oracle Exadata and Oracle Database Appliance (ODA) hardware. Still, some commentators were optimistic that a mainstream on-prem version of the latest database would arrive soon.\n\nNine months later, it has yet to emerge. The most recent missive says that \u2013 other than the cloud, Exadata, and ODA \u2013 there is no on-prem planned. It only states that Supercluster, Linux x86-64, Linux on Arm, Oracle Solaris SPARC (64-bit), Oracle Solaris x86-64 (64-bit), Microsoft Windows x64 (64-bit), HP-UX Itanium, and IBM Power and System Z are TBA.\n\nOracle was given the opportunity to comment.\n\nSpeaking to The Register, Martin Biggs, vice president and general manager of third-party support specialist Spinnaker, said:\n\n\"With 23ai going on-prem, nobody really knows why the release dates are still to be announced, but they have dramatically extended 19c support, which means it is supported right through to 2032. In fact, they are only saying they're going to support 23ai until 2031 at the moment. They will do longer, but it raises all sorts of questions, and it means 19c becomes probably the longest-ever strategic platform.\"\n\nBiggs said Oracle customers pay perpetual license and support fees on the understanding they get upgrades included during the period they cover. \"When new versions come out, you get it 'for free' although obviously, you have to pay to upgrade and so on.\"\n\nOracle increased its support fees by 8 percent in 2022. At the moment, there is \"no clear view of any new version coming out\" at least in terms of on-prem 23ai outside of Exadata and ODA.\n\nOracle database remains top in the DB-Engines ranking system, which relies on a combination of metrics including mentions on websites, Google search trends, appearance in online technical discussions, job ads, professional profiles, and social media feeds. The Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which largely reflects developer choices when building new applications, ranks Oracle as the ninth most popular database choice, well behind the leader, PostgreSQL. \u00ae",

For example, how much of this spending was already planned and is simply being 'branded' into the project versus what percent is incremental spend that previously wasn't projected?\n\nRegardless, as we've been following in our AI Investor Podcast where we manage a $500,000 AI Portfolio in front of readers, following a series of breakthroughs in the AI space, 2025 looks set to be another fantastic year for AI stocks.\n\nIf you're wanting to get more information on what AI stocks are the best to buy in the market, check out our newest episode where we detailed an AI market poised for more than twenty-five-fold growth.",

            "content": "Oracle Corporation (ORCL) has been a titan of the IT industry for some time now, but with AI becoming the buzzword on everyone\u2019s lips, it could be poised for an even more prominent role over the coming years. With deep integration into OpenAI\u2019s $500 billion Stargate Project, ORCL has all the resources needed to dominate the high-stakes world of AI infrastructure. Of course, there are plenty of risks along the way, but with a growing list of federal contracts, strong revenue growth, and a compelling track record, I\u2019m confident the company can outperform the market. Therefore, I\u2019m bullish on Oracle early in 2025.\n\nOracle Takes Aim at Market Peers\n\nThe company functions across three distinct areas, complementing each other as part of the growing enthusiasm for AI architecture. Cloud and Licence are the primary revenue drivers. Still, the Hardware division provides the essential computational backbone for this emerging revolution, supporting a dynamic range of AI-driven workloads and enterprise needs. Meanwhile, the Services unit ensures businesses can optimize and integrate these technologies effectively, also informing future strategic decisions for the company.\n\nWith the company\u2019s market capitalization now over $486 billion and revenues growing double-digits for the first time in well over a decade, it seems like management has been able to recover from a period when it was simply trying to keep up and is now accelerating past the competition. Unlike Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, Oracle clearly focuses on AI-optimised solutions, giving it a major advantage in continuous improvements and feature development.\n\nThe Big Opportunity in the Room\n\nMoving onto the big breaking news, ORCL can gain from the seismic $500 billion injection from SoftBank and OpenAi to launch Stargate. Many will consider this a milestone in the AI development story, but some will suggest it is a political move by the new president to capitalize on the work already underway. It represents a considerable investment in developing cutting-edge data centers over the next four years, building enormous capacity and sophistication for future work. Oracle\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) will be crucial in handling the immense processing needs of OpenAI\u2019s models, leading to reliable income in a growing area.\n\nThe first of these data centers is well underway in Texas. Oracle\u2019s strategy of optimizing smaller, regional cloud centers is significant in maintaining a cost-effective edge over competitors. I\u2019d expect that as AI adoption continues to surge, the company\u2019s cloud services will grow further, leading to steady revenue growth.\n\nPrice Catalysts Loom for Oracle\n\nOracle\u2019s revenues soared for the cloud infrastructure area in Q2 of 2025, up 52% in a year. With this expected to exceed $25 billion next year, it\u2019s hard to argue that the trajectory looks promising for the future.\n\nI\u2019m encouraged by the work announced in the private sector, but I think public sector work has just as much momentum. Oracle has secured multiple government contracts for classified data, meeting security standards many companies can only dream of. This opens up enormous opportunities for working with clients such as the U.S. Department of Defence and in other national security and healthcare areas.\n\nRegardless of the catalysts ahead, I\u2019ll keep my eye on the progress towards strengthening the balance sheet. Over time, management has drastically reduced the debt level compared to assets and steadily grown the company\u2019s value.\n\nPotential Challenges Ahead\n\nDespite my bullishness here, there are plenty of reasons the strategy could quickly fall apart. Oracle\u2019s cloud market share is still well behind AWS\u2019s, making it a relatively small player in a landscape based on scale and efficiency. Building this infrastructure is enormously expensive, and despite the investment from Stargate, there is no guarantee that such vast expense will lead to improved performance in the near term. Investors will see the operating margins while these capital-intensive operations are rolled out and monitor the success of projects as they develop.\n\nTech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are clearly all rapidly vying for market leadership in the AI space. While a mix of public and private sector work puts Oracle in a strong position, such companies could easily move in on this with vastly more resources and flexibility across the range of services offered by each.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the fairly hefty valuation of the share price. With the P/E at 42.5, it\u2019s no surprise to see some analysts hesitant to give the firm a buy rating. However, AI-driven growth estimates suggest there could still be plenty of potential.\n\nIs Oracle Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOn Wall Street, ORCL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buy, 11 Hold, and one Sell ratings over the past three months. ORCL\u2019s average price target of $192.88 per share implies an ~11% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nMy proprietary discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation suggests a fair value of $126, about 27% below the current level but based on more conservative revenue growth of 13%. With shares up 62% over the past 12 months and technical indicators suggesting momentum is still strong, I think there is plenty of upside, even if it exceeds the fair valuation in the near term.\n\nGlobal AI Boom Could Deliver for Oracle\n\nOracle has evolved far beyond its reputation as just a database provider, emerging as a major player in AI and cloud computing. With a key role in the Stargate story unfolding over the coming years, there\u2019s plenty to be optimistic about. While risks remain after a strong rally and in an uncertain market environment, Oracle\u2019s management has the resources to drive revenue growth, enhance efficiency, and solidify its position as a leading AI company for the long term. As a result, I\u2019m initiating a Buy rating.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "content": "Atsign\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atsign today announced the successful creation of the first invisible cloud on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using its proven NoPorts technology. NoPorts is Zero Trust by design, built on the atPlatform, ensuring unparalleled security and privacy.\n\nWhat Makes it Invisible?\n\nThe Atsign cloud instance operates on a non-routable IP address (10.1918), making it inaccessible from the public internet. Furthermore, all inbound ports on the virtual machine are completely closed, preventing access even from Oracle employees. This creates an \"invisible\" cloud, shielded from external and internal scans and attacks.\n\nNoPorts Enables Secure Communication\n\nDespite its invisibility, the cloud remains fully functional through NoPorts. This innovative technology enables secure and private communication with authorized individuals and services, with security embedded at the protocol level. This eliminates exposed attack surfaces while allowing authorized individuals and services to communicate securely\u2014without changing how the cloud works for your teams.\n\n\"This is an important milestone,\" said Barbara Tallent, CEO of Atsign. \"To be able to protect your data and make it invisible from even the cloud provider, is the future of security. The invisibility of our cloud on OCI underscores the power of NoPorts to deliver the most secure and private communication platform available.\"\n\nBuilt on Zero Trust\n\nNoPorts is built upon Atsign's zero-trust infrastructure, the atPlatform. This secure foundation ensures that only entities cryptographically authenticated can access the invisible cloud. This eliminates the need for traditional perimeter defenses and establishes a robust trust model for all interactions.\n\nThis announcement further solidifies Atsign's position as a leader in secure communication and data privacy. The company's innovative technology is transforming how individuals and organizations interact online, empowering them to take control of their data and communicate with confidence.\n\nFor more information about:\n\nAtsign visit Atsign.com\n\nNoPorts visit NoPorts.com\n\natPlatform visit https://docs.atsign.com/core\n\n\n\nAbout Atsign\n\nAtsign specializes in embedded security technology infrastructure, software solutions, and SDKs. The company is providing the technology for the next generation of the Internet with simplicity, security, and privacy built in. Atsign\u2019s products are based on the promise of a new approach to networking using public key cryptography and personal data services. Learn more at Atsign.com.",

            "content": "Larry Ellison has been at Donald Trump\u2019s side since he took office last month. The man Trump referred to as \u201cone of the most serious players in the world\u201d was front row at the inauguration, and then watched as the president signed an executive order on artificial intelligence \u2014 a major business interest for tech giant Oracle.\n\nAnd Ellison, Oracle\u2019s billionaire co-founder, was sitting next to Rupert Murdoch in early February when Trump created a fund to facilitate the purchase of TikTok. His presence was no accident.\n\nLast month, after the Supreme Court upheld a law banning TikTok, Oracle emerged as a leader in the race to take control of the Chinese-owned short-form video platform.\n\nWhile the campaign against TikTok was led by China hawks in Washington, it was the ire of pro-Israel activists that perhaps best explains why Oracle is such a natural choice to take over the social media app.\n\nThe campaign to ban the app kicked into high gear after Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack against Israel. The timing spurred talk that the push for a ban wasn\u2019t just about American national security, but Israel\u2019s too. Politicians even tied their campaigns against TikTok to alleged Hamas propaganda being hosted on the platform.\n\nOracle, which had already taken control of some of TikTok\u2019s day-to-day operations, had taken a firm pro-Israel stance and, according to an Intercept investigation, clamped down on pro-Palestine activism inside the company.\n\nLast November, Israeli American Oracle CEO Safra Catz told an Israeli business news outlet, \u201cFor employees, it\u2019s clear: if you\u2019re not for America or Israel, don\u2019t work here\u2014this is a free country.\u201d\n\nCollaborations between the company and Israeli government agencies have been wide-ranging, encompassing everything from direct technology work with the military to software intended to help Israel with public relations \u2014 including, according to internal company messages, on social media platforms like TikTok.\n\nCritics of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza exist within Oracle\u2019s 160,000 global staff, though they have faced repression and punishment related to their stances. The dissent and the backlash, half a dozen Oracle employees told The Intercept, was part of an internal crisis for pro-Palestinian staffers at the tech giant over its unwavering support of Israel.\n\nOracle employees who spoke with The Intercept described an environment of fear, and half a dozen said they were seeking to leave the company.\n\n\u201cThe environment is horrible, people are terrified to even mention Palestine,\u201d one employee, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, told The Intercept. \u201cI cannot stand it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are terrified to even mention Palestine.\u201d\n\nSixty-eight Oracle employees signed an open letter last year criticizing the company\u2019s partnerships with Israel. Many have also raised alarms about what they said were biases in certain company programs, including the removal of avenues for staff to donate money to pro-Palestinian causes.\n\nAccording to multiple Oracle staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their livelihoods, one employee was terminated for allegedly violating the company\u2019s branding and Slack policies after they created a combined Palestinian Oracle logo on a watermelon \u2014 a symbol of Palestinian solidarity \u2014 that was posted in a Slack channel and put on social media.\n\nWhile companies such as Google and Amazon have been criticized for their work with the Israeli military and suppression of pro-Palestinian voices, employees and observers told The Intercept that Oracle stands out for its steadfast commitment to Israel.\n\n\u201cWe have been seeing a theme across the tech sector where pro-Palestinian voices inside companies have been targeted and repressed for their actions,\u201d said Eric Sype, U.S. national organizer for 7amleh, also known as the Arab Center for Social Media Advancement. \u201cThis shows the influence that the right-wing Israeli government has on the tech sector in Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nTies to Israel\n\nOracle, a Texas-based tech giant that rose to prominence with software and services related to database management, has a rich history with Israel \u2014 one of several of the company\u2019s nation-state clients.\n\nBoth Catz and Ellison have close relationships with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Catz met with Netanyahu a few months before the war on Gaza began to discuss the expansion of Oracle\u2019s work in Israel. And Ellison, a Republican megadonor in the U.S., once offered Netanyahu a place on Oracle\u2019s board of directors and invited him to visit his private Hawaiian island.\n\nOracle\u2019s initial high-profile deal with the Israeli government came in 2021, when it became the first multinational tech company to offer cloud services in the country. The database giant established a $319 million data center in Jerusalem for the project.\n\nNot all of Oracle\u2019s work in Israel, though, is publicized. Even as it announced its cloud computing deal, Oracle was working on a four-year highly confidential project with the Israeli Air Force called \u201cProject Menta,\u201d according to screenshots of Slack postings obtained by The Intercept. (Neither Oracle nor the Israeli Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment.)\n\nProject Menta, which was previously undisclosed, has allowed Israel\u2019s air force to do a \u201cbunch of important military stuff that we can\u2019t share with you,\u201d Shimon Levy, head of communications at Oracle Israel, wrote to colleagues on Slack in December 2021, according to three internal sources. Levy appended a sword emoji to his message.\n\nIn 2022, Levy also announced in the same channel that the Israeli military\u2019s Unit 81 \u2014 essentially a technology solutions division housed within the country\u2019s intelligence apparatus \u2014 was in the final stage of a three-year program with Oracle to expedite procurement by allowing every soldier to make their own military purchase requests.\n\nThat same year, Oracle hosted a hackathon with the Israeli military to \u201cdevelop technical solutions to acute social challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at those faces!\u201d Levy wrote in the post accompanied by a photo from the event. \u201cWe\u2019re there to support the soldiers in their mission to make the world a better place, using Oracle\u2019s technology!\u201d\n\nOracle and the War on Gaza\n\nImmediately after the attacks of October 7, 2023, Oracle publicly declared its support for Israel. Catz also demanded the inscription \u201cOracle Stands with Israel\u201d be displayed on all the company\u2019s screens, in more than 180 countries.\n\nThroughout the war, company officials continued to tout their support for Israel \u2014 and discuss incipient and ongoing projects working with the Israeli government. At one point, in Slack, Levy remarked that the Israeli Ministry of Defense was \u201ca demanding customer with very high standards.\u201d\n\nA month into the war, Levy took to the company Slack to laud the Oracle employees that were leading an \u201cimportant volunteering initiative to develop and operate a unique tool\u201d for Israeli public relations on social media. The project, called \u201cWords of Iron,\u201d was developed in collaboration with Israeli ministries to help the country elevate pro-Israel content and counter critical narratives on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nIn February 2024, the Israeli military cyber department and Oracle collaborated on another hackathon \u201cto find tech solutions for rehabilitating Israeli settlements near Gaza using Oracle\u2019s technology,\u201d Levy wrote, according to internal Slack messages. Levy also announced that the company had donated bags with medical and environmental supplies to Israel Defense Forces soldiers, valued at half a million dollars.\n\nLast summer, Catz attended a private lobbying meeting with U.S. senators to advocate for the continuation of weapon shipments to Israel. And, in the fall, Oracle announced it was partnering with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, one of Israel\u2019s largest defense companies, on an AI project to provide \u201cwarfighters with quick, actionable insights in the battlespace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pretty astounding to me is how flagrant the complicity is,\u201d said Marwa Fatafta, MENA policy and advocacy director at Access Now. \u201cThey are definitely taking advantage of the impunity that Israel enjoys. There are no consequences.\u201d\n\nBy the time Catz returned to Israel in November for her second trip since the war broke out, some employees were feeling deeply uncomfortable in the workspace.\n\nOn LinkedIn, Hani Risheq, director of enterprise architecture at Oracle UK posted: \u201cCan any of the 155K+ worldwide Oracle employees with a different opinion than that of Catz\u2019s voice their opinion without being penalised or even shown the door?\u201d\n\nCutting Help to Palestinians\n\nMeanwhile, as Israel began its bombing and full-scale invasion of Gaza, some employees said that the company was restraining support for Palestinians.\n\nLike many companies, Oracle operates a program to match employee donations to charitable causes. As the war raged, relief organizations like Medical Aid for Palestinians and UNRWA were taken off the internal giving page and no longer listed as accepting matching donations, four employees told The Intercept.\n\nOracle employees told The Intercept that the company chalked up the disappearance of the Palestinian-oriented charities to changes in policy that focused on education, environment, and health \u2014 though the Oracle employees pointed out some of the charities in question did focus on those areas. When they asked for the charities to be reinstated, they received no response.\n\nIn Catz\u2019s public statements to Israeli media, she referred to pro-Palestinian rights groups as \u201cbrainwashing organizations,\u201d adding, \u201cThey don\u2019t even know the facts.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead our complete coverage Israel\u2019s War on Gaza\n\nActivists disagree with Oracle\u2019s blanket statements surrounding Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\n\n\u201cRight now, you have to be living under a rock to claim ignorance,\u201d said Fatafta of Access Now. \u201cThere is no single big tech company, its CEOs or executive management, that can claim a lack of knowledge about what has happened in Gaza.\u201d\n\nIn the press, the company has had no compunction about clearly taking sides, dismissing the idea that its work with Israel amid the onslaught against Gaza could cause problems with clients in other parts of the world. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Yael Har Even, deputy CEO of Oracle Israel, when asked about the possibility. \u201cSafra always says \u2014 the U.S. first, the second country is Israel, and after that the whole world.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nWith the first quarter of 2025 well underway, Jim Cramer hasn\u2019t been short of comments on artificial intelligence. AI stocks, which entered 2025 with optimism and tailwinds were dealt a shock during January\u2019s DeepSeek selloff. The selloff was centered around stocks of firms that investors believe stand to benefit from billions of dollars in AI GPU spending.\n\nThe firm that led the DeepSeek selloff was the AI GPU stock that has been Wall Street\u2019s favorite. Its shares dropped by 17% during the day and are flat year to date after having gained 17% since the selloff. Cramer has also been one of the firm\u2019s biggest fans. For instance, consider his remarks made in January before the selloff. Cramer started out by bemoaning a lack of knowledge about the firm and shared:\n\n\u201cOkay, some of the analysts are good, but some of the analysts are just talking about the quarter! And these are people, who are, they are bound by the four walls of idiocy. This is one of the greatest companies in the world, these people want to buy sell, buy sell, they don\u2019t recognize that [the firm] is doing things that are just running circles around.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cramer went as far as to suggest that the firm was ushering in an industrial revolution. According to him:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d \u201cI find over and over again that when you have the industrial revolutions no one really believes in them. And here\u2019s Jensen Huang. The other day someone said to me, I see you\u2019re like Jensen Huang, you guys both were dishwashers. And I said, I was a busboy. I mean the kinds of things I\u2019m seeing with people at [the firm]. How\u2019s your dog doing? My dog died three years ago, should I sell the stock? Heaven forbid they listen to Colette Kress, who is not going to give you the numbers that you want.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC TV show host had to naturally adjust his expectations after investors re-calibrated their AI GPU spending. Appearing on Squawk on the Street the day after the selloff, he shared two factors that would be key in determining the future of AI stock performance. According to Cramer, these factors are energy spending and GPU orders. Investors have focused on energy stocks, particularly those that deal with nuclear energy \u2013 a fact that has sent some stocks to gain as much as 140% over the past year. As for GPU orders, the Q4 2024 earnings season has seen big tech firms persist in their multi-billion dollar AI capital expenditure commitments.\n\nIn another morning appearance, Cramer also commented on an outfit he had discovered that was better than DeepSeek. He shared:\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s an outfit that I\u2019ve been dealing with called you dot com. . . .I really like you dot com. It\u2019s one of those companies that is really ahead of DeepSeek, it\u2019s way ahead.\u201d\n\nHe added that after digging deeper, he found that the AI GPU firm mentioned above was actually this outfit\u2019s largest investor. The investment signaled to Cramer that there are alternatives better than DeepSeek as he commented that \u201cthe long knives came out\u201d for it at the slightest hint of trouble.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 91\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: September 6th, 2024\n\nPerformance Since Then: 11.7%\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), primarily an enterprise resource planning and computing play, has transformed itself into an AI computing resource provider. Its shares have gained 11.7% since Cramer\u2019s comments. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s shares have performed well as investors have rewarded the firm for setting up and acquiring computing resources that enable enterprise AI computing. The shares jumped by 14% after President Trump\u2019s Project Stargate announcement and dipped by 11% during the DeepSeek selloff. Here is what Cramer said:\n\n\u201cOracle has reinvented itself with an AI kicker to go with its regular enterprise software business. As of last quarter, it\u2019s been performing exceptionally well, and I think they\u2019re going to do it again. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) could stop the tech blood flow.\u201d\n\nOverall ORCL ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "For us Bay Area natives, seeing NBA All-Star Weekend bridge the Bay feels like basketball poetry in motion. While Chase Center hosted Sunday night\u2019s marquee events, it\u2019s the NBA\u2019s decision to resurrect Oracle Arena for All-Star Friday and Saturday that hit different. That\u2019s where I spent countless nights watching the Warriors when they were NBA punchlines, when Warriors tickets were literally being passed out in the streets just to get folks to come. That\u2019s when being a Dubs fan meant explaining to people that yes, we actually had an NBA team in Oakland.\n\nThe symmetry is almost too perfect: The NBA\u2019s elite gathered in San Francisco to celebrate how the Warriors changed basketball forever, but they also payed homage to the building where that revolution was born. Oracle Arena, a.k.a. \u201cRoaracle\u201d to those of us who lived through the We Believe era, wasn\u2019t just a stadium. It was Oakland\u2019s basketball cathedral, where the faithful gathered to show their love and support despite decades of evidence suggesting we were crazy to keep showing up. To see Steph Curry back in that building for All-Star festivities, man, that\u2019s the kind of full-circle moment that makes you realize sports can write stories Hollywood wouldn\u2019t dare pitch.\n\nWELCOME TO THE BAY\n\n\n\nThe 74th Annual #NBAAllStar Game goes down TONIGHT on TNT pic.twitter.com/9SGDRLVOUZ \u2014 NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 16, 2025\n\nThe Bay really showed who we are this weekend, im so proud and grateful \u2014 P-Lo (@p_lo) February 16, 2025\n\nWe missed you Oracle: the concrete coliseum where a franchise and a city forged an unbreakable bond through decades of heartbreak and eventual glory.\n\nFor younger NBA fans who only know the Warriors as the dynasty that changed basketball forever, it might be hard to comprehend what Oracle meant. This wasn\u2019t just a building. It was Oakland\u2019s beating heart, a place where 19,596 true believers would transform into a living, breathing organism that could will an underdog team to victory through sheer force of collective determination.\n\nSteph Curry on what it means to be back at Oracle Arena\n\n\n\n\u201cGrowing up in the game inside of these walls. The energy in this building that can come back just like that. I\u2019ve enjoyed it to the fullest\u2026 it is a moment that is truly Oakland.\u201d pic.twitter.com/uOr5gJfmdA \u2014 KNBR (@KNBR) February 15, 2025\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about Oracle that the pristine confines of Chase Center still haven\u2019t quite replicated. It wasn\u2019t just loud, it was defiant. The building embodied Oakland\u2019s identity: blue-collar, overlooked, and absolutely unwilling to back down. When Baron Davis detonated on Andrei Kirilenko in the 2007 playoffs, the roar lasted over a minute not just because of the dunk\u2019s ferocity, but because it represented Oakland showing the basketball world they wouldn\u2019t be ignored anymore.\n\nThe numbers tell the story of Oracle\u2019s dominance: The Warriors went 218-43 at home during their last five seasons there, including the playoffs, with an absurd 11.5-point differential. They posted back-to-back 39-2 home records, the kind of statistical dominance that seems almost mythological. But the numbers only tell part of the story.\n\nMOSES MOODY: \u201cIt\u2019s really meaningful for the NBA to include Oakland in the festivities. I\u2019m glad they doing it because it\u2019s such a good culture over here. I love it every time I come. Just talking to the people and seeing how much they want it, how much they want basketball.\u201d pic.twitter.com/TfNa5FNS3b \u2014 KNBR (@KNBR) February 15, 2025\n\nOracle was where the Warriors transformed from laughingstock to legend. It\u2019s where Curry became a supernova, where Klay Thompson scored 37 points in a quarter, where \u201cWe Believe\u201d morphed into \u201cWe Dominant.\u201d The building\u2019s acoustics were perfect for amplifying crowd noise, but what made it special was how the fans understood the game\u2019s rhythms. They didn\u2019t just cheer \u2013 they anticipated. When the Warriors would start cooking, the upper deck would begin a low rumble, like a thunderstorm gathering force. By the time the lightning struck (usually a Curry three or a Green-to-Iguodala alley-oop), the explosion would nearly lift the roof.\n\nJames Harden to Stephen Curry at All-Star practice in Oakland Arena: \u201cI don\u2019t like this arena man. Y\u2019all did something bad to me in this arena man.\u201d\n\n\n\n(via @StephenCurry30) pic.twitter.com/AUvsya70Wx \u2014 TheWarriorsTalk (@TheWarriorsTalk) February 16, 2025\n\n\u201cThis was the hardest place to play in the league,\u201d said Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson, and he\u2019s right. But it wasn\u2019t just about decibel levels. Oracle crowds had an almost metaphysical connection to their team. They\u2019d stand for defensive possessions in close games without being prompted. They gave Chris Mullin a standing ovation when he returned from dealing with personal issues, showing that their loyalty went beyond just wins and losses.\n\nThe Warriors\u2019 move to Chase Center was inevitable in today\u2019s NBA economics. And while Chase is undeniably gorgeous, with its perfect sightlines and world-class amenities, it\u2019s still working to find Oracle\u2019s soul. The corporate crowds in well-appointed suites simply don\u2019t generate the same sustained intensity. As Curry diplomatically put it, trying to draw parallels between Chase and Oracle remains \u201can unfair comparison.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets interesting for the current Warriors: If they want to return to championship glory, they might need to channel some of that Oracle energy. The team is at its best when playing with that chip-on-the-shoulder mentality that defined those Oakland years. When Curry\u2019s shimmying, Green\u2019s barking, and the whole squad is playing with that controlled chaos that makes opposing teams wilt \u2013 that\u2019s when you see glimpses of the Oracle spirit living on.\n\nKevin Durant on his reception from Bay Area fans: \"I never though for a second I ain't get no love out here... All around the country, world there's Warriors fans and they always show me love.\" pic.twitter.com/boe6VZz4UB \u2014 95.7 The Game (@957thegame) February 17, 2025\n\nA golden tangent: if there\u2019s one current Warrior who embodies that Oracle Arena energy, it might be their newest addition Jimmy Butler. The six-time All-Star\u2019s arrival feels almost cosmically aligned with the Warriors revisiting their Oakland roots this weekend. Butler\u2019s entire career has been written in \u201cWe Believe\u201d ink \u2013 the 30th pick who worked as a coffee barista during the NBA lockout, transformed himself into a superstar through pure determination, and has made a habit of walking into hostile arenas and leaving with victory through sheer force of will.\n\nLocal hero Damian Lillard, who grew up watching Warriors games at Oracle, summed up the building\u2019s legacy perfectly: \u201cGrowing up close by here, driving by and looking at the Coliseum and seeing Oracle and how dead it is, when there was so much energy in it when I was a kid... I remember a lot about this parking lot.\u201d\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever forget\" \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\nOakland native @Dame_Lillard reminisces on going to Warriors games as a kid. pic.twitter.com/gk0LpeVV8P \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) February 15, 2025\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about Oracle \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just about basketball. It was about community. While the Warriors have invested heavily in Oakland through their foundation work (particularly Curry\u2019s \u201cEat. Learn. Play. Foundation\u201d), there\u2019s something bittersweet about seeing Oracle quiet most nights, a monument to an era when Oakland had all three major sports teams and an identity as one of America\u2019s great sports cities.\n\nBut for one weekend, the old building roared again. And maybe that\u2019s what the Warriors need to remember as they push for another title run \u2013 that Oakland underdog spirit never left them. It just moved across the Bay, waiting to be channeled once more. The Warriors may play in San Francisco now, but this Steph/Dray soul was forged in Oakland. And if they want to climb that mountain again, they\u2019d do well to remember the lessons Oracle taught them: Stay hungry, stay dangerous, and never stop believing.\n\nJust like Oakland never did.",

That's the sentiment echoed at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris as France President Macron touted a $112.8 billion investment in AI. The massive investment comes as four of the biggest US tech giants plan to spend $325 billion to further strengthen their AI ambitions in 2025.\n\nFrance's $112.8 billion underscores Europe's desire to take on the US and China, which have dominated the AI debate on innovations and investment in recent years. For starters, the US is receiving praise as part of the $500 billion Stargate project as China appears to have an edge on innovation following DeepSeek's revelation of cost-effective AI models.\n\nCritics of Europe have long argued that the continent has overregulated the tech sector, hindering innovation. Nevertheless, some in the technology sector believe that Europe is headed in the right direction, even though that perception hasn't completely changed.\n\n\"As a European region, at least, we are starting to see global leaders emerge, and that's the thing we really need,\" Victor Riparbelli, CEO of AI video company Synthesia, told CNBC in an interview on Monday.\n\nWhile there appears to be a tussle or fierce competition between nations to spearhead the AI revolution, China has made it clear that it is willing to work with other countries. Beijing insists it is willing and ready to promote development, safeguard security, and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, Zhang Guoqing, AI has become an essential driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. China has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.\n\nCorporations between nations instead of competing against each other to control the spoils are key to unlocking the full advantages of the AI revolution. Likewise, economists at Goldman Sachs expect widespread adoption of generative AI to raise US labour productivity by 15% over the next 10 years. It is also likely to unlock about $4.5 trillion in annual US GDP.\n\nAI economic benefits are anticipated to flow to hardware and infrastructure providers early on. Later, they will spread to platform and application developers, and finally, they will manifest as increases in productivity and efficiency throughout the industry as a whole. According to the Goldman Sachs team, the US AI investment cycle will peak at 2% of GDP before declining as the compute costs of running AI queries and training AI models decline. Investment in AI software was expected to rise gradually over time as end-user adoption rose.",

            "content": "Enterprise cloud strategies have evolved over the past decade. Initially, organisations adopted cloud computing to reduce infrastructure costs and improve scalability. However, the cloud is no longer just about infrastructure, it has become a core component of business transformation, enabling AI-driven insights, real-time data processing, and industry-specific innovation.\n\nAs cloud adoption matures, enterprises face new challenges. Data gravity, latency concerns, security risks, and the need for greater interoperability. Rather than relying on a single cloud provider, organisations are adopting multicloud architectures for better control over workloads, compliance, and performance optimisation.\n\nA major catalyst for the multicloud trend has been cross-cloud partnerships among major cloud providers. Enterprises no longer view the cloud as a one-size-fits-all solution but as an interconnected ecosystem where workloads need to move between providers.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure\u2019s executive vice president, Mahesh Thiagarajan, told iTnews Asia, that over the years, cross-cloud collaborations have evolved beyond basic connectivity to address one of the biggest challenges enterprises face - latency.\n\nWhile fiber interconnects have improved cloud-to-cloud communication, even small physical distances between workloads, such as those in separate buildings within the same region, can introduce latency that impacts performance-sensitive applications, Thiagarajan said.\n\nThis has led to a shift where cloud providers are not just improving network links but also co-locating workloads within the same data centers to reduce bottlenecks, he added.\n\nCloud providers are strengthening partnerships to enable multicloud integration and latency for enterprise workloads.\n\nAlong similar lines, Oracle has partnerships with AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to enhance OCI\u2019s value proposition.\n\nAI models work best when in closest proximity to data\n\nThe rise of AI-driven applications is changing cloud strategies. Enterprises focus on how to run AI models efficiently without excessive infrastructure costs. The challenge is not about processing power but about proximity - AI models are effective when they operate close to the data they rely on.\n\nThiagarajan mentioned observing two AI-related patterns: some organisations push data asynchronously for model training and batch processing, while others require near real-time inferencing where data must be processed instantly as it arrives.\n\nIn both cases, businesses want database technology positioned as close as possible to AI workloads.\n\nThiagarajan said, \u201cOn the data side, Oracle integrates AI directly into databases, including MySQL and Oracle Database, allowing inline AI models to run on the same compute layer as stored data.\u201d\n\nThis eliminates the need for extensive data movement and enables enterprises to derive insights without incurring extra costs or delays, he added.\n\nCloud security extends beyond data protection\n\nCloud security now goes beyond safeguarding data - it also involves protecting AI models that contain proprietary insights and business-critical algorithms. As AI adoption grows, enterprises must ensure the integrity and confidentiality of their models to prevent security breaches that could disrupt operations.\n\nThiagarajan highlighted that embedding AI directly into cloud platforms enhances security by allowing enterprises to customise and train models within a controlled environment.\n\nHe added that protecting model weights and ensuring data integrity is critical, as any compromise can have consequences for business decision-making and operational reliability.\n\nMeanwhile, cloud providers continue to expand their global footprints to meet enterprise demand and regulatory requirements.\n\nOracle, for instance, has grown to 171 built or planned cloud regions, reflecting the increasing need for geographically distributed infrastructure.\n\nThe shift toward multicloud strategies has further accelerated this trend, as organisations look to optimise workload distribution while minimising vendor lock-in.",

            "content": "Last week\u2019s Munich Security Conference underscored that strategic autonomy is Europe\u2019s only option.\n\nWho would have thought that a former comedian would turn out to be the most prescient strategic thinker in Europe? Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky stole the show at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday by stating that \u201can army of Europe\u201d was needed as the continent can no longer count on the United States for its defense as it has for the last eighty years.\n\nHistory will likely regard Zelensky\u2019s words as the most significant voiced at this gathering since Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2007 speech that criticized the United States for its unipolar domineering at a time when U.S. power was relatively slipping. Soon after, Putin launched wars in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.\n\nZelensky\u2019s admonition comes at a time of greater tumult for European security than any time since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the unification of Germany, and the end of the Cold War nearly two generations ago. President Trump also announced this week that the United States is starting bilateral negotiations with the Russians in Saudi Arabia without seats for European powers. All this despite steadfast and significant European support for Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion nearly three years ago.\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, the retired general Keith Kellogg, said in Munich that previous negotiations, like the Minsk agreements, had failed because there were too many negotiators and interests at play. Ultimately, those agreements did fail. However, the main problem was that the United States was not at the table due to President Obama\u2019s myopic \u201clead from behind\u201d approach. While Kellogg has indicated that the Europeans will be \u201cconsidered,\u201d this seems inadequate because in the event of successful negotiations, a very large if, the Trump administration has made it clear that it expects Europeans to be the continent\u2019s dominant peacekeeping force.\n\nVice President JD Vance\u2019s speech castigating Europeans for censorship, lax migration policies, and failing to uphold core principles of democracy was received about as negatively as Putin\u2019s in Munich in 2007. Vance\u2019s speech can be viewed as a harbinger of a growing wave of right-wing sentiment in Europe. Already, there is a conservative leader in Italy, Giorgia Meloni. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland Party (AfD) in Germany is now polling in second place and climbing rapidly. Moreover, Marine Le Pen will likely win the next French presidential election. What was not long ago viewed as extremism is now rapidly becoming mainstream.\n\nVance made clear in his speech and in his meeting with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel that the Trump administration is more than comfortable with this trend. Whether Vance\u2019s meeting with AfD helps or hurts the party in next weekend\u2019s elections in Germany remains to be seen.\n\nWhile Vance\u2019s speech caused an uproar in Munich, it was likely more motivated by domestic political interests. He wants to be viewed as Trump\u2019s MAGA successor. In that way, the address covered Vance\u2019s domestic political message under the guise of appeals to common European and American values of democracy and free speech.\n\nIt should be no surprise to anybody that the Trump administration is downgrading the value of its European partners. This is entirely consistent with his first term. Trump\u2019s persistent expressions of the desire to control Greenland, the Panama Canal, and bring in Canada as a \u201cfifty-first state\u201d all evoke a worldview of late nineteenth-century imperial competition for resources and territorial control. It is both a Hobbesian world of anarchy and a Darwinian world of the survival of the fittest. The \u201cinternational community\u201d has been exposed as a fiction. According to this view, the \u201cinternational community\u201d and the \u201cliberal rules-based international order\u201d are fictions that have left the United States more vulnerable to predatory rule-breakers like China and Russia.\n\nHowever, if this and other right-wing tendencies in the United States and Europe continue apace, the result will not be greater Western comity but rather the dominance of centrifugal forces. This is why Zelensky looks like the real oracle of Munich and Vance like the skunk at the garden party. Europe\u2019s position as a \u201cgreat power\u201d is facing its greatest threat in eighty years. It will have no choice but to assert forcefully its independent security and economic interests in the months and years ahead.\n\nPolitical change usually comes only as a result of the perception of crisis. The chickens of decades of economic stagnation and junior security status to Washington have come home to roost. The European unification project has moved in fits and starts for more than seventy years. Today may be the beginning of a new burst of progress not seen since the early 1990s after the conclusion of the Cold War. A more militarily and economically robust Europe would prove both a more valuable partner to Washington as well as a more credible check on U.S. unilateral excesses.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAndew Kuchins is a Senior Fellow at the Center for the National Interest and Adjunct Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC.\n\nImage: Review News / Shutterstock.com.",

            "content": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 For his last interview of the day, Stephen Curry took a seat and handed his phone to a friend. He wanted a picture of this moment.\n\nIt was his old locker. The one assigned to him as a rookie for the Golden State Warriors, with Anthony Randolph next to him on the right, and Corey Maggette occupying the coveted corner way to his left, with Stephen Jackson and Monta Ellis owning the two corner lockers across from Curry. This was where it all began. In this spot. The locker that once bore his name is now painted black. The seat was just a standard issue folding chair, not the special thickly padded chairs that served as his throne. Until he became such a big star, he couldn\u2019t do interviews at that locker anymore. The Warriors built a new locker in a new $2 billion arena in San Francisco.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaturday, Curry was back home. At the old Oracle Arena. The NBA had its annual All-Stars practice at the Warriors\u2019 former arena of 47 years, including the first 10 years of his career. A time-machine trip to romanticized memories. Now called the Oakland Arena, primarily a concert venue, it still seemed to be just as the NBA left it in 2019. The Warriors\u2019 branding was gone. Spaces were repurposed. But the concrete bones looked the same. The aura of history and intensity hovered the same. The pathways and sightlines were familiar enough to stoke memories and emotions.\n\n\u201cIt feels weird being back here.\u201d A common refrain uttered by many who still have particles of Oracle in their DNA.\n\nCurry misses those days. Oracle fit his worldview. He\u2019s a billionaire in training, so Chase Center does as well. That\u2019s the dichotomy of someone underrated becoming a global icon. But extravagance hasn\u2019t rid his palette of a taste for rusty charm. Fulfilling his wildest dreams only makes him appreciate the grimy origins.\n\nThat\u2019s why he wants to play in this arena again.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love the idea of coming back to play a game here,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt should be a regular-season game.\u201d\n\nStephen Curry throws a t-shirt to fans during Saturday\u2019s All-Star practice. His Warriors won three titles while in Oakland, transforming the franchise. (Darren Yamashita / Imagn Images)\n\nThe nostalgia was palpable on Saturday. A reminder of a time when the Warriors, when the NBA, when basketball, was an event of intimacy. This was before millions became billions. Before luxury quartered off the community and gentrified the kinship. Before suites turned ticket prices into mortgages. When arenas had a soul and hugged their guests. When its greatest moments were communal experiences. When hierarchy didn\u2019t prohibit tangibility.\n\nThe business of sports escalated to such massiveness that it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the uniqueness of places like Oracle is lost forever. Smothered by cash. Suffocated by opulence. Edifices costing billions of dollars don\u2019t turn a profit on vibes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo Saturday \u2014 especially for Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s squad of OGs \u2014 being in Oracle was a reminder of what they had, how far they\u2019ve come and how long they\u2019ve been at this. And just how different this all is now.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d said Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard, \u201cthe Warriors team was so bad that \u2026 me and my brother used to walk through the tunnel, walk in the back, eat food in the media room. Now that I\u2019m in the NBA, I know it was the media room. So it was like hot dogs and sodas and stuff like that \u2026 then walked out where the players walked out at. We would just stand there. They\u2019d be coming out of the locker room. We\u2019d get autographs. Walking up to their cars. It was just like, \u2018How were we ever able to do that?\u2019 That\u2019s one memory that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget, especially today walking in and seeing that exact spot.\u201d\n\nCurry, the champion of Oracle, and Lillard, the Oakland kid who grew up within walking distance of the arena, weren\u2019t alone in their sentimentality on Saturday. Truth is, this arena was special for many people.\n\nKevin Durant said he took the same route to the arena, a ride he remembered from his three seasons with the Warriors. He recalls fondly the significance of basketball in these parts. His favorite memory at Oracle?\n\n\u201cGame 5, 2017,\u201d he said, referencing the Warriors\u2019 NBA Finals win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. \u201cWinning the championship here, celebrating in the locker room, celebrating on the floor. I think that was the only time we did that. Out of the four championships the Warriors won in this era, I think that\u2019s the only time they celebrated at home. So that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nStephen Curry and Kyrie Irving chat in the Oakland Arena locker room, now painted black. The two had three Finals showdowns in the building. (Candice Ward / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nCurry said that clinching game was his favorite moment for the same reasons.\n\nOf course, in the last NBA game in this building, Pascal Siakam celebrated a championship with the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\u201cGood times,\u201d Siakam, now an Indiana Pacer, said with a full grin. \u201cThe locker room was crazy. Champagne everywhere. It was awesome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeBron James for sure loves Oracle. He had some monster games under this roof. None bigger than Game 7 in 2016, when his Cavaliers won the title on the hardwood in East Oakland.\n\nThat game, this arena, was the site of the greatest shot in Kyrie Irving\u2019s life.\n\nThat game, this arena, was the site of the greatest game Draymond Green ever played: 32 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists in 47 minutes of a Game 7.\n\n\u201cF\u2014 that game,\u201d Green said. \u201cI hate that game.\u201d\n\nInstead, he chose to focus on Game 3 against Denver in 2013. His first playoff game in Oracle and the Warriors\u2019 first home postseason game since 2007.\n\n\u201cWhen we ran out in Game 3, you couldn\u2019t hear. You could not hear. They had to turn the music off because the crowd was so loud. That\u2019s my favorite Oracle moment.\u201d\n\nWhat made Oracle special was the people. It\u2019s prime attracted the most rambunctious. Before the modern sports landscape worked its magic trick of exclusivity.\n\nIt featured an environment conducive to creating and fostering relationships. The concourse was for networking and reunions as much as for vending. The parking lot a stage for long walks and chats. The hallways outside the locker room, where people congregated behind the scenes, trafficked in relationships. A mesh of players, owners and executives, agents and managers, friends and families, lucky fans and entourages, entrepreneurs and corporate types.\n\nFor old-time\u2019s sake, Curry revived the \u201cJones\u2019 BBQ and foot massage\u201d dance he did with Oracle security before games.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by GSWALLDAY (@gsw.all.day)\n\nYeah, Oracle was special. It was by no means state-of-the-art. But it was a state of the people.\n\n\u201cWe had a run where we created opportunities for memories to happen,\u201d Curry said. \u201cBut anybody who came here before we won in 2015 could feel how unique this place was. It became more of a national, international arena because of the winning. Hosting that many finals and the whole deal. But it was always here. My rookie year, it was talked about differently than other arenas. Because it was just raw and you only came here for the game. Wasn\u2019t no bells and whistles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey still didn\u2019t exist when Curry returned Saturday. The Warriors\u2019 new digs felt especially lavish on the return to their old haunts. But that ol\u2019 feeling, that essence, that personality, it didn\u2019t make it to Chase Center. For it still remains in Oracle. In the concrete bones. In the aura the hovers. In the soul that hugs.\n\nGO DEEPER NBA All-Star Game 2025, explained: New format, rosters and how we got here\n\n(Top photo of Stephen Curry with fans Saturday during the All-Star Game practice at Oakland Arena: AAron Ontiveroz / The Denver Post via Getty Images)",

            "content": "By Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries and creating extraordinary opportunities for startups to thrive. For founders, AI offers vast potential\u2014but maximizing that opportunity requires access to powerful, reliable, and affordable tools. This is where modern cloud computing proves invaluable.\n\nCloud infrastructure that integrates high throughput and low latency networking, storage, and the latest GPUs empowers startups to build, train, and deploy AI models without becoming distributed computing PhDs. These tools take on the heavy lifting, allowing founders to focus on solving meaningful problems, scaling their businesses, and bringing their ideas to life \u2013 faster.\n\nAs AI startups navigate a shifting landscape of privacy regulations, fierce competition for computing power, and pressure from industry incumbents, they face critical decisions about their infrastructure. Let\u2019s explore the key considerations for success\u2014and how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) delivers unmatched value, end-to-end capabilities, and robust computing power to help startups build, serve, and scale their AI models and applications cost-effectively.\n\nEnterprise-Grade AI Power for Startups on Demand\n\nFirst, Oracle gives startups access to some of the world\u2019s biggest AI clusters \u2014 comparable to those that Meta and xAI build for their own massive AI workloads. That brings a lot of power for startups to apply to their own workloads on a pay-as-they-go basis. Currently, companies such as Evidium, Inworld, Suno, and more are leveraging OCI AI infrastructure to deliver the computing power and performance they need to build their next-generation AI solutions. Use of OCI gives these startups a leg up if they want to work with the huge installed base of Oracle Database and Fusion Applications customers. In addition, OCI has startup accelerator programs which provides free credits for startups up to $100K, so startups can get more out of their investment while building cutting-edge new solutions.1\n\nScalability remains critical. OCI\u2019s Zettascale cluster capability can offer aggregate network throughput of 100 petabytes per second with only microseconds of latency from machine-to-machine. This scale was unheard of in the industry until just a few months ago. By combining this high-powered network with OCI\u2019s advanced storage solutions, startups can train models faster, run workloads more efficiently, and achieve a better total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nRun Faster, Pay Less\n\nCost is a big deal for small-but-growing companies, and the architecture you choose should deliver high performance while training and serving generative AI models cost-effectively. AI startups should look for infrastructure that\u2019s optimized to run these workloads faster on a true pay-as-you-go pricing model\u2014like OCI. Unlike others, OCI has the same low price globally, so you don\u2019t have the overhead and complexity of picking from thousands of different compute SKUs. Remember, for startups as well as larger companies, the faster your jobs run, the less you pay.\n\nFurthermore, OCI offers a complete platform that goes beyond just training models. Unlike GPU-only specialists, once you\u2019re ready to launch your product, OCI provides the best value for hosting your model and applications. Or if you want to deploy the industry\u2019s leading LLMs from Hugging Face, Meta, Mistral, and others for your own use you can do this via OCI Data Science with just a few clicks. By combining high-speed performance with a comprehensive suite of tools, OCI is uniquely positioned to help startups succeed in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nPutting Security and Reliability at the Core\n\nSecurity anchors our platform. Customer A\u2019s data must never be accessible to Customer B\u2014by accident or otherwise. Strong data isolation and clear policies govern how data is managed and used for training AI models, helping ensure trust and compliance. Being able to share a cluster network across multiple jobs run by a startup or a startup\u2019s customers with strong isolation provides higher security, protects sensitive information, and enables startups to innovate with confidence. This foundation matters because the quality of data directly drives the quality of AI outcomes.\n\nBy building security and reliability into every layer of the platform Oracle ensures that startups can focus on developing cutting-edge AI solutions, and worry less about data breaches or compliance issues. Startups and enterprises alike trust Oracle\u2019s infrastructure to safeguard their data while supporting their innovation goals.\n\nInnovation Beyond GPUs: The Role of Resiliency, Networking and Distributed Cloud\n\nStartups require an AI platform that minimizes the need to directly manage resources. What they need is a reliable, high-performance platform that gets the fundamentals right including a great network and great storage. Even minor failures in AI infrastructure disrupt workflows and waste valuable resources. OCI mitigates these risks with robust fault-tolerant architecture, which ensures developers can focus on solving critical business challenges instead of troubleshooting interruptions.\n\nOf course, raw compute power is key, but AI workloads depend on more than the fastest GPUs. Networking also plays a critical role, and Oracle introduced innovations that streamline those technologies.\n\nTake RoCE or RDMA over Converged Ethernet networking for example. RDMA has powered Oracle Exadata databases for decades, and we were the first to run multi-tenant workloads on RoCE\u2014even before AI became mainstream. By applying optimized RoCE to enable seamless communication across tens of thousands of GPUs, we can deliver multiple gigaflops of performance per cluster, giving startups the efficiency and scalability needed. We also support InfiniBand networking for use cases such as AI training that require ultra-low latency to offer our customers choices in leading networking technologies. In addition, Oracle works closely with partners and industry leaders, driving standards through initiatives like UEC to deliver the best performance for AI workloads.\n\nFor over a decade, cloud providers focused on delivering cloud services in a handful of public cloud regions. OCI changed that equation by making full cloud services available for specific governments, for the EU, and even on-premises. This provides new ways for AI startups to provide their services and for customers to consume them. OCI\u2019s deployment options\u2014which allow companies to run their cloud services securely in a sovereign cloud setting\u2014are attractive to startups targeting markets with strict data location and privacy requirements.\n\nStartups like Fireworks AI are already leveraging these innovations. By using OCI\u2019s high-performance AI solutions with industry-leading RDMA networking, the startup is building a hyper-optimized inferencing engine to help other startups maximize the value of their GPUs\u2014an essential step in deploying AI models efficiently.\n\nUnlocking the Transformative Potential of Cloud AI\n\nThink about the transition from the Yellow Pages to Google Search\u2014a revolution that drastically sped access to information, whether it was finding a restaurant or mapping out the fastest route. Cloud-enabled AI takes this transformation much further. It doesn\u2019t just save time; it effectively shrinks the time it takes to perform complex tasks and creates entirely new possibilities. AI agents can now collaborate with each other to solve complex problems across industries, enabling faster research, deeper insights into behaviors, and improved trend analysis.\n\nThis rapid pace of innovation requires robust cloud infrastructure to sustain growth. With OCI, startups have access to the same versatile and cost-effective tools leveraged by the world\u2019s leading enterprises. This enables these businesses to focus on their core vision, without the distractions of managing hardware or worrying about prohibitive costs.\n\nStartups can find out more at the OCI AI Solutions Hub and check out developer sandboxes or packaged deployments of popular software.\n\n1Available to startups nominated by Oracle that meet specific qualification criteria.

            "content": "Glitz and glamour have always been at the heart of the NBA All-Star Weekend, but this year something feels different. The glittering spectacle has returned to Oakland \u2014 a city many NBA stars call home after 25 years. But this one they had to leave behind due to outdated amenities and various other factors. Among those affected by the move was Stephen Curry. You\u2019ve probably seen the man recently, shooting from the tunnel, vibing with fans, and making no-look half-court shots alongside Kevin Durant. But behind the lens, there was a different story. But what story?\n\nA story of nostalgia that Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic witnessed as he conducted one of Curry\u2019s final interviews leading to the NBA All-Star game. For Curry, it was all about taking a trip down memory lane. The old Oracle Arena was his roots. So, he couldn\u2019t resist visiting where it all began 16 years ago, on Saturday. But what hit Steph was rather painful than joyous.\n\nThe sounds of past victories and defeats echoed in his mind. He remembered the heartaches of losses, the bonds he formed, and the ones that faded away in that very arena. Sitting there, he soaked it all in, feeling the weight of his journey. Curry asked his friend to capture \u2018the moment\u2019.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe National reporter watched quietly as the visibly emotional Curry stood in front of the locker he first called his own. The one he shared with the Warriors\u2019 elites like Anthony Randolph, Corey Maggette, Stephen Jackson, Monta Ellis, and many more. But now, his locker was no longer his. It was painted black. His name was erased. And the seat? Thompson explained, \u201cThe seat was just a standard issue folding chair, not the special thickly padded chairs that served as his throne. Until he became such a big star, he couldn\u2019t do interviews at that locker anymore.\u201d\n\nvia Imago Feb 10, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30) looks on in the first quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-Imagn Images\n\nWhile the Chase Center may have built a shiny new locker room in 2019, it could never hold the memories that the humble locker at Oracle Arena carries. After all, that locker room wasn\u2019t just a place. It saw every stage of Curry\u2019s evolution, from a rookie to the superstar he is today.\n\nThe 36-year-old believed the best way to give back all the love the city showed him was by giving back to the community. And he wasn\u2019t doing it alone. His wife, Ayesha, and his mom, Sonya, were right there with him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nStephen Curry and his family step up for the noble deed\n\nThe league has not officially assigned Stephen Curry and his wife the role of hosts for the event. And Commissioner Adam Silver knows that, unofficially, guaranteed. But before stepping into that role, on Friday, they dedicated their time to helping schools and young minds. Their Eat. Learn. Play. The foundation organized a day of service and a playground renovation at an elementary school in the city.\n\n\u201cThis is where we both became adults, where we started our life together, where we had our first child,\u201d Ayesha Curry told The Associated Press. \u201cSo for us, Oakland has always left this enormous impact on our spirits. And we\u2019ve always said that we would continue to be a part of the community, even if we weren\u2019t necessarily right in Oakland every single day.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nOn the other hand, Sonya took it upon herself to share valuable lessons with the little ones, one that would help pave the way for their future.\n\nBut the All-Star Game is almost here. And after fulfilling his off-court duties, Stephen Curry will soon be gearing up to take the court. This time again, surely both women will be in the stands, supporting him there as well. With his clock ticking towards the inevitable end to a storied career, this game will surely be Stephen Curry\u2019s love letter to his beloved backyard.",

Let's discuss whether Oracle stock is a buy right now.\n\nCapitalizing on AI cloud infrastructure demand\n\nThe data-intensive requirements for companies building out their AI capabilities have made Oracle's ecosystem of products and services more important than ever. This includes Oracle's hybrid cloud solutions, spanning infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. The integrated platform represents a critical component of the AI value chain, enabling data storage, scalable computing for model training, and seamless deployment of AI applications.\n\nThe growth trends have been solid. For Oracle's last reported fiscal 2025 second quarter (for the period ended Nov. 30, 2024), total revenue climbed by 9% year over year, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was up 10% from the prior-year quarter. Within the top line, the bigger story was the 52% increase in cloud infrastructure revenue, reflecting what management described as a record level of AI demand, including with an increasing rate of new customers.\n\nThe financial metric that stands out is Oracle's remaining performance obligation (RPO), which reached a record $97 billion, up 49% from last year. This indicator, a measure of the contract backlog not yet recognized as revenue, provides some confidence for a growth runway. For the year ahead, management is guiding for double-digit revenue growth, with an acceleration expected into fiscal 2026.\n\nThe ongoing shift toward more value-added high-tech services should also help lift margins and earnings. That outlook is reflected in Wall Street analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo! Finance, which forecast Oracle's EPS growth to outpace the sales momentum with a 10.6% increase this year and 14.1% next year.\n\nMetric 2025 Estimate 2026 Estimate Revenue $57.7 billion $65.0 billion Revenue growth (YOY) 9% 12.6% Adjusted EPS $6.15 $7.02 Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 10.6% 14.1%\n\nThe Stargate Initiative growth driver\n\nPerhaps the most important development for Oracle this year is its role within the Stargate Initiative. The AI infrastructure project, announced by the new Trump administration, aims to maintain the leadership role of the United States in cutting-edge technology through policy and regulatory support that recognizes its strategic importance to national security.\n\nFunded through an initial planned investment of $100 billion by the Japanese holding group SoftBank, the joint venture includes Oracle and OpenAI and is focused on the development and construction of data centers to power advanced AI models. Oracle stands to benefit significantly as a key technology provider. It's partnering with OpenAI, which has committed to shifting its AI workloads to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a new growth driver over the next several years.\n\nThe Stargate Initiative may go a long way toward helping to reaffirm Oracle's previously issued financial targets, incremental to its organic opportunities. The company expects to reach more than $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, which is nearly double the $53 billion result in fiscal 2024. Oracle also expects EPS to accelerate above a 20% annual growth rate in the next five years.\n\nA bullish outlook for Oracle stock\n\nWhat I like about Oracle is its broader exposure to high-level themes in technology as a global leader in the ongoing digital transformation.\n\nThe company remains a major player in cybersecurity and data privacy, while its flagship Autonomous Database platform, with multiple industry-specific solutions, is now being used with AI and machine learning to deliver even greater productivity benefits. That layer of diversification beyond cloud infrastructure is what makes the stock a compelling investment. With the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times its consensus 2026 EPS, Oracle could prove to be a bargain if the expected growth acceleration materializes through its ability to capture market share as a high-performance hyperscaler.\n\nOverall, Oracle is well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders as it executes its profitable growth strategy, and the stock deserves a spot within diversified investor portfolios with upside in 2025.",

            "content": "OAKLAND \u2013 As Kyrie Irving stepped onto the Oracle Arena court for the NBA All-Star game practice session on Saturday morning, he couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of the three battles he had in the 2015-17 NBA Finals with the Golden State Warriors when he was playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe Warriors defeated Cleveland for the 2015 and \u201917 NBA titles, but Irving and the Cavs captured the 2016 NBA championship. And in the decisive Game 7 of that series held at Oracle Arena, it was Irving who drained a three-pointer over Stephen Curry to break a tie and give the Cavs a 92-89 lead with just 53 seconds remaining in a game they won, 93-89.\n\nFor the Cavs, that ended a 52-year major sports championship drought for the city of Cleveland.\n\nAnd Irving, who now plays for the Mavericks, was right smack in the middle of the action.\n\n\u201cIf you guys only knew what it\u2019s like to be in that locker room when those Warriors fans were just making so (much noise),\u201d Irving said. \u201cCelebrity row was going crazy.\n\n\u201cAnd the Finals was just one of those memorable moments that I look back on as a holy man now. I\u2019m grateful that I got to go through that.\u201d\n\nIrving also is grateful to have played at Oracle Arena before the Warriors left after the 2018-19 season to move to Chase Center in San Francisco, where Irving will be participating in Sunday\u2019s All-Star game.\n\n\u201cImagine how much history took place in here that I was not a part of, but also a part of,\u201d Irving said, referring to Oracle Arena. \u201cA lot of battles, man.\n\n\u201cA lot of blood, sweat and tears poured out on that court. It felt nostalgic going out there, but at the same time it felt re-invigorating, if that makes sense.\u201d\n\nThose three meetings in the Finals between the Cavs and Warriors have sort of made Irving and Curry joined at the hip. Especially since they joined the NBA around the same time \u2013 Curry was the No. 7 overall pick of the 2009 NBA Draft and Irving was the No. 1 overall selection in 2011.\n\n\u201cMe and Steph\u2019s relationship is ultra-competitive,\u201d Irving said during Saturday\u2019s Media Day. \u201cThat\u2019s where it started from just because we didn\u2019t really know each other coming into the league. To see him ascend to the places he\u2019s been \u2013 two-time MVP \u2013 and I\u2019m on record saying that he\u2019s been the guy for our generation for a while. When someone\u2019s setting that precedent and (being) that successful, it\u2019s hard not to try to steal recipes from him for success.\n\n\u201cWhether that be things that he does in the weight room, whether that be the way he handles being a franchise leader, or whether (that be) handling tough situations, I\u2019ve learned a lot from him and I think that\u2019s been a great kind of \u2014 not distant relationship \u2014 but we\u2019ve kept it competitive. But at the same time when we\u2019re at places like this we can open up to each other and talk from places of just understand that we know what it\u2019s like being in that pressure-cooker, being a small guard and leading your team.\n\n\u201cIt feels good when you get on the other end of success and all those doubters got to look you in the face and say you did it. I think that attitude and mentality that Steph has had for a while, it\u2019s rubbed off on a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIrving went about his All-Star duties with his daughter, Azurie Elizabeth, nearby. This is Irving\u2019s ninth All-Star appearance, and Azurie is nine years old, and the Mavs\u2019 guard wanted to make this weekend a daddy-daughter date.\n\n\u201cI just got here (Friday) night and I feel like it\u2019s been great,\u201d Azurie said. \u201cI think this weekend is going to be very memorable.\u201d\n\nAzurie said she\u2019s looking forward to her dad\u2019s team winning the All-Star game, and: \u201cI want to see his jersey on him.\u201d She also was taken aback by all the other All-Stars she was able to see.\n\n\u201cIt looks so different,\u201d Azurie said. \u201cLike, Oh my God, there\u2019s so many people from other teams. It\u2019s like, oh, wait, there\u2019s someone from the (Milwaukee) Bucks.\n\n\u201cOh, wait, there\u2019s someone from Boston. Oh, wait, there\u2019s someone from LA. It\u2019s just really exciting for me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s really excited for Irving, also, who explained to one reporter the secrets to his exceptional ball-handling skills.\n\n\u201cThe secret to my handles, I was born with some anatomy gifts,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI was born with some big hands, but also what I lack in height I make up for it by being closer to the ground and being able to get around taller defenders.\n\n\u201cSo, attacking people\u2019s hips and being quick on my feet, I would say my footwork and then also hand placement (are advantages). Being able to handle that ball and also being able to see your opponent eye-to-eye while you\u2019re dribbling, and to see the rim, too.\u201d\n\nIrving was also asked about the Mavs acquiring Anthony Davis and Max Christie from the Los Angeles Lakers for Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in a trade earlier this month. A reporter asked Irving about \u201cthe noise\u201d surrounding the trade.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it noise,\u201d Irving said. \u201cThis is what drives the engine of our business. It\u2019s the other side of our responsibility as artists or as athletes, is being engaging. Sometimes when you\u2019re dealing with things in the public eye it\u2019s not always going to be received the right way or positively by everybody, which is perfectly healthy and normal. But for me it\u2019s just maintaining my focus on the main task at hand \u2013 my missions, my goals. Every day I wake up, that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. To include others is also a beautiful thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on this journey alone. All of our emotions fluctuate when we really love what we do. I love the people that show up every day. They\u2019re not going to be the same, but they\u2019re going to be honest and transparent and work towards that goal, and that, for me, wins championships in this league.\u201d\n\nORACLE ARENA SHOWN SOME LOVE: On the day after Valentine\u2019s Day, the NBA staged its Media Day and also the HBCU Classic in Oakland at Oracle Arena, the former home of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Warriors played their home games at Oracle Arena from 1971 until 2019 when they moved to Chase Center in nearby San Francisco. In addition, the Warriors won three of their four NBA titles \u2014 in 2015, \u201917 and \u201918 \u2014 in Oracle Arena, so returning to the scene of so many celebratory moments meant a lot of Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment, for sure,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI think the idea of knowing we made the move to Chase Center and been in San Francisco the last six seasons, to have a little bit of a moment to honor and reminisce the 47 years that we played in this building, the 10 years that I had, growing up in the game inside of these walls, the energy in this building that can come back just like that, I\u2019ve enjoyed it to the fullest.\n\n\u201cHaving another opportunity to shine a light on the HBCUs and the game that\u2019s being played, it is a moment that\u2019s just truly Oakland, truly authentic to what I have experienced here, and it all matters. So, it\u2019s pretty dope.\u201d\n\nFormer Warriors forward Kevin Durant also thought it was \u201cpretty dope\u201d for the NBA pay homage to Oakland by bringing some events to Oracle Arena.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything would be up here at Oracle,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be doing everything at Chase. So, to kind of take the route that I used to take when I would come to the games is pretty cool.\n\n\u201cNostalgic to see some of the stuff that I\u2019ve seen when I was here. I\u2019ve always got love for the Bay Area and the fans. I was grateful to play for them for three years.\u201d\n\nDurant played for the Warriors from 2016-19, and was the Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals when they won back-to-back NBA championships in 2017 and again in \u201918.\n\nSILVER WEIGHS IN ON THE TRADE: During his press conference before All-Star Saturday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver weighed in on the Mavs securing Anthony Davis and Max Christie in a trade for Luka Don\u010di\u0107 earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Nico Harrison for a long time from his prior tenure at Nike, and I\u2019ve gotten to be close to Patrick Dumont, our new governor in Dallas,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI can say one thing for sure: Whether or not history will ultimately judge this as a smart trade, they did what they thought was in the best interest of their organization. I have absolutely no knowledge or belief there were any ulterior motives. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the Dumont and Adelson families bought that team to keep it in Dallas. I have no doubt whatsoever that they\u2019re committed to the long-term success of that franchise.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the Dallas fans, all I can say to them is again, time will tell whether it was a smart trade, but I think they should believe in their organization. Their organization truly made a trade that they believed was in the best interest of the organization, and in many cases, again, it doesn\u2019t mean they were right or wrong, but it\u2019s very difficult to put yourself in their shoes. They are living with the situation. They have a philosophical belief on what\u2019s necessary ultimately to win championships, and I\u2019m not in a position to second-guess that.\n\nBRIEFLY: Milwaukee guard Damian Lillard was born and raised in Oakland and was thrilled the NBA decided to have some of its All-Star events in his hometown. Especially since the Golden State Warriors have moved to San Francisco, and the NFL\u2019s Oakland Raiders and MLB\u2019s Oakland A\u2019s have moved to Las Vegas. \u201cI thought it was a great idea, especially with what\u2019s happening with the professional teams in Oakland right now,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cGrowing up close by here, driving by and looking at the (Oakland) Coliseum and seeing Oracle and how dead it is, when there was so much energy in it when I was a kid with the Raiders, the A\u2019s, the Warriors being here, concerts coming through here. I remember a lot about this parking lot. One of the first things I asked when I got here was, are they doing Saturday night at Oracle? Just because I would have loved to see that energy be here.\u201d . . . Asked if he needs to win an NBA title so he can be mentioned in the same conversation with Dallas Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, this is what Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had to say: \u201cYou play the game to win, and that\u2019s, at the end of the day, all that really matters. In my mind if you don\u2019t win, you lost and if you lost, you failed. Now you learn through those failures and losses, but ultimately, I wake up in the morning to win, and if I don\u2019t succeed in that in my career, I will have never accomplished what I wanted to.\u201d . . . The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 first game out of the All-Star break will be Thursday at the Moody Center ATX in Austin against the Phoenix Suns. That means Suns forward Kevin Durant will be back in the city where he played the 2006-07 season for the Texas Longhorns before he turned pro after his freshman season and became the No. 2 overall pick of the 2007 NBA Draft behind Greg Oden. \u201cI\u2019m excited that we get to go back to play a regular season game there,\u201d Durant said. \u201cAustin is a place where I kind of started this journey, and to have so many friends and family that are still there from, what, 16, 17 years ago, is pretty sweet. So, I appreciate the NBA for setting this up. I\u2019m going to try to roam around the city a little bit. I don\u2019t have a set schedule, but I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to see.\u201d . . . Mac McClung became the first player in NBA history to win the Slam Dunk Contest three years in a row. McClung, a 6-2 guard who played at Texas Tech in 2022 and now plays in the G League for the Osceola Magic, had three perfect scores in taking home the title over San Antonio Spurs guard Stephon Castle. McClung received perfect scores from the five judges when he jumped over a car and when he dunked two basketballs at once \u2014 one guy was on a ladder holding a basketball and another guy was holding a basketball while circling on a hoverboard. McClung also had Cleveland Cavaliers center Evan Mobley (6-11) stand on a three-inch board and he jumped over him, then tapped the basketball on the front of the rim before dunking it. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers won the Skills Challenge and Miami\u2019s Tyler Herro captured the Three-Point Contest with a one-point victory over Golden State\u2019s Buddy Hield.\n\nX: @DwainPrice",

Rather than racing toward general purpose virtual assistants, Oracle has decided to add targeted features that speed common-but-tedious tasks like entering a brief write-up of how a sales meeting went into a corporate records system.\n\nAnother such task that is common in the business world is giving a customer a price quote on a complicated purchase that might have a lot of options, when a sales professional would need to sift through materials to come up with a price.\n\nNetSuite on Thursday announced a feature to compile such a quote via conversation with a chatbot asking what the customer wants, which can either be used by sales professionals behind the scenes to speed up their work, or directly by consumers in the case of e-commerce businesses.\n\n\"When you buy something like a bicycle, you have to configure it - figure out what parts you want and which parts work together. We all do it when we buy our cars on the web these days,\" Evan Goldberg, executive vice president of Oracle NetSuite, told Reuters.\n\n\"If you can configure (products) for customers more easily, you can do more deals in a day, or each deal costs less.\"\n\nTo power those features, Oracle has decided to skip the costly race to develop huge AI models and instead works with partners such as Canadian startup Cohere.\n\nGoldberg said that Oracle's recent agreement to build massive data centers with ChatGPT creator OpenAI could lead to working with it as well, though the two firms have made no formal announcements.\n\n\"I think you could safely say that there's a possibility that OpenAI will be part of this,\" Goldberg told Reuters. \"We are eager to work with OpenAI.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Stephen Coates)",

We literally created teams just to beat the Warriors.\"\n\nGolden State played its home games at Oracle Arena from 1971 through the 2018-19 season, repeatedly facing off against Harden's Rockets in the postseason.\n\nHouston was never able to emerge victorious, though.\n\nThe two teams faced off in a playoff series on four separate occasions during Harden's tenure, with the Warriors winning every time. The Rockets came close to advancing during the 2017-18 season, narrowly falling to Golden State by nine points in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals.\n\nHarden blossomed into one of the NBA's elite three-level scorers in Houston, earning All-Star honors in each year as a member of the organization and winning the 2018 MVP award. He averaged 29.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game on 44.3/36.2/86.2 shooting splits with the Rockets.\n\nWhile Harden may no longer be competing for scoring titles on an annual basis, he's in the midst of a resurgent 2024-25 campaign in Los Angeles and earned his 11th All-Star nod.\n\nHe's recording 21.5 points and 8.6 assists per game for a Clippers team that currently owns the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference standings with a 31-23 record.",

            "content": "From time to time, Stephen Widmark\u2019s students salute him. As it turns out, there is no greeting more suitable for the former US Air Force pilot turned science teacher.\n\nWidmark, an AP Physics 1 and C teacher, was an F-111 Weapons system officer in the US Air Force from 1982 to 1988. After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in physics, Widmark said that he was burned-out from academia and thought that flying in the Air Force would be \u201cexotic.\u201d\n\nHe was stationed in England, and he was deployed to Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Germany. During one of his missions, Widmark was flying supersonic over the Mediterranean, 200 feet above sea level. They were 200 miles from the southern tip of Italy when they ran out of gas and had to chase sheep off the runway to land in Crotone, Italy.\n\nHowever, Widmark said that his experience in the military was not as exciting and challenging as he expected. He was moved to an eight-hour desk job at a wing headquarters, the command center for a specific wing in the Air Force, in England. Eventually, he said that he left the military because he was burnt-out and wanted to protect his political ideology.\n\n\u201cI came from a pretty liberal background,\u201d Widmark said. \u201cAnd, politically, the military tends to be conservative. It kind of disturbed me a little bit when I saw a lot of the old timers, the people that had been in [the Air Force] for 20 years, and their worldview seemed to me to be very skewed.\u201d\n\nDuring his early teaching career in the 90s, Widmark developed a flight-simulator physics curriculum based on a fictional aircraft called the A20A Vindicator using his experience in the Air Force.\n\n\u201cI certainly learned a lot,\u201d Widmark said. \u201cI think [the military] is a good place for a young man to be.\u201d\n\nHistory and social science teacher David Ortiz was an 11B Infantryman in the US Army from 2010 to 2014. He said that joining the military was equivalent to joining a brotherhood, something that he did not have growing up without siblings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain bond that happens when you go through such trauma together,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cThere\u2019s an intimacy.\u201d\n\nOrtiz was stationed in Kentucky and deployed to Afghanistan for eight months.\n\n\u201cDeploying was a kind of a surreal experience,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cEspecially for a first timer because you\u2019re going into a war zone and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come back.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ortiz said that going to Afghanistan made him develop a stronger sense of appreciation.\n\n\u201cThe village we were next to had kids running around barefoot,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI really saw that they were happy with what they had. Here, we are not happy until we have the newest iPhone. These people have nowhere near what we have, yet they are happier than we are.\u201d\n\nOrtiz said that he was discharged for an injury that left him unemployed and homeless for six months. His military friends housed him for some time and he moved around to St. Louis,Chicago, Las Vegas, and Bakersfield, California. He eventually settled in San Diego.\n\n\u201cIt almost feels like society completely rejected you,\u201d Ortiz said of his discharge. \u201cI sacrificed a few years of my life. I lost some friends, but I can\u2019t get a job. You feel like you\u2019re basically at square one again.\u201d\n\nOrtiz said that he was drawn to teaching because it was \u201cmilitary-like\u201d in structure and leadership. He said his \u201cunit\u201d is now his students, not fellow soldiers.\n\n\u201cThere is a mission that we undertake in [the classroom],\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cYou are going on a journey together for nine straight months. There are connections and bonds that last forever because you endure the trauma of the class.\u201d\n\nEngineering teacher Dr. Curtis Smith was an intelligence officer in the Navy from 1988 to 1995 and a reservist until 2011.. Smith said that with a single mother who could not afford college tuition, joining the military was one of his few options. Joining the military was \u201can opportunity for adventure\u201d \u2014 a change from growing up in the 10,000 person town of Canton, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI do have a romanticism for the ocean and the sea,\u201d Smith said. During his seven years on active duty, Smith was stationed in San Diego, and he was deployed to Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and several countries in the Pacific.\n\nHe said it was the \u201cmoments of stupidity\u201d with his fleet that kept him going. He said the fleet broke a monotonous 111 days at sea by catapulting a Chevrolet Impala off of the aircraft carrier.\n\nIn August of 1990, Smith was deployed in the North Indian Sea, heading for Australia on an aircraft carrier. He said that his captain ordered the fleet to turn around back to the Persian Gulf. Saddam Hussein, former dictator of Iraq, had ordered an invasion of Kuwait.\n\n\u201cI remembered feeling that \u2018shit, this is real,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201c\u2018These are real bullets and real missiles. Training is over.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith said that one of the more difficult parts of joining the military was giving up freedom.\n\n\u201c[I] grew up in America where we have unlimited freedom [and] unlimited rights,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe speak our mind [and] we do what we want. [When] you join the military, you give that up. An order is an order. It\u2019s not a request. It\u2019s not open to your interpretation or your opinion.\u201d\n\nOrtiz shares this sentiment.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call in sick,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss a day. You can\u2019t go to 7-11 and grab an ice cream. You can\u2019t do a lot of things we take for granted. One of the first things [me and my fellow soldiers] did when we came back was hit up a Baskin Robbins because we hadn\u2019t had ice cream for so long.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith, although it took time to grow into the military, it was more difficult to transition back into civilian life after being dispatched for a diving injury.\n\n\u201cI was used to being called sir,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was used to being saluted. There was a time when I flew more in helicopters than I drove my own pickup truck.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the military, Smith joined Troops to Teachers, a military program that paid veterans to get their teaching credentials to teach at low-income schools for four years. Smith said that he is able to use his military experience to teach the practical applications of engineering. He also said that he tends to take himself less seriously than other staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been shot at, I\u2019ve been stabbed, I\u2019ve been in combat zones, I\u2019ve jumped out of airplanes,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNothing we do in education is life or death. I don\u2019t get as hung up or stressed out about things as most people.\u201d\n\nWellness coordinator Michelle Burgos was a 25U Signal Operations Specialist in the US Army Reserve for six years after high school. As the middle daughter of two immigrants, she said that she felt like an outcast for most of her life. Joining the military was her chance to give back to America.\n\n\u201cThis country gave my parents so much,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cThey gave them papers. My dad bought his first home. I felt like I wanted to do my part.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Burgos, her parents were against it \u2014 joining the military was an act of defiance.\n\n\u201cI always felt weak being a woman of color,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cI had seen a lot of stuff in my life that always put the woman as a victim. There was a lot of trauma in my life that made me want to join the military and be strong and be able to protect myself when I needed to.\u201d\n\nBurgos completed basic training in Georgia, Advanced Individual Training in South Carolina, and was stationed at Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California. Burgos said that completing basic training was her most difficult experience.\n\n\u201cTheir whole purpose is to break you, both physically and mentally,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cSo they trash talk you. They make you do these insane physical workouts. There was a little bit of sexism and also racism in the military. There were girls that would cry every day trying to go home.\u201d\n\nWhen Burgos graduated basic training, she said that it was the first time that her mom said that she was proud of her. According to Burgos, now, her experience in the military is the first thing her parents talk about.\n\n\u201cPeople [who] don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in the military or what [soldiers] go through might judge [the military],\u201d Burgos said. \u201cWhen it comes to wars, they might not quite understand that we\u2019re all mostly just soldiers following orders. After I joined, I realized it\u2019s a big honor to be part of the military.\u201d\n\nAfter returning from the military, Burgos said that she struggled with panic attacks and anxiety.\n\n\u201c[The military] made me push down more of my feelings,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cBecause you want to be so strong, there is no time to process everything that is going on with you emotionally. So you start to bottle it up.\u201d\n\nHowever, Burgos said that working with students at MVHS has helped her mental health.\n\n\u201cMy job makes me happier,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cI love being around kids because they\u2019re hilarious. They are so young, and they are dreamers. It makes us, older people, remember that we were once like that.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other momentum stocks.\n\nIn the fast-paced world of investing, momentum is a force that can propel portfolios to new heights\u2014or leave them vulnerable to abrupt reversals. Momentum investing, a strategy centered on capitalizing on upward-trending stocks, has gained renewed attention as markets navigate economic uncertainty, technological disruption, and shifting consumer behaviors. For investors seeking to harness this strategy, the choices of hedge funds\u2014often regarded as the \u201csmart money\u201d on Wall Street\u2014offer a compelling roadmap. These institutions deploy vast resources, cutting-edge analytics, and seasoned expertise to identify stocks with the potential to sustain momentum.\n\nThe Allure of Momentum Investing:\n\nMomentum investing is based on the idea that stocks with strong recent performance are likely to keep rising. This momentum is driven by factors such as positive earnings surprises, favorable sector trends, or shifts in the economy. Unlike value investing, which focuses on undervalued stocks, momentum investing capitalizes on market psychology, riding waves of optimism and institutional buying.\n\nWhy Hedge Funds Matter:\n\nHedge funds manage billions in assets and employ teams of analysts, quantitative models, and proprietary data to stay ahead of trends. Their stock picks often reflect deep conviction in a company\u2019s fundamentals, competitive edge, or alignment with transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), renewable energy, or healthcare innovation. When multiple hedge funds converge on a stock, it signals collective confidence in its momentum potential. Moreover, their filings\u2014such as quarterly 13F disclosures\u2014provide a window into their strategies, offering retail investors actionable insights. While past performance is no guarantee, tracking these moves may help identify high-conviction opportunities poised for sustained growth.\n\nGrowth of Momentum Stocks:\n\nMomentum stocks have experienced significant growth recently, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, healthcare, and digital transformation. In 2024, momentum investing emerged as one of the top-performing strategies, with high-momentum stocks outperforming low-momentum ones by 28% year-over-year as of December 11, 2024, as reported by Morgan Stanley.\n\nHedge funds have been instrumental in this trend, significantly increasing their investments in momentum-driven sectors. For instance, hedge funds boosted their exposure to financial firms by 50%, totaling $340 billion, contributing to a 33% surge in the NASDAQ Bank Index, which outpaced both the broader market and the tech-heavy Nasdaq.",

            "content": "French indie upstarts Oracle Sisters have released their sophomore album, Divinations, out on February 14. This album comes from Wizard Artists; a label founded by the band. The colorful artwork was also made by them too, using scraps from newspaper clippings.\n\nFollowing a very busy and successful 2023 and a world tour supporting their debut album Hydranism, the band could not believe how fast the year flew and how much was squeezed into it. From festival stages to infighting brawls, these high and lows combined with the weariness of the road inspired them to reflect on nomadity. Divinations is a nomadic record; partially recorded in Parisian studios, Valentine Studios in L.A., and even an icy barn in the French wilderness. Sonically, the band experimented with swapping primary instruments, playing with toy drum machines, and crafting melodies on quirky tools like the OP-1 and a baby Casio keyboard.\n\nThis album mirrors that nomadic aspiration because it isn\u2019t quite set in one genre. It\u2019s indie, but it forays into folk, post-rock, country with steel guitar, and even some jazz with saxophone interspersed. Oracle Sisters cite Carl Jung, Leonard Cohen, Air, Talking Heads, Rimbaud, and Baudelaire as influences on Divinations.\n\n\u201cRiverside\u201d is the first song on the record, and it sets a transcendental mood: reverb-laden guitar like a rippling river. A walk along the river, the band urge us, \u201cDon\u2019t go askin\u2019 nothing.\u201d The river will tell us what we need to hear. \u201cHow far are you going?/Is it more than money can buy?\u201d Going further than we\u2019ve ventured before on our stroll, the Oracle Sisters incorporate piano flourishes, saxophone splashes, visuals of songbirds, and a world of inspiration outside your door and within your quieted mind. From the riverbank, we travel to \u201cMarseille,\u201d where the song was penned. Tambourine and vocal harmonies are the focus here on this psychedelia pop tune, and, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d as this song wraps a summery breeze around you.\n\nReturning to the image of a songbird, the lead single \u201cAlouette\u201d is an homage to a lark, meant to be a French children\u2019s song. It\u2019s a bass-driven dance number with a chorus of unlikely members, \u201cThe pirates sing their song/The owls and the artists,\u201d and the titular alouette. Their guitar tone is so lovely and reminiscent of The War on Drugs. \u201cBlue Left Hand\u201d is a reference to The Caliban and the Witch by Silvia Federici, a critique on selfishness and collaboration throughout capitalism. They sing, \u201cIt\u2019s in the harbor of every page / It\u2019s in the corner of the playwright\u2019s stage / And every player and every fake / And every witch that we burned at the stake.\u201d The funky, bouncy tune ends with a sharp twist; \u201cWe had it great/ Now you got it / You can throw it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cVelveteen\u201d also channels transcendentalism with a clear picture of the tail-end of winter, chopping wood in the forest. Shimmery guitar and synths poke out and signal spring is here. \u201cIs that a honeybee in my hair?\u201d Following that, \u201cShotguns\u201d begs the listener to \u201chowl with the wind, baby howl with the sea.\u201d The singalong chorus of da-da-das and steel guitar bring us to spring. Birds chirp; the song fades out to a thunderstorm outside our windows.\n\n\u201cMoon on the Water\u201d is again springtime. \u201cMoon on the water, shine, it\u2019s raining all the time,\u201d sing the Sisters. \u201cHow long, how long, how long we raised you from the wood?\u201d Piano and saxophone dance separately then together. For a split second at the end, the saxophone reminds me of Pharoah Sanders\u2019 \u201cHarvest Time;\u201d a flurry of notes I recognize that evoke peace. \u201cTalk is Cheap\u201d features Johansen gently lulling us with soothing voice and piano, singing sweetly. If \u201cTalk is Cheap\u201d is the lullaby, \u201cBanshee\u201d evokes drifting, \u201cI close my eyes, and I dream you\u2019re close\u2026waiting on it, waiting on it, waiting on your touch.\u201d\n\nThe title track of Divinations is also dreaming, but deep sleep. A single piano note is repeated on a fade-in and then we are afloat on a stream of consciousness with a simple guitar lick. The guitar solo is a fretboard waltz, up and down the neck. The intro guitar lick refrains in the outro before the album blossoms. The album ends suddenly; how I wish I could bottle this sound up.\n\nOracle Sisters traversed the world in 2023. The trio of Willett, Lazar, and Johansen compiled a wide array of musical, philosophical, and literary influences to create Divinations. They brought us with them to Norman Rockwell vignettes, Thoreauvian headspaces, and have given us a soundtrack for all four seasons. Even though there is a foot of snow on the ground, this album fills me with wanderlust and exploring the Great Outdoors. Grab your hiking boots, keep this album nearby, and go venturing.\n\nBuy Divinations here.",

Learn More.\n\nLarry Ellison, co-founder and chairman of Oracle, wants the U.S. to upload all national data \u2014 including highly sensitive personal information, such as genomic data \u2014 into an Oracle AI model for study. The world\u2019s fourth richest man shared his thoughts via a video call with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair on February 12 during the World Government Summit in Dubai.\n\nEllison says uploading national data is the \u201cmissing link\u201d\n\nIn Ellison\u2019s opinion, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to take full advantage of artificial intelligence until all national data is uploaded into an AI model. He recommended consolidating fragmented databases into one huge population data set, then feeding it into an AI model \u2014 ideally, one created by his company \u2014 so it can be analyzed for improvement suggestions and cost-cutting ideas.\n\n\u201cWe need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it\u2019s easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the missing link.\u201d\n\nEllison particularly emphasized the potential for AI models to identify waste and fraud in the U.S. government. He also mentioned the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), which is being run by fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who is also a friend of Ellison\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe can provide high-quality services, save the government vast amounts of money, our populations will be healthier and the government will be spending less for better outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics say that making such a widespread, consolidated database could be the first step in creating a unified mass surveillance system that tracks the residents of the United States. Ellison expressed his support for such a surveillance system in September 2024, saying it would keep people \u201con their best behavior\u201d on a call with Oracle financial analysts.\n\nOracle doubles down on AI technology\n\nEllison\u2019s remarks came amidst Oracle\u2019s huge and public push for artificial intelligence. Oracle is one of the founding partners of the Stargate initiative, alongside OpenAI, SoftBank, and MGX. The Stargate project aims to invest a total of $500 billion in U.S. AI infrastructure over the coming years. President Trump announced the project the day after assuming office.\n\nWhile Oracle may not be the first AI company that people think of, the corporation is working to position itself as the go-to option for underlying infrastructure and networking architecture, primarily databases that can be used to underpin AI models. Ellison\u2019s recent comments also indicate that the company hopes to become the foundation of any U.S. national AI models as well.",

            "content": "Should you invest in the underdog or the cloud leader?\n\nOracle (ORCL 1.09%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) represent two different ways to invest in the growing cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services markets.\n\nOracle, one of the world's largest database software companies, transformed many of its on-premise applications into cloud-based services over the past decade. It also expanded its own public cloud infrastructure platform to provide remote storage and computing power for enterprise customers. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, but it also owns the largest cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nOracle is often considered a slower-growth stock than Amazon. But over the past three years, Oracle's stock more than doubled as Amazon's stock rose about 40%. Let's see why Oracle outperformed Amazon, and if it remains the better buy right now.\n\nOracle is still growing at a steady rate\n\nOracle generated 32% of its revenue (excluding its acquisition of the healthcare IT giant Cerner in 2022) from its cloud-based services in fiscal 2024 (which ended in May 2024). That closely watched segment -- which hosts its cloud-based database services, enterprise resource planning (ERP) services, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services -- grew revenue 26% for the full year. That only represented a slight slowdown from its 29% growth (also excluding Cerner) in fiscal 2023.\n\nYet Oracle still generates the rest of its revenue from its legacy on-premise and cloud licensing businesses. Those slower-growth businesses partly offset the faster expansion of cloud-based services, but its total revenue still rose 6% for the full year.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Oracle's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% and 20%, respectively. That growth should largely be driven by the expansion of OCI, which has been rolling out more dedicated tools for hosting generative AI applications, and its own cloud-based services. It will also likely continue to expand cloud and AI ecosystems with more acquisitions.\n\nThat outlook seems bright, but investors should be mindful of the competitive threats. OCI is still a tiny underdog in the cloud platform race compared to AWS and Microsoft Azure, and those public cloud giants have also been expanding their own integrated database services to challenge older market leaders like Oracle.\n\nAmazon's core businesses are warming up again\n\nAmazon still generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce marketplaces, but most of its profits come from AWS' higher-margin business. In 2024, AWS only generated 17% of Amazon's net sales but accounted for 58% of its operating profit.\n\nAWS' revenue rose 19% for the full year. A lot of that growth was driven by the AI market, which drove more companies to upgrade their cloud-based infrastructure. AWS has also been rolling out custom application programming interfaces (APIs) like Bedrock, which can be used to build customized chatbots and generative AI tools.\n\nAmazon usually subsidizes the growth of its lower-margin marketplaces with AWS' higher-margin revenue. That unique strategy allows it to keep expanding its e-commerce ecosystem with loss-leading strategies, while the cash generated by its e-commerce ecosystem can support AWS' ongoing expansion.\n\nThat flexible business model widens its moat against both its cloud and e-commerce competitors. However, Amazon still needs to stay ahead of tough rivals like Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure market, while its e-commerce business faces intense competition from Chinese cross-border marketplaces like PDD's Temu.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Amazon's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 10% and 20%, respectively. Its growth should warm up again as the macro environment improves and the AI market expands.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nOracle outperformed Amazon over the past three years because Oracle's cloud business continued to expand as inflation and rising rates rattled the broader markets. Amazon's e-commerce business was less resistant to those macro headwinds.\n\nBut as interest rates decline and the macro environment stabilizes, Amazon might just win back more investors as its e-commerce and cloud businesses steadily expand again. Yet neither of these stocks can be considered a bargain right now. Oracle was recently trading at 33 times forward earnings, while Amazon had a higher forward multiple of 36.\n\nInvestors should take Wall Street's estimates with a grain of salt, but Oracle actually trades at a lower forward valuation while growing at a slightly faster rate than Amazon. So while both stocks might be reliable long-term plays on the expanding cloud and AI markets, Oracle looks like a slightly more balanced play on those trends than Amazon right now.",

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Oracle (ORCL) standing at $173.86, reflecting a +0.95% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.04%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.77%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.51%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 8.79% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.48% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.92% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Oracle in its forthcoming earnings report. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.48, marking a 4.96% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.36 billion, showing an 8.12% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.22 per share and revenue of $57.65 billion, which would represent changes of +11.87% and +8.85%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Oracle. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% lower. Currently, Oracle is carrying a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Oracle is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 27.67. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.78.\n\nIt's also important to note that ORCL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.72. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.18 as of yesterday's close.",

Incumbent Scott Johnston will leave the company with immediate effect.\n\nDuring his eight-year spell at Oracle, Johnson was instrumental in transitioning the company from its legacy on-premise roots to the cloud, setting up the OCI unit, and spearheading the company\u2019s resurgence these past few years.\n\nPrior to Oracle, Johnson worked as an engineer at AWS since the inception of Amazon\u2019s cloud division.\n\nDocker is seeking such credentials as it looks to expand into areas across the whole \u201cdevelopment life cycle,\u201d including cloud-based services.\n\n\u201cDocker both feels like a cool new startup and the bedrock of the container native universe, prevalent now and moving towards ubiquitous, as cloud-native takes over the world,\u201d Johnson said in a statement announcing his appointment.\n\nJohnson is Docker\u2019s sixth CEO, following co-founder Solomon Hykes, who led the company until 2013; Ben Golub, who departed in 2017 to make way for Steve Singh; and Rob Bearden, who was the company\u2019s CEO for just six months before Docker chief product officer, Scott Johnston, was promoted to lead the company in 2019.\n\nDocker station\n\nLast valued at $2.1 billion at its Series C round three years ago, Palo Alto-based Docker divested its enterprise business to Mirantis as Johnston took the reins six years ago. That deal signaled a shift in strategic focus as competing containerization services \u2014 such as Google-led Kubernetes and Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift \u2014 had gained traction.\n\nSubsequently, Docker \u201creturned to its roots,\u201d targeting developer tooling and container workflows rather than competing in enterprise infrastructure. This included new services spanning debugging, supply chain security, container testing, and a cloud-based container build service it launched last year.\n\nContainerization involves packaging software and its dependencies into portable, isolated environments (called \u201ccontainers\u201d), ensuring that the software runs consistently across all systems \u2014 on a local machine, server, or whatever cloud environment a company wishes to deploy on.\n\nSo as AI and cloud converge, with Docker pushing its own AI tools into the mix, Docker sees a new opportunity ahead.\n\n\u201cThere is so much opportunity to solve the broad array of challenges that developers and businesses continue to struggle with \u2014 from building and running the latest AI models, to running and operating in a secure and scalable manner, to achieving advanced levels of compliance, to just not breaking the build in CI [continuous integration,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEverything is harder than it should be. Every challenge that developers face is an opportunity for us to step in, take on the burden, and make their lives easier. You\u2019re going to see Docker solve these problems and more, building and innovating, and shipping things fast.\u201d",

            "content": "Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of database behemoth Oracle, more and more resembles a villain out of a science fiction movie. Recently, Ellison showed up at a global conference where he encouraged the governments of the world to fork over all of their data to the AI industry, claiming this would be beneficial to countries in the long run.\n\nBloomberg reports on Ellison\u2019s appearance at the World Government Summit in Dubai, where he was interviewed by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Ellison apparently encouraged the world leaders in attendance to \u201cunify\u201d their national data and feed it to AI models, so as to make AI stronger. Bloomberg writes:\n\nFragmented sets of data about a population\u2019s health, agriculture, infrastructure, procurement and borders should be unified into a single, secure database that can be accessed by AI models, Ellison said\u2026Countries with rich population data sets, such as the UK and United Arab Emirates, could cut costs and improve public services, particularly health care, with this approach, Ellison said.\n\nHow convenient, then, that Ellison happens to own a database company that is also currently attempting to scale up its AI business. Interesting how that works! \u201cWe can provide high-quality services, save the government vast amounts of money, our populations will be healthier and the government will be spending less for better outcomes,\u201d Ellison told the crowd.\n\nThe vision of the future that Ellison paints is fairly disturbing and feels not all too dissimilar from the \u201cRehoboam\u201d plot line from the 3rd season of Westworld. Ellison wants to create a smoother, more efficient world, one where the technocratic corporate state and the governments of the world are joined at the hip by a constant flow of population data.\n\nTake note, too, that at one of Oracle\u2019s corporate get-togethers last September, Ellison also said he foresaw the rise of a new AI-fueled surveillance state, wherein robotics and automated systems could monitor entire populations and keep them in line. Specifically, he said the following: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have supervision\u2026Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there\u2019s a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d This is the cheery future he wants to create.\n\nDuring the same event, Ellison gave an example of how AI and robotics would, in the years to come, allow governments to increase control over their populations. He cited high-speed car chases as an example: \u201cYou just have a drone follow the car,\u201d he said, apparently dispensing with the need for human police officers. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple in the age of autonomous drones.\u201d\n\nWhat if people don\u2019t want to behave, Larry? What if people want to let loose every once in a while? What then? I guess that\u2019s where the killer robot armies will come in.\n\nYou may not like what Ellison has to say but, increasingly, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s much you can do about it. The new Trump administration has made it known that it\u2019s going all-in on the AI industry and that it wants to build out America\u2019s AI businesses to make them the most dominant ones in the world. Ellison\u2019s Oracle was recently announced as a member of the Stargate project, a new AI infrastructure effort that seeks to build AI data centers all across the U.S. Other participating members include OpenAI, Microsoft, SoftBank, NVIDIA, and other powerful tech companies.",

We need to unify all the national data\n\nIf governments want in, they\u2019ll need to gather all their data \u2013 spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure. Whatever they\u2019ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal.\n\n\"I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can,\" Ellison said. \"We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like,\" he said. \"That's the missing link.\"\n\nHe believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated.\n\n\"As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large,\" Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.\n\nOf course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance \u2013 an idea Ellison last year said he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.\n\nConstant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone \"on their best behavior,\" Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the NSA, PRISM, Snowden et cetera.\n\nEllison is not just a techno-optimist. He\u2019s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.\n\nHe therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a big-time government and military contractor, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process.\n\n\"Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build,\" Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. \"Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models.\"\n\nAnd a handful of players that can train them. Oracle\u2019s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the Stargate project, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. \u00ae",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Vendor support agreements have long been a sticking point for customers, and the Oracle Applications Unlimited (OAU) program is no different. The high costs and lack of flexibility associated with OAU puts its value into question and affects enterprises running on Oracle E-Business Suite, JD Edwards Enterprise One, PeopleSoft, Siebel CRM, Hyperion, and more.\n\nAs security remains high on the priority list for companies and IT leaders,1 and increasingly so with the rise of cyber-attacks, IT executives are put into a tough position \u2013 trying to find the funds to keep their systems secure while having enough left to invest in innovation and growth.\n\nWhile the OAU program gives customers access to security patches and application updates which may be delivered through periodic upgrades at a cost of typically 22% of the annual license fees, applying changes to software introduces risk of compatibility issues with existing applications and customized software. That, in turn, can lead to system crashes, application errors, degraded performance, and downtime.2\n\nThese challenges and contradictions are prompting OAU customers to seek alternatives \u2013 including third-party support \u2013 to reduce cost, skip unneeded upgrades and consider strengthening their security posture without a dependency on vendor patches.\n\nIncreasing security risk and business impact\n\nThe security aspect can\u2019t be overstated, with security risks increasing daily as cyber threats evolve and IT environments expand. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities were reported to NIST in 2024, an increase of over 10,000 vulnerabilities YoY.3\n\nBreaches are also expensive. IBM put the latest global average cost of a data breach at $4.88 million, a 10% increase over 2023 and the highest total ever. Much of that cost is reputational in nature, as IBM reports \u201clost business\u201d accounts for 30% ($1.47M) of the costs of a data breach on average. 4\n\nSecurity strategies and proactive vulnerability management\n\nMost companies implement multiple levels of protection using specific solutions to protect against specific risks. While patching individual vulnerabilities may be one part of that strategy, an alternative (or complementary) approach is to proactively remedy whole categories of weaknesses that lead to vulnerabilities.\n\nRimini Street, the global leader of third-party support for Oracle, forms a partnership with its clients and helps them identify such weaknesses. The team offers ongoing guidance and detailed, regular reviews of clients\u2019 security posture, as well as proprietary information on how to stay protected.\n\nWith a long history dating back to 2005, securing thousands of clients in tightly regulated industries to address both their business and technical needs, Rimini Street\u2019s security offering, Rimini Protect\u2122, provides guidance and support in 3 primary ways:\n\nEstablishing an advisory relationship. Staying on top of active threats and vulnerabilities demands resources and expertise that organizations generally don\u2019t have. The Rimini Protect team continually tracks cyber threats on a global basis, providing threat intelligence research that gives users options for addressing the vulnerabilities they face that go well beyond industry best practices.\n\nUnderstanding your current security posture. The Rimini Protect team conducts a security assessment to evaluate the risk posture of a client\u2019s enterprise software as well existing security controls, network configurations, deployed applications, and policies. It follows and expands upon security guidance including the Open-Source Intelligence framework (OSINT), the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, and the Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).\n\nAddressing the remaining risk. Some risks cannot be mitigated through hardening guidance or security patches (if available). The Rimini Protect portfolio addresses security vulnerabilities as well as the underlying weaknesses that lead to those vulnerabilities, offering protection even against vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered \u2013 and without requiring changes to the software being protected.\n\n\u201cA proactive defense strategy helps to protect against unknown or yet-to-be-discovered vulnerabilities that can be exploited at some point in time,\u201d said Gabe Dimeglio, SVP & GM of Rimini Protect and Watch Solutions. \u201cBy getting ahead of bad actors and having a robust, proven method to immediately combat security breaches, organizations can help prevent the devastating impacts of cybersecurity breaches and the threats that lie-in-waiting for the perfect moment to attack.\u201d\n\nBreaking free from vendor support\n\nMany companies that have elected to switch to third-party support and services typically no longer receive new patches \u2013 and they have not looked back.\n\nFor Ricoh, the Japan-based provider of integrated digital services, selecting Rimini Support\u2122 and Rimini Protect\u2122 for its Oracle EBS applications proved to be a powerful combination that helped keep systems secure while freeing up critical resources for other strategic projects.\n\n\u201cRimini Street offers an attractive service that has saved us hundreds of millions of yen in upgrade costs. They provide highly skilled support engineers who can cover major ERP and database systems and protect them too,\u201d said Keisuki Hamanaka, Deputy General Manager, Process, IT and Data Management at Ricoh. \u201cRimini Street is the only partner that can support the Japanese market with the high-quality support and protection we need, at a price that aligns with our financial goals.\u201d5\n\nThe dilemma of what to do about risk mitigation shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to any organization\u2019s growth. Rimini Street gives organizations a robust third-party support option for turning application support into a competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cOur proactive approach reduces support costs, provides critical security support, and allows our customers to make the most out of their significant application investments,\u201d Dimeglio says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound alternative when new enterprise software features lack any business imperative, and more priority projects can be delivered leveraging those unlocked funds and resources by choosing Rimini Street.\u201d\n\nNo need to sacrifice innovation for security\n\nAs cyber-crime continues to rise, IT leaders must evolve their security strategy. Embracing a proactive, multi-layered approach to protecting enterprise software investments, including Oracle applications, can provide organizations with peace of mind. At the same time, the approach frees up resources needed to invest in the strategic IT initiatives that matter most to the business.\n\nWith the right third-party support, no longer do IT leaders need to choose between protection and innovation. Follow the path of hundreds of Oracle clients who have achieved flexibility, security and deep savings with Rimini Street.\n\nTo learn more about how Rimini Street can help businesses secure their Oracle applications, visit the Rimini Protect page.\n\n1CIO: 7 tough IT security discussions every IT leader must have\n\n2 Linford & co LLp: Navigating the Risks of Patch Management: Security & Stability in IT Systems\n\n3CVE Details\n\n4IBM.

This is just one place. There are Nickels all over this country.\u201d\n\nWhen Colson Whitehead published his 2019 novel \u201cThe Nickel Boys,\u201d it was met with great critical acclaim and received the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The book was inspired by the closing of the historic Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, a juvenile reform school in Florida, and the reveal of multiple civil rights violations and unmarked graves on the campus. Although this is a fictional story, real people and real suffering happened at schools like these all over the country, so it is important that people become aware of this.\n\nThe plot follows two boys named Elwood (played by Ethan Herisse) and Turner (played by Brandon Wilson) who are sent to the segregated Nickel Reform Academy in Florida. They meet and become good friends and endure discrimination and hardships from the white students and teachers. Eventually, Elwood realizes that nothing will change without direct action, so he secretly takes notes of their illegal actions to bring them down through the legal system.\n\nOne of the most notable things about the picture is that the entirety of the movie is shot from a first-person perspective, where the camera is positioned at the eyes of a character. While this setup does allow for several inventive framings, I felt that the characters were too static for the gimmick to be fully effective. Still, I hope that more films take more creative risks like this in how their stories are visually told in the future.\n\nOne large criticism I had with the film is that the occasional flash-forwards were unclear on what timeframe they occurred in. The television sets looked like they were from the 70s, but the computers and news articles were dated from 2018, which would put these events almost 50 years after the main story. While Daveed Diggs gives a good performance as the older version of Elwood, he is too good-looking for me to believe that his character would be 70.\n\nThis film only got two Oscar nominations: one for Best Picture and one for Best Adapted Screenplay. It is extremely unlikely to win either, but they always say that it is an honor just to be nominated.\n\nAlthough this may have been my least favorite of this year\u2018s Best Picture nominees, that does not mean this was a bad film. I still enjoyed my time watching \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d and my final rating for the film is a 7/10.",

            "content": "AI-Powered Growth in OCI: The rise of AI has created a need for powerful cloud computing resources, and Oracle has taken advantage of this opportunity. The amount of GPU usage on OCI increased by 336% in just one quarter, showing how much AI developers rely on Oracle's infrastructure. OCI stands out because of its ultra-fast networking and automated data centers, which allow AI models to train more quickly and at lower costs compared to many competitors.Oracle recently announced it had built the \"largest and fastest AI supercomputer,\" featuring up to 65,000 Nvidia G200 GPUs. Partnerships with AI leaders like Meta, OpenAI, and Nvidia show that OCI is becoming a trusted option for handling large-scale AI tasks. These collaborations give Oracle an edge over cloud providers that lack specialized AI capabilities. The big question is whether Oracle can continue growing in this space. AI workloads require massive amounts of computing power and energy, so Oracle must scale efficiently to maintain its advantage. Right now, demand for AI cloud services is growing rapidly, but Oracle will need to keep investing in its data centers and technology to stay ahead. I believe that the Stargate project investing $500 billion is commitment enough that Oracle is able to continue investing and continue growing.\n\nRecently, Oracle made headlines with its $500 billion joint investment in The Stargate Project, an OpenAI-led initiative to develop a massive data center footprint for AI compute needs. However, the AI growth story faced a major test on January 27, 2025, when DeepSeek announced that its latest AI models deliver performance comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT. This triggered a broad market sell-off, with Oracle dropping 13.79% as investors questioned the long-term returns of massive compute investments. Despite the short-term turbulence, I believe Oracle's long-term growth story remains intact.\n\nBack in 2020, Oracle was widely seen as a fading player in the cloud infrastructure spacea mature legacy vendor at risk of losing market share. Fast forward four years, and the narrative has shifted dramatically. Oracle is now experiencing significant growth in cloud infrastructure, shedding its outdated image as a company reliant solely on its database legacy. Over the past three years, its stock has surged ~50%, outpacing many faster-growing cloud competitors. This turnaround is driven by an aggressive pivot to cloud services, evolving from a measured transition to an all-out sprint. Oracle's transformation bears striking similarities to Amazon's rise, with cloud services fueling growth while traditional business lines take a back seat. Oracle Cloud, encompassing both SaaS (cloud-based versions of its software) and IaaS (infrastructure competing with AWS and Azure), has emerged as the company's primary growth engineand I believe the cornerstone of its evolution into an AI powerhouse.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCloud Database Strategy: While Oracle's advancements in AI have garnered significant attention, its database heritage remains a critical driver of its growth. Enterprises continue migrating on-premises databases to the cloud, drawn by Oracle's high-performance infrastructure and its flexible multi-cloud approach. This shift is yielding strong resultsOracle's cloud database services grew 28% YoY, generating $2 billion in annualized revenue. Oracle has also aggressively expanded its cloud footprint, adding 17 joint cloud regions to run its services on partner clouds, with plans for 35 more. This aligns with the rising trend of multi-cloud adoption, strengthening Oracle's positioning in this rapidly growing market. Furthermore, Oracle's data center expansion strategy sets it apart from competitors. The Stargate project, in particular, is a key differentiator, benefiting from strong U.S. government support as the country seeks to maintain technological dominance over China. This backing could accelerate Oracle's data center expansion plans, pulling forward investments and driving faster growth. Additionally, Oracle's deepening ties with OpenAI and Microsoft will likely prove invaluable in the broader AI race, as it aligns with two of the most influential players in the space. Given these factors, I expect sustained top-line growth from Oracle's cloud database segment, with long-term benefits and synergies emerging as the Stargate project progresses.\n\nSustained Growth Through Cloud Investments: Oracle has moved beyond simply catching up to early cloud leaders like AWS and Azure. The company is charting a unique path, leveraging AI, multi-cloud partnerships, and its SaaS offerings to drive growth. Management's commitment to operational discipline has allowed Oracle to improve profitability while increasing investments in high-growth areas like AI and cloud infrastructure. Looking ahead, Oracle aims to exceed $25 billion in cloud revenue this fiscal year, supported by its robust pipeline of AI deals and continued success in SaaS. As more organizations recognize OCI as a competitive and scalable alternative for large-scale AI, I believe Oracle's growth trajectory will only strengthen.Gaining Ground in a Competitive Landscape: Oracle may not yet rival the dominant players in PaaS, IaaS, or SaaS, with its market share trailing industry leaders like Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure). However, recent quarters have shown Oracle's cloud revenue growing at a faster pace than its competitors. In 2024, Oracle climbed from 7th to 5th position in global cloud market share, overtaking IBM and Salesforce, according to Synergy Research. Although I don't expect Oracle to challenge AWS or Azure in the short term, I believe the company is well-positioned to capture additional market share. Even incremental gains would significantly enhance Oracle's financial performance.\n\nOracle's AI-Powered Cloud Transformation: A New Era of Growth\n\n[Synergy Research]\n\nFundamentals\n\nOracle recently reported its fiscal Q2 results for the November quarter, which caused a brief sell-off due to a slight miss against consensus estimates. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.47, up 10% YoY, and beat management's high-end constant currency guidance by $0.01, but missed analyst expectations by the same margin. Revenue grew 8.6% YoY to $14.06 billion, just below Wall Street's estimate of $14.12 billion, marking a 50bps shortfall.\n\nDespite these misses, the core elements of Oracle's business continue to demonstrate strong growth. Oracle's cloud segment, encompassing IaaS and SaaS, reported a 24% YoY increase to $5.9 billion, accounting for 42% of total revenue. IaaS alone saw exceptional growth of 52% YoY, contributing $2.4 billion to the company's cloud revenue. The SaaS division, which grew 10% YoY, has also been a consistent performer. Together, these segments underline Oracle's robust cloud strategy and provide evidence that the Q2 miss is likely an anomaly rather than a trend.\n\nOracle's revenue growth has been accelerating over recent quarters, rising from 4% YoY in Q3 FY24 to 8% in Q1 FY25 and 9% in Q2 FY25. This steady improvement highlights the growing strength of the business. Moreover, Oracle has managed to maintain impressive margins despite its aggressive expansion efforts. Non-GAAP operating margin reached 45%, with pro forma operating income increasing 10% YoY to $6.10 billion. Margins also improved by 60bps YoY to 43.4%. With its combination of ~10% revenue growth and 40%+ margins, Oracle comfortably meets the \"Rule of 40,\" a benchmark of high-performing growth companies.\n\nFor Q3 FY25, Oracle expects currency headwinds to impact both revenue and earnings due to a stronger dollar. Revenue is forecast to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency (7% to 9% in USD), while non-GAAP EPS is projected between $1.50 and $1.54 in constant currency ($1.47 to $1.51 in USD). Despite these challenges, management maintained the quarterly dividend at $0.40 per share, signaling confidence in the company's financial health.\n\nOracle's growing demand story is reflected in its capital expenditure trends. Management guided for a doubling of CapEx in FY25 compared to the prior year, driven by strong customer demand for OCI and related services. During the last quarter, the capex-to-sales ratio reached an all-time high of nearly 30%, signaling a proactive approach to expanding capacity.\n\nWhile some may view the increase in CapEx as a concern, I see it as a necessary move to capitalize on the company's growing backlog. Remaining performance obligations (RPO) surged 50% YoY, with current RPO rising 20% YoY, demonstrating sustained revenue visibility. Oracle's ability to convert its robust backlog into revenue further reinforces its growth trajectory. Notably, Oracle's operational cash flow of $20 billion over the trailing twelve months positions it well to fund future growth initiatives and return value to shareholders.\n\nOracle's growth strategy now rests on three strong pillars: IaaS, SaaS, and cloud database services. The recent Meta deal brought another major AI player into Oracle's ecosystem, while partnerships with hyperscalers like AWS, Google, and Microsoft have added a new dimension to its cloud database offerings. These developments ensure that Oracle is not just reliant on one segment for growth but is leveraging multiple engines to drive revenue and profitability. As long as demand for cloud and AI services remains strongand I see no signs of it slowing down.\n\nValuation Dynamics\n\nNew Growth Dynamics Demand a Higher Multiple: Despite Oracle's accelerating growth and strategic AI partnerships, the stock continues to trade at a compelling valuation compared to its large-cap software peers. Oracle's forward P/E multiple of 19.4x is the lowest among competitors benefiting from similar AI-driven tailwinds, including Microsoft (23.7x), Amazon (29.2x), Workday (24.1x), and Salesforce (25.3x). This relative undervaluation provides investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to Oracle's AI and cloud-driven growth at a discount. While Oracle has not seen the same level of stock price appreciation as some AI-focused peers, I view this as a favorable entry point for investors to build a position.\n\nOracle's AI-Powered Cloud Transformation: A New Era of Growth\n\n[Alpha Spread]\n\nOracle has historically traded at a discount to its peers due to slower growth rates. However, this gap has significantly narrowed. With cloud revenue growing at 24% YoY, Oracle is now on par with, or even surpassing, the growth rates of companies like Salesforce and Workday, whose revenue growth has slowed to the low/mid-teens. The company's AI-driven tailwinds and strategic partnerships, such as the recent Meta deal and its collaborations with hyperscalers, are transforming Oracle's growth narrative. These developments justify a re-rating of Oracle's valuation. I believe Oracle should trade at the peer average forward P/E of 24.3x, reflecting its improved growth trajectory and strong position in the AI and cloud markets. Based on this multiple, I derive a target price of ~$201.7 per share, representing approximately 25% upside from current levels.\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis Supports Upside: To further assess Oracle's valuation, I conducted a DCF analysis using a discount rate of 9% and a terminal growth rate of 3% beyond the five-year forecast. I assumed a top-line CAGR of 12% over the next five years, aligned with Wall Street expectations, and kept the net margin steadya conservative approach given Oracle's proven ability to scale profitably. Under these assumptions, I arrive at a DCF-based target price of $188.54 per share, indicating upside potential of roughly 15%. While this is slightly below the target derived from peer multiple analysis, it still underscores the stock's attractive risk-reward profile.\n\nOracle's AI-Powered Cloud Transformation: A New Era of Growth\n\n[Alpha Spread]\n\nOracle's investments in AI, particularly in IaaS and OCI, have positioned the company as a key player in the next phase of cloud computing. The early-stage infrastructure investmentsdata centers, chips, and tools for building large language modelsare now paying off. With demand for Oracle's AI-powered solutions driving top-line growth, I expect further convergence between Oracle's valuation and those of its peers. The biggest risk for Oracle lies in the broader market environment. With valuations in the tech sector elevated, a market-wide correction could pressure Oracle's stock. However, Oracle's lower valuation relative to its peers provides some downside protection, making it a safer bet in a volatile market.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nOracle stands out as a resilient long-term investment in the cloud and AI sectors. Despite the Q2 miss, the company's accelerating revenue growth, robust margins, and strong demand for OCI reflect its ability to thrive in competitive markets. The recent Meta deal and expanding partnerships with major AI players underscore Oracle's growth trajectory, even as it lags behind larger competitors like Amazon and Microsoft in market share. With its disciplined expansion strategy, stable financials, and attractive valuation, Oracle offers a compelling entry point at ~15% off recent highs. For investors with a long-term horizon, Oracle's growth story remains firmly intact. The combination of strong fundamentals, increasing AI-driven opportunities, and reasonable valuation multiples provides both stability and upside potential. Whether through its cloud dominance, AI capabilities, or shareholder returns via dividends, Oracle is well-positioned to deliver sustainable value over time.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

            "content": "Oracle now offers its Fusion Cloud Applications Suite on the EU Sovereign Cloud. As a result, companies can keep their applications and data within EU borders when using Oracle\u2019s public cloud.\n\nDue to both EU and U.S. legislation, European organizations with critical social responsibilities cannot simply entrust their data to U.S. tech companies. Oracle was one of the first to address this concern. Its EU Sovereign Cloud operates entirely separate from the company\u2019s commercial cloud infrastructure, with no network connections to other Oracle cloud environments and a management team based in the EU. This guarantees that sensitive data remains within EU borders. Oracle is now extending access on this platform to all Fusion Cloud Apps.\n\nFusion Cloud Apps\n\nThe Fusion Cloud Applications Suite spans various enterprise applications, including ERP, HCM, and SCM. Most recently, Oracle added more than 50 new GenAI features to this suite, which are also becoming available in the sovereign cloud environment.\n\nDeploying Fusion Applications in the EU Sovereign Cloud greatly simplifies compliance with European regulations. Organizations no longer need complex configurations to ensure their data stays within the EU.\n\nRunning Oracle\u2019s AI tooling on-premises can be extremely costly because specialized hardware is required to power GenAI. Now that a sensible and compliant public cloud option is available to organizations in the EU with strict privacy requirements, Oracle\u2019s solutions become much more viable.\n\n\u2018True\u2019 compliance remains an issue\n\nLike Oracle, the three largest hyperscalers offer EU-specific solutions, yet critics argue these do not provide true certainty. So far, the U.S. government has never tested the law by demanding data from a sovereign cloud. It remains unclear whether AWS, Microsoft, or Google could comply with a CLOUD Act or Data Act request: European employees are bound by EU law and may be prohibited from removing encryption or granting special access.\n\nThese concerns are not always top of mind in day-to-day operations. Organizations tend to choose solutions based on features and pricing. While there is merit to the compliance promises from U.S. tech giants, Oracle\u2019s approach is more tangible. Simply put, no U.S. personnel are involved with Oracle\u2019s EU Sovereign Cloud, eliminating many data privacy worries. It may sound somewhat superficial, but these assurances offer peace of mind in the absence of legal challenges.\n\nAccording to Ashok Patel, Research Manager at IDC, the discussion should extend beyond technical privacy issues. \u201cThis [data privacy] trend goes beyond compliance. It\u2019s fundamentally about an organization\u2019s desire to maintain control, ensure security, and build trust in an increasingly AI-driven world. The availability of Oracle\u2019s complete cloud application suite\u2014offering the full range of services, features, and functionality\u2014in a sovereign environment is instrumental to meeting this critical market need in Europe.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Oracle and Google Cloud expand Oracle Database@Google Cloud",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other top AI stocks to watch amid DeepSeek frenzy.\n\nDeepSeek has sparked a frenzy for Chinese stocks with exposure to artificial intelligence innovations. While the focus in the past was on US tech giants, there is a realization that Chinese companies could be at par or even ahead amid the AI boom.\n\nThe renewed focus on Chinese AI investment comes as Grandview Research projects the country\u2019s artificial intelligence market to reach $206 billion by 2030 while growing at a compound annual growth rate of 44%. Amid the expected growth, investors have started jostling for investment opportunities with Chinese chipmakers, software designers, and even data center operators.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough shows Chinese engineers are creative and capable of inventions that can compete with Silicon Valley,\u201d said China Europe Capital Chairman Abraham Zhang. \u201cIt has also stirred nationalistic fever in capital markets.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs have already warned that there is a possibility of Chinese breakthroughs in artificial intelligence materially altering the stock market trajectory. The investment bank has already reiterated that the revolutionary technology will result in enhanced efficiency that could bolster earnings by up to 2% for Chinese equities. The firm also predicts brighter growth prospects that could lead to a 20% valuation uplift for Chinese firms.\n\nEven as Chinese investors rush into Chinese stocks, US stocks remain king amid the artificial intelligence race. Companies likely to benefit from low-cost AI models, as shown by DeepSeek, have rallied significantly ever since the Chinese startup rattled Wall Street.\n\nAccording to analysts at JPMorgan, artificial intelligence should continue to drive economic and market outcomes in the US. Nevertheless, the analysts insist that stiff competition between China and the US will result in winners and losers. Therefore, analysts are warning that the concentration of the US stock market in mega tech names could pose significant risks to investors in 2025.\n\nNevertheless, AI opportunities are not a monolith, as increased competition and efficiency lead to increased consumption of resources.",

The availability of Oracle's complete cloud application suite\u2014with the full range of services, features, and functionality\u2014in a sovereign environment plays a key role in the vendor's efforts to address this increasingly critical market need in Europe.\"\n\nOracle EU Sovereign Cloud is designed with data residency and security in mind and an architecture that is physically and logically isolated from Oracle\u2019s commercial regions. Customer access to Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud is managed separately from access to Oracle Cloud\u2019s commercial regions.\n\nIn addition, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud consists of two cloud regions to support disaster recovery architectures within the boundaries of the EU. Each region comprises three fault domains to help avoid grouping workloads on the same physical hardware. As a result, any hardware failure or compute hardware maintenance in only one fault domain will not impact instances located in other fault domains.\n\nWith operations, support, and policies that are separate from Oracle\u2019s commercial cloud, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud helps streamline and simplify customer compliance with their EU data privacy and sovereignty requirements. In addition, by ensuring that customer data is located within the EU without requiring additional customer configuration via complex policy tools, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud helps accelerate customer deployments.\n\nAdditional Resources",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best Energy Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.76%\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a Texas-based software company. It delivered strong financial results in fiscal Q2 2025, reporting $14.06 billion in revenue, a 9% increase from the previous year. Cloud services, encompassing both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), generated $5.9 billion, reflecting a 24% rise in both USD and constant currency. Notably, cloud infrastructure revenue (IaaS) surged 52% to $2.4 billion. With this momentum, Oracle\u2019s cloud revenue is on track to exceed $25 billion for the fiscal year.\n\nParnassus Investments made the following comment about ORCL in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company\u2019s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.\u201d\n\nIn the past 12 months, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has outperformed the market, surging by nearly 50%. The company is widely recognized for its advanced data center infrastructure, which plays a critical role in AI development. Demand for its services currently outpaces supply, as the company remains a key partner for top AI firms, including OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. Despite its efficient operations, Oracle is still working to keep up with growing demand, with 162 data centers either active or under construction as of fiscal Q1 2025. To bridge this gap, the company has ambitious expansion plans, aiming to scale its data center network to between 1,000 and 2,000 in the future.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is also gaining traction among investors because of its strong dividend history. The company has paid regular dividends to shareholders since 2009 and has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of nearly 11% in the past five years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.92%, as of February 8.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2024, 91 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared with 93 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $7 billion.\n\nOverall ORCL ranks 12th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, the company is headquartered in Austin, Texas and has a presence in over 175 countries. Oracle's primary focus is on providing cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to its customers, helping them to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nThe current management team at Oracle is led by Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz, who has been with the company since 1999 and served in several senior leadership positions before assuming her current role. Other key management team members include Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, who co-founded the company, and Executive Vice President of Product Development, Steve Miranda.\n\nOracle has reported slight growth in recent years, with its revenue around $40 billion in the last several years. Its net income has also been relatively stable over the past several years. The company's debt levels have remained relatively unchanged over the past few years. Oracle's current valuation metrics show that it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio below the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the technology industry.\n\n\n\nRegarding market performance, Oracle's stock has shown some volatility in recent years but has performed well. Its stock price has increased from around $44 in 2017 to $102 in 2022, although it has experienced some dips and spikes during that time. The company has also seen an increase in trading volume in recent years, indicating that it is attracting more investor interest.\n\nOracle operates in the highly competitive technology industry, competing with other software giants like Microsoft and Salesforce. The industry is constantly evolving, with new trends and innovations emerging regularly. One direction that has gained prominence in recent years is adopting cloud-based solutions, which have been a key focus for Oracle. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political pressures, which can impact the operations of companies operating in the space.\n\nOracle has identified several growth opportunities, including developing new products and services, expanding into new markets, and making strategic acquisitions. The company has recently announced plans to expand its cloud infrastructure footprint by adding new data centers in several countries. Additionally, Oracle has made several acquisitions in recent years, including its acquisition of NetSuite in 2016 and TikTok's US operations in 2020.\n\nLike any company, Oracle faces risks and challenges that could impact its future growth and profitability.

            "content": "Stock splits have gained in popularity in recent years as the pace of the market's growth has risen, with many companies going this route in order to get per-share prices back to levels retail investors are comfortable with. Such a move doesn't alter a company's fundamentals. It simply reduces the price of each share while increasing the number of outstanding shares proportionally.\n\nEven though a forward stock split is simply a cosmetic move, some companies believe that doing so could make their shares accessible to a bigger pool of investors, potentially raising demand which leads to an increase in the stock price. Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) is a company that has frequently taken this route over the course of its history as a publicly traded company.\n\nSince going public in March 1987, it has undertaken a total of 10 stock splits with its last split occuring in October 2000. Share prices have jumped 373% since that split. Does this mean the time is ripe for Oracle to do another split? Let's find out.\n\nIt has been a long time since the last split, but another can't be ruled out\n\nGiven that Oracle last split its stock more than 24 years ago, investors may be wondering if it would go down this route once again. After all, many brokerages allow investors to buy fractional shares, greatly reducing the need for a split. Moreover, the stock's price of around $169 isn't very high. Other names in the technology sector have gone for stock splits at much higher prices. Oracle, however, has a history of executing splits with its stock price in double digits. Its last split happened when it was trading at $63 a share in October 2000.\n\nThe stock has underperformed the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index in the past decade. That could give management another reason to go for a split based on the belief that this move could increase the demand for its shares. But what's worth noting here is that Oracle's improving growth prospects due to artificial intelligence (AI) raising demand for its cloud infrastructure, along with its valuation, make the stock worth buying irrespective of a stock split.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Oracle's prospects and check why the stock is capable of outperforming the broader market in the long run.\n\nArtificial intelligence has opened up a terrific growth opportunity\n\nOracle made its name by providing database software, but it now has a new growth catalyst in the form of AI. Companies have been rushing to rent cloud infrastructure from Oracle so that they can train and deploy AI models. This explains why Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Nov. 30, 2024) shot up 52% year over year.\n\nManagement says it saw \"record-level AI demand\" that was much higher than what other hyperscale cloud infrastructure providers reported during the quarter. Chairman Larry Ellison believes that the company's ability to provide faster computing at lower costs as compared to other cloud computing companies is the reason for its growth.\n\nIncluding its cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, the company ended the quarter with a 24% jump in cloud revenue to $5.9 billion. It expects to end the year with $25 billion in total cloud revenue, including both infrastructure and software. And it's just scratching the surface of a huge end-market opportunity in this niche.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates the cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market will generate $580 billion in revenue in 2030. Cloud SaaS is expected to hit $780 billion in revenue by the end of the decade.\n\nOracle, therefore, has massive room for growth in its cloud revenue over the next five years. More importantly, it seems to be on its way to making the most of this opportunity.\n\nThat's evident from the terrific growth in the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO), a metric that refers to the total value of Oracle's contracts that will be fulfilled in the future. It reported a 50% year-over-year jump in this metric in the previous quarter to $97 billion, which was much faster than the 9% growth in its overall revenue.\n\nThe faster growth of the RPO means that Oracle is signing more contracts than it is fulfilling right now, and that's likely to translate into stronger growth. This explains why the company expects its top line to grow by 12% in the next fiscal year following a 10% increase in the current one. Even better, management expects its top line to hit $104 billion in fiscal 2029, which would be nearly double fiscal 2024 levels.\n\nMeanwhile, it expects earnings to rise in excess of 20% through fiscal 2029. Using the fiscal 2024 earnings of $5.56 per share as the base, its bottom line could hit $13.83 per share after five years assuming an annual growth rate of 20%. Multiplying the projected earnings after five years with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) points toward a stock price of $373.\n\nThat would be more than double the current stock price. Given that Oracle is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 24 right now, investors are getting a good deal on this AI stock that they may not want to miss.",

Founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates, the company is headquartered in Austin, Texas and has a presence in over 175 countries. Oracle's primary focus is on providing cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to its customers, helping them to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nThe current management team at Oracle is led by Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz, who has been with the company since 1999 and served in several senior leadership positions before assuming her current role. Other key management team members include Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, who co-founded the company, and Executive Vice President of Product Development, Steve Miranda.\n\nOracle has reported slight growth in recent years, with its revenue around $40 billion in the last several years. Its net income has also been relatively stable over the past several years. The company's debt levels have remained relatively unchanged over the past few years. Oracle's current valuation metrics show that it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio below the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the technology industry.\n\n\n\nRegarding market performance, Oracle's stock has shown some volatility in recent years but has performed well. Its stock price has increased from around $44 in 2017 to $102 in 2022, although it has experienced some dips and spikes during that time. The company has also seen an increase in trading volume in recent years, indicating that it is attracting more investor interest.\n\nOracle operates in the highly competitive technology industry, competing with other software giants like Microsoft and Salesforce. The industry is constantly evolving, with new trends and innovations emerging regularly. One direction that has gained prominence in recent years is adopting cloud-based solutions, which have been a key focus for Oracle. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political pressures, which can impact the operations of companies operating in the space.\n\nOracle has identified several growth opportunities, including developing new products and services, expanding into new markets, and making strategic acquisitions. The company has recently announced plans to expand its cloud infrastructure footprint by adding new data centers in several countries. Additionally, Oracle has made several acquisitions in recent years, including its acquisition of NetSuite in 2016 and TikTok's US operations in 2020.\n\nLike any company, Oracle faces risks and challenges that could impact its future growth and profitability. One significant risk is the changing preferences of consumers and businesses, which could affect the demand for its products and services. Additionally, increased regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures could impact the company's operations.",

            "content": "Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts\u2014they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.\n\nA report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years\u2014such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative\u2014they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nDividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market\u2019s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.\n\nDividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market\u2019s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn\u2019t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index\u2019s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.\n\nWithin the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nOracle (ORCL): AI-Infused HR Solutions Shaping the Future of Work\n\nA team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\n5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.76%\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a Texas-based software company. It delivered strong financial results in fiscal Q2 2025, reporting $14.06 billion in revenue, a 9% increase from the previous year. Cloud services, encompassing both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), generated $5.9 billion, reflecting a 24% rise in both USD and constant currency. Notably, cloud infrastructure revenue (IaaS) surged 52% to $2.4 billion. With this momentum, Oracle\u2019s cloud revenue is on track to exceed $25 billion for the fiscal year.\n\nParnassus Investments made the following comment about ORCL in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company\u2019s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.\u201d\n\nIn the past 12 months, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has outperformed the market, surging by nearly 50%. The company is widely recognized for its advanced data center infrastructure, which plays a critical role in AI development. Demand for its services currently outpaces supply, as the company remains a key partner for top AI firms, including OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. Despite its efficient operations, Oracle is still working to keep up with growing demand, with 162 data centers either active or under construction as of fiscal Q1 2025. To bridge this gap, the company has ambitious expansion plans, aiming to scale its data center network to between 1,000 and 2,000 in the future.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is also gaining traction among investors because of its strong dividend history. The company has paid regular dividends to shareholders since 2009 and has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of nearly 11% in the past five years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.92%, as of February 8.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2024, 91 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), compared with 93 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $7 billion.\n\nOverall ORCL ranks 12th on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

A complimentary excerpt is available here.\n\nThe IDC MarketScape report evaluated 13 public cloud Infrastructure as a Service providers, evaluating each provider based on criteria such as their ability to deliver services at scale, the range of functionality offered, and innovation.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cOCI\u2019s global reach is supported by high-speed interconnects, including partnerships with Microsoft Azure in 12 regions and Google Cloud in 11 regions. These interconnections enable joint customers to leverage OCI alongside Azure or Google Cloud with low latency and no data transfer fees, facilitating seamless multicloud architectures. Oracle\u2019s multicloud strategy and offerings extends directly into the other major hyperscalers with its Oracle Database@Azure, Oracle Database@Google Cloud, and Oracle Database@AWS services. Customers can run Exadata Database Service, as well as Autonomous Database, directly in the datacenters of the major hyperscalers, with the flexibility and choice of where their applications run or which cloud services they want to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cOracle\u2019s cloud strategy is aligned with IDC\u2019s view into what customers want from their strategic providers,\u201d said Dave McCarthy, research vice president, IDC. \u201cFlexible compute shapes and consistent deployment options that deliver cloud computing wherever organizations require it comes up as a persistent theme in our research and surveys.

With increasing numbers of regions interconnected with Azure and Google Cloud already, Oracle has strengthened its ability to cater to customers looking for a hybrid or multicloud approach. IDC believes the deep investments Oracle has made in OCI as well as enticements around pricing and fees have paid off.\u201d\n\n\u201cOracle\u2019s heritage in enterprise software and databases provides a foundation of trust among long-standing clients, particularly those in regulated sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and government,\u201d the report added. \u201cOCI Dedicated Region further strengthens Oracle\u2019s appeal to these industries by delivering the full range of Oracle Cloud services on premises, with compliance and latency requirements in mind.\u201d\n\nThe report noted, \u201cOCI\u2019s compute portfolio remains varied, offering Intel, AMD, and Arm-based options with recent updates to support expanded GPU and AI/ML-focused instance types, such as NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, to support AI model training.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe Oracle\u2019s position as a Leader in the IDC MarketScape reflects the global demand we\u2019re seeing for our AI and cloud services,\u201d said Karan Batta, senior vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cWith consistent global pricing and a distributed cloud model, customers can optimize their cloud strategy wherever they operate however they want. Our fully integrated AI capabilities combined with the industry\u2019s most powerful AI infrastructure help customers innovate faster and drive more meaningful outcomes.\u201d\n\nAdditional Resources",

(Or fifth, depending on what else is going on that day.)\n\nSo, McCoven, my question for you today is about food.

But it was delicious.\n\nNowadays, getting to a game in-person is a lot more rare. I also have adult money now, so I like to splurge a little and get the Krazy Krab sandwich. And then complain about the price the whole time, as you do. And of course, when those temperatures start to drop to freezing in the middle of a summer night, I have to get a Ghirardelli hot chocolate to maintain the feeling in my fingers so they don\u2019t shatter if I happen to catch a fly ball.\n\nWhat is your favorite food to get at Oracle Park?",

            "content": "Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) is one of the most influential technology companies in enterprise software, specializing in database management, cloud computing, and enterprise solutions. As one of the early pioneers in relational database software, Oracle has transformed over the years into a cloud-driven powerhouse, competing with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.\n\nThis analysis explores Oracle\u2019s transition from traditional on-premise software to cloud-based solutions, its strategic innovations, financial growth, and the key factors investors and industry professionals need to know.\n\n1. The Evolution of Oracle: From Database Giant to Cloud Competitor\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 and became the dominant player in relational database software, a foundational technology for managing and analyzing structured data. However, as cloud computing began disrupting traditional enterprise IT infrastructure, Oracle faced significant challenges.\n\nFor decades, Oracle\u2019s core business model revolved around on-premise database licenses, where enterprises would purchase Oracle software, install it on their own servers, and pay annual maintenance fees. This model was highly profitable but increasingly outdated as businesses shifted to cloud-based solutions, which offer greater scalability, lower costs, and enhanced flexibility.\n\nRecognizing the shift, Oracle began transitioning to cloud computing in the mid-2010s, though it lagged behind early cloud adopters like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Under the leadership of CEO Safra Catz and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison, Oracle aggressively pivoted toward cloud services, focusing on two main areas:\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) \u2013 A direct competitor to AWS and Azure, providing enterprise cloud computing solutions, including compute, storage, and networking services.\n\nCloud-based applications (SaaS and PaaS) \u2013 Offering cloud-hosted versions of its enterprise software, such as Oracle ERP Cloud, Oracle HCM Cloud, and Oracle Fusion Applications.\n\nToday, Oracle is firmly entrenched in the cloud industry, with substantial revenue growth coming from cloud-related services.\n\n2. Cloud Growth: How Oracle Is Gaining Market Share\n\nOracle\u2019s cloud business has seen impressive growth in recent years, particularly in its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) division. Unlike its early attempts at cloud computing, which were criticized for being late and lacking features, Oracle has now built a competitive cloud platform.\n\nKey Drivers of Oracle\u2019s Cloud Growth:\n\nStrategic Partnerships \u2013 Oracle has partnered with Microsoft to integrate Oracle Cloud with Azure, allowing customers to run workloads across both platforms seamlessly. This \"multi-cloud\" approach differentiates Oracle from AWS, which tends to be a more closed ecosystem. Autonomous Database \u2013 Oracle\u2019s Autonomous Database uses AI and machine learning to automate routine database management tasks, improving efficiency and security while reducing costs. Enterprise-Focused Cloud Solutions \u2013 Unlike AWS, which serves a broad range of customers, Oracle primarily targets large enterprises that already rely on Oracle databases and applications. Government and Defense Contracts \u2013 Oracle has won key contracts, including U.S. government and Department of Defense (DoD) cloud initiatives, increasing its credibility in highly regulated industries. Aggressive Mergers & Acquisitions \u2013 The $28 billion acquisition of Cerner, a healthcare IT company, positions Oracle strongly in the healthcare cloud market.\n\nWhile Oracle still trails AWS and Microsoft in overall cloud market share, it has gained traction in the enterprise cloud space, where many large corporations prefer Oracle\u2019s integrated approach.\n\n3. Financial Performance and Revenue Breakdown\n\nOracle\u2019s financials reflect its successful transition toward a cloud-driven model.\n\nRecent Financial Highlights (as of FY 2023-2024):\n\nTotal Revenue : Over $50 billion , with cloud services now contributing a significant share.\n\nCloud Infrastructure (OCI) Growth : Annualized growth in OCI revenues exceeding 30% , outpacing Oracle\u2019s legacy database revenue.\n\nOperating Margin : Oracle maintains strong profit margins due to high-value enterprise contracts.\n\nRecurring Revenue Model: The shift from one-time software licenses to recurring cloud subscriptions has improved revenue stability.\n\nA key takeaway from Oracle\u2019s financial transformation is its ability to leverage its existing customer base\u2014many companies already using Oracle databases are migrating to Oracle Cloud rather than switching to AWS or Azure.\n\n4. Innovation and Technology: What Sets Oracle Apart?\n\nDespite its reputation as a legacy enterprise software company, Oracle continues to innovate in multiple areas:\n\nA. AI and Machine Learning in Database Technology\n\nOracle\u2019s Autonomous Database is one of its biggest technological breakthroughs. Unlike traditional databases, which require manual tuning and maintenance, the Autonomous Database self-manages, self-tunes, and self-secures itself using artificial intelligence.\n\nB. Multi-Cloud Strategy\n\nBy integrating with Microsoft Azure, Oracle has positioned itself as a multi-cloud provider. This appeals to enterprises that want to avoid vendor lock-in and use the best features of both Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nC. High-Performance Cloud Infrastructure\n\nOracle\u2019s OCI is optimized for enterprise workloads, including high-speed transaction processing, AI/ML applications, and high-performance computing (HPC). This allows Oracle to differentiate itself from AWS and Google Cloud, which primarily serve startups and developers.\n\nD. Expansion into Healthcare and Government Cloud\n\nThe Cerner acquisition has opened new opportunities for Oracle in healthcare data management and cloud-based electronic health records (EHRs). Oracle also continues to secure contracts with government agencies, further diversifying its cloud business.\n\n5. Competitive Landscape: How Does Oracle Compare to AWS, Microsoft, and Google?\n\nWhile Oracle Cloud has grown significantly, it still faces stiff competition:\n\nOracle\u2019s strategy is not to compete directly with AWS or Microsoft but to focus on serving enterprise customers that already use Oracle products.\n\n6. Challenges and Risks for Oracle\n\nDespite its strong growth in cloud, Oracle faces several challenges:\n\nLate Start in Cloud \u2013 Oracle was late to the cloud market, which allowed AWS and Microsoft to dominate. Closing the gap remains difficult. Customer Migration Hesitancy \u2013 Many Oracle customers still rely on on-premise database solutions, and convincing them to move to the cloud is a gradual process. Regulatory and Legal Risks \u2013 Oracle has faced antitrust scrutiny and lawsuits related to its business practices. Dependence on Enterprise Clients \u2013 Unlike AWS and Google Cloud, which serve businesses of all sizes, Oracle is heavily reliant on large enterprises, making it vulnerable to economic downturns.\n\n7. The Future of Oracle: What to Expect in the Next 5 Years\n\nOracle\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to sustain cloud growth while continuing to innovate. Key areas to watch:\n\nFurther expansion of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\n\nGrowth in AI-driven database technology\n\nMore acquisitions to strengthen industry-specific cloud offerings\n\nContinued government and healthcare cloud contracts\n\nExpansion of its multi-cloud partnerships with Microsoft and others\n\nFinal Thoughts: Should You Invest in Oracle?\n\nOracle has successfully transformed itself into a major cloud player, albeit behind AWS and Microsoft. Its strong enterprise relationships, high-margin cloud business, and AI-powered database innovation give it an edge in certain markets.\n\nFor investors, Oracle represents a stable, profitable tech giant with strong cloud momentum. It\u2019s not a high-growth stock like AWS or Google, but it offers solid long-term potential, especially for those seeking exposure to enterprise cloud computing.\n\nFor businesses, Oracle remains the go-to solution for mission-critical database management and enterprise software, with a growing cloud ecosystem to support modern IT needs.\n\nWhile challenges remain, Oracle\u2019s cloud transformation is far from over\u2014and the next phase of growth could be even more significant.",

A complimentary excerpt is available here.\n\nThe IDC MarketScape report evaluated 13 public cloud Infrastructure as a Service providers, evaluating each provider based on criteria such as their ability to deliver services at scale, the range of functionality offered, and innovation.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cOCI\u2019s global reach is supported by high-speed interconnects, including partnerships with Microsoft Azure in 12 regions and Google Cloud in 11 regions. These interconnections enable joint customers to leverage OCI alongside Azure or Google Cloud with low latency and no data transfer fees, facilitating seamless multicloud architectures. Oracle\u2019s multicloud strategy and offerings extends directly into the other major hyperscalers with its Oracle Database@Azure, Oracle Database@Google Cloud, and Oracle Database@AWS services. Customers can run Exadata Database Service, as well as Autonomous Database, directly in the datacenters of the major hyperscalers, with the flexibility and choice of where their applications run or which cloud services they want to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cOracle\u2019s cloud strategy is aligned with IDC\u2019s view into what customers want from their strategic providers,\u201d said Dave McCarthy, research vice president, IDC. \u201cFlexible compute shapes and consistent deployment options that deliver cloud computing wherever organizations require it comes up as a persistent theme in our research and surveys. With OCI, Oracle continues to make significant investments in AI infrastructure\u2014such as with OCI Supercluster, which is available with up to 131,072 NVIDIA GPUs\u2014and multicloud solutions that create a differentiated cloud experience.\u201d\n\nThe report noted, \u201cThe partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are a strong differentiator, allowing Oracle to address multicloud needs effectively. With increasing numbers of regions interconnected with Azure and Google Cloud already, Oracle has strengthened its ability to cater to customers looking for a hybrid or multicloud approach. IDC believes the deep investments Oracle has made in OCI as well as enticements around pricing and fees have paid off.\u201d\n\n\u201cOracle\u2019s heritage in enterprise software and databases provides a foundation of trust among long-standing clients, particularly those in regulated sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and government,\u201d the report added. \u201cOCI Dedicated Region further strengthens Oracle\u2019s appeal to these industries by delivering the full range of Oracle Cloud services on premises, with compliance and latency requirements in mind.\u201d\n\nThe report noted, \u201cOCI\u2019s compute portfolio remains varied, offering Intel, AMD, and Arm-based options with recent updates to support expanded GPU and AI/ML-focused instance types, such as NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, to support AI model training.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe Oracle\u2019s position as a Leader in the IDC MarketScape reflects the global demand we\u2019re seeing for our AI and cloud services,\u201d said Karan Batta, senior vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. \u201cWith consistent global pricing and a distributed cloud model, customers can optimize their cloud strategy wherever they operate however they want. Our fully integrated AI capabilities combined with the industry\u2019s most powerful AI infrastructure help customers innovate faster and drive more meaningful outcomes.\u201d\n\nAdditional Resources",

These payments come under the original $9.99 billion deal, launched in 2018.\n\nThe deals mean Oracle Cerner will also be used to support medical facilities already using the software in Spokane and Walla Walla, Washington; Columbus, Ohio; Roseburg and White City, Oregon; and North Chicago, Illinois.\n\nOracle acquired Cerner \u2013 a specialist developer of electronic health records systems used throughout the world \u2013 for $28.3 billion in June 2022. With the acquisition, Oracle inherited the ten-year deal to design an EHR system for VA hospitals and communicate with a system that Cerner was installing for the US Department of Defense, replacing legacy systems, some of which were 40 years old.\n\nThe implementation at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane went live in 2020 but Veterans Health Administration patient safety experts found 60 concerns with the new software, according to a US Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs hearing in 2022.\n\nDuring the same hearing, Mike Sicilia, executive vice president at Oracle, said Cerner and the VA had implemented system changes to reduce the number of errors. He promised to \"fix it first and work out the economics later.\"\n\nIn October 2022, the VA said it would delay pending deployments of the Oracle Cerner EHR system until June 2023 because of ongoing problems. In April 2023, it suspended the project indefinitely.\n\nAt the time, former VA secretary Denis McDonough said: \"We're holding Oracle Cerner and ourselves accountable to get this right. This reset period will allow us to focus on fixing what's wrong.\"\n\nIn December 2024, the VA announced it would restart the project with the implementation of new software at its medical centers in Michigan.\n\nWhile the VA and Oracle say they have made progress addressing the EHR system's flaws, they both acknowledge that some still have not fixed, including the pharmacy module and referral routing. They claim they can continue to improve the system while preparing for go-lives.\n\nOracle and the VA have been asked to comment.\n\nThe House of Representatives Committee on Veterans Affairs is set to assess what improvements have been made, and whether the system can be deployed in Michigan in 2026 without negatively impacting the delivery of care to veterans and productivity for VA employees.\n\nEarlier this month, VA secretary Doug Collins said he would consider restarting the EHR system project sooner than planned. \"I believe that we can do it and do it properly, not rushed. There's enough information there that I believe we can actually get it done quicker, but it's going to take looking at.\" \u00ae",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, offered his thoughts on the market\u2019s response to President Trump\u2019s tariffs news. He recalled how, during the presidential campaign, Trump had promised to impose tariffs on several countries, including China. Cramer expressed his surprise that people seemed to have convinced themselves otherwise, considering the president\u2019s long-standing position on the matter.\n\nCramer highlighted one aspect of the tariffs that took him by surprise in a more positive light. He had expected that China would bear the brunt of the tariffs, with Canada receiving the lowest impact due to its strong relationship with the U.S. However, the 25% duty on Canadian goods struck Cramer as unexpected, especially given that there was not a significant issue like fentanyl or migration at the Canadian border.\n\n\u201cIt seemed relatively innocent as far as trade policy goes, but President Trump said over and over again that Canada was taking advantage of us. So they got hit.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer On 9 Stocks That Are Rallying Despite Tariff Worries and Jim Cramer Recently Talked About These 11 S&P 500 Stocks\n\nCramer then drew attention to Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico. According to Cramer, Sheinbaum had a clear understanding of the situation. She recognized that Trump was going to shift the rules, and she knew he had the upper hand in the negotiation and understood his goals of curbing illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Sheinbaum understood that a trade war with the U.S. would not be in Mexico\u2019s interest, so she was prepared to adapt and engage with Trump accordingly. Cramer added:\n\n\u201cI think the Chinese will see the 10% number go higher if they recalcitrate. To me, this one's obvious. The president told me there could be some good news with China when I interviewed him on the floor of the exchange after the election. I have no idea why he went so easy on the Chinese, but it's possible that he might want to try to extend an olive branch to China, at least to start.\u201d\n\nBy starting with the lower tariff, Cramer noted, Trump left himself significant room to maneuver in the future. If he had begun with a 25% tariff, he would have had less flexibility in dealing with China. Now, with more space to negotiate, Cramer believes China recognizes it is receiving a favorable deal.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on February 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "The resilient cloud underdog still has plenty of irons in the fire.\n\nOracle (ORCL 1.09%), one of the world's largest database software companies, was often considered a slow-growth tech giant. But over the past three years, its stock has more than doubled as it dazzled investors with the robust growth of its cloud business.\n\nCould Oracle's stock head even higher over the next three years? Let's take a fresh look at its business to find out.\n\nWhy did Oracle impress its investors again?\n\nOver the past decade, Oracle transformed many of its on-premise database applications into cloud-based services to keep pace with its rapidly growing cloud competitors. It also expanded its cloud ecosystem with more enterprise resource planning (ERP), healthcare information technology (IT), and infrastructure services.\n\nAs a result, the growth of Oracle's cloud-based services offset the slower growth of its on-site applications, and its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) had compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 3% and 5%, respectively, from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in May 2024). It also bought back more than a third of its shares over the past decade.\n\nWhat happened to Oracle over the past three years?\n\nHere's how Oracle fared over the past three years. Its EPS dipped in fiscal 2022 as it lapped a big one-time tax benefit in fiscal 2021, but its profits soared higher over the following two years. Its revenue growth accelerated significantly in fiscal 2023, but most of that growth can be attributed to its takeover of the healthcare IT giant Cerner.\n\nMetric FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Revenue growth 5% 18% 6% EPS growth (47%) 27% 21%\n\nMost of Oracle's recent growth was driven by its cloud infrastructure platform, which helped companies store their data and manage their AI workloads; its ERP services, which helped companies manage their employees and processes more effectively; and the growing usage of its cloud-based database services. Those businesses continued to expand even as the macroeconomic headwinds drove many companies to rein in their software spending.\n\nIts total cloud services rose 22% in fiscal 2022, 29% in fiscal 2023 (excluding its acquisition of Cerner), and 26% (also excluding Cerner) in fiscal 2024. That robust growth consistently offset the weaker performance of its on-premise software.\n\nWhat will happen to Oracle over the next three years?\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure platform (OCI) is becoming its core growth engine. It's still tiny compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, but it already serves massive customers like Nvidia, Uber Technologies, and ByteDance's TikTok. It's also rolling out more features for hosting and accelerating generative AI workloads.\n\nThe secular growth of the AI market should drive more companies to store their data on its databases. The company's leading position in the database market should continue to support the growth of its AI-focused cloud infrastructure services. It will also likely keep expanding its ecosystem with acquisitions even as it buys back more shares.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect revenue and EPS to have a CAGR of 12% and 20%, respectively. Based on those expectations, the stock might seem pricey at 32 times forward earnings, but its growth potential might justify that higher valuation. If the company matches those expectations, increases its EPS at a CAGR of 20% through fiscal 2029 (ending in May 2029), and keeps trading at 30 times forward earnings, its stock might rise 65% to $280 in calendar 2028.\n\nThat wouldn't be as impressive as Oracle's previous three-year run, but it could be a reliable way to profit from the secular growth of the cloud and AI markets. It should also remain less volatile than other higher-growth tech stocks.",

            "content": "Oracle this week asked the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to partially dismiss a challenge to its JavaScript trademark.\n\nThe move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name.\n\nDeno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community.\n\nThis legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term \"JavaScript\" in a conference title or business venture.\n\n\"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations,\" the website explains. \"These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around \u2013 for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world\u2019s most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name.\"\n\nOracle is not shy about protecting its trademarks, in part because failure to police a mark weakens it under the law. The tech giant for example won a preliminary injunction in 2002 against telecom publication Light Reading to prevent it from offering online newsletters under the titles \"OpticalOracle\" and \"WirelessOracle.\"\n\nLast year, Rust for JavaScript Developers claimed to receive a cease-and-desist letter from an attorney representing Oracle, a claim that was subsequently dropped. And in November, the database biz sued Crypto Oracle LLC for using its trademarked name.\n\nConcern about potential litigation is part of why the official specification for the JavaScript programming language is called ECMA-262.\n\nIn the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of \"JavaScript.\" The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.\n\nOracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term \"in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer\u2019s guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term.\"\n\nThe fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product.\n\n\"Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer,\" the trademark cancellation petition says. \"Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle.\"\n\nOracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO \u2013 a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend.\n\n\"Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material,\" Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented.\n\nBeyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.\n\nOracle waited until the deadline to file this motion, a tactic commonly used to drag out proceedings\n\nAsked to comment, Dahl provided The Register with a copy of a draft blog post, now live here, addressing Oracle's claims that accuses the company of dragging its feet.\n\n\"Oracle is sidestepping whether their use of the Node.js screenshot was wrong, instead arguing that it simply doesn't matter because they also submitted another document,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Oracle waited until the deadline to file this motion, a tactic commonly used to drag out proceedings. By challenging only the fraud claim, they avoid addressing genericness and abandonment\u2014the core issues of the case.\"\n\nDahl says Oracle's attempt to delay the proceedings forces Deno Land to either drop the fraud claim, \"letting them get away with misrepresenting their trademark renewal,\" or \"spend months fighting this procedural issue before even getting to the real debate.\"\n\nHe concludes, \"The truth is simple: Oracle did not create JavaScript. Oracle does not control JavaScript. Oracle should not own the trademark for JavaScript.\" \u00ae",

Modern-Day Oracles or Bullshit Machines?, a humanities course about how to learn, work and thrive in a world increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, was designed for students with and without a technical background.\n\n\u201cOur instructor guide provides a choice of activities for each lesson that will easily fill an hour-long class,\u201d Bergstrom, a UW Department of Biology professor, observed in an introductory Bluesky thread co-authored with West, an Information School professor and CIP co-founder.\n\nThe entire course is available freely online, and built around 18 online lessons, each which take 5-10 minutes. Each lesson \u201cilluminates one core principle,\u201d including \u201cAutocomplete in Overdrive\u201d (Lesson 1), \u201cFrom Voice Cloning to Shrimp Jesus\u201d (Lesson 7) and \u201cYour Own Private Truman Show\u201d (Lesson 17), hitting on themes of misinformation, creativity, and authenticity.\n\nBergstrom and West have published accompanying videos for the first two course lessons and additional videos will be made available on a rolling basis on the course website throughout the next few months.\n\nThe professors and long-time UW collaborators worked on the new course over eight months and developed lessons and resources from a cautious viewpoint to better understand the risks and rewards of a rapidly evolving technology.\n\n\u201cLarge language models are both powerful tools, and mindless \u2014 even dangerous \u2014 bullshit machines. We want students to explore how to resolve this dialectic,\u201d Bergstrom and West wrote. \u201cWe marvel at what LLMs can do and how amazing they can seem at times \u2014 but we also recognize the huge potential for abuse, we chafe at the excessive hype around their capabilities, and we worry about how they will change society.\u201d\n\nBergstrom and West noted that they didn\u2019t want to lecture \u201cat\u201d students about the risks of generative AI and the large language models they\u2019re built on. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that works,\u201d they wrote. \u201cStudents use LLMs already; we want them to discover the problems for themselves.\u201d\n\nModern-Day Oracles or Bullshit Machines? is a follow-up to Calling Bullshit: Data Reasoning in a Digital World, a course Bergstrom and West first co-developed in 2017 at the University of Washington. The data reasoning course became one of the most popular at UW and has served as a model for similar classes at hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States and around the world. The course also led to a book, \u201cCalling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data Driven World,\u201d co-authored by Bergstrom and West and published by Penguin Random House in 2020.\n\nBergstrom and West hope the new course will be just as far reaching but note that the lessons and resources are still a work in progress, so they\u2019ll be \u201cadjusting and adapting and revising in the months to come\u201d based on user feedback.\n\nLearn more about Modern-Day Oracles or Bullshit Machines?\n\nMichael Grass is the Center for an Informed Public\u2019s assistant director for communications.",

In addition, embedded AI now acts as an advisor to help analyze supply chain data, generate content, and augment or automate processes to help improve business operations and create a resilient supply network to outpace change, Oracle says.\n\nThe new tech comes in the form of role-based AI agents within Oracle Cloud SCM that are designed to automate routine tasks, deliver personalized insights and recommendations, and allow organizations to focus more time on strategic supply chain initiatives. While past versions of Oracle software already included AI assistants\u2014that could formulate descriptions or write emails\u2014the new AI agents can help users by answering natural language queries about complex rules such as a policy document on returns or claims.\n\n\u201cOne of our goals is to not have AI be an esoteric thing that you need special training to use, but just to act as part of the tool, to help you accomplish each task according to the standards of your own particular company,\u201d Srini Rajagopal, Oracle\u2019s vice president of logistics product strategy, said in a briefing.\n\n\n\nFor example, once a company\u2019s IT office has uploaded the firm\u2019s unique policy documents\u2014on issues such as packaging, deadlines, or transaction requirements\u2014then all the company\u2019s customer service representatives (CSRs) can use the new AI-based advisory agents to type natural-language queries into a text-based chat box to obtain quick answers to complicated questions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to providing quick business answers to current employees, that approach can also help to train new workers on company policies in a labor market with high turnover rates. Additional use cases could apply to workers in roles such as a shop floor operator or warehouse worker, Rajagopal said.\n\n\n\nIn another application of the new AI, the updates have added new capabilities to Oracle Transportation Management, Oracle Global Trade Management, and Oracle Order Management.\n\n\n\nApplied to the transportation management system (TMS) product, the AI enables \u201cbetter, faster, smarter\u201d operations through new capabilities such as AI-powered order route predictions, transit time predictions, and a transportation emissions calculator. In the global trade management (GTM) took, the new AI supports a user-configurable platform that can provide trade incentive program processing relief and reporting. And in the order management software, the AI can provide a returns summary, pricing promotions summary, item availability check, and order fulfillment view.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo successfully navigate an increasingly complex global landscape, supply chain leaders need agile and efficient processes that can help them diversify and strengthen supplier networks, adapt transportation and logistics strategies, and stay ahead of regulatory changes,\u201d Rajagopal said in a release.\n\n",

            "content": "BOSTON \u2014 For three days in mid-October thousands of police leaders gathered at the annual International Association of Chiefs of Police conference to learn from subject matter experts, network with colleagues from around the world and research thousands of product solutions on display. Police1 spoke with Shane Ruiz, head of product marketing for Oracle Local Government, at the Oracle booth, where a Tesla Cybertruck was showcased as an advanced integrated patrol vehicle platform aimed at transforming incident management and improving situational awareness for law enforcement agencies. Oracle will prominently feature the technologies at the Mobile World Congress scheduled for March 2025.\n\n| RELATED: Starlink to provide reliable high-speed connectivity to the Oracle Enterprise Communications Platform\n\nWhy it matters: A unified command platform\n\nAt the IACP conference, Oracle showcased its integrated technology platform (Oracle Public Safety Suite) using a Tesla Cybertruck outfitted with state-of-the-art features. The standout capability of the Cybertruck? It harnesses the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) interfaces and cameras, transforming stock components into mission-critical tools for law enforcement. This reduces the need for additional cameras \u2014 cabin cameras become prisoner cameras, and OEM exterior cameras integrate seamlessly with Oracle\u2019s incident command software.\n\nHowever, the software is vehicle-agnostic, working equally well with Ford, Dodge, or Chevy patrol vehicles.\n\nOracle\u2019s software provides a real-time command and control dashboard. Photo/Oracle\n\nKey features: A deep dive\n\nIncident command and CAD integration\n\nOracle\u2019s software provides a real-time command and control dashboard, enabling agencies to:\n\n\n\nTrack officer locations and resources in real-time.\n\nAssign units, including drones, to specific incidents directly from the vehicle interface.\n\nStream live video from vehicle cameras, drones and body-worn devices to command centers.\n\n\u201cWhat this allows us to do is see all the locations of incidents happening around the community and which officers have responded to those,\u201d explained Ruiz. \u201cIf we need to deploy a drone or alert another officer, we can do it directly through the interface, making response times faster and more efficient.\u201d\n\nDrone deployment\n\nEquipped with a rear-mounted drone system, the platform allows officers to deploy drones for search, rescue, or surveillance with minimal setup time.\n\n\u201cMost departments take minutes to deploy a drone \u2014 they have to take it out of a case, unfold it, and turn it on,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201cWith our system, the drone is ready to go, fully charged, and can be launched in seconds.\u201d\n\nReliable connectivity\n\n\n\nStarlink Satellite integration: Offers uninterrupted connectivity, even in remote areas.\n\nDual SIM Cradlepoint system: Offers 5G fallback with FirstNet or Verizon, maintaining constant communication even in tunnels or parking structures.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of our system is that if we lose satellite connectivity in a tunnel or parking structure, the vehicle automatically switches to 5G,\u201d noted Ruiz. \u201cThis ensures officers are always connected, no matter where they are.\u201d\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nTo counteract the high energy demands of electric vehicles, Oracle added auxiliary lithium-ion batteries dedicated to powering lights, drones, and onboard electronics without depleting the vehicle\u2019s primary battery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve added two lithium-ion batteries up front that power all the electronic components,\u201d explained Ruiz. \u201cThis helps ensure that the mileage of the vehicle isn\u2019t impacted, even during static operations.\u201d\n\nAdaptability across use cases\n\nThe system is designed for diverse law enforcement needs, including:\n\n\n\nPatrol operations.\n\nSWAT and tactical response, featuring ballistic doors and tactical grab points.\n\nEMS scenarios, with integrated stretchers and medical kits for mass casualty incidents.\n\nThe future of command and control\n\nOracle\u2019s patrol vehicle system offers a glimpse into the future of law enforcement technology. From seamless communication to autonomous drone capabilities, the solution provides agencies with tools to help enhance officer safety, improve response times, and deliver better outcomes for their communities.\n\nWhile the Cybertruck serves as a showcase vehicle, Oracle\u2019s software is designed to integrate with any fleet, making this innovation accessible to agencies of all sizes.\n\n\u201cThe Cybertruck is a great marketing piece, but this technology works just as well in a Ford, Dodge, or Chevy,\u201d emphasized Ruiz. \u201cWe\u2019re not tied to a specific vehicle \u2014 we\u2019re focused on providing a solution that\u2019s flexible and adaptable for any department.\u201d\n\nA solution-driven approach\n\nOracle\u2019s platform isn\u2019t just about shiny new technology. By combining advanced tools with intuitive design, Oracle empowers officers to focus on their mission while maximizing the effectiveness of their resources.\n\n\u201cThis is about saving lives and improving officer safety,\u201d concluded Ruiz. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the tools officers need to de-escalate situations and respond effectively, with the ultimate goal of protecting our communities.\u201d\n\nWatch the video to explore Oracle\u2019s integrated patrol vehicle and body-worn computing system to see how real-time intelligence and connectivity are transforming public safety.",

            "content": "The CEOs of Oracle and Microsoft last week fully embraced the DeepSeek phenomenon despite the possibility, however remote, that it could seriously threaten the gargantuan-scale infrastructure approach to which both companies, along with Google Cloud and AWS, are massively committed.\n\nI\u2019m purposefully referring to this most-recent EMP moment in the techworld as the \u201cDeepSeek phenomenon\u201d rather than focusing on DeepSeek as a company because, while I\u2019m not sure the company itself will be on anyone\u2019s radar 12 months from now, the repercussions of its release of a model built on a wildly scaled-down approach will trigger waves of new thinking across the Cloud Wars Top 10 companies.\n\nWe all saw the initial indications of this ultra-shiny new object last week in the stock market, when DeepSeek\u2019s debut torpedoed hundreds of billions of value from the market caps of entrenched cloud and AI superstars including NVIDIA and Microsoft. This Reuters headline was typical: \u201cDeepSeek sparks AI stock selloff; Nvidia posts record market-cap loss.\u201c\n\nBut as cooler heads prevailed and rational analysis overtook hyped-up hysteria, we began to see that the DeepSeek phenomenon is two things: simply another new model among what will soon be millions of new models available for everything from broad use to purpose-built deployments; and a high-value wake-up call to the tech industry that while the current approach of spending many tens of billions of dollars each year on cloud and AI infrastructure \u2014 in Microsoft\u2019s case, $80 billion \u2014 the history of the tech business shows that at some point, new and better ideas always \u2014always \u2014 come along to topple what was once believed the ultimate in innovation.\n\nThat sentiment was fully reflected by Oracle CEO Safra Catz during her keynote presentation at an Oracle CloudWorld event in Texas last week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all seeing this DeepSeek situation and some people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s bad!\u2019 But I\u2019m saying, \u2018Fantastic! Competition increasing in large-language models?? Come on in!\u2019,\u201d Catz says at about the 15:00-minute mark on this YouTube video.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be more thrilling because what it means is that potentially \u2014 and who knows what the real story is with DeepSeek, but in a way it doesn\u2019t matter! Because it just turns the competition even faster, even harder, and what it means is that AI is accessible to our customers at lower prices potentially,\u201d Catz said.\n\n\u201cAnd for us, AI is fun, it\u2019s very cool \u2014 a couple of years ago, the baby talked and we\u2019re all asking it things,\u201d she said about the ChatGPT phenomenon that kicked off 27 months ago.\n\n\u201cBut really where it\u2019s important for us is how does it help us run our business?\u201d\n\nAlso last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used his company\u2019s fiscal-Q2 earnings call to note that DeepSeek R1 is now available in Microsoft\u2019s GitHub. Later in the call, he described his view of the relative significance of DeepSeek, stating that after initial gains from Moore\u2019s Law with compute infrastructure and also with what he called \u201cAI scaling laws,\u201d big advances in software optimizations are starting to kick in.\n\n\u201cI think DeepSeek has some real innovations,\u201d Nadella said, adding that Microsoft continues to work \u201csuper hard on all the software optimizations \u2014 not just the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Nadella said, the value of all of that work manifests itself for customers: \u201cThe big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customer.\u201d\n\nIndeed it is \u2014 and that\u2019s the founding view we continue to embrace deeply here at Cloud Wars.\n\n\u2013",

Investigations have traced the oil on canvas that was stored in the halls of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, one of the few buildings that escaped the flames that devastated California in the serious incidents of recent days.\n\nTraces of the rediscovered painting had been lost for several decades, but it was documented in the catalog of property of the Province of Naples compiled in 1912. \u201cThe Oracle of Delphi\u201d had been illegally brought to the United States during the post-World War II period. Later, having entered the American antiquities market circuit in 1972, it had landed in the collections of the Getty Museum in LA. Miola\u2019s painting falls within the aesthetic of European Romanticism of the second half of the 19th century. The subjects favored by the artist, a follower of Morellism\u2013i.e., the art of Domenico Morelli, a Neapolitan painter and politician who lived and worked in the second half of the 19th century-were inspired by anecdotes from ancient history and particularly from Greek and Roman culture.\n\n\u201cThe stolen work of art is like the fugitive,\u201d said Rome Deputy Prosecutor Giovanni Conzo, \u201donly unlike the fugitive, who talks, phones and moves, the work is cold and therefore it is even more difficult to search for it abroad. This operation, carried out with the Carabinieri Heritage Protection Command and the Ministry, has made it possible to recover to our city these important works and return them to the community because the work of art must be enjoyed by the whole community.\u201d\n\nIn the course of this recovery operation, another important work was also found. It is the painting titled \u201cPortrait of Vittorio Emanuele III,\u201d by Achille Talarico, an oil on canvas dated 1902 and commissioned by the Province of Naples and whose traces had been lost for several years. This painting has also been located and seized and may be returned to the community.\n\n\u201cThe return of these two paintings belonging to the Metropolitan City\u2019s collection,\u201d stressed the head of the Department for the Protection of the Cultural Heritage of the Ministry of Culture, Luigi La Rocca, \u201dcomplements the heritage of the institution, which consists of about 400 works, a heritage that we hope can be enhanced and made usable.",

With OCI, Shiseido has been able to reduce its operating costs by approximately 20 percent and optimize its total cost of ownership (TCO) over a five-year period.\n\nFounded in 1872, Shiseido is the eighth largest cosmetics company in the world and offers beauty products in skincare, suncare, and makeup. To help modernize its customer analytics system called B-NASS+, which is used by approximately 5,000 sales and marketing employees globally to collect and analyze data from thousands of point-of-sale systems, Shiseido needed a scalable, highly performant, and stable solution that could support growing data volumes and the diverse analytical demands of its workforce. By moving to OCI, Shiseido was able to improve the processing performance of B-NASS+ and reduce its operational costs. In addition, B-NASS+ can now deliver real-time analytics to its employees, including sales performance and customer insights such as the likelihood of repurchase.\n\n\u201cWith OCI, we built a new system with the performance, scalability, and flexibility to handle our growing data volumes and diverse analytics needs while also enabling us to benefit from generative AI and machine learning capabilities in the future,\u201d said Atsunori Takano, Chief Information Technology Officer, Shiseido, and Co-Representative Director and President, Shiseido Interactive Beauty. \u201cThe transition to Oracle Exadata Database Service and Oracle Analytics Cloud was seamless, and most importantly, it maintained the same user experience for our employees. In addition, we modernized our systems and empowered our teams with real-time data for more informed decision-making.\u201d\n\nShiseido Interactive Beauty Company Limited, the subsidiary responsible for driving Shiseido\u2019s IT and digital transformation, was tasked with rebuilding, operating, and developing the B-NASS+ system. Since migrating to Oracle Exadata Database Service, the off-peak batch processing of B-NASS+ has accelerated by approximately 90 percent, resulting in improved response time. With Oracle Analytics Cloud, Shiseido has developed a new self-service business intelligence environment that enables it to analyze a wide range of data with high flexibility. This has enabled Shiseido to accelerate its data analytics process and empower its teams to make decisions with actionable information.\n\n\u201cThe skincare industry is one of the most competitive sectors globally, driven by the constant influx of new trends, products, changing preferences, and brands,\u201d said Kothanda Umamageswaran, senior vice president, Exadata and Scale-Out Technologies, Oracle. \u201cTo stand out, companies must leverage the latest AI and cloud technology to drive innovative customer-centric experiences. With OCI\u2019s world-class architecture and the Exadata platform running Oracle databases at scale in the cloud, Shiseido was able to migrate mission-critical systems quickly and reliably to the cloud, capturing the cloud\u2019s economic benefits. Shiseido is now well-positioned to enhance its innovation capabilities and continue delivering cutting-edge beauty innovations for the future.\u201d\n\nShiseido received the Data Platform Innovation Award in the infrastructure category at the 2024 Customer Excellence Awards hosted by Oracle Corporation.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other best FAANG+ stocks to invest in right now.\n\nThe group of stocks formerly known as FAANG were synonymous with technological prowess, market dominance, and high growth. These companies provided exponential returns and offered the chance to be part of the technological revolution. Their rise to dominance was fueled by innovation, digital transformation, the increasing use of the internet, and their insatiable hunger for growth. In the process, they reshaped industries, altered consumer behavior, and redefined customer engagement. However, over the past couple of years, the acronym has lost some of its relevance as some names have changed and new companies have encroached on the territories of these mega-caps. As a result, the market has started using the term \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d to better represent the most valuable tech stocks. In this list, we include the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 plus five interesting stocks that focus on the transformational technology growth trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, EV technology, and streaming.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by understanding the sheer magnitude of these stocks. We created an equal-weighted portfolio (equal investment in each stock) of all 12 mega-cap technology stocks in this list and compared their combined performance with the S&P 500 Index over the past 5 years. Astonishingly, the mega-caps portfolio has returned over 385% compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s return of around 86%. Additionally, these 12 stocks now have a combined market cap of over $20.0 trillion, with around $14 trillion added in the past 5 years. In comparison, the total market cap of all US-listed stocks is approximately $60.5 trillion (as of December 2024; source: Wilshire 5000 Index), making these mega-caps account for nearly one-third of the total US market value. Although it\u2019s not entirely fair to compare market caps to GDP, if we could, and if these 12 mega-caps formed a country, they would rival China as the second or third largest country by nominal GDP.\n\nDespite recent intense competition, challenging market dynamics, and a difficult regulatory environment, these tech leaders still stand tall with their legacy of innovation and digital transformation. We believe their substantial investments in technology infrastructure, strategic acquisitions, international expansion, and continuous innovation have helped them maintain their dominance. Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened new avenues for growth among these tech giants. With that, let\u2019s explore these 12 stocks.",

Within this short period of time, the automaker has sold out the entire inventory of the White Interior option in North America.\n\nTesla offered a new Glacier Blue color for the Model Y Juniper when it launched the vehicle in China and Asia Pacific last month. However, looking at the North American Model Y Launch Series configurator, Tesla does not offer the Glacier Blue paint option in the US & Canada.\n\nOnly 4 colors are available to choose from for the 2025 Model Y Launch Series in North America. These include Stealth Grey, Ultra Red, Pearl White Multi-Coat, and Quicksilver.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nTesla Model Y Launch Series (Juniper) online configurator for the United States shows the White Interior as sold out and paint options are limited to 4 without the new Glacier Blue (listed above). Credit: Courtesy of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n\nThe non-availability of the new Glacier Blue color is most probably due to the paint shops not yet equipped with it at the Fremont, California and Giga Texas factories.\n\nIn my ~9 years of reporting on Tesla, I\u2019ve probably seen the interior option being sold out and drained this fast for the first time. It\u2019s just been a week since the Launch Series orders were opened and the \u2018Black and White\u2019 interior inventory has completely drained out.\n\nThe only option available now is the \u2018All Black\u2019 interior. This entirely blacked-out interior theme does not appeal to a majority of Tesla customers. The white seats, door trims, and dashboard comparably look more futuristic and catchy to the eyes.\n\nAlthough the white seats of the \u2018Black and White\u2019 interior of Tesla vehicles tend to get dirty with jeans stains there are ways to clean it off. It\u2019s just a trade-off for the spaceship-like feel that comes with the white interior elements.\n\n\u2018Black and White\u2019 interior of the new 2025 Tesla Model Y Juniper refresh with the new white seats (see Black Interior image for comparison below).

Credit: Courtesy of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n\n\u2013 Sponsored \u2013\n\nThe white interior option of the new Tesla Model Y Launch Series going out of stock is a sign that the automaker received an overwhelming number of orders with this specific trim. Tesla bagged more than 100,000 Model Y Juniper orders in less than 2 weeks in China and APAC last month.\n\nThe North American customer base was also waiting for the new design-refreshed Model Y to place their orders. Although the price of the 2025 Model Y Launch Series is on the higher side, the futuristic looks and dozens of improvements from the previous generation have resulted in its staggering sales.\n\nThe initial batch of the new Model Y is called the Launch Series. For entirely new vehicles introduced, Tesla uses the term Founders Series or Foundation Series.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nStay tuned for constant Tesla updates, follow us on:\n\nGoogle News | Flipboard | X (Twitter) | WhatsApp Channel | RSS (Feedly).\n\nRelated Tesla Model Y News",

            "content": "As the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.90%) (BRK.B 2.05%), Warren Buffett has had a fantastic track record allocating capital. The conglomerate\u2019s stock price has climbed at an impressive 19.8% compound annual rate between 1965 and 2023, substantially outpacing the broader S&P 500.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s no wonder the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s investment decisions are closely monitored by the rest of the market -- and recent moves could signal that it might be time to worry. Does billionaire Warren Buffett know something Wall Street doesn\u2019t?\n\nThere's one possible warning sign you should be paying close attention to right now.\n\nBuilding cash\n\nBesides fully owning businesses, Berkshire also runs a massive public equities portfolio. Investors have noticed increased selling activity here. In the first three quarters of 2024, Berkshire sold $133 billion worth of shares in other companies, most notably Apple and Bank of America. This is much higher than the $6 billion of stock that it purchased.\n\nThe result is a higher cash position. As of Sept. 30 last year, the Buffett-led company had $325 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. That was up considerably from the $168 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nBuffett called out the possibility of a higher capital gains tax rate down the line as a key reason for him wanting to take profits off the table. This logic makes sense. But there could be more to the story.\n\nBuffett's warning\n\nSelling a large chunk of stock and watching the cash pile up to a massive level could present a clear warning that Buffett is seriously worried about the current valuation of the stock market. Given his unbelievable track record, the average investor might want to take notice.\n\nA widely followed valuation tool is the CAPE ratio. It makes an adjustment to the traditional price-to-earnings ratio by taking inflation into account and by using the average of the previous 10 years\u2019 worth of earnings. The goal is to smooth out bottom-line fluctuations.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the CAPE ratio has a high inverse correlation with forward returns. For example, when the CAPE ratio was at 44.2 in November 1999, the S&P 500\u2019s future five-year total annual return was just a negative 10%. And when the CAPE was lower at 13.3 in January 2009, investors benefited from a wonderful 128% forward five-year total return.\n\nAs of this writing, the CAPE ratio is at 37.9. It has rarely been higher. Since the time the CAPE ratio started being measured about 150 years ago, its average is 17.2. The market\u2019s current valuation is a 120% premium to that level. Buffett and Berkshire could be telling everyone that it\u2019s best to adopt a more cautious approach. Maybe there\u2019s a very real possibility of disappointing stock market performance as we look ahead\n\nM2 money supply\n\nThe soaring valuation of the S&P 500 can instill fear among investors. After all, we now have numerous trillion-dollar enterprises, a group that seems to get larger and more valuable every year.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no strict rule that says the CAPE ratio can\u2019t continue going higher, or that its elevated status always leads to poor returns. This becomes clearer when you consider the trend with M2 money supply among the four major economies (U.S., Europe, China, and Japan), which has doubled in the past 14 years.\n\nMore money in the financial system can promote higher asset prices. We've seen this play out right before our eyes since the end of the Great Recession more than a decade ago. Higher real estate values, as well as the creation of the cryptocurrency industry, are two other examples of what greater money supply can lead to.\n\nWhat's more, the rising popularity of passive investing, which now controls more assets under management than active strategies, means investors continue to buy stocks regardless of valuation.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to take clues from Warren Buffett, the greatest investor ever. But at the end of the day, making accurate predictions is difficult, particularly when market and economic dynamics shift. It's still smart to invest early and often, with a long-term mindset.",

Official documents also show few differences, as they address topics such as land purchases or a wife\u2019s possessions in the event of separation.\n\nCarolin Arlt holds a doctorate in Egyptology. After studying Egyptology, Ancient History, and Classical Archaeology at the Julius-Maximilians University of W\u00fcrzburg (JMU), she earned her doctorate at the same institution. She later worked at universities in Cologne, Berkeley, and Jerusalem before returning to JMU in 2009 as a researcher on a project focused on a temple in Egypt\u2019s Fayum region.\n\nShe is now starting a new research project based on another temple in Fayum, a Ptolemaic archive from the temple of Soknopaiu Nesos. Her research will focus on 75 documents from this temple, written on papyrus in Demotic over 2,200 years ago by Tesenuphis, son of Marres, who referred to himself as the \u201cscribe of the priests.\u201d\n\nSoknopaiu Nesos was an Egyptian settlement in the Fayum basin, where a lake fed by a branch of the Nile served as a focal point. Today, the area is about a two-hour drive from Cairo. In its temple, Soknopaios, a crocodile god, was worshiped as the lord of water and a symbol of fertility.\n\nSonokpaiu Nesos temple ruins. Credit: Martin Stadler / Julius-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg\n\nWhat makes this temple special is that its archive has survived. It is one of the few known Egyptian temple archives from this period, says Arlt. She refers to the period between 180 and 120 BCE, within the Ptolemaic era, which lasted from 323 to 30 BCE. During this time, Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemies, a Macedonian dynasty named after Ptolemy, a general of Alexander the Great who became Egypt\u2019s first Ptolemaic monarch.\n\nIt is possible that these texts were part of the private archive of a temple scribe, who may have stored them in a chamber upon his retirement, where they were later forgotten. However, this cannot be determined with certainty. We do not know where the papyri were found. They came from a looting and were purchased in the second half of the 19th century by two British papyrologists, explains Carolin Arlt. As a result, it remains unknown whether the documents were taken from the temple or belonged to the scribe\u2019s house.\n\nAdditionally, the buyers were only interested in the Greek papyri, so they gave the Demotic texts to a colleague in Oxford, who never studied them. These documents are currently stored in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in Oxford, and most of them have yet to be analyzed.\n\nAmong these papyri, there are fragments, but also many complete texts. They mainly consist of administrative documents: letters sent to or written from the temple, questions addressed to the oracle, certificates, accounts, lists, and receipts, explains the Egyptologist.\n\nCarolin Arlt works with texts like this one. In this case, it is an incomplete application for a lease to the temple. Credit: P.Oxf. Griffith C 10\n\nThese texts provide key information about life in the temple over 2,000 years ago, both in terms of religious practices and economic management. We know that the temple had certain monopolies and leased them periodically, says Carolin Arlt. These monopolies included a ferry service across the lake, a laundry, a brewery, and various agricultural lands.\n\nAmong the papyri already studied, Arlt has identified 15 lease offers, in which applicants described their financial proposals to obtain temple concessions. Receipts confirming these payments have also been found. This type of documentation is extremely rare elsewhere, she notes.\n\nCarolin Arlt will be responsible for transliterating these 75 selected texts\u2014that is, transcribing them into a modern system, translating, analyzing, commenting on, and publishing them along with photographs. However, many of these papyri require restoration before they can be studied. After being buried in the sand for 2,000 years and spending over a century between sheets of paper in Oxford, their condition is dire.\n\n\u201cDemotic\u201d is both a linguistic term and a writing system of Ancient Egypt, used from the 7th century BCE to the 3rd century CE. I love deciphering Demotic, confesses Carolin Arlt. However, her work is not simply about reading and translating linearly. Some papyri are only a few centimeters wide, with text extending between 10 and 25 lines, yet it can take between 30 and 60 minutes to decipher a single word. Sometimes, even after all that effort, its meaning remains elusive.\n\nOccasionally, unknown words appear, requiring deductive skills. Fortunately, we have references from Ancient Egyptian and can infer how the word might have sounded in earlier times or how it evolved into Coptic. It is also possible that the word was borrowed from Greek, she explains. Thanks to this process, she often manages to solve the mystery of previously unknown words\u2014though not always successfully.\n\nShare on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Oracle\n\nHow Quickly Is Oracle Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Oracle grew its EPS by 4.4% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Oracle shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 31%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Oracle's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Oracle Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSeeing insiders owning a large portion of the shares on issue is often a good sign. Their incentives will be aligned with the investors and there's less of a probability in a sudden sell-off that would impact the share price. So as you can imagine, the fact that Oracle insiders own a significant number of shares certainly is appealing. Actually, with 41% of the company to their names, insiders are profoundly invested in the business. This should be a welcoming sign for investors because it suggests that the people making the decisions are also impacted by their choices. at the current share price. That level of investment from insiders is nothing to sneeze at.",

Oracle's primary focus is on providing cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to its customers, helping them to streamline their operations and reduce costs.\n\nThe current management team at Oracle is led by Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz, who has been with the company since 1999 and served in several senior leadership positions before assuming her current role. Other key management team members include Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, who co-founded the company, and Executive Vice President of Product Development, Steve Miranda.\n\nOracle has reported slight growth in recent years, with its revenue around $40 billion in the last several years. Its net income has also been relatively stable over the past several years. The company's debt levels have remained relatively unchanged over the past few years. Oracle's current valuation metrics show that it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio below the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the technology industry.\n\n\n\nRegarding market performance, Oracle's stock has shown some volatility in recent years but has performed well. Its stock price has increased from around $44 in 2017 to $102 in 2022, although it has experienced some dips and spikes during that time. The company has also seen an increase in trading volume in recent years, indicating that it is attracting more investor interest.\n\nOracle operates in the highly competitive technology industry, competing with other software giants like Microsoft and Salesforce. The industry is constantly evolving, with new trends and innovations emerging regularly. One direction that has gained prominence in recent years is adopting cloud-based solutions, which have been a key focus for Oracle.

            "content": "President Donald Trump unveiled a $500 billion private-sector AI investment package on his second day in office last week, just as Chinese startup DeepSeek demonstrated it can match U.S. technology at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe \u201cStargate\u201d project, backed by OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son, and Oracle\u2019s ORCL Larry Ellison, aims to build massive data centers in Texas over four years. \u201cThis is money that normally would have gone to China,\u201d Trump said during the announcement.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough threatens to upend the AI landscape. The nascent Chinese company\u2019s latest models match leading U.S. chatbots while using fewer resources, challenging the assumption that AI advances require ever-increasing computing power and investment.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe timing heightens tensions in the U.S.-China tech rivalry. Trump\u2019s administration includes China hawks like AI czar David Sacks and Under Secretary of State nominee Jacob Helberg, who each view the AI race as crucial to national security.\n\nSilicon Valley executives hope Trump will loosen domestic regulations while maintaining pressure on China. The president already scrapped Biden-era requirements for AI companies to share information with the government, promising Stargate partners to make development \u201cas easy as it can be.\u201d\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise suggests U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors haven\u2019t prevented Chinese innovation, according to a report by The Economist. The company\u2019s mobile app topped U.S. iPhone downloads in January, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d\n\nTrending: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year \u2014 Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000\n\n\u201cMore investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,\u201d DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng told Chinese media, noting U.S. chip restrictions remain his main challenge.\n\nThe contrast between Trump\u2019s massive investment push and DeepSeek\u2019s efficient approach highlights diverging strategies in the AI race. While U.S. firms bet on overwhelming resources, Chinese companies focus on maximizing limited computing power.\n\nThe battle extends beyond raw investment numbers. The Biden administration\u2019s \u201cFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion,\u201d now under Trump\u2019s review, aims to tighten controls on GPU exports and AI data sharing. Critics, including semiconductor giant Nvidia NVDA, argue such restrictions could backfire, pushing allies toward Chinese technology.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek\u2019s models remain constrained by Chinese censorship, automatically deflecting queries about sensitive topics like the Tiananmen Square protests or President Xi Jinping. The company also faces infrastructure challenges, experiencing outages as user numbers surge.\n\nRead Next:",

These include Exadata Database Service, Autonomous Database Service, MySQL HeatWave, Zero Data Loss Autonomous Recovery Service, GoldenGate and Data Safe.\n\nThis collaboration began in four Google Cloud regions and has now expanded to eight new regions. In Europe, Oracle Database@Google Cloud is now available in London and Frankfurt. In these regions, data center capacity will also be doubled in the coming months.\n\nMore replication\n\nIn addition to expansion to more Google Cloud regions, the joint Oracle-Google Cloud service now gets support for cross-region disaster recovery, specifically for database replication in the Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless edition.\n\nBoth parties claim this additional support is a major advancement. Currently, replication for disaster recovery is only possible within the Google Cloud region where the service is purchased. Oracle already offers cross-region replication within its own cloud environment, OCI.\n\nWith the cross-region disaster recovery support now announced, joint service customers can set up a replicated standby database in a separate Google Cloud region. This allows them to access their Oracle databases globally through a public endpoint and limit access to approved IP addresses.\n\nThis new functionality is especially suitable for users who want to use Oracle Autonomous Database in conjunction with Google services that require heavy workloads, such as Google Vertex AI and Google BigQuery.\n\nThe cross-region functionality will extend to other Oracle database services and cloud platforms later.\n\nOracle Exadata Database Service\n\nIn addition, the tech giants are introducing a lower-cost option for Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure. This more straightforward version of Oracle Exadata for (multi)cloud environments is especially suitable for customers with lower computing power requirements or who need a separate development and testing environment.\n\nThe new option no longer requires RACs, which originally provided high availability and scalability by allowing multiple servers to run a single Oracle database simultaneously. As a result, RAC licenses are no longer required for single-node clusters.\n\nUltimately, this simplified version of Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure should become more accessible to smaller customers while providing significant cost savings.\n\nAlso read: Oracle and Google enter multi-cloud partnership",

In addition, embedded AI acts as an advisor to help analyze supply chain data, generate content, and augment or automate processes to help improve business operations and create a resilient supply network to outpace change.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nWhat should supply chain leaders expect to gain from Agentic AI? Implementing Agentic AI across various supply chain functions can lead to significant, measurable business impacts. In inventory management, by autonomously analyzing historical and real-time data, Agentic AI optimizes stock levels, reducing overstock and stockouts. This leads to decreased warehousing costs and improved cash flow. In predictive maintenance, Agentic AI monitors equipment health in real-time, predicting failures before they occur. This proactive approach minimizes unplanned maintenance, reducing downtime by up to 50%. In demand forecasting, by analyzing vast datasets, Agentic AI enhances demand forecasting accuracy, leading to better production planning and a potential 20% reduction in forecast errors. In route optimization, Agentic AI autonomously determines the most efficient delivery routes, considering factors like traffic and weather. This can result in a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and faster delivery times. And in supplier relationship management, Agentic AI evaluates supplier performance and compliance, facilitating better collaboration and negotiation. Early trials have shown a 25% increase in supplier collaboration efficiency.\n\nOracle is betting big on Agentic AI. Oracle is making significant investments in agentic AI, positioning itself prominently among leading ERP providers. A notable initiative is the Stargate Project, a joint venture announced in January 2025, involving Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank, and MGX. The project plans to invest up to $500 billion over four years to develop AI infrastructure in the United States, with an initial deployment of $100 billion. This substantial commitment underscores Oracle\u2019s dedication to advancing AI capabilities within its offerings. In addition to the Stargate Project, Oracle has introduced over 50 AI agents within its Fusion applications. These agents are designed to automate various business processes, enhancing productivity and efficiency for users. Of course, Oracle is not alone. The AI race among the world\u2019s leading enterprise software providers is heating up. Arch rival SAP has committed over $1.04 billion to AI development, focusing on integrating AI capabilities into its products and services. Backed by SAP, Sapphire Ventures has dedicated over $1 billion to fund AI-powered enterprise technology startups, supporting innovation and expanding SAP\u2019s AI ecosystem. And in 2024, SAP acquired WalkMe, a digital adoption platform leveraging AI to improve user interactions with enterprise software, for approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nDo you fit within the ideal customer profile (ICP) for Oracle Fusion Cloud SCM? Oracle Fusion Cloud SCM is utilized by numerous large enterprises, particularly those with over 10,000 employees and revenues exceeding $1 billion, with 63% based in the U.S. Oracle\u2019s ICP for Oracle Fusion Cloud SCM includes companies involved in discrete or process manufacturing aiming to optimize production planning, inventory management, and distribution. It also includes retail businesses focused on efficient inventory control, demand forecasting, and streamlined logistics, and high-tech organizations requiring intricate supply chain networks with a need for real-time visibility and agile operations. Oracle\u2019s SCM customers are typically organizations with complex supply chain processes that necessitate scalable solutions to manage multiple suppliers, manufacturing units, and distribution channels, and a desire to unify supply chain planning with execution processes to enhance responsiveness and efficiency. These companies also typically operate in multiple regions requiring solutions that support global supply chain networks and compliance with diverse regulatory standards. In 2023, the global SCM software market reached nearly $13 billion, with the top 10 vendors commanding approximately 42% of the market. SAP led with a 10.7% share, followed by Oracle, Blue Yonder, E2open, and Manhattan Associates.",

Nearly three-quarters (71%) of respondents said more than 20% of their cloud compute capacity is unused.\n\nThis presents a serious problem as cloud expenses continue to rise, with 38% of survey participants stating their organization has established new internal rules for cloud asset management to reduce this inefficiency.\n\nAdditionally, when asked why they use a high-performance JDK, 61% of respondents said they used it in order to optimize their cloud compute costs.",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL), fresh off of announcing its part in the massive Stargate Project alongside OpenAI and SoftBank, debuted its latest AI agents aimed at manufacturers during its CloudWorld event in Austin Thursday.\n\nThe agents are designed to help supply chain workers across a host of jobs ranging from procurement to sustainability. AI agents are specialized artificial intelligence bots that can take actions on a user\u2019s behalf, either autonomously or with their oversight, across multiple apps.\n\nCompanies ranging from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) are pushing AI agents as the next major step in AI evolution thanks to their ability to help streamline mundane but time-consuming tasks.\n\n\u201cOur new AI agents for supply chain management help ease the administrative burden by streamlining workflows and automating routine tasks to enable greater accuracy and efficiency, smarter decision-making, and ultimately, a more agile and responsive supply chain,\u201d Oracle executive vice president of applications development Chris Leone said in a statement.\n\nThe idea behind Oracle\u2019s latest offerings, which are available through its Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain and Manufacturing platform, is to help employees deal with everything from product inspections to providing detailed delivery instructions for goods.\n\nThe AI agent explosion is part of the tech industry\u2019s effort to squeeze more capabilities out of its vast investments in AI technologies. Microsoft has released its own AI agent builder as part of its Copilot Studio, while Google has its Vertex AI Agent Builder.\n\nOracle\u2019s announcement comes after the company\u2019s chairman, Larry Ellison, joined OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to announce their joint Stargate Project. The venture seeks to spend as much as $500 billion constructing AI data centers across the US.\n\nThe first data center is currently under construction in Texas.\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Oracle logo is displayed on a smartphone. (Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) \u00b7 SOPA Images via Getty Images\n\nOracle\u2019s cloud service ranks below that of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in terms of overall market share, but the company is riding the same AI wave as its larger competitors. In Q2, Oracle reported earnings just short of analysts\u2019 estimates, sending shares falling following the announcement.\n\nThat said, cloud infrastructure revenue for the quarter rose 52% to $2.4 billion, while cloud application revenue jumped 10% to $3.5 billion.\n\nShares of Oracle have risen sharply throughout the last year, climbing 41% over the last 12 months. That\u2019s far better than Microsoft\u2019s 7% increase and Google\u2019s 27% improvement. Amazon, however, has Oracle beat, jumping 47% in the last year.",

            "content": "Cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) has delivered impressive gains in the past year, rising more than 48% on the market as compared to the 25% gains registered by the Nasdaq Composite index over the same period (as of this writing). Its performance was driven by the fast-growing demand for the company's cloud infrastructure for handling artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nHowever, Oracle's rise over the past year has made the stock expensive. It now trades at 45 times trailing earnings as compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 24.\n\nEven analysts aren't expecting much upside from the stock in the coming year. It carries a median 12-month price target of $205 as determined by 39 analysts covering the stock, a jump of 11% from current levels.\n\nBuying the stock for such limited potential upside given Oracle's expensive valuation may not look like a very good idea. However, there is a chance that it may be able to do better than that and deliver stronger gains to investors in the coming year. Let's look at why.\n\nOracle's capacity expansion should lead to stronger growth\n\nThe demand for cloud infrastructure for AI model training and inferencing has been increasing rapidly. Gartner estimates that the global infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market was worth $140 billion in 2023. The research firm says that this market is set for exponential growth based on the increasing deployment of generative AI applications in the cloud.\n\nGoldman Sachs is forecasting IaaS revenue to grow to $580 billion in 2030. This opportunity has already supercharged Oracle's cloud infrastructure business. Its IaaS revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Nov. 30, 2024) increased 52% year over year to $2.4 billion.\n\nThat number could have been higher, but the company faced capacity constraints as the demand for its cloud infrastructure powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia was higher than supply.\n\nThis is why Oracle is focused on significantly expanding its cloud capacity across the globe. The company currently serves 17 cloud regions globally. It plans to expand into another 35 regions across the world in partnership with major cloud service providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet's Google.\n\nAnd now, management has entered into a joint venture with SoftBank, OpenAI, and the Abu Dhabi-based AI investment vehicle MGX to build 20 AI data centers in the U.S. These parties plan to invest $100 billion initially to build out AI infrastructure, and to take that figure up to $500 billion over the next four years.\n\nOracle's focus on enhancing its capacity should allow it to corner a bigger share of the massive opportunity in the IaaS market by the end of the decade. The company's fast-growing revenue pipeline indicates that it is on track to deliver impressive growth in the near term as well.\n\nManagement reported remaining performance obligations (RPO) worth $97 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 49% from the year-ago period. This is why analysts are forecasting revenue growth to accelerate from 9% in fiscal 2025 to 12.5% in fiscal 2026. This improvement is expected to filter down to the bottom line as well, with earnings expected to grow 14% in the next fiscal year to $7.03 per share following a 10.7% increase in the current one.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nWe have seen that Oracle's valuation is on the richer side now, following its impressive gains in the past year. The good part is that the company may be able to justify its expensive valuation thanks to its sizable RPO, which is the value of unfulfilled contracts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the future.\n\nAssuming the company manages to deliver $7.03 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026 and trades at 33 times earnings at that time -- in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) -- its stock price could hit $233. That would be a gain of 26% from current levels.\n\nSo, the possibility of the stock outperforming the consensus price target in the coming year cannot be ruled out even if it trades at a discount to its current valuation. As such, investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolio can still consider buying Oracle since it seems built for more upside.",

It is soaring past a half a trillion dollars in the first month of 2025 as technology vendors and investment firms vie to build out massive AI compute.\n\nThe last day of the month is not yet here but since 2025 began, more than half a trillion dollars in data center investment has been announced from the biggest hyperscale players including Amazon Web Services, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Oracle.\n\nMeta is planning a data center that\u2019s bigger than New York\u2019s Central Park, while Microsoft has pledged $80 billion to bring its own designs. But it was OpenAI, Nvidia, and Oracle that have so far come in with the largest figure, some $500 billion over four years at a site in Texas.\n\nBut one of the largest deals was announced by DAMAC, a UAE real estate firm that could emerge as an instant rival to some of the largest hypserscalers on this list, if the $20 billion it pledged to spend is translated into data center build-out, according to Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. He told CRN that on paper the investment would make DAMAC one of the largest vendors in the U.S., but said variables in location, supply chain, staff and construction are at play.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant investment. Microsoft committed to spending $80 billion globally, with roughly half of this going to the U.S., so I would expect the hyperscalers to keep a lead, but DAMAC would be a major player immediately in terms of floor space,\u201d Nguyen told CRN.\n\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, worldwide spending on data center infrastructure equipment \u2013 the compute, storage, networking, and supporting technology \u2013 grew 34 percent last year to an all-time high of $282 billion. Public cloud infrastructure spending now accounts for $156 billion, up 48 percent, wrote John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at the Reno, Nev.-based group, in a research note.\n\n\u201cTake a bow generative AI and GPUs, which lit a fire under a market that was otherwise just chugging along nicely,\u201d he wrote in a research note. \u201cGrowth was particularly strong in sales to public cloud providers, which jumped almost 50 percent, but even sales to enterprises increased by an unusually large 21 percent.\u201d\n\nSynergy Research Group says hyperscalers run 1,103 data centers and have a known pipeline of 497 facilities set to debut in the near future.\n\n\u201cThe trend has always been for the critical IT load of hyperscale data centers to grow in size over time, but generative AI technology and services are power hungry and have supercharged that trend,\u201d Dinsdale wrote.\n\nIn a research note, Dinsdale said the capacity inside hyperscale data centers will triple in size by the end of the decade as more investments pour in.\n\n\u201cThere will also be some degree of retrofitting existing data centers to boost their capacity. The overall result is that the total capacity of all operational hyperscale data centers will grow almost threefold by 2030,\u201d Dinsdale wrote.\n\nAccording to his research, Dell Technologies remains the overall leader in server and storage segment revenues, with Inspur being a leader in server sales to public cloud providers. Cisco is the leader in the networking segment, while Microsoft features prominently in the rankings due to its position in server OS and virtualization applications, Dinsdale wrote.\n\nHere are five of the biggest data center investments announced this month:",

Rather than just following ordained tasks under set rules, it can understand context, make decisions and tweak its approach as circumstances change. Importantly, it can autonomously carry out tasks on behalf of users.\n\n\u201cWhen RPA faces a problem that doesn\u2019t match its template, it needs to be reprogrammed for changes in process,\u201d PYMNTS wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen an AI agent faces the same situation, it can reason through the problem and come up with a fitting response. It can learn and adjust to new situations. RPA uses structured inputs and logic; AI agents use unstructured data and reasoning.\u201d\n\nFor instance, an RPA-powered chatbot on a website can handle pre-programmed responses for the most commonly asked questions by customers. But deviate from those questions, and the chatbot provides incorrect or irrelevant answers. An AI agent trained on GPT-4, on the other hand, would have a more natural response, and could better answer the customer because it can understand the question and dynamically find the answer.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

In October, Crusoe joined a $3.4bn joint venture with alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital and data center advisory and investment firm Primary Digital to help fund the campus.\n\nAt the time, as Microsoft was technically the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI, Oracle was set to provide services to Azure, which would then be used by OpenAI.

Stargate's backers claimed that they had $100bn to invest 'immediately,' but reports put the actual figure closer to $45bn. It is not known if a transfer of leases or assets will happen, which could count into the figure.\n\nSoftBank has financial responsibility and OpenAI has operational responsibility of Stargate, but this data center appears to be run by Oracle, adding further complexity.\n\nEarlier this week, DCD exclusively reported on OpenAI's own planned Stargate hires, including a data center sourcing manager and an infrastructure strategy manager. \"Help craft the direction of the entire data center industry,\" the generative AI company claimed.",

Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX, a new Emirati investment firm focused on AI technologies, are creating the company and pledged to invest at least $100 billion and up to $500 billion in new AI infrastructure to support American leadership in the new technology. Oracle stock finished up nearly 7$ on news of the announcement.\n\nWhat is the Stargate Project?\n\nAccording to an OpenAI's post announcing the project, Stargate will build new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the U.S. OpenAI announced that Stargate's equity partners will be Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX, and the key technology partners will be Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI. The equity partners will provide capital while the tech partners will supply the chips and other tech infrastructure. Softbank and OpenAI were named as the lead partners for the project with Softbank having financial responsibility for itand OpenAI in charge of operations.\n\nThe goal of the project is to ensure American leadership in AI, aid national security, and contribute to the manufacturing revitalization in the country.\n\nWhat it means for Oracle\n\nWhile OpenAI and Softbank are the leaders of Stargate, Oracle looks set to cash in on the deal as the only cloud-infrastructure company named as the initial equity funders.\n\nWhile Microsoft is one of the tech partners, Oracle is the clear leader here among the cloud infrastructure partners, and its cloud infrastructure is often favored by the government and other high-value customers due to its reputation for security, reliability, and scalability.\n\nIt also serves as a high-profile win for a company that is facing a lot of competition in the AI data center with other big tech companies, though it's formed a strategic partnership with Microsoft as both companies are opening data centers as fast as they can, according to Oracle CEO Larry Ellison.\n\nFinally, $100 billion represents a huge investment in data centers, and Oracle should benefit as OpenAI monetizes the investment.\n\nThe OpenAI/Oracle relationship\n\nOpenAI worked closely with Microsoft for much of its history and has received an estimated $13 billion in funding from the tech giant.\n\nHowever, more recently it forged a partnership with Oracle. In June, OpenAI selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to extend the Microsoft Azure AI platform to OCI, giving extra capacity to OpenAI. The move seems designed to increase OpenAI's ability to train its large language models (LLMs).\n\nOracle also worked closely with Microsoft since the AI race started, so the partnership with OpenAI makes sense. Microsoft isn't being elbowed aside here as it will be one of the tech partners involved, but running data centers for a project set to receive at least $100 billion in funding should be lucrative for Oracle.\n\nIs Oracle a buy?\n\nOracle isn't one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, but it outperformed its peers in that group as of late, and the company is also outgrowing the \"big three\" cloud-infrastructure platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet in cloud-infrastructure revenue.\n\nRevenue in its most recent quarter from cloud infrastructure jumped 52% to $2.4 billion. Overall revenue growth at Oracle, which may be best known for its database software, was more modest at 9% as businesses like licensing, hardware, and services are either flat or declining.\n\nHowever, its growth should accelerate as cloud computing makes up a larger percentage of its business. It's unclear exactly what the reward to Oracle will be for Stargate, but it could be significant. Meanwhile, the company also seems likely to benefit from Ellison's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nOverall, 2025 looks set to be another strong year for Oracle stock.",

Jensen Huang, the co-founder of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), saw his fortune plummet by a massive $20.1 billion\u2014a drop that set a new record for the \"biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history,\" according to Forbes.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDeepSeek's AI Breakthrough Sparked a Market Panic\n\nThe chaos started when DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, launched its DeepSeek R1 chatbot\u2014a model that suddenly had everyone questioning whether Silicon Valley's AI dominance was as untouchable as it seemed.\n\nHere's why: DeepSeek's AI is open-source, meaning developers can inspect and tweak it freely. The open-source nature of DeepSeek\u2019s model could radically transform the AI ecosystem.\n\nMore importantly, it reportedly cost them only $5.6 million to develop\u2014a fraction of the billions being dumped into AI by U.S. tech giants like OpenAI, Google, and, of course, Oracle.\n\nThe result? A massive selloff in AI-heavy stocks. Oracle, Nvidia, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all took a hit, but Ellison was the day's biggest loser.\n\nTrending: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nSome Billionaires Came Out on Top\n\nNot everyone suffered. While Ellison and Huang lost billions, Mark Zuckerberg walked away $4.3 billion richer, and Jeff Bezos pocketed an extra $632 million. The market doesn't play favorites\u2014it just rewards whoever's on the right side of the trade.\n\nThe Market Rebounded\u2014But This Isn't Over\n\nOn January 28, stocks like Nvidia and Oracle started climbing back. Nvidia jumped nearly 9%. Forbes said in an article, \"Nvidia's Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added.\" Oracle gained 3.6%, and investors took a deep breath.

The reason behind this behavior is the bold claim made by Chinese technology company DeepSeek, which allegedly was built quicker and more powerful than its American competitor ChatGPT. This is why there was some turmoil in the markets.\n\nCapital expenditure budgets were much higher than what DeepSeek claims, meaning that demand for chips and semiconductors might be overstated today. This is why shares of NVIDIA Co. NASDAQ: NVDA led the way lower in the market, declining by over 17% in a single day. However, other stocks related to artificial intelligence also went down by association.\n\nGet Oracle alerts: Sign Up\n\nInvestors can take shares of Oracle Co. NYSE: ORCL, for example, which sold off by up to 14% during the same day as NVIDIA\u2019s crash. However, there should be no association between this lower semiconductor demand and Oracle\u2019s cloud and infrastructure business; if anything, it should boost it. Why? If DeepSeek proves anything, there will be a more energy-efficient and faster way to do things, and that\u2019s where software dominates hardware.\n\nPrice Action Left Clues Behind\n\nBefore the sell-off, shares of Oracle rallied, following an announcement of an investment of up to $500 billion in developing artificial intelligence technology and infrastructure. Compared to other stocks, Oracle led the way.\n\nNow, taking that behavior for what it means, investors can feel more comfortable in a potential thesis where Oracle recovers quickly since it deals with the infrastructure and cloud computing businesses that can make artificial intelligence more cost-effective in the first place.\n\nUnlike NVIDIA\u2019s business, where the faster chips get, the less need for chips there could be until a new revolutionary model is developed. Oracle\u2019s upside seems to be an undeniable bargain now that the stock sits at only 82% of its 52-week high. For these reasons and its discount, some Wall Street analysts might want to keep their recent upgrades.\n\nThe Market\u2019s Take on Oracle Stock\n\nAs of late January 2025, analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald decided to initiate coverage on Oracle stock, kicking things off with an Overweight rating and a valuation of up to $214 a share. This view, which is unlikely to change soon, would call for a net upside of as much as 35.3% from where Oracle stock trades today.\n\nDespite its discount on a price action basis, Oracle stock still commands a premium from the broader markets, as investors can see from its current price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 30.7x. Compared to the rest of the computer sector, valued at an average of 8.3x P/B, Oracle clearly trades at a significant premium to peers.\n\nSome value investors would call this expensive and filled with downsides. However, seasoned traders would confirm that the market is always willing to pay a premium for the names it expects to outperform its respective industry and the market.\n\nWith this in mind, it shouldn\u2019t surprise investors to see an overall downtrend in Oracle stock\u2019s short interest over the past quarter. This means that, as the bullish evidence and catalysts built up for this company over the past few months, short sellers decided that the chances of a new rally outweighed the ones for a sell-off.\n\nSo, they decided to close down some of their short positions, as investors can see through the 4.0% decline in short interest for Oracle over the past month alone. After these bearish traders left, some institutional buyers gladly came to take their place recently.\n\nOracle Co. (ORCL) Price Chart for Saturday, March, 15, 2025\n\nAs of late January 2025, institutional buyers from Jennison Associates decided to boost their holdings in Oracle stock by 280%, an allocation that netted their entire stake at a high of $201.8 million today. Those from Abrdn followed closely with an 8.1% boost of their own, leaving them with $166.4 million worth of Oracle stock today.\n\nWhat investors should take away from this DeepSeek sell-off is this: Making models and artificial intelligence more efficient doesn\u2019t reduce its demand; it actually increases it due to the added benefits. This is when industries shift to catch up to the new norms, and Oracle seems to be front and center, ready to take on that shift today.\n\nBefore you consider Oracle, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Oracle wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Oracle currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

The report noted, \u201cSimphony Cloud POS is evolving with trends to meet the demands of hotel operators to amplify food and beverage as a revenue stream with seamless cross-channel capabilities and integration with OPERA Cloud. Oracle Payment Cloud Service\u2014which initially started in Oracle Food and Beverage\u2014has now expanded to hospitality for both the Simphony Cloud and OPERA Cloud.\u201d\n\nThe IDC MarketScape evaluated the capabilities of different point-of-sale software vendors, how they are addressing their hotel and restaurant clients\u2019 omnichannel sales needs, and their strategies and commitment to resolving those demands over the next three to five years.\n\n\u201cWe believe being named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape report, not only validates the value of the Simphony platform, but also the unique advantage Oracle provides hoteliers with the ability to integrate their POS and property management system data together on a common, secure cloud infrastructure,\u201d said Alex Alt, executive vice president and general manager, Oracle Consumer Industries. \u201cThis helps hoteliers reduce complexity in their IT stack, drive better engagement and up-sell opportunities with a holistic view of each customer, and provides insights into how, when, and where dining is driving revenue for their business for better planning.\u201d\n\nThe report noted, \u201cA particular strength of Oracle is its rapid deployment for customers and easy controls. A focus for Simphony\u2019s UI is that it is user-friendly and ensures order accuracy.

The surge comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\nOracle was hit by the big news of the day -- the revelation of the latest version of the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek -- as well as complications with President Trump's AI initiative.\n\nDeepSeek deeply spooks Wall Street\n\nA Chinese firm created the AI model DeepSeek, which is capable of competing with top models from OpenAI and Amazon, for a fraction of the price. DeepSeek R1, the newest version, was released last week, sending shockwaves through the world of AI. It was revealed that not only was R1 trained for just millions of dollars -- equivalent U.S. models take billions -- it was trained using underpowered Nvidia chips. Despite these limitations, it performs on par with its U.S. rivals.\n\nAI stocks were hit across the board, but especially infrastructure players like Oracle. Some investors believe the significantly more efficient model will drastically reduce the need for the data centers Oracle and others operate.\n\nI would exercise caution here. There is a lot of fear and speculation circulating around this news, but there is ample reason to believe this could ultimately be good for the industry, data center operators included. The increased efficiency could lead to better AI applications and, ultimately, increased demand.\n\nProject Stargate could have funding issues\n\nOracle's stock jumped last week on the announcement of Project Stargate. President Trump held a press conference featuring, among others, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to detail the new initiative. However, details were light, and where the full $500 billion promised would come from remains unclear. Furthermore, it was revealed that some of it would be expected to come from debt financing, disappointing investors.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect.\n\nMarkets were in turmoil after Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced a low-cost AI model over the weekend. DeepSeek is set to disrupt the AI industry, having developed the technology using a fraction of the resources used by competitors in the US. It is a direct challenge to rivals like OpenAI, Google and Meta, whose valuations now come under scrutiny. DeepSeek also reduces the usage of chips and energy. Investors are now keen on understanding what a justified valuation of chip manufacturers would be after accounting for a more efficient technology that is expected to curb demand for huge data centers that run on extremely expensive chips. DeepSeek has already gained popularity since its launch, occupying a top position in the Apple Store.\n\nThe NASDAQ is down almost 3%, with cumulative losses for the top 10 losers reaching $965 billion. Chipmakers lost the most value followed by big tech companies. Even firms supplying electricity have been reeling after this announcement. Big players like Meta and Microsoft are monitoring the development closely and are expected to bring changes to their software after DeepSeek\u2019s foray into AI.\n\nREAD ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article we have picked a list of 10 stocks that have witnessed the highest erosion in value due to the DeepSeek effect. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Feeling the Heat from The DeepSeek AI Effect?\n\nA team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system.\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) lost around $70 billion in market share after the stock price was down 14%. The firm has been making heavy investments in developing data centers in a bid to compete with big players like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\n\nOverall, ORCL ranks 6th on our list of stocks feeling the heat from the DeepSeek AI effect. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Under President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, a deal between China\u2019s ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, and U.S. technology company Oracle is being reconsidered. A possible acquisition stems from lingering concerns about national security and the protection of U.S. user data. TikTok is originally Chinese.\n\nTip: Oracle: stop, think and acquire something other than TikTok\n\nOracle is seen as a trusted tech partner to which the U.S. government entrusts the management of TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data. Oracle will oversee data collection, algorithm, and software updates if a deal is reached. Currently, Oracle already provides a sizable portion of TikTok\u2019s IT infrastructure.\n\nThere is even talk of a deal that would leave TikTok parent ByteDance with a minority stake. The deal is said to involve other U.S. investors in addition to Oracle. \u201cThe goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok,\u201d one source stated. \u201cByteDance wouldn\u2019t completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.\u201d\n\nPolitical and technological challenges\n\nThe potential deal\u2019s resurgence occurs during rising tensions between the U.S. and China on technology issues. It reflects broader concerns about the impact of technology on national security and privacy. As negotiations continue, the future of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain.

            "content": "TikTok has been one of the hot topics in the US for quite some time. The short video platform, which went dark briefly in the country on January 19, bought itself a 75-day extension with the help of the US President Donald Trump. There have been reports about China\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s proposal to sell 50% of TikTok to the US. Now, it seems Oracle could take over TikTok\u2019s global operations, with Microsoft being one of the investors.\n\nOracle is in talks to take over TikTok\u2019s operations, while Microsoft is willing to invest\n\nYesterday, NPR exclusively reported that the White House is negotiating a deal with TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance. The ongoing negotiation reportedly involves ByteDance retaining a minority stake in the company, with Oracle overseeing the app\u2019s algorithm, data collection, and software updates.\n\nAn anonymous source in direct connection with the ongoing talks said, \u201cThe goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok. ByteDance wouldn\u2019t completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership.\u201d Oracle is reportedly also willing to shell out \u201cthe tens of billions\u201d to take over TikTok.\n\nIt seems Oracle isn\u2019t the only name that is engaged in the talks; Microsoft is also one of them. The tech giant is reportedly willing to invest in the company. Apart from that, details about its direct involvement in TikTok\u2019s operations haven\u2019t been disclosed in the report.\n\nTrump surprisingly denies discussions with Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison, though\n\nOracle\u2019s involvement in the ongoing deal is surprising given that Trump denied discussions with Larry Ellison about buying the app. Today, Reuters similarly reported on this matter, but with a few more details.\n\nWhen asked if Trump was working on a deal with Oracle and other investors, he reportedly said, \u201cNo, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Trump hinted that he was open to Elon Musk and others buying TikTok. On the other hand, ByteDance board member still thinks that it\u2019s possible to resolve the ban without selling off the company. Well, the drama around TikTok doesn\u2019t seem to stop. It\u2019ll be interesting to see who will take the driver\u2019s seat to run TikTok.",

            "content": "The AI race took another geopolitical twist last past week, as the Trump Administration announced the formation of the $500 billion Project Stargate. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Executive Chairman Larry Ellison\u2014among other major partners\u2014was front-and-center at the White House for the unveiling of the public-private partnership.\n\nUnder Project Stargate, Oracle, OpenAI, and Nvidia will work together to build up to 20 data centers over the next four years. Oracle shares jumped up by double digits in the days after the announcement, reflecting hopes that this consortium will indeed serve as quite the boon for the company.\n\nOne top investor known by the pseudonym JR Research agrees that this confidence is certainly well-founded.\n\n\u201cOracle\u2019s reported $7 billion equity stake in Stargate could elevate its brand profile and AI data center execution capabilities,\u201d explains the 5-star investor, who sits in the top 1% of TipRanks\u2019 stock pros.\n\nJR further expands that Oracle\u2019s participation in the project is a positive reflection on the capabilities of its cloud computing infrastructure. The partnership also demonstrates confidence among these major industry players regarding Oracle\u2019s ability to provide the technological wherewithal needed to support this massive project.\n\n\u201cI believe the scale of the opportunity should elevate Oracle\u2019s brand positioning in the highly competitive hyperscaler space, as it seeks to catch up with the leading trio\u201d of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, expounds JR Research.\n\nAnd yet, the valuation of ORCL remains quite reasonable, explains JR Research. Noting that \u201cthe market hasn\u2019t gone FOMO on ORCL,\u201d the investor points out that ORCL\u2019s Forward EBITDA multiple of 18.66x is less than that of both Microsoft (21.65x) and Salesforce (20.57x).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that Oracle\u2019s improving long-term opportunity, potential market share gains, and favorable developments from its Stargate venture should help alleviate the extent of any subsequent decline,\u201d asserts JR Research. The investor is therefore maintaining a Buy rating for ORCL. (To watch JR Research\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nA healthy contingent of Wall Street analysts seem to agree with JR Research. With 15 Buy, 11 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings, ORCL enjoys a consensus Moderate Buy rating. Its 12-month average price target of $192.88 would yield gains of ~5% in the coming year.

Credit: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nTikTok has less than 75 days before facing another ban after President Donald Trump signed an executive order granting the viral video app an extension to find a buyer.\n\nWith the clock ticking, the Trump administration is facilitating talks between potential U.S. buyers and TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance.\n\nAccording to a new report from NPR, the current deal in the works features the business-oriented software company Oracle taking over and overseeing \"the app\u2019s algorithm, data collection and software updates.\" Other U.S. investors, such as Microsoft, are also involved in the acquisition process, according to a source close to the discussions.\n\nHowever, ByteDance wouldn't be completely out of the picture. The current deal in the works would allow the company to hold a minority stake in TikTok.\n\nPresident Trump has since denied the report, saying that \"numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it\" and that he will make his decision within the next 30 days.\n\nObviously, things could change at this point, but Trump has previously shared his preferences for an Oracle takeover of TikTok.\n\nTime is ticking for TikTok\n\nThe latest TikTok deal talks come just one week after TikTok went dark after being removed from Apple and Google's mobile app stores. The removal came in response to a law, passed by a bipartisan Congress and signed into law by then-president Joe Biden, requiring that TikTok cut ties with its China-based owner over national security concerns pertaining to China's government.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Citing his own usage of the platform in his successful 2024 election campaign, Trump vowed to make a deal to \"save\" TikTok. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension.\n\nWith a nod to Trump, TikTok has since restored its service for U.S. users. However, Apple and Google have yet to restore the app on app stores due to potential fines they can receive as a result of the TikTok ban law. TikTok cannot push updates or fixes for the app to U.S. users as a result of the removal. Users who want to reinstall the TikTok app or install it on a new device are currently unable to do so.\n\nOracle's TikTok?\n\nOracle is no stranger to these TikTok takeover talks.\n\nThe software company was originally floated as the lead buyer for TikTok during Trump's last presidency when he required that ByteDance sell off the app. While an acquisition deal never went through, a result of the talks saw Oracle partnering with TikTok to provide cloud services for its U.S. data.\n\nIn fact, TikTok has become such a major customer of Oracle's, that the latter said a ban on the former would hurt its business . Other U.S. investors are also involved in the TikTok takeover talks.\n\nMicrosoft, which was one of the leading interested parties alongside Oracle last time around, is said to be one of those companies. One major party that was involved in talks last time around that is missing from this round of discussions is Walmart. The big box retailer is said to be sitting out of this one due to TikTok's estimated asking price.\n\nWhile these talks can change, it does appear that Oracle is at least President Trump's preference for taking over TikTok. A few days ago, Trump was asked by a reporter if he was open to Elon Musk buying TikTok.\n\nWhile Trump said he was fine with that arrangement, he offered up his own suggestion for a buyer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like Larry to buy it, too,\" Trump said, referring to Oracle's billionaire founder Larry Ellison.\n\nIt looks like we'll know more about TikTok's future sometime in the next 30 days.",

There's great interest in TikTok,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSponsor Message\n\nAppeasing Congress\n\nWhile estimates vary on how much TikTok's global business is worth, negotiators in the White House have said ByteDance believes it could fetch at least $200 billion, putting it well outside the reach of any of the consortium of investors who have been promoting their bids, according to the source involved in the discussions.\n\nAnother person who has sat in on conversations with senior White House officials about a TikTok deal said appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle.\n\nUnder a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as \"qualified divestiture\" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S. Trump is given wide latitude to interpret what that means, but experts say it could involve ByteDance retaining a minority stake in the company.\n\nThe app has passed its Jan. 19 deadline for achieving that splitting off from ByteDance, but President Trump has issued an executive order intended to provide a 75-day extension, though legal experts say the action cannot supersede the now-passed deadline set forth by Congress.\n\nA congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval.\n\n\"A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control,\" the Congressional staffer said. \"There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access.\"\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nFears about China\n\nEliminating all potential ways for Chinese authorities to access TikTok's data and algorithm has been a concern among technology experts for years.\n\n\"The question that has always been difficult to answer is how do you prove a negative? How do you prove the absence of Chinese control of data and the algorithm?\" said Sarah Kreps, who focuses on technology and foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \"You can audit millions of lines of code, but it's really hard to show one way or the other.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nA national security plan that also involved Oracle, known as Project Texas \u2014 which gained momentum during the Biden administration \u2014 fell short of guaranteeing TikTok's independence from ByteDance, the staffer noted, but would not elaborate, saying it involves a security vulnerability that could have given China access to the data of American users.\n\nThe Project Texas proposal to eventually collapsed when Biden officials instead chose to get behind a congressional effort to force ByteDance to sell TikTok, or face a nationwide ban.\n\nIn April, Congress attached a divest-or-ban measure to a foreign aid bill. Biden signed the bill. It gave ByteDance until Jan 19. to shed its Chinese owner.\n\n\"We gave them nine months to figure out a way to sell,\" the congressional staffer said. \"But they instead decided to fight it in court, rather than working toward divestiture.\"\n\n\n\nOpening up TikTok\n\nOne thing that is unclear: what exactly Trump means when he has said that the U.S. should be entitled to a 50% ownership of TikTok.\n\nSome have suggested this means Trump is pushing for a partial nationalization of TikTok, others have chalked it up to imprecise language for a situation in which American private investors hold a 50% ownership stake in the company.\n\n\"Nobody seems to know what he means with the 50% equity comments,\" the source involved in the talks said.\n\ntoggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nChinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions \"should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles.\" The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.\n\nChina experts have said Beijing may be interested in approving a TikTok sale as a negotiating tactic to try to win tariff relief in the White House.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nMeanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores after the platform went offline for about 14 hours. Without Apple and Google's support, the app is deprived of software updates. It also cannot be downloaded on Apple devices, or found in the Google Play app store.\n\nTrump's executive order was enough for Oracle, and other web infrastructure companies, to restore TikTok's services. But other companies are not taking a gamble, including Apple and Google.\n\nUnder the TikTok ban law, supporting TikTok while it remains under the control of ByteDance can lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in fines, a punishment that can be levied a year after Trump's term.\n\n\"Oracle just has more confidence in Trump's political assurances,\" said Kreps at Brookings. \"For Apple and Google, yes, they were invited to the inauguration last week, but where will things stand next week?\"",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off.

According to NPR, this plan would see ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, maintaining only a minority stake while Oracle would oversee critical aspects like the app\u2019s algorithm, data collection, and software updates. Oracle, which already supports TikTok\u2019s web infrastructure, would essentially become the steward of these key functions, aiming to address national security concerns about data misuse.\n\nThis potential arrangement comes in the wake of a law that required ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban in the U.S., a scenario that unfolded when TikTok was briefly taken offline on January 19. Trump\u2019s executive order, signed shortly after his second term began, seeks to delay the enforcement of this law by 75 days, providing a window for negotiations.\n\nUnder the tentative deal, American investors would hold the majority stake in TikTok, though the specifics are still subject to change. The objective, as revealed by an anonymous source to NPR, is for Oracle to monitor and oversee TikTok\u2019s operations, thereby reducing Chinese influence over the app.\n\nDiscussions about this deal have included other major players like Microsoft (MSFT), indicating broad interest from U.S. companies in securing a stake in what is seen as a lucrative and influential social media platform. The report also notes that these talks are ongoing, with meetings between Oracle representatives and White House officials having taken place, and more scheduled for the near future.\n\nThe financial scope of Oracle\u2019s interest is significant, with reports suggesting their investment could be in the tens of billions. However, Trump has expressed a desire for a 50% U.S. ownership in any joint venture, indicating a push for substantial American control.\n\nOne of the critical challenges in finalizing this deal, as per NPR, is appeasing Congress, which has shown skepticism towards TikTok due to national security concerns. This skepticism was part of the reason why the previous administration under Joe Biden had passed legislation aiming at a potential ban or divestiture.\n\nMoreover, the deal faces opposition from free speech advocates who argue against the TikTok ban, pointing out that TikTok\u2019s data operations and content moderation are already managed within the U.S., with Oracle\u2019s cloud servers handling data storage and decision-making processes for American users.\n\nThis intricate situation reflects the broader tension between national security, international business, and digital rights, as the U.S. navigates its relationship with technology firms linked to foreign entities. The outcome of these negotiations could set precedents for how the U.S. deals with similar cases in the future, balancing economic interests with security imperatives.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Project Stargate will include an influx of $500 billion in private investment -- primarily from SoftBank -- directed at increasing domestic AI infrastructure.\n\nAs evidenced by Ellison's presence during the announcement, Oracle will play a central role as the program launches. Investors were pleased, sending Oracle stock higher this week.\n\nA reprieve in the TikTok saga\n\nPresident Trump took further action that helped Oracle, signing an executive order that directs the attorney general to not enforce a federal ban on TikTok. The federal ban, which cleared Congress, had just also been given the green light by the Supreme Court after the ban was challenged. Trump's action pauses enforcement of the ban for 75 days. It's unclear whether he has the power to do so, but for now, TikTok lives on in the U.S.\n\nAs the primary cloud provider for TikTok, Oracle's bottom line is directly tied to TikTok's fate. The eleventh-hour move by President Trump helped boost Oracle stock, as investors hope for a permanent resolution that keeps TikTok active in the U.S.",

            "content": "A private joint venture known as Stargate that pledges to invest up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence development, and will include tech firms OpenAI and Oracle and sector investor SoftBank with investment also from Middle East fund MGX, was announced by President Donald Trump on Jan. 22.\n\nOracle CEO Larry Ellison, speaking at a White House news conference, said Stargate will start building out data centers and electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-moving AI in Texas. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, terming the plan \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential.\u201d Also at the event were Masayoshi Son and Sam Altman, CEOs of Softbank and OpenAI, respectively, who credited the administration boost.\n\nEllison said Abilene, Texas, is the first Stargate data center location, with work already underway by developer Crusoe Energy Systems,, which also is design engineer and will operate the $3.4-billion data center.\n\n\"AI holds incredible promise for all of us,\" he said. \"We've been working with OpenAI for awhile. The data centers are actually under construction.\" Each building is roughly 500,000 sq ft in size, Ellison added, noting that 10 are currently under construction, with the number to expand to 20 and \"to other locations beyond Abilene.\"\n\nThe project is 100% leased to a company now known to be Oracle. Joint venture partner Lancium said in an October press release that it would provide clean energy for the campus. DPR Construction is the general contractor, breaking ground on the project in 2022, with completion expected later this year. Lancium did not detail the method of clean energy generation to be used for the Abilene facility, but most similar data center projects have on-site wind or solar power. The total cost of the Oracle-leased data canters is expected to be $1.1-billion according to public filings.\n\nThe other nine locations Ellison mentioned are not yet known but the Texas data center market is robust with multiple developers building facilities that have on-site energy generation.\n\nSon, who will take be Stargate chairman in addition to his current role at Softbank, has committed to investing $100 billion in U.S. data center projects. SoftBank and OpenAI are lead partners, with the former having financial responsibility and the latter in charge of operations. OpenAI and Oracle also were identified as Stargate's key initial technology partners, along with Arm, Microsoft and NVIDIA.\n\n\"We'll be turning [the data centers] over to Sam [Altman] to start training the next [AI] model,\" Ellison said. \"The data center we already built ... was the largest computer ever built. The data center we're building [now] will surpass it and will be the largest computer ever built, which enables this AI.\"\n\nAlso, Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 23 that revoked one from the Biden administration with requirements on companies developing and deploying AI. The new order, which claims the previous one \"would stifle private-sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership,\" calls for federal agencies to revise or rescind previous policies, directives, regulations, orders and other actions that are \"inconsistent with enhancing America\u2019s leadership in AI.\"\n\nTrump advisor Elon Musk and Altman engaged Jan. 23 in debate on Musk's X social media platform, with each accusing the other of being dishonest about the deal. Musk is an OpenAi co-founder and former board member before leaving and suing the company over its change from a non-profit entity to a for-profit company led by Altman.\n\nThe Musk lawsuit, which also appears to touch on the evolution of AI as a technology, is scheduled to be argued next month in federal district court in San Francisco.",

The stocks of all companies involved soared, with Oracle and Nvidia rising 7% and 4%, respectively, the day after the announcement.\n\nBut these early announcements have been followed by social media feuds featuring Elon Musk, questions about funding, and rival announcements about AI investments slated for this year.\n\nTrump's close ally, Elon Musk, took aim at Stargate\u2019s backers on his social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Responding to a post from OpenAI about the project, he wrote, \"They don\u2019t actually have the money,\" adding, \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured.\"\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, wrote back, \u201cWrong, as you surely know.\u201d OpenAI has raised nearly $17 billion in the past two years and opened up a $4 billion credit line with various banks, though the company said it expected to lose $5 billion in 2024 while generating only $3.7 billion in revenue. OpenAI would need to raise an additional $19 billion to fund Stargate, according to The Information.\n\nA person familiar with Stargate refuted Musk's claims, telling Yahoo Finance that the project is indeed prepared to immediately deploy the initial $100 billion investment, noting that SoftBank had $24 billion in cash as of its most recent quarterly earnings.\n\nThe Financial Times, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that Stargate has not yet secured its required funding, will receive no government financing, and will only serve OpenAI once completed.\n\nSo far, only about 4% of Americans report using AI daily in their workplaces, though almost all Americans use AI-enabled products in their daily lives, often without realizing it.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI CEO, speaks to President Donald Trump, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison at the White House, on Jan. 21, 2025.

            "content": "Apple Inc. and Oracle Corp. have reacted differently to President Donald Trump 's pledge that the US government won't enforce a national security law that raised potential penalties for US partners of the popular video app TikTok Oracle, which provides cloud services for TikTok, took Trump\u2019s go-ahead to heart. It\u2019s kept TikTok operational since the app briefly went offline over the weekend. Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, however, which removed the app from their respective app stores to comply with the Jan. 19 ban, have held off on relisting TikTok. The app has been unavailable for the past five days.This diverging approach by some of the country\u2019s biggest and most powerful tech companies underscores the current confusion around Trump\u2019s order, the uncertainty about TikTok\u2019s future and just how much political capital matters in the Trump era. Tech titans are stuck between complying with the law and appeasing a sitting president who values loyalty and expects others to follow his lead.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the statute remains in effect, so there is some legal risk and that\u2019s incontrovertible,\u201d said Glenn Gerstell, who served as general counsel of the National Security Agency during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cWhether that legal risk is acceptable or not is going to vary with your circumstances.\u201dLawmakers and other Washington insiders have raised concern about Oracle\u2019s role in keeping TikTok available to US users. Even with a nod from Trump, critics argue that the company could open itself up to lawsuits from current shareholders and massive fines from a future administration that may want to retroactively enforce those penalties. There is also the possibility that Trump could change his mind on enforcement and go after tech firms for billions in damages.Oracle\u2019s longstanding coziness with Trump and its lucrative business entanglements with TikTok appear to be enough incentive to take on that potential legal risk. \u201cThey've obviously made the business decision that that risk, relative to the reward, is an acceptable one for them,\u201d Gerstell said.Apple and Google, meanwhile, have come to a different conclusion. While the app is popular, it\u2019s also free to download and the companies likely make minimal revenue from TikTok via in-app purchases compared to any potential fine they may face for violating the law. The potential upside for Apple and Google to ignore the law is \u201cprobably far less significant,\u201d Gerstell said.According to the law, daily fines for supporting TikTok could quickly climb into the billions of dollars if the statute is ultimately enforced. ByteDance, TikTok and Oracle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Oracle leaders have long aligned themselves with conservative politics. Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on Trump\u2019s transition team after the 2016 presidential election, and billionaire co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has donated to Republicans, including Trump. Ellison is also famously close to Elon Musk, a newly central figure to the Trump orbit, and previously sat on Tesla Inc.\u2019s board of directors and has let Musk vacation at his private Hawaiian island.\u201cHe\u2019s sort of CEO of everything \u2014 he\u2019s an amazing man, an amazing businessperson,\u201d Trump said of Ellison during an event at the White House earlier this week.Oracle\u2019s proximity to Trump has paid off in the past. The cloud giant was Trump\u2019s original pick to buy TikTok in 2020 when he also tried to ban the app over national security reasons. Though the deal ultimately fell apart after Trump left office, the outcome for Oracle was arguably more transformative than the partial ownership Trump had proposed: Oracle landed TikTok\u2019s enormous cloud infrastructure business, and was selected as a partner to help the app cordon off sensitive US user data from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., in an effort marketed by TikTok as Project Texas.TikTok has since become one of Oracle cloud\u2019s most important clients as a crucial early customer of that unit, helping to validate a then-nascent part of Oracle\u2019s business. Last summer, Oracle warned investors that a TikTok ban could hurt revenue and profits and increase expenses. The multiyear cloud contract was already worth over $1 billion by the time TikTok announced in 2022 that US user data was flowing through Oracle\u2019s servers, according to people familiar with the work who asked not to be named discussing private information. Oracle also won work from TikTok to host data in the EMEA region, the people said.Due to political and press intrigue, work with TikTok was considered highly confidential internally. TikTok was codenamed \u201cTelesis\u201d inside Oracle, and staff working on relevant projects had to sign separate nondisclosure agreements, the people said. Ultimately, a proposal for TikTok to cordon off US user data from its Chinese parent company was never accepted by US regulators, though the two companies still have a cloud partnership.It couldn\u2019t be determined how much TikTok\u2019s spending on Oracle Cloud has grown since its initial commitments, but Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, estimates Oracle\u2019s annual revenue from TikTok may now be in the range of $500 million to $800 million.Trump\u2019s executive order on his first day in office directed his Justice Department not to enforce penalties from the divest-or-ban law. The order gave ByteDance an additional 75 days to orchestrate a deal for the app while the new administration evaluates the situation.Under the new law, TikTok can remain in the US if ByteDance executes a \u201cqualified divestiture,\u201d but it\u2019ll largely be up to Trump to determine what kind of deal satisfies the country\u2019s national security concerns. ByteDance would need to finalize a sale by early April, when Trump\u2019s temporary non-enforcement order lifts. But there\u2019s been little indication publicly that ByteDance is willing to sell, nor that it\u2019s entertaining proposals from Trump or offers from interested bidders.\u201cI think we\u2019re quite optimistic we\u2019ll find a solution,\u201d ByteDance board member and General Atlantic Chief Executive Officer Bill Ford told Bloomberg Television this week.It\u2019s unclear if Trump\u2019s extension is even legal under the current law. Discussion during TikTok\u2019s Supreme Court hearing made clear that even the justices didn\u2019t know if an extension was allowable after the law went into effect on Jan. 19.\u201cI am at a loss to describe to you where the law is at this moment,\u201d said Dick Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, earlier this week. The law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress, signed by President Biden and upheld by the US Supreme Court , he added, but \u201cnow the new president is saying, \u2018ignore it if you wish.\u2019\u201dEven members of Trump\u2019s own party are criticizing his handling of the matter. Trump loyalist and former VP hopeful, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, believes tech companies helping TikTok operate are opening themselves up to legal penalties and \u201chundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201dApple and Google clearly are. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts believe it\u2019s unlikely either company will reinstate TikTok on their app stores because of the potential legal exposure. \u201cWhen facing risk on this scale, the better course is to heed the law,\u201d wrote analysts Matthew Schettenhelm and Tamlin Bason.Oracle may see value in following a different path. At an event this week, with Ellison standing feet away, Trump said he was open to the idea of Musk or Ellison buying TikTok. \u201cI\u2019d like Larry to buy it, too,\u201d he said.",

Senator Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., asked about improving the transition from active duty to the VA and access to community care \u2013 and, specifically, porting over veterans' medical records.\n\nCollins acknowledged that transferring records from the VA to healthcare providers outside the system has been a roadblock to smooth transitions to community care that is more convenient for rural veterans.\n\nThe EHR modernization program is one example of the VA itself \"standing in the way\" of veterans' access to care, he said on Tuesday.\n\n\"That is a program that has went too many years and cost too many billions of dollars without finding a solution,\" he said at the hearing. \"And my commitment is one of the very first priorities, if confirmed, is to get in and figure out why and put this on a bigger timeframe to get this medical health records issue solved.\"\n\nThe beleaguered state of the VA's EHR, with six facilities on the new Oracle system, has left \"uncertainty for the veteran, that leaves uncertainty for the family and makes a very unhealthy experience for those that are serving,\" Collins said.\n\nWhen Moran announced that Collins's nomination would advance to a full Senate vote, he praised the former Congressman and veteran for his firsthand knowledge.\n\n\"During his hearing before the committee, he demonstrated his understanding of the policies he will be expected to administer at the Department of Veterans Affairs and his care and respect for our nation\u2019s heroes,\" said Moran.\n\n\"If confirmed, I will hold him to his commitment to work with our committee to implement critical reforms at VA to better support our nation\u2019s veterans and their families.\"\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nLast month, the VA announced that it had improved veteran trust and clinician satisfaction during the EHR Modernization program reset, and that it would soon resume system deployments.\n\nIt's been more than 18 months since lawmakers charged the agency with making critical improvements to patient safety at five VA health systems using the new EHR. Following a series of outages and incidents of patient harm, the VA's Office of Inspector General has investigated system flaws and recommended more than 70 changes.\n\nIn November, Trump tapped Collins to head the VA, saying that he would be an advocate for veterans care and support.\n\n\"Doug is a Veteran himself, who currently serves our Nation as a Chaplain in the United States Air Force Reserve Command, and fought for our Country in the Iraq War,\" Trump noted.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"We will not shy away from challenges like homelessness and suicide prevention, electronic health record modernization and shrinking the department\u2019s claims backlog,\" Collins said in his written testimony.\n\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\n\nEmail: afox@himss.org\n\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

            "content": "For many ERP Insiders, Oracle Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) solutions have been instrumental in helping organizations manage risk, enforce access controls, and maintain regulatory compliance. However, as Big Red officially sunsets its GRC suite by May 2025, businesses relying on these tools face a critical challenge: What comes next?\n\nWith Oracle ceasing active development and only offering Sustaining Support, organizations must act now to mitigate compliance risks and transition to alternative solutions. The end of Oracle GRC impacts multiple business functions, from finance and audit to IT security and enterprise risk management. If your company hasn\u2019t begun planning for this shift, you may soon find yourself exposed to compliance gaps, operational inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.\n\nWho is Affected by the End of Oracle GRC?\n\nThe discontinuation of Oracle GRC will have widespread consequences across key business functions, particularly those responsible for governance, risk management, compliance, finance, and IT security. As such, organizations must be prepared for a fundamental shift in how they manage these critical areas.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nGovernance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) professionals will be among the most directly affected by Oracle GRC\u2019s sunset. These individuals rely heavily on the platform to enforce regulatory policies, automate risk detection, and manage internal controls. GRC managers and analysts will therefore need to evaluate alternative platforms to ensure continuity in risk monitoring and policy enforcement.\n\nInternal auditors, who depend on Oracle GRC\u2019s automated tracking and reporting capabilities, will also have to reassess their audit workflows and find new tools that allow them to maintain efficiency and transparency in compliance reporting.\n\nCompliance officers will also be impacted, as they will need to redefine their regulatory frameworks, ensuring that their organizations continue to meet industry and legal standards despite the absence of Oracle GRC\u2019s built-in compliance tools.\n\nIT and security teams will face significant challenges as well. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and security analysts must implement new security frameworks and policies to maintain the same level of access control and governance that Oracle GRC provided. Without a clear transition plan, organizations risk introducing security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps. ERP administrators, who oversee security configurations and user access rules, will play a crucial role in ensuring that alternative solutions are seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise systems. These teams must work swiftly to migrate identity and access management policies to a new platform, ensuring that critical security controls remain intact and business operations are not disrupted.\n\nFinancial and accounting leadership will also experience major disruptions. Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and financial controllers have depended on Oracle GRC to oversee financial governance, fraud detection, and compliance with ever-evolving financial regulations. Without it, they must identify and implement new solutions that offer similar capabilities to prevent financial misstatements and ensure compliance. Meanwhile, accounts payable and receivable managers will need to integrate new fraud detection and transaction monitoring solutions to maintain visibility and control over financial transactions. Failing to do so could expose organizations to financial fraud risks and regulatory penalties.\n\nOracle ERP and technology consultants will be instrumental in guiding businesses through this transition. As companies evaluate their next steps, ERP consultants and solution architects will need to identify the best alternatives to Oracle GRC, ensuring that any new solution integrates seamlessly with existing Oracle ERP systems. In particular, technology advisors should be tasked with assessing third-party risk management platforms, determining which options best align with an organization\u2019s unique compliance needs, and assisting in the technical implementation of new governance tools.\n\nWhat Are Your Options?\n\nWith Oracle GRC being phased out, businesses must explore alternative solutions. While Oracle recommends transitioning to Oracle Risk Management Cloud, this solution does not fully replicate all functionalities of the legacy GRC suite\u2014particularly Oracle Preventive Controls Governor (PCG). As a result, companies must carefully evaluate their options to maintain strong compliance and security frameworks.\n\nTransition to Oracle Risk Management Cloud\n\nOracle\u2019s cloud-based Risk Management Cloud offers some access control and risk monitoring capabilities, particularly in areas such as audit management and transaction monitoring. However, it lacks certain key functionalities that Oracle GRC users may be accustomed to, particularly in preventive control enforcement. Organizations considering this route should conduct a detailed gap analysis to determine whether the Oracle Risk Management Cloud meets all their governance needs or if additional solutions are required.\n\nConsider Third-Party GRC Solutions\n\nMany enterprises may find that third-party GRC platforms provide a more comprehensive alternative to Oracle GRC. Several industry-leading solutions offer robust compliance, risk, and security management capabilities, including:\n\nSAP GRC solutions \u2013 A strong alternative for organizations that already operate within the SAP ecosystem. With tools such as SAP Risk Management and SAP Business Integrity, the ERP giant provides comprehensive risk, compliance, and audit management functionalities.\n\n\u2013 A strong alternative for organizations that already operate within the SAP ecosystem.

ServiceNow GRC solutions \u2013 ServiceNow\u2019s platform includes cloud-based risk and compliance management solutions that offer automation, workflow integration, and real-time monitoring to support enterprise-wide governance frameworks.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different features and capabilities, so organizations should conduct thorough evaluations to determine which best fits their needs.\n\nEvaluate Custom & Hybrid Approaches\n\nSome organizations may opt for a custom or hybrid approach to governance and compliance management. This might involve integrating multiple tools to achieve the same functionality that Oracle GRC provided or developing in-house risk management frameworks tailored to specific business needs. While this approach offers greater flexibility, it also requires a strong commitment to ongoing maintenance and development.\n\nSteps to Prepare for the Transition\n\nTo ensure a seamless transition away from Oracle GRC, organizations should take a structured approach:\n\nConduct an Impact Assessment \u2013 Identify the specific GRC modules in use and assess the risks associated with their discontinuation.\n\n\u2013 Identify the specific GRC modules in use and assess the risks associated with their discontinuation.

Communicate with Stakeholders \u2013 Keep all affected teams informed about the changes, and provide training to ensure smooth adoption of new tools and processes.\n\nThe Time to Act is Now\n\nThe retirement of Oracle GRC is more than just an IT concern \u2014 it is a business-critical issue that impacts compliance, security, and financial oversight. Organizations that fail to prepare adequately risk exposing themselves to regulatory violations, fraud, and operational inefficiencies. The window to make a proactive transition is closing quickly, and delaying action could lead to costly disruptions.\n\nBusinesses must take immediate steps to assess their options, implement alternative solutions, and ensure they remain compliant in a post-Oracle GRC landscape. Whether adopting Oracle Risk Management Cloud, migrating to third-party platforms, or implementing custom solutions, success will depend on proactive planning and a well-executed transition strategy.\n\nIs your organization ready for the end of Oracle GRC? If not, the time to prepare is now.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders",

            "content": "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure makes it easier to achieve US DoD CMMC requirements,\n\nwith the potential to save months of manual work\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle today announced a comprehensive set of customized tools and documentation to help defense contractors comply with the new Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) when they launch services on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). As of October 15, 2024, defense contractors must be compliant with CMMC Level 1, 2, and/or 3 over a phased implementation period.\n\nAchieving these standards can be difficult, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The new OCI Core Landing Zone automation template and CMMC-specific documentation can significantly ease this process, helping save months of manual work mapping controls and setting up compliance-ready cloud architecture.\n\n\"GE Aerospace uses Oracle US Government Cloud to deliver CMMC Level 2 readiness on a modernized supply chain,\" said Shravan Devulapalli, cybersecurity technologist, GE Aerospace. \"Our modernization project was delivered on time and on budget with performance that exceeded the on-premises solution it replaced.\"\n\nAchieving CMMC compliance\n\nThe CMMC Program enables the DoD to verify that defense prime contractors and subcontractors have implemented security safeguards for Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). To achieve CMMC certification, businesses must comply with controls that are aligned to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171.\n\n\n\nThe OCI Core Landing Zone includes baseline configurations and rules delivered using a standardized Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) template designed to help meet CMMC requirements. Based on Terraform, OCI Core Landing Zones allow customers to perform one-click, best-practice deployments of a preconfigured set of cloud native services. Customers can answer a few simple questions about their needs, launch the OCI Core Landing Zone templates, and have an architecture set up that is designed to automatically meet many CMMC controls.\n\nOracle US Government Cloud has also achieved FedRAMP High JAB P-ATO status, and its services meet NIST SP 800-171 control requirements.\n\n\"CMMC is more than a secure implementation in the cloud. It is documentation that authoritatively matches that implementation to the CMMC controls,\" said Rand Waldron, vice president, Oracle. \"Oracle has gone further to help defense contractors by providing comprehensive guidance to explain how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure helps achieve compliance with CMMC requirements. Oracle provides both an informational guide and controls checklist for CMMC Levels 1 and 2 compliance.\"\n\nThe OCI Landing Zone and associated technical documentation are provided at no additional charge under a customer's contract. Cloud services used to stand up OCI Core Landing Zone in a customer's tenancy will be billed in accordance with the customer's contract. OCI Core Landing Zone templates are available within the OCI Console and through GitHub. For more information, check out the CMMC Level 1 and Level 2 informational guides.\n\nOracle US Government Cloud services are priced at the same, consistent global pricing as Oracle's commercial public cloud regions and meet DISA Impact Levels 2, 4, and FedRAMP High authorization standards. Oracle US Government Cloud is available in the US East (Ashburn, VA), and US West (Phoenix, AZ) regions.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

Son will be the chairman, they said.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. will also join the project as technological partners, with a plan under consideration to build data centers for the development of AI, they said.\n\nIn Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that the latest development is a \"business decision for each individual company.\"\n\nBut Hayashi, the top government spokesman, expressed hope that SoftBank's move will \"lead to further deepening and progress of Japan-U.S. economic relations.\"\n\nSoftBank Group in recent years has been focusing on AI as the centerpiece of its business strategy, promoting the use of the technology across countries and industries through its influential British chip-designing subsidiary Arm Holdings PLC, while boosting investments in startups in the sector, such as OpenAI.\n\nAt its annual shareholders' meeting in June last year, Son vowed to realize AI thousands of times smarter than humans within the next 10 years, saying he was \"born to\" create artificial superintelligence.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nTrump taps ex-investment banker Glass as U.S. ambassador to Japan\n\nSoftBank CEO Son with Trump vows $100 billion investment in U.S.",

China is a competitor and others are competitors.\u201d\n\nThe trio of tech giants is expected to commit an initial $100 billion to the initiative, dubbed the Stargate project, and plan to invest a total of $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years, OpenAI said in a blog post. Trump claimed the effort will quickly create more than 100,000 American jobs and called it a \u201cresounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential under a new president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs companies compete globally to build new AI products, the initiative underscores the potential for tech jobs to fuel the U.S. economy. The AI race is increasing the demand worldwide for data centers, facilities that house computing equipment such as servers used to process the trove of information needed to train and maintain AI systems.\n\nStill, questions linger about how Stargate will pan out. Billionaire Elon Musk, who has emerged in recent months as one of Trump\u2019s close advisors and is heading the newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency, publicly challenged the initiative.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk posted Tuesday on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman fired back on X. \u201cWrong, as you surely know,\u201d he wrote. \u201cwant to come visit the first site already under way? this is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put [America] first.\u201d\n\nMusk, who runs an artificial intelligence company, xAI, but was also an early investor in OpenAI, is embroiled in a legal battle with OpenAI and has accused the San Francisco-based company of putting profits over the \u201cbenefit of humanity.\u201d\n\nWhile AI is being put to use to address a seemingly limitless array of challenges including fighting wildfires and diagnosing diseases, concerns remain about the impact the technology will have on jobs, people\u2019s safety and other issues. Trump has downplayed such worries, repealing a 2023 executive order by former President Biden that aimed to place safety guardrails around AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle, a technology fund in the United Arab Emirates named MGX will provide funding for Stargate, according to OpenAI\u2019s blog post. Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, will be the chairman of Stargate. Technology partners include Arm, Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nThe first data centers for Stargate are under construction in Texas, Oracle Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said at the news conference. It\u2019s unclear whether new data centers will be built in California as part of this effort, but OpenAI\u2019s blog post said that Stargate is looking at potential sites across the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled we get to do this in the United States of America,\u201d Altman said at the news conference. \u201cI think this will be the most important project of this era.\u201d",

SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX are the initial equity funders. Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) are technology partners. The project includes a data center already underway in Texas, according to the announcement.\n\nTrump called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project, by far, in history.\"\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle stock gained 6.8% to close at 184.22. The stock soared above its 50-day moving average. Oracle stock has now gained for six straight trading days, its longest streak since August 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nTrump Praise Could Boost Oracle Stock\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote to clients that Stargate represents \"the start of a wave of massive AI investments to take place in the U.S. as we expect more big tech players to make announcements over the coming weeks.\"\n\nIves added that he expects \"Trump to aggressively court more AI investments in the U.S. with the China tariff negotiations in the background all part of a broader game of high stakes poker with China. As Project Stargate takes hold this is bullish for the likes of Palantir (PLTR), Microsoft, Oracle, Dell (DELL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and a host of other players.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump praised Oracle's Ellison as \"CEO of everything. He's an amazing man and an amazing business person.\" Ellison, 80, founded Oracle in 1977 and stepped down as Oracle chief executive in 2014. But he remains the database software company's most prominent leader as chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne wrote Wednesday that the \"fundamental impact\" from Stargate for Oracle stock remains to be seem. But the announcement highlights the opportunities for Oracle to work with Trump.\n\n\"Based on President's Trumps comments yesterday, it is quite clear that Oracle is well positioned to have a seat at the table as it relates to some of the current administration's efforts (such as) the build out of AI and other digital initiatives related to driving greater efficiency across the government,\" Materne wrote.\n\nOracle stock rallied by nearly 60% in 2024, its best year since 1999. Shares soared as Oracle's cloud infrastructure business attracted AI startups that need cloud computing power.\n\nBur Oracle stock has pulled back in recent weeks from a high of 198.31 reached on Dec. 9. Oracle's fiscal Q2 earnings report that same day missed expectations for earnings and sales, setting off the recent slump.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nPresident Trump Eases Up On Artificial Intelligence Regulation\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nTop Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nBest IBD 50 Stocks To Watch",

            "content": "In July 2025, Microsoft will discontinue support for the Microsoft Connector for Oracle in SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). This blog provides essential details to help customers prepare for this change in advance.\n\nThe Microsoft Connector for Oracle enables data export from and import into Oracle databases within an SSIS package. This feature, available in Enterprise editions of SQL Server 2019 and 2022, will remain functional for the lifecycle of the SQL Server product. However, support for this feature will officially end on July 4, 2025. With the deprecation, future product releases will provide no further bug fixes. Additionally, it will not be supported from SQL Server 2025 and onwards.\n\nToday, customers are leveraging the Microsoft Connector for Oracle in a variety of scenarios, including integrating Oracle data with other sources and supporting ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to gain valuable insights. We recommend that customers use the SSIS ADO.NET Source and ADO.NET Destination components as the primary alternative solution to the Microsoft Connector for Oracle.\n\nThese SSIS ADO.NET components offer similar ETL capabilities for connecting Oracle databases with a .NET provider, specifically the OracleClient Data Provider, to connect, transfer, and transform your data efficiently.

            "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThree top tech firms on Tuesday announced that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House Tuesday afternoon alongside President Donald Trump to announce the company, which Trump called the \u201clargest AI infrastructure project in history.\u201d\n\nThe companies will invest $100 billion in the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. The project is expected to create 100,000 US jobs, Trump said.\n\nStargate will build \u201cthe physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,\u201d including data centers around the country, Trump said. Ellison said the group\u2019s first, 1 million-square foot data project is already under construction in Texas.\n\nAI leaders have for months been sounding the alarm that more data centers \u2014 as well as the chips and electricity and water resources to run them \u2014 are needed to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years.\n\n\u201cI think this will be the most important project of this era,\u201d Altman said on Tuesday. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOracle is among the biggest US data center operators. And SoftBank has the kind of deep pockets needed to fund the expansion of AI infrastructure, which is expected to cost billions of dollars.\n\nAltman has previously urged US officials to aid in that infrastructure buildout to ensure the United States remains ahead of China in the AI arms race, given that AI is poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities. The OpenAI CEO also reportedly met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips.\n\nAltman, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, told Fox News last month that he believes Trump will \u201cbe very good at\u201d attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and said he looks \u201cforward to working with his administration on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure in the United States is super important, AI is a little bit different from other kinds of software in that it requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities,\u201d Altman said in the interview.\n\nIn a policy white paper published last week, OpenAI said investment in US AI infrastructure can ensure that US AI tools win out over Chinese technology, as well as creating new US jobs and economic opportunities, and urged the US government to create \u201cfoundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI.\u201d The brief estimated that there are \u201c$175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the US doesnt attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects\u2014strengthening the Chinese Communist Partys global influence,\u201d the company said.\n\nOracle said in a statement that the Stargate project \u201cwill secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world. This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.\u201d\n\nSoftBank will have financial responsibility for Stargate and OpenAI will have operational responsibility. A fourth partner, MGX, is also contributing funding. SoftBank\u2019s Son will be Stargate\u2019s chairman, OpenAI said.\n\nNew presidents and presidents-elect have often held joint announcements with companies about massive US investments to promote a supposed rebirth of American industry. But their track record for success is decidedly mixed.\n\nTrump in 2017 announced with Foxconn a massive $10 billion electronics factory in Wisconsin that was expected to create 13,000 jobs. But the company eventually abandoned most of its plans for the facility and the high-tech products it was set to build. The company in 2021 said it would invest just $672 million in a revised deal that would create fewer than 1,500 jobs.\n\nFoxconn has said it invested $1 billion into the state, however, and it still has a major manufacturing site for data servers with more than 1,000 employees. But the facility Trump announced has become a Microsoft data hub that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump on Monday also reversed an executive order passed by former President Joe Biden in 2023 that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Oracle Corporation ( ) share price has soared 206% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. And in the last week the share price has popped 4.6%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.2% in a week.\n\nSince the stock has added US$20b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Oracle achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.1% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Oracle, it has a TSR of 229% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Oracle shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 27% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

There is abundant documentation on Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6\u2019s calving and melting, making it is a very popular touristic destination. AI models are not specifically trained to replicate what occurs in those extreme places but what the models say over the whole ice sheet. Extreme places like this one may be used as verification. (Photo: Cl\u00e9ment Cherblanc). Cl\u00e9ment Cherblanc\n\nWe scientists keep a close eye on the ice in Greenland and the Arctic, because even though there is a lot of ice, you probably already know that the ice is melting faster and faster. This is due to global warming, which is emphasised by the latest IPCC report and calculations from GEUS.\n\nBut how fast is the ice melting and how much meltwater is actually being produced? We don't know for sure.\n\nThe models we use to predict how much ice will remain in the future and how quickly it will disappear are slow, complex and disagree on the amount of melt.\n\nThis is why we are now working on a new project to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that can create faster surface mass balance models.\n\nCurrent models and satellite observations for how much ice the Greenland ice sheet has lost do not agree. On the right are the names of 13 different models together with the mean of the models, which is called the ensemble. The GRACE satellite measures the mass changes which are shown in grey. The left axis shows the models' and GRACE satellite\u2019s estimates of how much ice was lost between 2003 and 2013, in terms of mass of water added to the ocean (which contributes to sea level rise). (Figure: Fettweis et al, 2020).\n\nOut of balance\n\nThe Greenland ice sheet is constantly changing.\n\nYou can compare it to your bank account, money comes from some places and comes out to others.\n\nSimilar to your bank account, the mass of the Greenland ice sheet can increase and decrease.\n\nAt the surface the ice sheet grows when it snows, but it thins and retreats when the surface melts.\n\nThe surface mass balance describes this increase and decrease of snow and ice at the surface only.\n\nWhat is mass balance and surface mass balance? Surface mass balance (SMB) is the sum of the surface's mass loss and gain. Surface mass gain is precipitation, consisting of snowfall and rainfall. Surface mass loss consists of surface runoff, sublimation and evaporation, and blowing snow erosion. SMB=Precipitation - Runoff - Sublimation -Evaporation -Blowing snow erosion Note that this is not the same as total mass balance, which also includes the discharge of ice. So the ice sheet can still be losing mass even though the surface mass balance is positive. The total mass balance (TMB) consists of the surface mass balance, plus the loss caused by solid discharge (D), i.e., iceberg calving, and basal melt (BM), i.e., melt that happens at the base of the ice sheet and glaciers. TMB = SMB - D - BM\n\nOn the Greenland ice sheet, snow falls most of the year, but in the summer months when the temperatures are high (sometimes 0 degree in the middle of the ice sheet and over 10 degrees at the margin), the surface at lower elevations melts and the water might run off the ice sheet.\n\nIn an ideal world, the winter mass increase would equal the summer loss.\n\nBut with global warming, the increase in surface mass in winter does not match the increased loss of surface mass in summer.\n\nOur predictions have improved/have become more and more accurate\n\nWe, climate researchers, currently observe physical phenomena such as melting ice and attempt to describe them with equations that computers can solve.\n\nThis approach is called \u2018numerical modelling\u2019.\n\nThose models create a coarse grid, and each point of the grid is supposed to represent what happens at that location on the ice sheet and nearby.\n\nThose models work great if the grid is very fine, but the finer the grid, the longer the computation time.\n\nComputational power has improved over the last decades, thus the spatial resolution (=how fine the grid is) of the models has increased.\n\nIn the figure below you can see an example of how our models have improved over time.\n\nThe figure is an example of how models have become increasingly accurate over the years. Here the climate models included in the IPCC\u2019s First, Second, Third and 4th Assessment Report (AR) are used as an example. However, the more accurate and fine-grained the models are, the slower to run and more difficult they are to use. (Figure: IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007)\n\nBut the computing power is starting to fall short\n\nHowever, the spatial resolution needed to have reliable predictions of the surface mass balance is so fine that it would require extremely powerful computers, or running the models would take years.\n\nBut we do not have such powerful computers. So where to look for new solutions?\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has made rapid progress in the last years, and is applied in various fields, including language processing (like ChatGPT), image generation (Dall-E), but also in medical applications and mechanical engineering.\n\nAI models also spark the interest of climate scientists \u2013 including us.\n\nIn climate modelling, AI models can be used to approximate the predictions of the numerical models without solving complex physical equations.\n\nThus we will be able to make new predictions at a fraction of the computation costs, as this study indicates, where the researchers managed to make instantaneous predictions, whereas the associated numerical model took multiple weeks on a supercomputer.\n\nHowever, how much faster we can make the calculations depends on the specific application, but the time consuming part in AI is the training of the model, that also depends heavily on the available hardware.\n\nSpeeding up the process\n\nIn our projects, we are developing AI models designed to mimic the predictions of numerical models.\n\nSince we can run an AI model much faster than a numerical model, we can make many predictions instead of one in the same amount of time.\n\nSince a single simulation from one of the current standard models only produces one prediction, we have limited knowledge of the reliability of this prediction.\n\nWith the multiple outputs produced by the AI model, we get a range of possible predictions, that we can analyse together and get a more accurate picture of how likely the predictions are.\n\nMelting at the Qooroq Glacier in Greenland occurs from both the surface and the bottom, creating high water pressure and strong freshwater flow over the salty fjord water. This current pushes icebergs and sea ice away, forming the characteristic circle. In the future, AI will be able to better predict the consequences of the complex melting of the Greenland and Arctic ice sheets. (Photo: Cl\u00e9ment Cherblanc).\n\nHow to make an AI model mimic the old models (just faster)\n\nAI models can be made in many ways, and each of those can also be build in different ways, with different \u2018structures\u2019.\n\nThis is why ChatGPT is not the same model as your Photoshop assistant, your phone fingerprint detector, or your phone\u2019s camera object detector, or what we use for scientific predictions - those are different AI models with their respective strengths.\n\nSo before we can use the AI model to make predictions, we need to teach the models exactly how to mimic the numerical models.\n\nWe do that by giving the existing predictions from the numerical models to the AI model, so that it learns how the output should look when given a certain input. This we call training the AI model.\n\nFor AI models to be reliable, we need to train the model with a lot of data.\n\nGathering enough data to train a model can be tricky, especially when this data comes out of a numerical model that is very slow to run in the first place.\n\nHowever, once the AI model is properly trained, we don\u2019t have to run the numerical models again and thus reducing the computational cost.\n\nAI models are only as good as their training data\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of AI models is that the models are only as good as the data they have been trained on.\n\nAlthough we aim to correctly mimic the numerical models, they might not perfectly portray the real world and reliably predict the future, as we saw in the first figure the models make very different estimates of ice loss - even for the present-day ice sheet.\n\nFor one when we run the numerical models, we make a lot of compromises, which means we don\u2019t capture the nitty bitty detail of what\u2019s going on at the surface of the ice sheet.\n\nSince we use the output of the numerical models to train the AI model, they inherit this.\n\nAI for Climate modelling Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines or systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as decision-making and learning. Machine learning is a part of AI where systems improve their performance by learning from data without being explicitly programmed for each task. In machine learning, models are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions. While creating and training such a model takes time, once it\u2019s finished training, predictions can be done much faster than with a physical model.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the future - and neither does AI\n\nAnother aspect of this challenge is that we can never fully know what the future holds.\n\nIf there are some fundamental changes about the way the ice sheet behaves in the future, we might not have included that in our equations yet, since it is extremely difficult to predict.\n\nTipping points are a good example of drastic changes in the system.\n\nThis article gives a good overview of different possible tipping points, and also shows that some elements that were proposed as tipping points but are no longer seen as such.\n\nBecause the traditional numerical models use these equations, they might not capture these future changes correctly.\n\nAnd since the AI models are trained on the output of the numerical models, both the numerical models and the AI might not perfectly represent the future real world.\n\nThis challenge is not unique to AIs used to predict melting ice or climate change, this is the case with all AI models - they are only as good as the data they are trained on.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean we can't use AI to make predictions. As mentioned, AI models will both produce predictions much faster and in greater numbers.\n\nThis gives us the opportunity to compare predictions, calculate uncertainties and thus get a better picture of what the future holds for our ice caps.",

Last week, the Supreme Court upheld the law .\n\nOn Saturday, Google and Apple removed the app from their stores, a requirement of the ban, which also forbids web-hosting companies from providing back-end support to the app.\n\nWhen Biden officials said they would leave enforcement of the law up to the Trump administration, web-hosting services were not confident they would not be prosecuted. The law outlines stiff penalties for violations that could cost the companies billions.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nOn Sunday morning, President-elect Donald Trump effectively reversed the black-out with a single post to his Truth Social social network: He issued a statement vowing to pause the law and said he would extend a liability shield to tech companies that support TikTok, as the app's future is worked out by his incoming administration.\n\nNot long after, companies that provide web support, including firms Oracle and Akamai, restored the TikTok website and app for millions of users in the U.S.But Trump's post Sunday gave the web providers the assurance they needed to bring TikTok back, according to a person close to TikTok's ongoing discussions with the Biden administration and Trump's transition team, who was not authorized to speak about the talks.\n\nTikTok's future remains clouded with legal and political questions.\n\nApple and Google, which operate the all-powerful app stores for mobile devices, still have not agreed to let TikTok return.\n\nWithout the backing of those two companies, TikTok cannot be downloaded by new users; the app cannot receive vital software updates to resolve bugs and other glitches; and in-app purchases have ground to a halt, with users unable to purchase \"coins\" during live-streams, nor paid subscriptions.\n\nLegal scholars, like Alan Rozenshtein at the University of Minnesota Law School, say TikTok's business partners are taking divergent paths: Apple and Google are holding out, while Oracle and Akamai have restored service based on Trump's Truth Social post.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"These 'service providers' have lost their minds,\" said Rozenshtein in a post on X. \"There's no assurance that Trump, who's not even the president yet, can provide,\" he said, predicting that litigation could be the next stage of the TikTok saga.\n\nUnder the TikTok ban law, supporting the app before divestiture could trigger fines of $5,000 per user, easily running into billions of dollars in potential penalties.\n\nApple, Google, Oracle and Akami did not return a request for comment.\n\nLegal experts said the tech giants may be waiting to see if Trump follows the letter of the law, which requires the White House to certify to Congress that a deal to sell TikTok is in progress before it can halt enforcement of the ban.\n\nBeyond the Apple and Google morass, some lawmakers in Washington are raising doubts about Trump's ability to intervene without abiding by the specific requirements set forth in the law.\n\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that Trump does not have the authority to postpone the start date of a law that is already in effect. He noted in a post on X that for Apple, Google and other companies, there could be grave consequences for assisting TikTok before it splits from ByteDance.\n\n\"Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law,\" Cotton wrote. \"Not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits and state AGs,\" he continued, referring to the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. \"Think about it.\"\n\n",

            "content": "By Dawn Chmielewski, Kanishka Singh and Milana Vinn\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle ORCL.N and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app\u2019s operations, two people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.\n\nUnder the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok\u2019s China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok\u2019s Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe terms of the deal are fluid, the sources said, and are likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as well as other regions.\n\nNational Public Radio on Saturday reported deal talks for TikTok\u2019s global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. The White House and Oracle had no immediate comment.\n\nThe deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance\u2019s current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass\u2019s Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance\u2019s U.S. backers.\n\nRepresentatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nOthers vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users\u2019 information, to alleviate Washington\u2019s worries about Chinese government interference.\n\nTikTok\u2019s management would remain in place, to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources.\n\nThe app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.\n\nTrump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans\u2019 data being misused.\n\nOfficials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.\n\nOracle was interested in a TikTok stake \u201cin the tens of billions,\u201d but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.\n\nTrump has said he \u201cwould like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d in TikTok.\n\nNPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.\n\nFree speech advocates have opposed TikTok\u2019s ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe company has said U.S. officials misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S. Source: REUTERS",

            "content": "Hi everybody Let\u2019s talk about Target (TGT), a stock that got my attention this week, and for good reason. At first glance, the company\u2019s recent updates seem promising, but as with most things in the stock market, the story is more complex than it appears. Target just raised its Q4 comparable sales guidance to forecast 1.5% growth, up from its previous projection of flat sales, which sounds like a positive move in the right direction. But when we dig deeper, the plot thickens\u2014and the chart reflects that perfectly.\n\nThe Chart: Target's Bearish Struggle\n\nLooking at the chart for TGT, we can see that it\u2019s currently trading at $133.62, down significantly from its 52-week high of $181.86 and flirting with its support level of $120.21. The price action is clearly bearish, with the stock trending lower over both the 1-month and 6-month timeframes. Moving averages (the colored lines on the chart) are sloping downward, and TGT\u2019s price remains well below these levels\u2014a clear sign that sellers are firmly in control.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) score of 3/10 confirms the stock is weak. Momentum indicators like the MACD show continued downward pressure, making it unlikely we\u2019ll see a significant rebound in the near term. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, though\u2014stocks don\u2019t stay oversold forever, and the chart suggests that $120.21 could be a critical level to watch for potential buyers stepping in.\n\nThe Story Behind the Stock\n\nHere\u2019s where the chart meets the narrative. Target recently updated its Q4 EPS guidance (earnings per share), but rather than raising it alongside the improved sales forecast, the company merely reaffirmed its previous guidance of $1.85-$2.45 per share. This immediately raised red flags. Why? Because an increase in sales without a corresponding boost to profits strongly suggests that the company relied heavily on markdowns and promotions to drive demand.\n\nThis aligns with what we saw in Q3, when Target\u2019s operating margin shrank by 60 basis points year-over-year due to price cuts. Back then, management warned that it would need to stay in \u201cpromotional mode\u201d to lure in budget-conscious shoppers\u2014and it seems that strategy has carried into Q4.\n\nBreaking Down the Numbers\n\nWhile Target is seeing better-than-expected sales growth in discretionary categories like apparel and toys, this improvement hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the challenges posed by a shift in consumer spending habits. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\nSales Shift to Essentials: About 70-75% of Target\u2019s sales come from discretionary items, making it vulnerable to economic headwinds. Meanwhile, its main competitor, Walmart (WMT), benefits from higher demand for essentials like food and household items, helping it report stronger U.S. comp growth of 5.3% last quarter compared to Target\u2019s 0.3%. Promotional Pressure: Target\u2019s reliance on discounts to drive traffic is putting pressure on margins. Even though it raised its comp guidance for Q4, the flat EPS outlook signals that profit growth is still out of reach. Slowing Momentum: While sales grew 2% in November and December, the guidance suggests that January has been slower, hinting that the holiday shopping bump hasn\u2019t carried forward into a broader uptrend.\n\nBright Spots in the Darkness\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though. Target continues to make headway in key areas:\n\nTraffic Growth: The retailer has seen eight consecutive months of year-over-year traffic growth , a sign that customers are still coming through its doors (and logging onto its website).\n\neCommerce Momentum: Digital sales are growing, with 11% growth in digital comps last quarter . This is encouraging as it shows that Target\u2019s investment in its online presence is paying off.\n\nDiscretionary Recovery: Categories like apparel and toys are starting to rebound, which is critical given their large contribution to overall sales.\n\nHow the Story and Chart Connect\n\nThe stock\u2019s price action and technical indicators reflect the broader narrative of a company struggling to balance growth and profitability in a tough retail environment. The bearish trend aligns with the challenges Target is facing:\n\nMargins under pressure due to heavy promotions.\n\nSlower growth in January despite a holiday boost.\n\nVulnerability to economic headwinds as consumers prioritize essentials over discretionary purchases.\n\nMy Takeaway\n\nTarget\u2019s chart shows a stock under pressure, and the story behind it explains why. While there are bright spots like traffic growth and improving eCommerce performance, the company\u2019s reliance on markdowns and its inability to convert higher sales into higher profits are weighing heavily on investor sentiment. For now, $120.21 is the key support level to watch\u2014if the stock holds above this, it may stabilize, but if it breaks below, further downside could be in store.\n\nFor traders or investors looking to get involved, patience is key. Wait for signs of a reversal in the bearish trend, such as a break above the 200-day moving average around $150, or keep an eye on earnings in March for a potential catalyst. Until then, TGT remains a stock to monitor rather than chase. Until next time, stay disciplined, stay profitable, and trade smarter! \ud83c\udfaf-EC\n\nI hope this deep dive sheds some light on Target\u2019s challenges and opportunities\u2014let me know your thoughts!

            "content": "How do you bulletproof your cloud security posture as your applications grow in number and complexity? It\u2019s not a new question, but it confounds many CISOs.\n\nIf you control too much, employees and customers may feel you are throwing a wrench in the way of innovation. Meanwhile, shadow IT and AI teams in your company go off building rogue robots in the dark corners of your network. But if you become too lax, you risk rampant data theft, leakages and gigantic lawsuits, not to mention government fines and a breakdown of trust with your customers. One data breach and it's lights out for your reputation (and maybe even your job).\n\nOracle says it now has the key for CISOs to escape this security purgatory. The company is taking a radically different approach with its new OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing (ZPR) to reimagine how they secure clouds fundamentally.\n\nSecurity baked in, not bolted on\n\n\u201cAny customer who builds an application and sets up security does a good job on day one,\u201d explains Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBut then what happens when [the application] evolves over a few years? Because applications can live for a long time... if you don\u2019t plan security at every step of the way and change the architecture, you create holes in your security posture,\u201d he adds.\n\nThiagarajan believes that our traditional approach to defining security when deploying applications crumbles as applications age and sprawl. Multiply that by the number of applications and instances, and it is easy to see why the poor CISO feels he or she is drowning in hundreds of individual security policies and firewall rules.\n\nOCI ZPR (pronounced \"zipper\") flips the script. Instead of being bolted onto applications like armor that gradually becomes ill-fitting over time, security is woven into the system's fabric.\n\n\u201cHow we separate the control for the security organization and security posture away from the architectural evolution is at the base of what we're trying to solve,\u201d Thiagarajan explains. OCI ZPR separates architecture evolution from network misconfiguration, he adds.\n\nAnalysts see the value. OCI ZPR \u201cenables organizations to decouple network configuration from security, helping to eliminate the effects of human network configuration errors,\u201d observes Philip Bues, senior research manager for cloud security at IDC in a press announcement.\n\nAt its core, OCI ZPR uses zero trust and least privilege principles to restrict access based on policies and security attributes. It enforces these policies at the network layer so that requests from unapproved sources will not touch the database. This approach prevents unwanted data exfiltration by limiting requests to approved paths only.\n\nOCI ZPR\u2019s approach allows Oracle to reduce the number of security configurations CISOs must manage by approximately 50%, claims Thiagarajan. And they\u2019re aiming to reduce this even further.\n\nCreating a new policy language standard\n\nOracle is not done yet. It has a long-term vision for OCI ZPR that extends far beyond its current capabilities. \u201cWe're just getting started,\u201d says Thiagarajan.\n\nMahesh Thiagarajan @ Oracle: \"How we separate the control for the security organization and security posture away from the architectural evolution is at the base of what we're trying to solve.\"\n\nFor example, the company is working to make ZPR an open standard through zpr.org and the likes of Applied Invention to make the intent-based language used to define security policies more accessible. It hints to a future where this security model may be an industry standard.\n\nWhy would CISOs want another standard? The company believes that focusing on business intent and security outcomes simplifies security and better aligns with evolving business and application needs. It also represents a fundamental shift from traditional approaches that require deep technical knowledge of networking concepts that are becoming very hard to find.\n\n\u201cThis new standard driven by Oracle flips this all too often checkbox item on its head to provide an innovative solution for organizations that simplifies compliance efforts, reduces the burden on security teams, and ultimately strengthens security,\u201d adds IDC\u2019s Bues.\n\nOverall, OCI ZPR is designed to evolve alongside applications, maintaining security even as application architectures change. While time- and location-based dynamic security policies aren't yet implemented, Thiagarajan acknowledges these are \"theoretically possible\" but sees them as potential future developments.\n\nA different way for secure AI training\n\nOCI ZPR\u2019s launch comes as AI reshapes the security landscape. The focus on AI model training has broadened the attack risks, while data sovereignty has made compliance an additional security headaches.\n\nOCI ZPR\u2019s implications for AI and machine learning workloads are particularly compelling. Companies can now create isolated \u201cislands\u201d for AI training infrastructure and strictly control what data these systems can access, even if individual network configurations are modified.\n\n\u201cIf you have GPUs that are training the models, and you want to control access to data, you can actually segregate the data, put it in a different zone and tell ZPR that these computers [should only be accessing this data for AI training] and nowhere else,\u201d explains Thiagarajan.\n\nAnother area where OCI ZPR proves its mettle is in meeting data sovereignty and residency requirements. These are continuing to expand, particularly in Asia. The solution provides a consistent security model that can be applied across different deployment models \u2014 from public cloud to isolated regions.\n\n\u201cSingapore thinks about sovereignty differently from how India thinks about sovereignty... different from how Japan thinks about sovereignty,\" notes Thiagarajan. The platform's flexibility allows companies to maintain consistent security controls while meeting diverse regulatory requirements, he adds.\n\nUnraveling future security complexity\n\nFor CISOs grappling with cloud security complexity today, OCI ZPR represents a compelling vision of a future where network misconfigurations do not impact security postures and data governance \u2014 one where security is inherent in the infrastructure itself rather than bolted on through endless configurations.\n\nAs AI workloads become more prevalent and data sovereignty requirements more complex, this approach to security may become not just attractive but essential.\n\nImage credit: iStockphoto/SIphotography",

            "content": "The analyst might have been a bit too bullish on Oracle Financial Services Software Limited ( ), given that the company fell short of expectations when it released its third-quarter results last week. Oracle Financial Services Software missed earnings this time around, with \u20b917b revenue coming in 3.0% below what the analyst had modelled. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) of \u20b961.99 also fell short of expectations by 13%. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what expert is forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analyst has changed their mind on Oracle Financial Services Software after the latest results.\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Oracle Financial Services Software's solitary analyst is for revenues of \u20b976.2b in 2026. This would reflect a solid 13% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to ascend 17% to \u20b9309. In the lead-up to this report, the analyst had been modelling revenues of \u20b979.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20b9326 in 2026. The analyst are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the minor downgrade to earnings per share expectations.\n\nThe analyst made no major changes to their price target of \u20b911,400, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Oracle Financial Services Software's valuation.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Oracle Financial Services Software's past performance and to peers in the same . The analyst is definitely expecting Oracle Financial Services Software's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 9.9% annualised growth to the end of 2026 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 7.2% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 15% per year. So it's clear that despite the acceleration in growth, Oracle Financial Services Software is expected to grow meaningfully slower than the industry average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analyst downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at \u20b911,400, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price target.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

The official also made it clear that the Biden administration believes that TikTok should operate under a U.S. owner. However, the outgoing administration is allowing the incoming administration to decide what to do about TikTok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive the latest Apple news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nTikTok itself isn't responsible for following the law that calls for the app to go dark on January 19th. The responsibility falls on the app stores and internet hosting companies to pull the plug on TikTok starting on Sunday. The DOJ has the ability to fine these companies $5,000 per user if they do not comply with the law. That adds up to a fine large enough to make sure that every company involved in the dissemination of TikTok on devices in the U.S. falls into line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if the Biden administration or the Trump administration decides not to enforce the law, the tech firms responsible for listing TikTok in app stores (Apple and Google) and the internet hosting company that allows U.S. internet users to access TikTok (Oracle) will still have to follow the law unless the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes at the last second, or ByteDance sells TikTok to another firm. And the law calls for the app to go dark on January 19th with a 90-day extension possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president can issue a one-time 90=day extension moving the start of the ban under three conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok must prove that it is working on a deal that takes it out of the hands of ByteDance.\n\nThere must be \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a sale.\n\nProgress toward a sale must be sealed with \"relevant binding legal agreements.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, none of these conditions have been met. Donald Trump has changed his mind about TikTok with the president-elect stating after the election that he has a \"warm spot in my heart\" for the app. That could be due to TikTok's ability to deliver to Trump the youth vote. Nonetheless, barring some explosive news being announced by Saturday night, TikTok's days in the U.S. might be numbered.\n\n",

Yes, but it seems almost nonsensical to describe him so. Terms like those suit filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick or Martin Scorsese because you can measure other directors against them. But Lynch, sui generis, eluded comparison. We shall not see his like again, because we\u2019d never seen it before either.\n\nHe started out\u2014and in some respects always remained\u2014a painter, a visual artist who loved best what the hands could make and the eye could see. \u201cDavid could spend hours putting dots on a wall,\u201d Raffaella De Laurentiis, the producer of Dune, Lynch\u2019s one big commercial film and one big commercial failure, told the writer Kristine McKenna, who collaborated with Lynch on his 2018 autobiography Room to Dream. The book is both a delight and a frustrating chimera, the 500-page result of a publisher\u2019s futile attempt to get Lynch to reflect on his life in any conventional fashion. He famously refused to explain his movies. In his 2006 sort-of-self-help book Catching the Big Fish, Lynch suggested that this was because he wanted viewers to arrive at an understanding of his work on their own, but it also seemed that he could not articulate his intentions\u2014indeed he seemed, at times, not even to have any. Of the blue box and its blue key\u2014the ominous MacGuffin in his 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive\u2014he simply said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what those are.\u201d\n\nRelated From Slate David Lynch\u2019s MasterClass Is As Surreal and As Banal As You\u2019d Expect Read More\n\nLanguage was a medium he resisted, and even the most famous phrases from his work (\u201cThe owls are not what they seem,\u201d for example) functioned like images instead of words\u2014they had effects rather than meanings. Those effects were often, though not always, disturbing, and in a manner difficult to describe or replicate. A long empty hallway lit by a stuttering fluorescent bulb in a Lynch film is menacing to a degree that other directors can allude to but never equal. In the vast cinematic universe of jump scares, what makes the sooty \u201cbum\u201d (Bonnie Aarons) behind the diner parking lot in Mulholland Drive so terrifying? Your guess, Lynch would surely reply, is as good as mine.\n\nWords, and the meanings they hope to impart, fail us again and again, which may explain why Lynch, who seemed to place little stock in either, maintained an eccentric personal cheerfulness at odds with his often unnerving films. (In one of the more charming tributes to appear on Bluesky, the writer Kashana Cauley, who once lived near Lynch, recalled him as a \u201ccool neighbor\u201d who would wave to her from one of \u201chis crazy retro cars that looked like 1940s hearses\u201d when she was out for a run.) In Blue Velvet, another of his masterpieces, Lynch posited a vision of goodness in the dreamy suburban innocence embodied by Laura Dern, an actor with whom he had a long and fruitful artistic relationship. By the time Lynch made the groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks\u2014or, more specifically, Fire Walk With Me, a movie sequel made without his Twin Peaks co-creator, Mark Frost\u2014he had transformed this blond homecoming queen figure, in the person of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), into a tragic, heroic bulwark against the darkness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe thing is, he really believes in that,\u201d I remember a friend saying as we mulled over Blue Velvet, in one of the surely infinite number of fervid conversations that movie has inspired. My friend was speaking of the final scene, in which the main character, Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan, another longtime Lynch collaborator), having survived a soiling trip through the underworld, marvels with Sandy (Dern) at a robin that has alighted on Sandy\u2019s kitchen windowsill. But the bird is flagrantly mechanical and pinches a writhing bug in its metal beak. My friend insisted that, while the scene is funny, it doesn\u2019t undermine the sunniness of the suburban idyll Jeffrey has regained. The bug has to be included for the idyll to be real.\n\nBlue Velvet was the most autobiographical of Lynch\u2019s films, mostly because it featured images drawn from his own childhood in the Pacific Northwest. Once, while he and his brother were playing outside in the suburban neighborhood he recalled as an earthly paradise, they were approached by a disoriented naked woman with a bloodied mouth. Jeffrey has an almost identical experience with the traumatized Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) in Blue Velvet, but he is implicated in her distress. Lynch also described as formative a moment when, as a child, he approached a beautiful tree only to find its bark crawling with ants, a moment of fascinated disgust that inspired the ants swarming over the severed ear Jeffrey discovers at the beginning of Blue Velvet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Lynch, these glimpses of disorder, violence, and decay didn\u2019t invalidate or overturn his own boyhood happiness. Somehow, they deepened and solidified it. For the rest of his life, he would identify as an Eagle Scout while making movies that peered into abysses that felt more bottomless than anyone else\u2019s. You\u2019d think such an arrangement would be tormenting, but Lynch breezed along, enthusing about the weather and Bob\u2019s Big Boy and adorably camping on a street corner in L.A. with a live cow to champion Dern\u2019s performance in Inland Empire\u2014all apparently thanks to a policy of just not overthinking it. Like an oracle, he inhaled vapors emanated from the bowels of the Earth\u2014and, worse, from the depths of human nature\u2014then transmitted the voices of the gods, untouched. You could always feel that in his best work, for all its abundant idiosyncrasies: the shudder of forces bigger than any one person. But only one person has ever done, could ever do, what he did.",

He will assist in the transition of duties and continue as Oracle\u2019s representative on the Board of Directors of Ampere Computer Holdings, the tech giant said in the filing. Oracle did not disclose who would succeed Screven in this role.\n\nScreven joined Oracle in 1986 and currently leads the company\u2019s technology and architecture decisions as well as its strategic initiatives including industry standards and security across all Oracle products.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nHe is credited with leading the tech giant\u2019s open-source strategy since Oracle\u2019s buyout of Sun Microsystems in 2009 and introducing some of Oracle\u2019s most popular open-source programs like Java, Oracle Linus, MySQL and VirtualBox. Screven also heads Oracle Labs, a unit that explores and identifies new technologies that can improve Oracle\u2019s customers\u2019 business.\n\nWhat this means for ERP insiders\n\nOpen-source software solutions to maintain a strong growth trajectory. The near- and long-term trends for open-source software suggest that the market for these solutions remains strong due to ongoing technological advancements and improved adoption across different sectors. The technology\u2019s cloud-native focus continues to be a significant growth area as it plays a crucial role in enabling cloud-based deployments. Additionally. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities into open-source software has the potential to drive more innovation in this space. While Oracle continues to enjoy a pole position in this space, companies like Red Hat, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are also embracing open source with various initiatives of their own. They include Red Hat Enterprise Linux; Microsoft\u2019s .NET Core and Azure; Google\u2019s projects for Android, Kubernetes, and Tensor Flow; and Amazon leveraging open source in its AWS cloud platform.\n\nMonitor Oracle\u2019s open-source strategy. Big Red\u2019s open-source strategy embraces three fundamental principles: participating in and contributing to various open-source communities and projects, leveraging open-source technologies to build its own products and solutions, and providing support and expertise for these technologies. The company\u2019s most popular open-source programs were introduced under Screven\u2019s leadership and include Java, MySQL and VirtualBox. Apart from this, Oracle has also actively participated in and contributed to cloud-native projects such as Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nLeverage new technologies from Oracle Labs. Oracle Labs plays a significant role in driving innovation across Oracle\u2019s product portfolio, including its ERP solutions. By staying informed about the research and developments coming out of Oracle Labs, ERP users can gain a better understanding of the future of enterprise software and leverage these innovations to improve their business operations. The unit focuses on research areas like AI, cloud computing blockchain, quantum computing, and data science. It provides early access to advancements in these areas for improved ERP solutions, automation, superior security and predictive analysis.",

            "content": "Two industry-leading global companies share their insights on AI challenges, strategies for success and the power of collaboration\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming business operations, and businesses are starting to see returns. Nearly half (49%) of technology leaders in PwC\u2019s October 2024 Pulse Survey said that AI was \u201cfully integrated\u201d into their companies\u2019 core business strategy. A third said AI was fully integrated into products and services. As AI rapidly advances, enterprises should embrace an AI strategy so they can stay competitive \u2014 whether their goal is to enhance productivity, reinvent functions to lower costs, or develop AI-driven products and services that transform their business models.\n\n1. Focus on human-facing use cases for greater impact\n\nThe financial services company has been modernizing its enterprise technology stack for years, even acquiring an AI company to improve its capabilities. The company sees a huge demand for AI use cases and capabilities across its business. After careful evaluation, the organization decided to prioritize human-in-the-loop use cases with a holistic modernization program for its front- and back-office functions. For this financial services organization, it was all about creating tools and systems that help its employees do their jobs more easily and efficiently.\n\nFor example, the company discovered that a significant amount of friction in its customer service process arose when agents needed to put a customer on hold to clarify the next action to take. The company leveraged AI in its Oracle applications to develop a generative AI-powered virtual assistant for its contact center, which helps prevent the need to put a customer on hold and can reduce the time-to-resolution to seconds.\n\n2. Start with clean data for better insights\n\nData is at the heart of what finance does \u2014 and the financial services company\u2019s data management strategy has always been at the core of its transformation journey. In finance, professionals spend a lot of time inputting data and generating reports. Because the company had invested in traditional AI, data, and cloud capabilities with its Oracle products, it was well positioned to \u201cflip the script\u201d and use generative AI to enable its employees to spend more time on insights and less on inputs. The clean core and trustworthy data provided by Oracle Fusion applications helped set the company\u2019s AI initiatives up for success from day one.\n\n3. Build risk management into new products\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest global IT companies began deploying its large language model in a wide variety of consumer use cases, the company worked hard to confirm that risk management was well considered in its AI models. For example, the company integrated a safety mechanism into its large language model to help prevent users from retrieving harmful answers by filtering out problematic questions. The safety model\u2019s taxonomy is designed to recognize serious queries \u2014 it can distinguish whether a question is about biological warfare or academic chemistry, for instance. The organization is committed to providing Responsible AI across all its products, and a big part of achieving that is often forging industry AI alliances that focus on developing policies, benchmarks, and tools to help confirm Responsible AI usage.\n\n4. Embrace an executive-level approach to governance\n\nIn addition to technological initiatives such as cybersecurity evaluations and industry AI alliances, Responsible AI requires cultural initiatives which includes a leadership driven approach to governance and a holistic change management strategy. Finance is a heavily regulated industry, and the financial services company has taken a careful approach to managing its risk and governance. By instituting a structured approach to governing AI and involving senior leaders at the earliest stages of the process, the company has set itself up to innovate and adopt AI quickly across its enterprise landscape.\n\n5. Develop strong collaborations for development and deployment\n\nThe Tech company was one of the first to open-source a large language model, making it available on Oracle Cloud. The initiative aimed to enable organizations to use its model at scale, with PwC and Oracle providing specialized knowledge for further fine-tuning, deployment and model distillation for effective use cases. This infrastructure provided a seamless tool for engineering teams to use large language models in their own projects.\n\nSimilarly, the financial services company\u2019s use of AI embedded in Oracle\u2019s products, such as Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), positions the company to take advantage of the possibilities of AI. Working with PwC, the company moved to production and improved the customer experience while increasing employee efficiency.",

His recent $202 million purchase of a stately London office building is the latest jewel in a glittering real estate portfolio.\n\nAccording to CoStar News, Ellison has agreed to buy the West End property from Hong Kong-listed investor Chinese Estates. The property, located at 11-12 James Square, is currently entirely vacant, and Ellison, 80, is thought to be buying it for one of his businesses. Chinese Estate purchased the building from Malaysia\u2019s Employees Provident Fund for \u00a3175 million ($216 million in 2017).\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nOver $1 Billion In Real Estate\n\nThe purchase is notable for Ellison, as most of his real estate holdings \u2013 valued at over $1 billion \u2013 thus far have been U.S.-based in California, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Palm Beach. Dubbed \u201cthe nation\u2019s most avid trophy-home buyer\u201d by the Wall Street Journal in 2011, Ellison\u2019s penchant for picking up prestige properties has hardly abated. Here\u2019s a closer look.\n\nCalifornia Dreaming\n\nAccording to AOL, in 1988, a decade after founding Oracle, Ellison purchased a $3.9 million, 10,000-square-foot home in San Francisco\u2019s upscale Pacific Heights neighborhood. Seven years later, in 1995, Ellison purchased a 23-acre estate in Woodside, California, for $12 million. The tech mogul reportedly spent $200 million renovating the home, modeling it on a 16th-century Japanese imperial palace, completing it in 2004.\n\nOutside of his role with Oracle, Ellison is perhaps known for helping make Malibu, CA, what it is today. He started buying homes in the former laid-back surf town three decades ago. Today, he owns eleven properties in Malibu\u2019s Carbon Beach, an area referred to as \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Beach\u201d because of its high net-worth residents, as detailed in the Wall Street Journal. Ellison also owns multiple buildings and commercial ventures. Among them is the Japanese-inspired Nobu Ryokan Hotel, where rates start at a minimum of $2,000 a night.",

            "content": "Businesses rely on reporting capabilities to make better, informed decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and evaluate business scalability to better pinpoint growth opportunities and assess market viability.\n\nTo stay competitive and agile in today\u2019s data-driven world, organizations must bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights. This requires not just collecting information, but also leveraging advanced reporting tools that transform complex data into meaningful, real-time analytics.\n\nSplashBI, a business analytics platform, offers organizations with solutions to boost their reporting and data capabilities from pre-built reports, data integration, data models, security, cloud or on-premise offerings.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nHow the City of Tampa revolutionized reporting with SplashBI for Oracle Cloud\n\nThe City of Tampa, Florida, sought out a clear and comprehensive view of their expenditures and activities. To achieve this, the City\u2019s administrators chose to move from their legacy Oracle EBS to Oracle Fusion Cloud.\n\nTransitioning from the legacy systems, however, was not easy and brought on many complexities such as limited reporting formats, data inconsistencies, and steep learning curves for the City\u2019s users. The City required advanced ad hoc reporting, more specifically for grants and budget utilization, which the legacy solution failed to provide. As a result, the City then reached out to SplashBI to help with the migration to Oracle Fusion Cloud.\n\nTo aid the City in its transition to Oracle Fusion Cloud, SplashBI developed over 500 pre-built reports, ten custom reports and implemented real-time reporting capabilities tailored to the City\u2019s needs. The platform upgrade ensured compatibility with the City\u2019s new Oracle Fusion Cloud environment, and ultimately set the stage for the implementation of SplashBI for Oracle Cloud.\n\nThe implementation was completed in ten weeks with no downtime which ensured business workflows operated seamlessly. Additionally, the upgrade enhanced transparency and operational efficiency which enabled the City\u2019s users to gain access to insights independently.\n\nWhat does this mean for ERP insiders?\n\nMigrating to Oracle Fusion Cloud offers businesses the opportunity to modernize their operations, enhance transparency, and unlock the full potential of their data. By addressing the limitations of legacy systems, organizations can benefit from advanced reporting capabilities, real-time insights, and streamlined workflows, all of which are critical for maintaining a competitive edge in today\u2019s fast-paced environment.\n\nSplashBI helps to ensure these transitions are seamless and effective. With its robust suite of pre-built reports, tailored customization, real-time reporting, and user-friendly design, SplashBI empowers organizations to leverage the power of Oracle Fusion Cloud. As demonstrated by the City of Tampa\u2019s success, SplashBI not only simplifies the migration process but also equips users with the tools needed to drive efficiency, make data-driven decisions, and achieve organizational goals.",

            "content": "Oracle has made over 100 acquisitions in its lifetime, which have helped develop it in a multitude of ways, including application development, industry solutions, middleware, server expansion, storage capabilities, and network development.\n\nOracle has spent a significant amount of money on its acquisitions but its most expensive as of 2025 is its purchase of Cerner for $28.3 billion in 2022. Before that, Oracle\u2019s most expensive acquisition had been PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2005.\n\nDue to the numerous products, services, and industries Oracle caters to, it is no surprise that there are a substantial number of important subsidiaries and integrated companies that result in Oracle having the second-highest revenue across all software companies.\n\nKey Takeaways Oracle is known as a global leader in enterprise software and IT solutions; it is the second-largest software company in the world by revenue.\n\nOracle's cloud computing and database packages are well-known throughout the industry, but the company also has relied on an aggressive acquisition strategy to bolster its portfolio.\n\nIncluded under the Oracle banner are BEA Systems, Hyperion, Siebel Systems, and Sun Microsystems, among several others.\n\nOracle's largest acquisition was of Cerner for $28.3 billion in 2022.\n\n1. Acme Packet\n\nAcme Packet produced session border controllers, security gateways, and session-routing proxies. It allowed secure and reliable communications across devices, regardless of network. Oracle acquired Acme Packet in 2013 for $2.1 billion.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, Acme Packet\u2019s solutions were utilized by almost 90% of the world\u2019s top 100 communications companies. Acme Packet was founded in 2000 and was headquartered out of Bedford, Massachusetts.\n\n2. BEA Systems\n\nOracle acquired BEA Systems in 2008 for $8.6 billion. The acquisition was made to bolster Oracle\u2019s Fusion middleware software suite.\n\nFounded in 1995, the three founders of BEA were all former employees of Sun Microsystems. BEA Systems\u2019s three major product lines were a transaction-oriented middleware platform called Tuxedo, an enterprise infrastructure platform, and a service-oriented architecture platform.\n\nAll three products are utilized, including the development of the Oracle Weblogic Server and Oracle Service Bus.\n\n3. Hyperion Solutions Corporation\n\nHyperion Corporation, a provider of performance management software, was acquired by Oracle in 2007 for $3.3 billion. It offered enterprise resource planning solutions, financial modules, and reporting products. The combination of the two companies resulted in the creation of the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition.\n\n4. MICROS Systems\n\nIn September 2014, Oracle completed the acquisition of MICROS Systems Inc. Previously headquartered in Maryland, MICROS provided enterprise applications to restaurants, hotels, casinos, and other entertainment businesses.\n\nThe $5.3 billion deal to acquire MICROS enabled Oracle to expand its Retail and Hospitality Hardware and Software division. At the time of acquisition, MICROS technologies were used by over 330,000 customers in 180 countries.\n\n5. NetSuite\n\nOracle\u2019s 2016 acquisition of NetSuite expanded Oracle\u2019s operations in cloud services. NetSuite was the first cloud company and was founded in 1998. NetSuite provided customers with a suite of software services to manage business operations and customer relationships.\n\nNetSuite provided products to over 40,000 companies in 100 countries. NetSuite was one of the biggest acquisitions ever made by Oracle, costing the company $9.3 billion, and giving its library of software a huge boost.\n\nOne of Oracle's most important and successful products is Java, which it acquired through its purchase of Sun Microsystems.\n\n6. PeopleSoft\n\nPeopleSoft provided numerous financial and business applications to address a range of business requirements. Oracle\u2019s hostile takeover of PeopleSoft in 2005 cost $10.3 billion.\n\nModules created by PeopleSoft included Human Capital Management, Financial Management, Supplier Relationship Management, Enterprise Service Automation, Supply Chain Management, and PeopleTools.\n\n7. Siebel Systems\n\nSiebel Systems specialized in customer relationship management solutions. After paying $5.85 billion in 2006, Oracle acquired its main competitor in the sales automation program industry.\n\nSiebel\u2019s customer relationship manager provided solutions to more than 20 industries and was integrated into Oracle\u2019s Customer Experience portfolio.\n\nFounder Thomas Siebel was an Oracle executive from 1984 to 1990 before founding Siebel Systems in 1993. Siebel itself continued to operate as a product under the Oracle branding.\n\n8. Sun Microsystems\n\nFounded in 1982, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle in 2010 for $7.4 billion and was utilized in the production of Oracle Optimized Systems.\n\nSun Microsystems helped develop a high-performance infrastructure for the Oracle Database, as well as the first Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud. Sun Microsystems\u2019s portfolio of software included Solaris, MySQL, and Java.\n\nHow Many Acquisitions Has Oracle Made? As of January 2025, Oracle has made 148 acquisitions in its lifetime. The acquisitions have been both large and small and have allowed Oracle to expand its presence in a variety of fields.\n\nDoes Oracle Make Hardware? Yes, Oracle makes hardware. Its hardware products include servers, storage, and engineered systems, with the goal of optimizing database performance at lower costs.\n\nWhat Is Oracle's Acquisition Strategy? Oracle's acquisition strategy seeks to acquire firms that enhance or expand its capabilities, with a focus on growing cloud services, improving software services, and broadening its customer base. Oracle focuses on companies that have complementary technologies, such as cloud infrastructure, data management, enterprise software, and artificial intelligence in order to make it more competitive in the technology marketplace.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOracle's growth and success have primarily been driven by its many acquisitions, enabling the company to expand its offerings and improve its software solutions. Key acquisitions, such as PeopleSoft, Cerner, and Sun Microsystems have allowed Oracle to dominate in cloud computing, enterprise software, and IT. Through its acquisitions, Oracle continues to adapt and innovate, making it one of the largest and most important technology companies.",

            "content": "One of Oracle's longest-serving senior team members, chief corporate architect Edward Screven, has announced plans to retire on a comfortable sum.\n\nScreven joined Oracle in 1986, famously leading the company's open source strategy since the 2009 buyout of Sun Microsystems, with which Big Red acquired development language Java and open source database MySQL.\n\nAccording to an official Oracle missive shared with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Screven handed in his notice on January 8, saying he intended to retire from Oracle by the end of February. It said he would assist in the transition of his duties until then. He is also set to continue serving on the Oracle board.\n\nReporting to executive chairman and chief technical officer Larry Ellison, Screven drives technology and architecture decisions across all Oracle products to ensure that product development is consistent with Big Red's overall strategy.\n\nAccording to an Oracle proxy statement [PDF], the exec owned 3.367 million shares in Oracle as of September last year, making him the fourth-largest individual shareholder after co-founder Ellison, CEO Safra Catz, and vice chairman Jeffrey Henley. Reports claim Screven made just under $21 million in 2024, including a $900,000 salary and around $17.4 million in stock awards. Oracle's annual revenue is around $53 billion.\n\nOracle's official blurb says Screven leads the teams that \"drive innovative product strategy, engineering, operations, sales, and technical support for a wide range of Oracle products.\"\n\n\"He is responsible for Oracle Labs, which identifies, explores, and transfers new technologies that have the potential to substantially improve Oracle's \u2013 and customers' \u2013 business. He's responsible for many of Oracle's best-known open source programs including Java, Oracle Linux, MySQL, and [hosted hypervisor] VirtualBox,\" it said.\n\nAn Oracle veteran, Screven is also in charge of the company's open source businesses, including Linux, virtualization, and MySQL. Screven leads company-wide strategic initiatives too, including industry standards and security.\n\nIn 2023, Screven and colleagues claimed IBM/Red Hat was trying to kill open source competition among Linux distributions to boost its bottom line, and pledged to keep distributing Oracle Linux source code for free.\n\nScreven was a defender of MySQL, saying in 2014 that the idea Oracle would kill the open source database was \"a very mysterious concept to us.\"\n\nUntil recent years, Oracle won praise for its custodianship of MySQL alongside its proprietary databases. But last year, critics said the latest release was underwhelming, and voiced fears that Oracle was becoming too focused on Heatwave, its proprietary analytics database built on MySQL, which Screven also heads up.\n\nScreven studied computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and, according to his corporate bio, continues to enjoy programming in his personal time. We figure he'll have plenty more time for that without the quarterly targets of the day job. \u00ae",

            "content": "DigitalOcean, Oracle, and Dell all look cheap relative to their growth potential.\n\nAmericans only have a median savings of $8,000 across all of their checking, money market, savings, call accounts, and prepaid debit cards, according to the Federal Reserve's latest numbers. That amount only covers cash and doesn't include any stocks, which are still only held by 62% of all American adults, according to a Gallup survey.\n\nIf you're one of those Americans who only has $8,000 in the bank but don't own any stocks, you might consider entering the market today to maximize your long-term gains. After all, the S&P 500 has delivered average annual total returns of more than 10% since its inception in 1957, and it could maintain that momentum for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut with the market now hovering near its all-time highs, investors might be reluctant to buy new stocks as many have high valuations. So today, I'll highlight three oft-overlooked tech stocks that still aren't too expensive relative to their long-term growth potential: DigitalOcean (DOCN 2.38%), Oracle (ORCL 1.09%), and Dell Technologies (DELL 3.48%).\n\n1. DigitalOcean\n\nDigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure company that serves up cheaper \"droplets\" of servers for small businesses and independent developers. That unique strategy helped it carve out a niche in a market that was dominated by enterprise-oriented cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, DigitalOcean's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28%. It also turned profitable in 2023. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 13% and 85%, respectively.\n\nAs DigitalOcean continued growing in the shadow of its larger cloud competitors, and it increased its exposure to the booming AI market by acquiring the start-up Paperspace in 2023 and adding its GPU-powered servers to its platform. It could have plenty of room to run as its niche market expands, but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nOracle is one of the world's largest database software companies. Over the past decade, it expanded its cloud-based infrastructure and software services to pivot away from its on-site applications. It also acquired a lot of companies -- including the cloud giant NetSuite and the healthcare IT leader Cerner -- to accelerate that evolution. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in May 2024), Oracle's revenue and EPS grew at a CAGR of 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nBut from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 12% and 21%, respectively. That acceleration will likely be driven by the generative AI market, which is driving more companies to run their AI workloads on its Gen 2 cloud infrastructure platform. Its stock isn't too expensive at 29 times forward earnings, and it's committed to returning a lot of its free cash flows to its investors through dividends and buybacks. Its forward dividend yield of 0.8% isn't too impressive, but it's bought back more than a third of its shares over the past decade.\n\n3. Dell\n\nDell was taken private back in 2013 after it \"di-worsified\" its business with too many messy acquisitions, but it returned to the public market as a more streamlined company in 2018. Today, it's still one of the world's largest producers of PCs and servers.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in February 2024), Dell's annual revenue actually declined. That drop was caused by its spin-off of Vmware in 2021 and a sluggish PC market. But from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise at a CAGR of 8% and 24%, respectively, as the PC market stabilizes and its AI server business expands.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Dell COO Jeff Clarke called AI a \"robust opportunity\" for the company with \"no signs of slowing down.\" So while Dell might be growing as rapidly as Nvidia or other more popular AI companies, it still looks like a dirt cheap play on that market at 12 times forward earnings. It also pays a forward yield of 1.3%.",

            "content": "Enabling retailers to energize their operations and in-store engagement, Oracle today unveiled the latest version of Xstore Point of Service. The cloud application has been redesigned on a new architecture and features an intuitive user interface and workflows that fuel efficiency and support connected retail journeys for retailers of all sizes. With it, associates can carry out day-to-day transactions and activities with ease with new dashboards that quickly surface customers past purchase history and worklists to guide next-step actions such as preparing \u2018Buy Online, Pick Up In Store\u2019 (BOPIS) orders.\n\nXstore is built on a new, containerized architecture supported by the best-in-class security and high performance of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and the data processing power and automation of Oracle Autonomous Database. These enhancements make it easier and more cost effective for retailers to deploy, update, and securely build new capabilities on top of the open, extensible Xstore platform.\n\nProviding highly flexible choices in deployment models, including public cloud, multicloud, on-premises, and now OCI Roving Edge Infrastructure, Xstore can be delivered as a fully mobile experience on iOS or Android-based tablets or other handheld options, as well as on a desktop.\n\n\u201cPoint of Service systems are at the epicenter of in-store operations, and Oracle just made Xstore, one of the world\u2019s most used and trusted retail POS platforms, even more functional and effective from its architecture through to its intuitive workflows,\u201d said Paul Woodward, Vice President of Retail Products, Oracle. \u201cNow, retailers have the agility and security to support evolving customer journeys, move inventory from anywhere, and adhere to regional requirements while delivering great experiences to both their customers and staff.\u201d\n\nThe redesigned Xstore is the latest innovation in the Oracle Retail Suite. With unified solutions, retailers can connect journeys from planning through to fulfillment to harmonize processes across their operations, delivering better insights, outcomes, and experiences for every user. Request a demo of the new Xstore at: https://www.oracle.com/retail/omnichannel/.\n\nConnecting journeys and jobs\n\nAs retail customer journeys expand, so do the responsibilities of retail staff. The new intuitive dashboards and workflows in Oracle Retail Xstore reflect this evolution and empower staff with the information they need to deliver more impactful, personalized customer interactions with minimal training. From anywhere in the store, associates can quickly pull up a customer\u2019s transaction history, as well as relevant offers and rewards, to suggest potential next purchases based on each customer\u2019s past preferences and complete transactions.\n\nIn tandem, associates can view inventory from across channels and arrange for items to be shipped or picked up at another store to help ensure a customer can get the item they came for while moving merchandise more effectively.\n\nWhen not supporting customers, associates are prompted with individualized dashboards that guide them on next-step actions such as a new order that needs to be prepped for shipping or in-store pick up or tasks such as managing price adjustments. The capabilities of Oracle Retail Xstore also extend to store managers who now have a holistic view into the fulfillment of orders, ensuring customers get the products they ordered in a timely manner.\n\nArchitected for innovation\n\nWith OCI and OCI Container Instances, retailers can speed implementations and updates as well as build and connect their own containerized apps into the Xstore platform without the cost or hassle of managing any servers. In addition to providing enhanced security and the ability to deploy containers across numerous cloud environments, this model provides accelerated performance that can handle the most demanding, high-throughput retail transaction requirements.\n\nIn addition, retailers operating in Wi-Fi constrained environments now have the option to leverage OCI Roving Edge Infrastructure to accelerate their Xstore deployment outside of a data center. These ruggedized devices deliver cloud computing, storage and AI/ML services at the edge of networks and in disconnected or inhibited locations, allowing faster processing and analysis closer to the data source.\n\nAlready successfully running in 95 countries, Xstore features out-of-the-box translation in 13 languages, localization formatting, support for multiple currencies, and additional functionality that help retailers to meet unique regional regulations and requirements to stay compliant.\n\nTo experience the new Xstore in action, join Oracle at NRF 2025 January 12-14 at booth #5838.

            "content": "A new test, developed by researchers from UCL Cancer Institute and the Francis Crick Institute, can better predict lung cancer survival at the point of diagnosis, which could inform treatment decisions and potentially reduce the risk of the cancer returning or spreading.\n\nIn research published in Nature Cancer, the team assessed the diagnostic test, called ORACLE, in 158 people with lung cancer as part of the Cancer Research UK-funded TRACERx study. They found that ORACLE, which looks at the genes expressed in a tumor, could better predict patient survival than currently used clinical standards like tumor stage.\n\nORACLE was developed in 2019 to overcome the lack of biological markers in lung cancer, which can indicate to doctors who might be at a greater risk of their cancer coming back or spreading to another part of the body.\n\nThis is particularly important for people with stage 1 lung cancer, who are normally given surgery without chemotherapy. For a quarter of stage 1 patients, their cancer returns, suggesting they may have benefitted from more frequent monitoring or chemotherapy.\n\nWhen doctors take a sample from a tumor, they typically only capture less than 1% of the tumor, and the genetics can vary massively from region to region within the same tumor. ORACLE overcomes this by looking at genes expressed at a high or low level in every part of the tumor.\n\nThe new findings show that ORACLE could predict which patients with stage 1 lung cancer had a lower chance of survival, and might benefit from chemotherapy as well as surgery. Currently used clinical standards weren't able to give this information for stage 1 patients.\n\nThe researchers also found that high ORACLE risk scores were linked to regions of the tumor that were more likely to spread to another part of the body.\n\nFinally, by looking at 359 current and potential lung cancer drugs, they found that a high ORACLE risk score predicted better response to some types of chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based drugs like cisplatin.\n\nThis is because tumor regions with high ORACLE scores are associated with unstable DNA (called 'chromosomal instability'), which is particularly targeted by platinum drugs. The same lab has recently found that changes in a key gene called FAT1 drives chromosomal instability, and is also one of the genetic variations ORACLE looks for.\n\nThe next steps for the researchers are to compare people with high ORACLE scores receiving standard care and those receiving more surveillance or chemotherapy to determine if the test improves survival, even for people diagnosed at the earliest stage.\n\nDr Dhruva Biswas, co-first author of the study from UCL Cancer Institute, the Crick and Yale School of Medicine, said: \"ORACLE can now predict survival rates in patients diagnosed at the earliest stage. If validated in larger cohorts of patients with lung cancer, doctors could one day use ORACLE to help make informed treatment decisions, bringing lessons from cancer evolution into the clinic.\"\n\nWe wanted to build on the previous work developing ORACLE and show that it can predict survival at the point of a lung cancer diagnosis. We've also shown that it can predict who would benefit from certain types of chemotherapy drugs or if someone's cancer is likely to spread, giving a holistic measure of how a patient's cancer might progress and respond.\" Ms. Yun-Hsin Liu, co-first author of the study from UCL Cancer Institute\n\nProfessor Charles Swanton, Chief Investigator of the CRUK TRACERx study from UCL Cancer Institute, the Crick and UCLH, said: \"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death throughout the world, so it's clear we need better markers to accurately classify tumors and predict who is at high risk. We're now working with the Translation team at the Crick and industry partners to progress ORACLE into a test which could hopefully be used in the clinic as soon as possible.\"",

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Oracle\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.57b US$11.6b US$16.1b US$23.6b US$31.2b US$37.1b US$42.3b US$46.7b US$50.6b US$53.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x18 Analyst x17 Analyst x11 Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Est @ 18.79% Est @ 13.94% Est @ 10.54% Est @ 8.16% Est @ 6.50% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$7.0k US$10.0k US$13.0k US$17.7k US$21.8k US$24.1k US$25.5k US$26.3k US$26.4k US$26.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$198b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

            "content": "In a viral video, Professor Wande Abimbola, former vice-chancellor of the University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University, and the Awise of Yorubaland \u2013 head of all Ifa oracle diviners \u2013 threw a bombshell. In it, he affirmed that the Oyo state government contacted him on the divination process leading to the nomination of a new Al\u00e1\u00e0fin of Oyo. Abimbola, who hails from Oyo town, would seem to have ignited a major earthquake which struck Yorubaland and its system of choosing kings. In its strike, the earthquake disembowelled dirt and stench and flung them in the face of the people. The shame hit a Yoruba people whose strength, from ancient times, had always been a reference to the purity and incorruptibility of their traditional system.\n\nAbimbola then claimed that the Oyo governor put a call to him and asked him to preside over Ifa oracle\u2019s choice of who would succeed Alaafin Lamidi Adeyemi, as it was done in \u00ecgb\u00e0 \u00ecw\u00e1s\u00e8 \u2013 the ancient times. \u201cI spent ten days seeking the face of If\u00e1 oracle and If\u00e1 made its choice,\u201d he said. Asked who If\u00e1 chose, the professor said it was Prince Owoade, the man announced by the Oyo government on Friday. He claimed that upon the If\u00e1 divinity\u2019s choice, the kingmakers sought to persuade him to change his mind over it through many subterfuges, but he refused.\n\nThe announcement on Friday of Prince Akeem Owoade as the Alaafin of Oyo-designate by the Oyo government was the trigger of the above. As celebrations and tempers hit the news, Abimbola also alleged that a fight ensued among the Oyo Mesi, the traditional kingmakers of Oyo, over the sharing of the huge sums of money collected from candidates for the office. Though they had collectively agreed to choose the candidate who gave them the hugest bribe, two of the kingmakers were said to have quarrelled over the amount of money collected by their head and the amount given them in turn. Oyo people were then said to have petitioned the government asking if it was aware of the deleterious influence and effect of bribery on the stool.\n\nThe Al\u00e1\u00e0fin, before the advent of the colonial lords, held powers that could only be curtailed and questioned by the 7-member Oyo Mesi, the council of kingmakers. The kings of Oyo were given cognomens which affirmed their mini-omnipotence like Ik\u00fa B\u00e0b\u00e1 Y\u00e8y\u00e9 and Al\u00e1se \u00e8kej\u00ec \u00f2r\u00ecs\u00e0, both of which considered them as vice-regents of Yoruba gods of creation on earth. Except when the kingmakers\u2019 institution intervened, the actions of the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin, either justified or otherwise, were unquestioned and unquestionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe role of the Oyo Mesi in the choice of Prince Owoade has become an issue lately. Immediately after the interment of Al\u00e1\u00e0fin Adeyemi in the traditional kings cemetery in Bara, the contest for succession to the throne of the foremost king in Yorubaland began. Made up of seven principal officers of the state, together, the kingmakers are the Electoral Council of the Oyo Kingdom and also imbued with legislative powers. Their head is the Bashorun, who also doubles as the prime minister. Other members of the Electoral Council are the \u00c0gb\u00e0akin, the S\u00e0m\u00f9, the Al\u00e1pinni, the L\u00e1g\u00f9n\u00e0, the Ak\u00ednik\u00fa, and the Ash\u00edpa. When there is a vacancy, the Bas\u00f2run is expected to consult the Ifa oracle for guidance and approval of who the next Al\u00e1\u00e0fin would be. In time past, it was believed that Oyo kings were chosen by the gods. However, the peremptory manner with which kings are chosen in Yorubaland and the fascination of kingmakers with money in the choices have given people a different opinion.\n\nIn October 2023, it was reported that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had quizzed the Oyo kingmakers over allegations that they took bribes from one of the candidates for the vacant stool. They were alleged to have received the sum of N15 million each from that candidate. The state government was said to have doubted the fairness of the Oyo Mesi on account of this allegation. It thus appointed warrant kingmakers to join two dissenting Oyo Mesi chiefs in the persons of \u00c0gb\u00e0akin and S\u00e0m\u00f9 of Oyo. This produced the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin-designate whose choice was made known on Friday\n\nSo many studies have been embarked upon on Yoruba if\u00e1 divination and its arts. The divination trays have also been subjected to sizeable studies. Professor Wande Abimbola, the most vociferous voice in defence of this inherited system of divination, has conducted so many studies on If\u00e1 and its place in Yoruba religion and the position of divination in Yoruba pantheon. In this wise, Abimbola has variously propounded and pursued the desirability of the use of If\u00e1 divination poetry and literature as sources of historical evidence, even in a modern age as ours. He theoretically and even practically focuses on If\u00e1 prose, poetry, mythology and divination. Indeed, many studies on the If\u00e1 corpus have submitted that with If\u00e1 divination, there is not only a religious implication but it is a means of communication between man and god among the Yoruba people. In fact, studies have posited that If\u00e1 divination has a cultural underpinning for the Yoruba people and is connected to \u00d2r\u00fanm\u00ecl\u00e0, a Yoruba deity whose teachings are used by kingmakers in the selection of kings in time past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the controversy continues on the process of picking the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin, abandoning the corpus of the seven traditional kingmakers to take a decision on the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin stool could be said not to be novel. It began during the reign of Oba Adeniran Adeyemi, father of the immediate past Al\u00e1\u00e0fin. A journey into history will seem to explain this. As it is today with the announcement of Prince Owoade as the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin-designate, immediately Prince Adeyemi was announced as successor to Al\u00e1\u00e0fin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu 11 in 1970, Oyo town and Western State of Nigeria quaked. The choice generated brickbats among the contending princes and their ruling houses. Upon the passing of Oba Ladigbolu, the Western State government had notified the Oyo Mesi to begin the selection of a new Oba.\n\nThe Oyo Mesi in turn contacted Baba Oranlola, also known as Baba Iwo, of the Alowolodu ruling house, to become the king. Oranlola then convoked a meeting of the ruling house wherein he informed them that he was nominating his son, Prince Sanda Ladepo Oranlola as Gbadegesin\u2019s successor. Though Baba Iwo got the buy-in of all members of the house for the nomination of his son, a key member of the house, Baba Salami Dudu voiced his dissent to the choice. He instead nominated Prince Adeyemi, whose father, Alaafin Adeyemi Adeniran 11, Gbadegesin\u2019s successor, died in exile upon his deposition by the Western Region government. The contention for the throne was so fierce that it threw other princes who were of other ruling houses, into the ring. Some of them included Prince Olanite Ajagba, Prince Afonja Ilaka, Aremo Sanni Gbadegesin and of course, Prince Oranlola. From whichever prism it may be looked at, Prince Adeyemi, the 31-year-old insurance magnate son of Oba Adeniran, was not going to be the successor to Oba Gbadegesin.\n\nMany scholars also held that the reason for Oba Adeniran\u2019s fall from grace to grass was his highly conservative disposition and his overly uncompromising attitude, in spite of his illiteracy. Five years after his coronation, specifically between September 13 and October 13, 1950, the king went ahead in the demonstration of his religious piety by embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca, even without the colonial authority\u2019s support. It was at a time when the District Officer, on August 5, 1950 described such pilgrimage as a \u201chaywire adventure\u201d. Oba Adeniran was also held to have distrusted Western region\u2019s educated elite, most of whom were Christians. Being a Muslim, he seemed to have been marooned by Christian administrators. The councillors of Oyo Province, which included Chief Bode Thomas, Mr. T. Akerele, Rev Gesinde and Rev Taiwo, were all Christians. Unlike other Obas of the Region, Oba Adeniran was neither a member of the Action Group nor of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) like his colleagues. The Ooni of Ife, Odemo of Ishara and the Oba of Benin openly flaunted their membership of politial parties. Oba Adeyemi however donated the sum of \u00a350 to the AG party fund. To rally round Oba Adeyemi, Muslims in Oyo formed the Oyo Parapo (Oyo Peoples Front) as a protective shield for him against the councillors. The symbol of their group was a lion and the crown.\n\nSo when Council Chair Bode Thomas cut Al\u00e1\u00e0fin Adeniran\u2019s allowance by \u00a3600 in 1952, the history of schism among Oyo Mesi, the kingmakers council, would seem to have begun. Thomas also removed the salary of Adeniran\u2019s heir apparent called the Aremo from the Council\u2019s expenditure and at the same time stopped the salaries of senior officials of the \u00c0\u00e0fin who performed judicial functions in the palace. So when Thomas visited the Aremo\u2019s compound on April 21, 1953, he met stiff resistance and a little skirmish. It was the beginning of the division among the Oyo Mesi, though theirs was not about filthy lucre, which culminated in what we see today on who becomes the 22nd Al\u00e1\u00e0fin of Oyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oyo Mesi\u2019s division came during the period of the 1953 to 1958 crisis, first on the basis of religion. The Basorun, chairman of the Oyo Mesi and the Baba Iyaji, the latter who originally was not a member of the Oyo Mesi but both being Christians, were the first to disconnect from Oba Adeniran. However, by March 1954, Oba Adeniran had got all members of Oyo Mesi back into his fold, excluding the Bas\u00f2run and Ash\u00edpa. The government then responded by appointing Baba Iyaji and other chiefs to constitute the Oyo Mesi, just as the Oyo government did in the nomination of Prince Owoade. A procession of 3000 Oyo sons and daughters, led by Balogun Aleelo, was immediately organised and stormed the resident\u2019s house. On September 5, 1954, Oyo Parapo members\u2019 protest stormed the homes of prominent ruling party chiefs in a riot which left seven people dead. The Lloyd Commission was then set up in 1955, which though exonerated Al\u00e1\u00e0fin Adeniran of complicity in the crisis, could not stop Oba Adeniran from being deposed and banished to Ilesa. He died in 1958.\n\nThe question that remains to be answered now is, did the framers of the unwritten constitution of Oyo Kingdom, especially its kingship electoral system, envisage that a day like this would come when the otherwise revered council, would be enmeshed in sordid allegation of colossal bribery to pick an Al\u00e1\u00e0fin? Is there fairness in the choice of an Al\u00e1\u00e0fin candidate whose nomination was ostensibly prompted by graft and bribery? Which of the nominations would be seen to be equitable, the one made via bribery or the one made through the Ifa oracle and government-nominated chiefs?\n\nA new Al\u00e1\u00e0fin must strive to imbibe many of the qualities of the late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. In contemporary Nigeria, though the powers of the throne may seem to have dwindled, the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin still symbolises the social and political will of his people. He is regarded as the supreme head of kings and princes in the Yoruba nation. This is why if a king who carries excessive personal foibles becomes the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin, his baggage will tell tremendously, not only on his immediate Oyo people, but on the Yoruba people as a whole. The immediate past occupier of that stool reified the myth and powers of the palace in the most regal manner.\n\nWithout compromise, Oba Adeyemi fought the late Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade to the hilt over the ascendancy and supremacy of his stool. The next Al\u00e1\u00e0fin must be sure of himself like Oba Adeyemi was. Except in very exceptional cases, Oba Adeyemi continued the myth of Al\u00e1\u00e0fin of yore who only came out three times in a year. Though he ran an open administration, anyone who attempted to cross the line, he didn\u2019t suffer their fools gladly. I know of a lawyer friend who, ostensibly exploiting his access to the palace, Oba Adeyemi told me, he kept waiting for almost a whole day, and who had to leave exasperated. \u201cMo fi Al\u00e1\u00e0fin h\u00e0n \u00e1n ni\u00ec\u201d (I showed him the colour of the palace), he told me on the symbolic implication of what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOba Adeyemi also saw Yorubaland as his constituency. In the build-up to the 2015 general election, Kabiyesi Adeyemi had complained severally to me on how the then governor of Oyo, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, was not requiting the sacrifices he made in backing him to be governor in 2011. It was common knowledge that Al\u00e1\u00e0fin and his side-partner, Alhaji Azeez Arisekola, fought then incumbent governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, to a standstill and were the major sponsors of Ajimobi to the governorship. So, in 2015, Kabiyesi was dilly-dallying on which of the pendulum he should swing. Goodluck Jonathan had made a foray into the palace and the Muhammadu Buhari phenomenon was catching up like a pestilence. So Kabiyesi rang me up. \u201cWe need to decide where we are going,\u201d he said urgently.\n\nAnd the second day, I was in the palace. Due to the horde of backbiters and evil permutators who surround power like ants do candy, I had to inform Governor Ajimobi about my movement. And he gave his consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the said day, Kabiyesi and I sat all alone. Anyone who called, he either ignored or told he needed the next one hour off. One of his daughters, a commissioner in the Ajimobi government, came in and he told her how engaged he was. Al\u00e1\u00e0fin then gave what sounded like a welcome speech which encapsulated the meat of the meeting. Where is the Yoruba going to queue in the impending movement: Jonathan or Buhari? he asked. Should he support Ajimobi for another term? So, I began a very long treatise about the place of the Al\u00e1\u00e0fin in the present Yoruba socio-political equation. The palace had to move with the tide of opinions in Yorubaland or the palace risked being swept off by the typhoon. If he doubted me, he should commission an opinion survey on where the mood of Yorubaland swung, I said. I also gave my opinion about Ajimobi\u2019s disposition to him. \u201cKabiyesi, not once, not twice, Governor Ajimobi tells whoever wanted to listen that \u2018Al\u00e1\u00e0fin ta\u00e1 t\u00e1n f\u00fan wa ni\u2026\u2019 \u2013 Al\u00e1\u00e0fin bit the bullet for me,\u201d (in 2011) I told Oba Adeyemi.\n\nHe thanked me profusely after that discussion. A few days after, Kabiyesi called to appreciate the candidness of my opinion and how where I suggested was where he would swing. In the 2019 election as well, Kabiyesi called to seek my opinion on where he would swing in the gubernatorial election in his state, though he later abandoned our agreed choice and chose his own path. He didn\u2019t seek my opinion on the presidency because he knew we were diametrically opposed on where to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new Al\u00e1\u00e0fin has been chosen. May his reign be long. But, no matter how long the reign is, what will matter ultimately is how well the fortunes of his people increased during his time. May the new Oba not be antagonistic to his Or\u00ed in\u00fa (his inner head).",

            "content": "It's Five Nights at Freddy's Again!\n\nDear Reader\n\nIt's your lucky day, you get access to my most recent market brief as sent to Patrons Sunday 12th.\n\nEarly 2025 stock market rally evaporates triggering much doom and gloom though the S&P is barely changed on the start of the year! We have got pretty much a repeat of a year ago i.e. Santa rally fail, first five days down, that got folk into a bit of panic as the likes of Hirsch had talked up his incoming Trifecta SELL Signal on a Down January which prompted me to do the following Five Nights at Freddy's article -\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/stock-market-at-96603286\n\nWhich concluded that it was all just noise and won't make any difference to the strong bull year that would be 2024, and the same holds true for 2025, it's just noise as President Pump is incoming, when he ramps up the money printers folk will start to FOMO into assets as the next inflation wave starts to take off. So as happened last year all of early January's gloom and doom resolved in the S&P ending the month up 1.6%. So I expect the current doom and gloom to also soon evaporate, 2024 climbed a wall of worry and so will 2025.\n\nWhat have I been doing?\n\nI've been buying the FEAR, buying the likes of AMD for as little as $115, this is how I perceived AMD at $115 - It's going to trade to over $150 pretty soon, probably within a month so I got opps to add some cheap that I can trim for a quick 30% profit! What else gives one 30% in a month! Instead some folk are at the opportunity\n\nThough it's been a bitter sweet buying opp because of sterling's 9% downtrend since it's September high, bitter in that the pound buys less AMD, sweet in that it's pushed up the value of my portfolio in sterling terms. Sterling's down trend is a reaction to Liebour trying to print debt to spend on consumption as well as hitting business with tax hikes, Liebour's learning a painful lesson of who really runs this country! The only thing the Labour government can do is to INFLATE, nothing else will work. The debt needs to be constantly inflated away hence get ready for the NEXT REAL INFLATION WAVE there is NO alternative! A sign of the times are oil stocks such as OXY starting to come alive. QE4EVER is resuming....\n\nBitcoin - $95k, trading in the middle of it's range of $100k to $90 ahead of an expected pump to over $120k.\n\nLA Fires - Global Warming - Worse to come hence US eyes on Canada and Greenland... Though why did so few stay to try save their homes instead of fleeing and expecting others to come along and put the fires out. The great irony is many of the celebs now crying because they lost their mansions not so long ago were tweeting to let Gaza burn, Kama's a biotch!\n\nMusk the Megalomaniac Oligarch\n\n\"Wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy.\" Aristotle 350BCE.\n\nIt never fails to impress how lemmings fawn over the likes of Musk as if he is going to save them the people, instead alls he seeks is the fastest route towards concentration of wealth and power into his own hands, he tried the left, too slow, so now he has become an advocate of the far right so to accelerate the transfer of wealth and power into his own hands as he plays the age old game of BUYING GREEDY POLITICIANS.\n\nMusk has bought his way into the White House for about $200 million that near immediately yielded more than $200 billion in profit for Musk as the Tesla stock price more than 2xd and now seeks to open doors for his Star link network to replace European internet sats starting with Italy.\n\nMusk bangs on about free speech but he only cares about his own speech as he peddles narratives aimed towards maximising personal gain whilst banning those who oppose him including former MAGA allies. By looks of it Musk does not only seek to become Dictator of Mars! As per the fictional novel written by Nazi rocket scientist Werner von Braun in 1952 about a Mars colony ruled over by the dictator named ELON!\n\nThe focus of my next article will be the INFLATION Mega-trend! As the next wave for a decade long waves of high inflation as a consequence of the governments debt fuelled money printing response to Scamdemic of 2020 is now starting to take off again. Apart from the S&P, stocks and AI I will also cover gold, silver and housing.\n\nYour buying the dips analyst.\n\nNadeem Walayat\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Nadeem_Walayat\n\nhttp://www.marketoracle.co.uk\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2025 Marketoracle.co.uk (Market Oracle Ltd).

            "content": "Hey guys! It\u2019s ya girl, Christydabull. I wanted to give you guys a post where I showcase my oracle skills for the collective, but I also wanted to just give you guys a post while I\u2019m attempting to finish the astrology post on my mind.\n\nI encourage you to listen to the VoiceOver/audio of this post because I feel as if i\u2019m very entertaining when I do oracle readings. + I just add more of my two cents in the audio.\n\n\n\nThis is a collective reading, so it\u2019s not personal to one person specifically. It\u2019s meant to reach those who feel called for a message, so let me know if I\u2019m hitting some points in your life. I want to do this monthly (if I remember to'; I do a lot throughout the day you guys. I say a month, but when I randomly decide to remember that I have obligations, it could be 2 months from now) Alright, lets get into the messages!!\n\nWhat To Know\n\nGood news!!! (I\u2019m referencing wicked here; go see it if you haven\u2019t) It seems like some of you are going to encounter some good news in the next month, however; it won\u2019t come without some trials and tribulations. The second card I received was compromise, so you\u2019re going to have to work with other people in their energies to make this good news come into fruition. This is timely, and you have a choice to dedicate yourself to this project, idea, creativity, whatever it is, you need to take the time to curate this. Nothing comes just because you want it to, you have to work for it. So yes, nothing beats failure but a try and you will receive a good outcome because of it, even if it does not pan out exactly how you want it to. This is a good feeling opportunity that can come to you, so take it while you can, embrace it, hold on to it, but understand that you need to be patient and understanding. These processes do take grit, and at times it doesn\u2019t feel easy, but don\u2019t deter yourself from the process. Just simply let it happen, feel the feelings you feel, and know that good will come out of it because you decided to put in the effort.\n\nWhat energy to channel\n\n\u201cIs somebody gonna match my freakkkkk? Is somebody gonna match my nasty?\u201d (First thing that came into my mind). Probably not, BUT, this is the chance to get this energy towards yourself. Forget that lover who is wishy washy, or if you\u2019re in a relationship forget that man for a second. Focus that energy back on you, and remember who the hell you are! Get in tune with your body and stare at yourself some more. Admire those curves, the way you smile, the way that outfit compliments you. Remind YOURSELF that you are that girl and no one can stop that girl from being that girl. What will help you is getting back in tune with the activities, the dreams, the mission you held when you were the younger version of yourself. I feel like it\u2019s an insane card combination off face value but I actually understand where it\u2019s hinting at. What were those insecurities you had as a child that has followed you to adulthood. Because he/she is screaming to be let out, but our adult brains are so stuck in the past not understanding that there is a future and there is patience, love, and understanding coming from all different avenues. The issue is, y\u2019all are too fixed and stuck in your ways! Go with the flow of things. The last message I literally said it\u2019s going to take time, so why get frustrated with yourself when you know it\u2019s not going to happen overnight? You have to rebuild yourself up to find that flow, and it becomes easier over time. Did someone make fun of you for your hair? Pay more attention to your hair and style it in the ways that make you excited. Fall in love with yourself again.\n\nAstrology Cards\n\nIt\u2019s actually funny how the astrology cards support what I\u2019m already telling you guys. The South Node represents the side of the moon where we are used to the experiences we have had. We already know what to do, the problem is is that we get stuck in the past and our past feelings surrounding these topics. When the situation comes back again, we think that we know how to handle it, but usually it reverts to us being quiet, shells of ourselves or too outrageous in our ways of handling it. We need to look at those past wounds to find a way to heal from them, in a manner that will satisfy us in the long term. With the Mars card coming out\u2026Mars has officially gone back into Cancer, which isn\u2019t the best experience for our friend Mars here. There\u2019s a lot of anger and passions that we\u2019ve held on for too long that need to come out. Now whether you go off the hinges or not is none of my business but it does need to come out, hopefully in a productive way. Those family wounds are relevant, but matter of fact those self sacrificing wounds are coming out. Why are you always the shoulder to cry on, but who are you crying on in return? Or, maybe it\u2019s an excess of it without you having a proper solution. It\u2019s time to do some soul searching before who lose your damn mind. Finally, the Sagittarius card calls you to be explorative with this phase in your life. It\u2019s time for you to question your surroundings, but not in the basic \u201cwhy?\u201d format, but \u201cHow? When? What? Where? Who?\u201d. There\u2019s deeper levels to this shit and you have to dig deep within yourself to understand it. What\u2019s on the horizon for you? That\u2019s for you to find out since i\u2019m talking to the collective. Maybe some travels are to be made? Maybe you have a special spot from your childhood that you need to return to? Whatever it is, I hope you find the answers you really need.\n\nDon\u2019t make me take out this roast deck if you ain\u2019t doing the work either. Yes, I have cards that will specifically tear you up. I\u2019m just here to help guide you towards the path you\u2019re seeking.\n\nI do oracle readings privately as well, here is a link to my site: https://beacons.ai/taurus_queen\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re pretty cheap, and i\u2019ll be getting all into your business if your energy allows me to. I\u2019m here to help, and god damnit, I\u2019m going to help you. Thank you all for reading and until next monthly (supposedly)\u2026\n\n- Christydabull",

            "content": "Oracle will not voluntarily release its trademark on the word \u201cJavaScript,\u201d according to a recent Mastodon post by Deno.\n\nDeno is an open source runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript and WebAssembly created by Ryan Dahl. Dahl also created Node.js, the JavaScript runtime environment.\n\nDeno filed a petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Oracle\u2019s trademark in November 2024. The filing contends that JavaScript is a generic, universal name for the programming language. Oracle neither controls nor has ever controlled the language\u2019s specifications or usage, according to Deno\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cNext: they\u2019ll file their Answer and we\u2019ll start discovery to show how \u2018JavaScript\u2019 is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle,\u201d the Mastodon post noted.\n\nDahl has also claimed that Oracle submitted fraudulent evidence to the USPTO when it renewed the JavaScript trademark in 2019.\n\nFinally, the petition is premised upon the claim that Oracle, which acquired the trademark through its 2009 purchase of Sun Microsystems, has effectively abandoned it through non-use, which can be grounds for losing a trademark.\n\nGoogle Releases Home APIs for Android Developers\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a weekend project, Google just released its Home APIs in a public developer beta for Android.\n\nAn iOS version will be available in the coming months, Google noted on its developer blog this week.\n\n\u201cDuring the public beta, developers can begin building and testing their apps with up to 100 users in preparation for the general availability launch of the Home APIs later this year,\u201d wrote Senior Engineering Director Matt Van Der Staay, who heads the Google Home Platform. \u201cWe\u2019ve built our Home APIs to help app and smart home developers bridge digital interactions and physical devices to deliver the next generation of delightful experiences.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to share that the Home APIs include:\n\nDevice and Structure APIs, which give you access to more than 600 million devices connected to Google Home and a single unified interface to manage and control both cloud-connected and Matter devices across Google Home;\n\nCommissioning API, which simplifies device set up with Fast Pair on 3 billion Android devices; and\n\nAutomation API, which gives users the tools needed to create and manage home automations directly within your app, \u201cleveraging extensive signals, commands, and\n\nGoogle-specific AI-driven capabilities for personalized and intelligent home experiences.\n\nEve, Nanoleaf and LG are among the Google partners that have launched experiences built on the Home APIs and offered via the Google Play store. Eve used it to create an autonomous heating schedule on Eve Thermo for their users. Nanoleaf used the Home APIs to give customers simple voice commands to turn on their Nanoleaf 4D screen mirroring light strip. LG used the APIs to integrate Google Home devices into their TV smart home offerings.\n\nNode to Support TypeScript by Default\n\nThe open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment Node.js will soon support TypeScript by default, without extra configuration, according to Total TypeScript blogger Matt Pocock.\n\nHe cites a recent pull request by Marco Ippolito and, in an update, notes that it seems Node will support this in version 23.6.0.\n\n\u201cMarco Ippolito, who has been driving TypeScript support in Node for the last year, landed a PR unflagging \u2013experimental-strip-types in Node 23,\u201d he wrote and then explained that on a practical level, that means developers can create an index.ts file containing TS syntax, like type annotations, and run node index.ts with no further flags.\n\n\u201cNode will strip out the types using a version of swc, then run the resulting code,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe adds that it\u2019s available now in the Node Nightly version.\n\nTRENDING STORIES",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stands against the other cloud computing stocks.\n\nCloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025.\n\nGartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends to Watch Out in 2025\n\nMoving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization.\n\nAI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks.\n\nFuture developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to. Next, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 10th January. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 32.6%\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) gives numerous businesses scalable and secure computing power, network capabilities, and storage. The company\u2019s cloud business was the key driver of its recent success in Q2 2025. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure demonstrated healthy growth, with revenues rising 52% YoY in constant currency. This growth stemmed from elevated demand for AI compute and the company\u2019s strategic investments in expanding its cloud capabilities. This fiscal year, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) expects total Oracle Cloud revenue to top $25 billion.\n\nAs of Q2 2025, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s remaining performance obligation (RPO) stands at ~$97 billion, reflecting growth of 50% YoY in constant currency. To give context, RPO refers to the total revenue amount the company expects to recognize in the future from contracted, not fulfilled, customer commitments. This reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger and longer contracts, believing that Oracle Cloud Services continue to benefit their businesses. Furthermore, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s cloud RPO grew ~80% and now represents ~3/4th of the total RPO. The company expects ~39% of the total RPO to be recognized as revenue in the upcoming 12 months and it continues to expect acceleration in growth of current RPO.\n\nThe company\u2019s partnership with AWS and its open multi-cloud strategy should aid Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s future growth. This approach enables the company to leverage AWS\u2019s extensive customer base while providing its own unique services and databases. The partnership is expected to potentially result in increased adoption of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s cloud services among enterprises already using AWS, further expanding Oracle\u2019s market reach.\n\nParnassus Investments, an investment management company, released the Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company\u2019s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.\u201d\n\nOverall ORCL ranks 3rd on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Now, with multi-cloud, we\u2019re faster than AWS in AWS and faster than Azure in Azure,\u201d said Kothanda Umamageswaran, Oracle SVP of Exadata and scale-out technologies.

It challenges these providers in their own ecosystems.\n\nCurrently, Oracle Exadata X11M is available on-premises, with Exadata Database Service, Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and in multi-cloud setups including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with AIM, Ashish Ray, Oracle\u2019s VP of mission-critical database technologies, revealed that their customer base largely consists of on-premises clients, followed by those using Oracle Cloud, with multi-cloud customers ranking next.\n\n\u201cThe Google and AWS announcements are fairly recent, so naturally, this multi-cloud play is not at the same scale as our current on-premises and Oracle Cloud offerings,\u201d Ray said. However, the company anticipates significant growth in this multi-cloud initiative, including Azure, with the hope that clients using other platforms will move to its high-performance database.\n\n\u201cThe walled gardens have come down, and business productivity has become much more transparent. There are no bottlenecks, no setbacks, and now the choice is back to the customers,\u201d said Ray.\n\nHe described India as a data-driven market experiencing explosive growth, fuelled by the digital modernisation of businesses\u2014from large enterprises to a vibrant startup ecosystem. Ray expects that in India, Exadata X11 will act as a catalyst for further business innovation and IT modernisation.\n\nFurthermore, he added that migrating to Exadata X11M provides better value for businesses. \u201cWith Exadata X11M, companies can handle more workloads with fewer servers, which helps reduce costs related to data centres, power usage, space, and cooling, especially for those using on-premises setups.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Umamageswaran notes that companies requiring access to vast amounts of data from multiple sources and data types, say, graph, spatial, documents, transactional, and analytical data, will benefit from Oracle Databases 23ai on Exadata X11M.\n\nThe company claims that Exadata handles transactions in microseconds and also supports real-time analytics like anti-money laundering (AML) checks that must occur simultaneously with the transaction process.\n\nDatabase Competition Galore\n\nThe catch with Oracle Exadata is that it is only compatible with Oracle databases such as Oracle Database 23ai. But today, customers are experimenting with different database platforms such as Amazon Aurora, Cosmos DB, Google Spanner, MongoDB, CockroachDB, and many more.\n\n\u201cThere will always be individual data management solutions, whether it\u2019s PostgreSQL, Aurora, Redshift, or Cosmos DB,\u201d Ray added.\n\nMuch like Oracle, CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database designed for scalability, consistency, and resilience. It combines the best features of traditional relational databases with the advantages of modern distributed systems.\n\nSpencer Kimball, CEO of Cockroach Labs, in the latest episode of Tech Talks at AIM, critiqued the dependence on cloud vendors like AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle for databases, emphasising the limitations of vendor lock-in. He stated:\n\n\u201cWith CockroachDB, we let customers run across clouds, in private data centers, or both. You can even turn off a cloud vendor entirely and keep running without downtime. That\u2019s true freedom, and it\u2019s what enterprises need today.\u201d\n\nTo this, Ray said: \u201cA lot of these companies tend to be SQL-compatible. We do have customers who run CockroachDB and PostgreSQL,\u201d adding that the scale at which Oracle Database runs and supports large enterprises across the entire globe is absolutely unheard of. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see a lot of multi-cloud interest from the cloud hyperscalers,\u201d he added.\n\nFrom a generative AI perspective, he highlighted that Exadata significantly accelerates tasks like vector processing, index creation, and querying.\n\nHowever, he did acknowledge the growing popularity of PostgreSQL due to its open-source nature. Oracle Database doesn\u2019t directly support PostgreSQL, but Oracle offers a service called OCI Database with PostgreSQL. This service lets users use PostgreSQL in the Oracle Cloud, giving them PostgreSQL features along with Oracle\u2019s cloud benefits.\n\nAMD is EPYC: Oracle launched Exadata in 2008. Ray explained that while the Oracle Exadata X9M was based on Intel processors, the new Exadata X11M uses AMD EPYC processors. \u201cThe reason for moving to AMD was that it was just available with numbers that can drive a lot of parallel throughput for database workloads,\u201d said Ray.\n\nInterestingly, NVIDIA also recently partnered with AMD. AMD\u2019s EPYC CPUs are critical in powering NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs for large-scale AI workloads. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown a 20% improvement in training and a 15% improvement in inference when connecting EPYC CPUs to NVIDIA\u2019s H100 GPUs,\u201d said Ravi Kuppuswamy, senior vice president & general manager at AMD.",

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nThe market ended the week on a somber note as the economy once again took center stage. Investors were digesting a surprisingly robust jobs report that highlighted the Federal Reserve's ongoing battle with inflation, the potential for future interest rate cuts, and what it means for the overall economy. To add insult to injury, a decision by the Biden administration regarding advanced semiconductors used for artificial intelligence (AI) sent a ripple through the semiconductor industry.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, database and AI chipmaker Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) dropped 4.4%, chip architect Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) tumbled 3.4%, and semiconductor specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 2.8% as of 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- revealed no company-specific news to explain the swoon. This suggests the economy and developments in the semiconductor industry stole the spotlight.\n\nA tightrope walk\n\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis during the month of December, which far outpaced economists' forecasts of 153,000.\n\nThis report highlights not only the incredible resilience of the job market, but the difficult tightrope walk the Fed faces between curbing inflation and cutting interest rates. In normal circumstances, a strong job market is a good thing, but red-hot growth continues to keep inflation elevated. Wall Street and Main Street alike are eager for rates to come down, but the data makes it unlikely the Fed will be able to lower rates any further until it gets a handle on inflation.\n\nFed officials are scheduled to meet later this month to discuss the issue, but the chances of a rate cut are slim, with the likelihood now standing at just 2.7%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nFurther exacerbating matters in the chip industry, the Biden administration is set to introduce another wave of export restrictions related to high-performance and AI-centric processors, a move aimed at keeping this advanced technology away from U.S. adversaries, including China and Russia.\n\nThis plan involves a three-tiered system that would allow sales of these chips to U.S. allies, while sales to many other countries would be strictly regulated. Countries in the final tier would be ineligible to buy these advanced processors at all. This will mark the third round of such restrictions, designed to keep third-party countries from acting as go-betweens and bypassing U.S. export restrictions.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad, as Broadcom earned a couple of price target increases. Analysts at Mizuho increased their price target to $260, while Goldman Sachs boosted its price target to $255. This would represent potential upside for investors of 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to Wednesday's closing price. Unfortunately, the bullish sentiment for Broadcom wasn't enough to overcome the market's otherwise dour mood.\n\nTaking a step back\n\nThis marks something of a one-two punch for our AI stocks. Wall Street is eager to see interest rates come down, as this will likely spur borrowing and capital investment among businesses -- which will likely include investment in AI. Furthermore, any restrictions impacting the semiconductor industry will likely weigh on the overall adoption of AI, ultimately impacting these key players:\n\nBroadcom provides many of the semiconductors and supplemental technology used in data centers and cloud computing, where much of AI processing occurs.\n\nArm Holdings creates and licenses many of the designs for high-end processors that are integrated into larger and more complex semiconductors and AI chips.\n\nOracle is a provider of database and cloud infrastructure services, but it also designs and engineers AI chips.\n\nOn the subject of valuation, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Arm, Broadcom, and Oracle are currently selling for 90 times, 35 times, and 27 times forward earnings, respectively, which suggests that Oracle is the best bargain.\n\nHowever, the most widely used valuation metrics tend to fall short when measuring high-growth stocks. Applying the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which takes into account their accelerating growth rates, Oracle, Arm, and Broadcom sport multiples of 0.38, 0.21, and 0.09, each below the threshold of 1, which is the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nToday's downturn aside, AI is expected to continue to grow rapidly. The technology is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to Big Four accounting firm PwC. This illustrates the magnitude of the opportunity in the coming years.\n\nIf our trio of AI companies can command even a small part of that windfall, today's declines will be a drop in the bucket -- despite the day-to-day volatility. That helps illustrate why investors should focus on the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

Getty Images\n\nKey Takeaways The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Friday in TikTok\u2019s appeal against a law requiring its private Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its TikTok holdings by or face a U.S. ban Jan. 19, and several justices cast doubt on the legitimacy of TikTok\u2019s argument.\n\n\n\nIn an otherwise down day for U.S. stocks \u2013 the S&P 500 fell more than 1.5% to a two-month low and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6% \u2013 two of the biggest stock gainers were a pair of American social media companies behind other short-form video platforms in Snapchat parent Snap, which owns TikTok competitor Spotlight, and Meta, which operates TikTok rival Instagram Reels.\n\n\n\nSnap stock gained 4% by close, notching its highest intraday share price since Aug. 1, while shares of the much larger Meta rallied 1%.\n\n\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet, which owns YouTube Shorts, were less affected by the TikTok hearing, dropping 1.1%, though that was a slimmer loss than the at least 1.4% losses experienced by stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, the world\u2019s only other $2 trillion companies.\n\nBig Number\n\n$1.5 billion. That\u2019s how much richer Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg got thanks to Friday\u2019s rally, the biggest daily jump of any American billionaire, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time net worth tracker.\n\nContra\n\nFriday was a rough day for perhaps TikTok\u2019s most notable American collaborator, software giant Oracle, whose stock tanked 5%, the worst daily loss of any of the U.S.\u2019 40 mega-cap companies worth at least $200 billion. Shares of Oracle hit their lowest price since early September. Oracle, which hosts the U.S. data of TikTok, cautioned in July its earnings would take a hit if TikTok got banned. Oracle\u2019s cofounder and chairman, Larry Ellison, was the biggest billionaire loser Friday, as his net worth tanked $10 billion.\n\nTangent\n\nBetting markets have moved heavily in favor of a TikTok ban: The odds of a TikTok ban by May have jumped from 30% to 70% over the last week on the blockchain-based site Polymarket.\n\nKey Background\n\nMeta and Oracle\u2019s opposite fortunes widened the net worth gap between Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, and Ellison, the fourth-wealthiest, to nearly $20 billion, just two days after Zuckerberg\u2019s riches surpassed Ellison\u2019s. ByteDance last fetched a $220 billion valuation in a 2023 funding round and valued itself internally at $300 billion in November, according to Reuters, which would make it the world\u2019s second-most valuable private company, trailing only SpaceX, which valued itself at $350 billion in an internal share sale last month, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThis article was originally published on forbes.com and all figures are in USD.\n\nLook back on the week that was with hand-picked articles from Australia and around the world.

            "content": "The ORACLE test may be capable of predicting lung cancer survival at the point of diagnosis more effectively than currently used clinical risk factors, according to a recent study published by Biswas et al in Nature Cancer. The findings could help physicians make more informed treatment decisions for patients with stage I lung cancer and reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis.\n\nBackground\n\nThe ORACLE test was developed in 2019 to overcome the lack of biological markers in lung cancer, which can indicate to physicians who might be at a greater risk of cancer recurrence or metastasis.\n\nAbout 25% of patients with stage I lung cancer\u2014who normally undergo surgery without chemotherapy\u2014experience cancer recurrence, suggesting they may have benefitted from more frequent monitoring or chemotherapy.\n\nWhen physicians take a sample from a tumor, they typically only capture less than 1% of the tumor, and the genetics can vary from region to region within the same tumor. The ORACLE test was designed to overcome these shortcomings by assessing genes expressed at a high or low level in every part in the tumor.\n\n\u201cLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death throughout the world, so it\u2019s clear we need better markers to accurately classify tumors and predict who is at high risk. We\u2019re now working with the Translation team at the [Francis] Crick [Institute] and industry partners to progress ORACLE into a test which could hopefully be used in the clinic as soon as possible,\u201d underscored co\u2013senior study author Charles Swanton, FRCP, BSc, PhD, Deputy Clinical Director and Head of the Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, Chair in Personalised Cancer Medicine at the UCL Cancer Institute, a medical oncologist at University College London Hospitals, and chief investigator for TRACERx.\n\nStudy Methods and Results\n\nIn the study, researchers examined the efficacy of the ORACLE test in 158 patients with lung cancer as part of the Cancer Research UK\u2013funded TRACERx study.\n\nCompared with currently used clinical standards such as tumor stage, the researchers found that the ORACLE test could better predict patient survival. The researchers demonstrated that the ORACLE test could predict which patients with stage I lung cancer had a lower chance of survival and may benefit from chemotherapy as well as surgery. Currently used clinical standards weren\u2019t able to provide this information for this patient population.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build on the previous work developing ORACLE and show that it can predict survival at the point of a lung cancer diagnosis. We\u2019ve also shown that it can predict who would benefit from certain types of chemotherapy drugs or if someone\u2019s cancer is likely to spread, giving a holistic measure of how a patient\u2019s cancer might progress and respond,\u201d explained co\u2013lead study author Yun-Hsin Liu, a research assistant at the UCL Cancer Institute.\n\nThe researchers revealed that high ORACLE test risk scores were linked to regions of the tumor that were more likely to spread to another part of the body. By evaluating 359 current and potential lung cancer drugs, the researchers found that a high ORACLE test risk score predicted greater response to some types of chemotherapy, particularly platinum drugs like cisplatin. They noted that tumor regions with high ORACLE test scores were associated with unstable DNA, known as chromosomal instability, which is particularly targeted by platinum drugs. Separate research has indicated that changes in the FAT1 gene may drive chromosomal instability, which is one of the genetic variations the ORACLE test searchers for.\n\nConclusions\n\n\u201cORACLE can now predict survival rates in patients diagnosed at the earliest stage. If validated in larger cohorts of patients with lung cancer, [physicians] could one day use ORACLE to help make informed treatment decisions, bringing lessons from cancer evolution into the clinic,\u201d highlighted co\u2013lead study author Dhruva Biswas, MD, PhD, a translation fellow at the Francis Crick Institute, a postdoctoral fellow at the UCL Cancer Institute, and an associate research scientist at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe researchers plan to compare patients with high ORACLE test scores receiving standard care with those receiving more surveillance or chemotherapy to determine if the test improves survival, even among those diagnosed at the earliest stage.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step forward, translating our understanding of the infinite complexities of lung cancer mutation into a diagnostic tool, prioritizing patients for the most effective therapies. We look forward to working with partners to take this work forward and maximize patient benefit from ORACLE,\u201d added Paul Mercer, BSc, PhD, Head of Industry Partnerships in the Crick Translation team.\n\n\u201cAlthough survival for lung cancer has improved since the 1970s, it\u2019s still one of the most challenging cancers to treat,\u201d underlined Dani Edmunds, PhD, Science Engagement Manager at Cancer Research UK. \u201cNew tests to predict lung cancer\u2019s behavior could help [physicians] tailor treatment strategies to each [patient\u2019s] condition, giving the best chance of a successful outcome. This research reflects Cancer Research UK\u2019s commitment to tackle this hard-to-treat cancer. While ORACLE still needs testing in larger-scale trials, these initial results show it could take us a step closer to more personalized approaches to treating lung cancer, so more [patients] live longer, better lives,\u201d she concluded.\n\nDisclosure: The research in this study was supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research UCLH Biomedical Research Centre.

Apple hit the most significant milestone to date when its valuation crossed $1 trillion for the first time in 2018, thanks to the success of devices like the iPhone.\n\nApple is still the world's largest company, with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion. But since 2018, seven other American technology companies have joined it in the trillion-dollar club: Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom.\n\nI think one more company is set to earn its membership in this club within the next four years. Some of the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) developers in the world are lining up to rent Oracle's (ORCL 1.09%) industry-leading data center infrastructure, and this part of its business could grow more than tenfold, according to management's guidance.\n\nOracle's market cap is $463 billion as of this writing, so if it does join the $1 trillion club in four years, as I predict, investors who buy its stock today could earn a very nice return of 116%.\n\nOracle's data centers are hot property right now\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers. That involves filling them with thousands of graphics processors (GPUs), which are specialized chips designed to ingest and process mountains of data for AI workloads.\n\nNvidia supplies the most powerful GPUs in the industry. And Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) supercluster technology enables developers to scale up to 65,000 of Nvidia's H200 GPUs, which is the highest number in the industry. To put it simply, access to more chips can enable developers to build and deploy larger models, which translates into \"smarter\" AI software.\n\nOCI's random direct memory access (RDMA) technology also allows data to flow from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. And since most developers rent computing capacity by the minute, faster processing can equal major cost savings.\n\nDuring its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), Oracle said GPU use climbed by 336% compared to the same period in fiscal 2024, which speaks to how quickly demand is ramping up. So far, OCI's infrastructure has attracted top AI start-ups like Cohere, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nOracle currently operates 98 data center regions and plans to grow that footprint by more than tenfold to somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 locations over time. The company's OCI will soon offer new clusters featuring over 131,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs, which will pave the way for the most advanced AI applications yet, and potentially drive a new wave of demand.\n\nOCI is Oracle's fastest growing business\n\nOracle generated $14.1 billion in total revenue during the second quarter, but the OCI segment was responsible for just $2.4 billion of that total, so it isn't a massive contributor yet.\n\nIt's still smaller than Oracle's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, which generated $3.5 billion in revenue during the quarter. It offers ready-made cloud applications to help businesses across dozens of industries manage everything from their inventory to their payroll.\n\nHowever, OCI is consistently the star performer when it comes to growth. While SaaS revenue grew by 10% year over year during the second quarter, OCI revenue soared by 52%. It was the fastest growth in a year, and it marked the second consecutive quarter of acceleration.\n\nOCI revenue would have grown even faster if Oracle had more data center capacity available, but it's still struggling to meet demand even though it's building infrastructure as quickly as possible.\n\nThat demand can be seen in Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPOs), which soared by 50% during the second quarter to $97 billion. RPOs typically convert into revenue at a future date once the company can deliver the agreed-upon services -- i.e., OCI revenue could surge once it can bring more data centers on line based on the deals it has already locked in.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz predicts RPOs will grow even higher from here because of the sheer volume of deals the company is signing, including a major one with Meta Platforms recently. Meta developed the world's most popular open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which have been downloaded over 600 million times, and the company will shift some of its training workloads over to Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nOracle has a realistic pathway to the $1 trillion club\n\nOracle stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40.5, which is a slight premium to the average P/E of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet (36.7). They are three of the biggest operators of AI data center infrastructure besides Oracle:\n\nBut Oracle stock looks much more attractive when we measure its value based on its potential earnings. For example, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo!) suggests the company's earnings per share (EPS) will grow by 14.4% to $7.05 during its fiscal year 2026 (which starts in June of this calendar year). That places its stock at a forward P/E of just 23.5.\n\nMathematically speaking, Oracle stock would have to soar by 72.3% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E of 40.5, which would value the company at almost $800 billion. If it grows its EPS by 14.4% again in fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2028 while maintaining the same P/E, it will be a $1.04 trillion company.\n\nEven if its P/E settles at 36.7, its valuation would still be around $950 billion.\n\nBut Oracle's earnings actually grew by 22% in the first half of fiscal 2025, and I think that pace is likely to persist (and maybe even accelerate), suggesting Wall Street might be too conservative. Remember: The company plans to grow its data center footprint more than tenfold. And its infrastructure is unique because it's fully automated, meaning it should become significantly more profitable at scale.\n\nIn fact, during the last couple of quarterly conference calls with investors, Catz talked about how the gross profit margin of the infrastructure business is climbing as more data centers come on line. If Oracle grows its earnings by 22% annually instead of 14% through fiscal 2028, it will be a shoo-in to join the $1 trillion club even if its P/E drops to around 34.",

            "content": "Transaction processing against relational databases may not be the focus of the datacenter, as it was when IBM created the first relational database and Oracle was founded to compete against it in the late 1970s. But transaction processing \u2013 counting the money that passes between customers and the companies that serve them \u2013 is still the backbone of the economy.\n\nThe funny thing is that IBM and Oracle are the two remaining companies that create co-designed hardware/software systems that accelerate the performance of databases while at the same time providing rock-solid reliability and the scalability that the Global 5000 require and that several hundred thousand smaller enterprise customers also value.\n\nThis week, Oracle has tweaked its Oracle Exadata database machines, providing them with more oomph and lower latency for database compute servers and flash storage servers that together run the eponymous Oracle database management systems. The Exadata X11M update, which is the thirteenth version of the Oracle engineered systems for running database workloads, comes pretty hot on the heels of the Exadata X10M machines that came out in the summer of 2023 and, significantly, represented a shift away from Intel Xeon processors in the database and storage servers and towards AMD Epyc processors.\n\nOracle has been engineering database systems for large-scale relational databases for a long time, and it is still interesting to take a look at how the architecture of these machines changes over time to meet increasing demands for speed and capacity. And with the Exadata X11M machines, it is also interesting to contemplate how AI is being woven into applications and embedded into the database compute and storage engines, and what it takes \u2013 and what it does not take \u2013 to add this functionality.\n\n(Hint: It does not take a GPU to add AI functions, but it does take a healthy amount of vector processing.)\n\nLarry Sings The NUMA NUMA Song\n\nJust as the Great Recession was getting underway in 2007, Oracle started quietly shipping the custom designed, first generation Exadata X1 database appliances to selected customers who were looking for ways to cut their spending on big NUMA servers from Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to run giant relational databases. These Exadata X1 machines were formally announced in partnership with HPE\u2019s ProLiant X86 server division, and incorporate InfiniBand networks to link database compute engines to each other for scaling up a database as well as to flash-based storage servers that ran the underlying storage engine for the Oracle database. The Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) feature of InfiniBand, which gives this interconnect its low latency and which made InfiniBand a preferred network for HPC clusters, was a key component of the Exadata appliances.\n\nA year later, Oracle launched its $7.4 billion bid to acquire Sun Microsystems, and in January 2010, that deal closed and Oracle co-founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison (who was previously also its chief executive officer for decades) set about using Sun gear to create Exadata X86 database systems as well as variants based on Sun\u2019s Sparc processors. (The last we saw of Exadata-like Sparc clusters, which still employed X86-based storage servers, was in the summer of 2016 with the Sparc S7 systems.) We covered the Exadata X6 machines in April 2016 during the early years of The Next Platform, and took a look at the Exadata X9 machines in October 2021.\n\nColumnar data compression and processing was invented for the Exadata V1 appliances way back in 2007, which allows for data analytics to be run on relational databases orders of magnitude faster and for databases to be compressed into smaller and faster flash storage servers for accelerated scanning of data. Breaking the computational tasks of running a database management system from the SQL processing against data stored in the underlying database storage engine is what gives Exadata system both scale up (running larger databases) and scale out (running SQL queries faster).\n\nThe Exadata architecture looks obvious in hindsight, as all good technologies do, and it has been a boon for Oracle as it took on rival database makers and high-end system makers who have carved out their stakes in large scale enterprise computing. By 2016, Oracle had over 5,000 customers using its engineered systems, and while it no longer releases statistics on these systems, we have no trouble believing that it has many tens of thousands of customers using these machines, not only in on-premises datacenters but on the major clouds. Oracle not only has Exadata iron installed on its own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure cloud, but has convinced Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to take its custom iron into their datacenters and rent time out on them as a service. These companies like to build their own iron, and it is a true exception when they are willing to invest in outside iron to try to capture workloads.\n\nIn a sense, the fact that big clouds will install and operate Exadata iron on behalf of customers is a testament to how these machines are built specifically to run Oracle databases and, even more accurately, how the most recent Oracle database releases are tweaked to make use of features in the Exadata systems and tuned for their very specific architecture.\n\nThe Exadata V1 machine from September 2008 was really for data warehouses and for fast scanning of information. With the Exadata V2 machines, Oracle added flash-based storage servers to the architecture and offloaded portions of the SQL processing to these storage servers while at the same time having optimizations for handling random reads and writes to the Oracle database on a combination of database and storage servers that makes Exadata V2 suitable for online transaction processing as well as data warehousing.\n\nA decade and a half ago, a rack of Exadata V2 iron had 64 X86 cores with 576 GB of main memory across eight database servers and fourteen storage servers; the CPU of choice was Intel\u2019s \u201cNehalem\u201d quad-core Xeon 5500. The Exadata V2 had 40 Gb/sec InfiniBand links hooking the database servers to each other and to storage servers, and the latter sported a combined 336 TB of raw storage for databases and 5.3 TB of flash for an acceleration tier. Such a rack ran $1.15 million, and that was minus the Oracle database server software but with a base Oracle Linux operating system.\n\nThis was big iron at the time. But the iron is ridiculously bigger today, and has grown a lot faster in capacity than the cost has.\n\nHere in early 2025, a rack of Exadata X11M machinery can have from two to fifteen database servers per rack and from three to seventeen storage servers per rack, allowing flexibility in the configuration to address different levels of compute and storage for Oracle databases. An Exadata X11M rack can have up to 2,880 AMD \u201cTurin\u201d cores and up to 42 TB of memory for database processing or up to 1,088 Turin cores and 21.3 TB of RDMA-addressable memory in the storage servers for dedicated SQL processing. Oracle is using a pair of 96-core Turin Epyc 9J25 processors in the plain-vanilla database server and a single 32-core Epyc 9J15 processor in the Z variant aimed at lighter workloads. The plain vanilla storage server has a pair of these Epyc 9J15 processors, and a lightweight Z version has only one. All of these processors run at a base 2.95 GHz and are custom to Oracle.\n\nExadata X11M customers can have up to 462.4 TB of performance-optimized flash or up to 2 PB of capacity-optimized flash per rack, and up to 4.4 PB of disk capacity if latency is not an issue and capacity is. Obviously, customers can mix and match the levels of each of these compute and storage components within the database and storage tiers. No matter the configuration of database and storage nodes, they are all connected by a two-rail, active-active Ethernet RDMA fabric that runs at 100 Gb/sec. Up to fourteen racks of Exadata iron can be interlinked into a giant database cluster with the existing switch fabrics in the racks. If you want larger configurations, you can add another tier of Ethernet switching and push it further.\n\nEach storage server in the Exadata X11M providers up to 8.5 TB/sec of I/O bandwidth per rack for SQL operations and up to 25.2 million 8 KB database read I/O operations per second (IOPS) and up to 13 million 8 KB write IOPS per rack.\n\nHere are some of the feeds and speeds of the individual Exadata X11M servers:\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about money. With the same configuration of eight database servers (the plain vanilla ones, not the Z variants with low core counts), with 3 TB of capacity per database server, it is $1.78 million for that part of the Exadata cluster. Those eight database nodes have a combined 1,536 X86 cores (which are each probably 2X as fast as the Nehalem cores from 2009) and 24 TB of main memory.\n\nIf you use seven Extreme Flash storage nodes (with the skinny flash cards) and add eight High Capacity storage nodes (with a mix of disk and flash), that gives you 2.1 PB of disk and 408 TB of flash storage for an additional $1.18 million.\n\nAdd it all up, and that is a total of $2.96 million for a balanced Exadata X11M rack.\n\nSo, compared to the Exadata V2 from 2009, a rack of Exadata X11M has 24X the number of cores in the database servers and probably on the order of 48X more performance, with 76.8X the total main memory capacity across the database and storage servers, somewhere on the order of 7.5X the disk and flash capacity, for 2.6X the cost.\n\nThe lesson here is that adding compute is cheaper than adding storage, and that is convenient when the amount of vector math is going up thanks to AI for database operations and their applications. Vector search, which is running on the vector units in the Turin processors, can be offloaded to the storage servers and automatically parallelized across them. Like this:\n\nThanks to that extra Turin vector oomph compared to the 96-core \u201cGenoa\u201d Epyc processors used in the prior Exadata X10M, vector search on the database servers in the Exadata X11M are 43 percent faster for in-memory vector index queries and on the storage servers are 55 percent faster for persistent vector index queries. The X11M machines can push 25 percent more transactions and thanks to faster 6.4 GHz DDR5 memory can deliver 43 percent faster data reads out of the flash for OLTP workloads.\n\nInterestingly, according to Ashish Ray, vice president of products for Exadata, database cloud services, and multicloud at Oracle, pricing on the Exadata X11M machines is the same as on the prior generation of X10M machines that debuted in June 2023.\n\nThe two things you do not see in the Exadata X11M machines are faster Ethernet RDMA networks or GPUs from Nvidia or AMD.\n\nRay says that getting lower latency in the Ethernet network is much more important for a distributed database/storage server architecture than pushing up the bandwidth to 200 Gb/sec, 400 Gb/sec, or 800 Gb/sec on the ports in the interconnect. Here is a good example.\n\nThe Exadata X8M and X9M platforms used Intel\u2019s Optane 3D XPoint memory as a fast cache tier in the storage servers, but with Intel spiking that product a few years back, Oracle created XRMEM memory cache, which takes a partition of main memory in the storage servers and links it to the database servers over RDMA links. On the X10M machines, the link from the database server to this XRMEM on the storage server had a 17 microsecond hop. By tweaking the microcode and network stack in the X11M stack, Oracle has been able to get that down to 14 microseconds, which is a 21 percent improvement in 8 KB I/O into the database server and which will boost overall throughput. All without requiring more expensive networking.\n\nDespite the many ways that GPUs have been used to accelerate processing on columnar data \u2013 think Heavy.AI (formerly MapD and OmniSci), Kinetica, and SQream \u2013 Ray says that thus far this has been unnecessary to boost the performance of the OLTP and analytics workloads that Oracle customers run on their databases.\n\n\u201cA lot of the AI processing that happens in that Exadata platform and its Oracle database is related to AI vector processing,\u201d explains Ray. \u201cIn other words, doing vector search, creating multiple dimensions of the vectors or vector indexing, and shortest distance Top K algorithms. Exadata is not in the LLM training business, where GPUs are particularly relevant. That\u2019s why you see GPUs in our cloud in our GenAI service. With regards to Exadata, because it is largely used for structured, private business data, that\u2019s where the vector processing happens, in this case on the super-fast AMD processors that we use for database servers and the storage servers.\u201d\n\nAnd when and if AMD adds tensor cores to its Epyc processors, you can bet Oracle engineers will be tweaking algorithms to make use of them. But we do not expect for GPUs or other kinds of accelerators to be added to Exadata database machines unless there is a compelling computational reason to do so. That could happen, particularly as AI functions themselves get added to the Oracle database management system.\n\nSign up to our Newsletter Featuring highlights, analysis, and stories from the week directly from us to your inbox with nothing in between.\n\nSubscribe now",

            "content": "The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday that could decide the future of TikTok in the U.S. If TikTok is indeed banned later this month, there is likely to be ramifications for TikTok competitors such as Meta Platforms (META) and other social media stocks. Another stock to watch is Oracle (ORCL), which provides cloud services to TikTok.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments ahead of the Jan. 19 date that a law banning the short-video app would take effect. Signed by President Joe Biden last spring with bipartisan support, the law requires China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to another company. If it doesn't, the app will be banned. TikTok is challenging the law on First Amendment grounds, calling the potential ban an \"unprecedented censorship\" for the more than 170 million Americans who use the app.\n\n\u2191 X This Is How A TikTok Ban Could Impact The Stock Market See All Videos NOW PLAYING This Is How A TikTok Ban Could Impact The Stock Market\n\nOver more than two hours of oral arguments Friday, the U.S. Solicitor General defended the law as an act of Congress that is in U.S. national security interests. TikTok's attorney argued the law violates free speech and said TikTok resists content manipulation from China. The New York Times reported following the hearing that the Supreme Court \"seemed inclined on Friday to uphold\" the law, with a decision expected quickly.\n\nHere's what to know about stocks that could be affected by the Supreme Court's eventual ruling:\n\nMeta Stock Potential Boost?\n\nTikTok has proved to be a formidable competitor to Meta's Facebook and Instagram, particularly in capturing time Americans spending scrolling their phones.\n\nThat's why analysts at Morgan Stanley said last month that a TikTok ban would bring a \"significant time spent and monetization opportunity for competitors.\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote that Meta and YouTube would be the \"largest beneficiaries\" of the 53 billion if TikTok users direct their time elsewhere.\n\nMeta offers a similar algorithm-driven short-video product in Reels, which is available through Meta's Facebook and Instagram. YouTube hosts YouTube Shorts.\n\nMorgan Stanley also expects some of that time would go to Snapchat, which owned by Snap, as well as Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest (PINS).\n\nThere could also be advertising dollars up for grabs. Research firm eMarketer projects that TikTok last year collected $10.4 billion in U.S. ad revenue, roughly 12% of social media ad spending in the U.S. and 3% of the U.S. digital advertising market.\n\nMeta dominates the social media advertising market and trails only Google in market share for overall U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer. The firm projects that Meta and Google, via YouTube, would collect about half of the \"dislocated\" advertising dollars from TikTok in the case of a ban.\n\nMeta Stock Gains\n\nOn the stock market today, Meta stock rose 3% to 629.12 in recent action. Snap is up more than 7% at 12.96 in recent afternoon trades. Reddit stock is down 1.7% at 168.97 while Pinterest is up 1% at 31.19. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are down a fraction at 192.63.\n\nMeta and Snap pushed higher in the afternoon following the hearing while Reddit pared its losses.\n\nIs TikTok Ban Probability Increasing?\n\nMeta analysts have generally taken a wait-and-see approach to a potential TikTok ban. But the view is starting to shift. Piper Sandler analysts wrote to clients early Friday that the odds are increasing. Analyst Thomas Champion wrote that he previously expected a \"TikTok reprieve\" but there is little time remaining for that to happen.\n\n\"The Supreme Court had an opportunity to put a stay on the ban, thereby punting it into (President-Elect Donald) Trump's term, but did not do so,\" Champion wrote. \"The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today, and the deadline for a ban is 9 days away. We've heard some industry contacts have begun to consider TikTok alternatives.\"\n\nChampion said Meta and Google stock would benefit most, with AppLovin (APP) a \"less-discussed\" beneficiary.\n\nTikTok Ban Oracle Stock Impact\n\nMeanwhile, TikTok is a customer of Oracle's cloud infrastructure business. The total value of the deal has never been disclosed, however. Evercore ISI analysts estimated last year that TikTok could be worth between $480 million and $800 million in annual revenue for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or about 5% of the division's sales.\n\nOracle warned investors through a regulatory filing in June that a TikTok ban could adversely impact\" revenue if Oracle \"cannot redeploy that capacity in a timely manner.\"\n\nOracle stock rallied 60% last year but is off to a slow start in 2025. The stock is down 2% this month after slipping 9% in December.\n\nOracle stock was down 4.5% in recent trading, on a Friday when enterprise software stocks were lower broadly.\n\nTikTok Buyers\n\nThe law does leave open the option for ByteDance to sell TikTok. So far, the company has appeared resistant to do that. But that hasn't stopped speculation on potential buyers.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) could \"make strategic sense\" as a potential acquirer. As could Walmart (WMT), which previously reached a deal to buy a stake in TikTok in 2020, though the deal was not completed, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Neither company has publicly expressed interest since the TikTok ban bill passed.\n\nA group formed by billionaire entrepreneur and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt has made an offer to ByteDance, according to a press release Thursday. The group, called Project Liberty, also has the backing of Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary. The group has not disclosed the value of its bid.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nHow Oracle Got Its Mojo Back\n\nUber Stock Regains Some Ground After CFO Commentary On Robotaxis, Demand\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nTop Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch",

            "content": "Multiregion RNA-seq data from LUAD\n\nPreviously, we utilized data from the first 100 patients recruited into the TRACERx study (TRACERx100 cohort, including 28 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD, 89 tumor regions) to quantify the RNA ITH of prognostic biomarkers in LUAD8. In this work, we leverage multiregion RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from an expanded cohort of patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD recruited prospectively in the TRACERx study (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For the validation of ORACLE in an independent patient cohort, we exclude patients profiled in our previous study to yield the TRACERx validation cohort, consisting of 369 tumor regions from 158 patients. Separately, for additional exploratory analyses, we utilize the full combined set of patients, termed the TRACERx exploratory cohort, comprising 450 tumor regions from 184 patients. All primary tumor regions were sampled from treatment-naive patients. ORACLE risk scores were determined as described in the original publication8, applying predefined model coefficients and risk-score cutoff (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1b).\n\nBenchmarking tumor sampling bias\n\nWe prospectively assessed the tumor sampling bias of ORACLE, benchmarking against comparable prognostic signatures. Tumor sampling bias was quantified using four metrics in the TRACERx validation cohort, restricting analysis to patients with multiregion RNA-seq data available (333 tumor regions from 122 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD; Extended Data Fig. 1a). To benchmark ORACLE, six RNA-seq-based prognostic signatures for LUAD were identified from a literature search and applied as described in their original publications (Methods and Supplementary Table 1): three signatures based on immune-related genes (Li et al.18, Song et al.19 and Jin et al.20), one N6-methyladenosine-related signature (Wang et al.21), one ER-stress signature (Li et al.22) and one signature derived from aberrantly expressed protein-coding genes (Zhao et al.23).\n\nFirst, the ORACLE signature was used to classify tumor regions as either high or low risk according to the predefined thresholds from Biswas et al.8. Each tumor could then be classified as concordant-low risk, concordant-high risk or discordant risk (Fig. 1a). For ORACLE, discordant risk classification was observed in 19% (23/122) of tumors compared with 25\u201344% across the other six signatures (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). We also assessed whether this observation was affected by tumor stage (TNM 8th edition), finding that the discordant risk frequency for ORACLE was not significantly associated with tumor stage (chi-squared test, P = 0.09; Extended Data Fig. 2b).\n\nSecond, we applied a hierarchical clustering method previously used by us and others to quantify tumor sampling bias8,24 (Extended Data Fig. 3). In this analysis, a larger area under the curve (AUC) value suggests more concordant classification of regions at the patient level. ORACLE exhibited an AUC value of 0.76, ranking second highest out of the seven signatures (AUC values ranging from 0.22 to 0.77; Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4a,b), with the Li et al.18 signature demonstrating a marginally higher AUC value (0.77).\n\nThird, we applied a method developed by Househam et al.25 for capturing the intratumor expression variability of individual genes, with lower values indicating homogeneous expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). By this metric, the genes comprising ORACLE exhibited the lowest median value at 0.36 compared with values ranging from 0.49 to 1.3 for the other signatures (Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating greater stability in expression across tumor regions.\n\nLastly, motivated by the reliance on single tumor biopsies in current clinical practice, we applied a metric previously used to quantify how many biopsies would be required to obtain a stable risk-score estimate26 (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Using a threshold prespecified by the authors of the original study26, the ORACLE signature reached a stable risk-score estimate at 1.3 biopsies compared with 1.6\u20132.8 for the other signatures (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This suggests that ORACLE yields a more stable risk-score estimate from a single tumor biopsy.\n\nIn this prospective validation of tumor sampling bias, ORACLE achieved the best mean rank (1.25) out of seven RNA-seq-based prognostic signatures for LUAD (range 4\u20136.25) across four metrics for tumor sampling bias (Fig. 1d).\n\nProspective validation\n\nNext, we focused on prospective assessment of the survival association of ORACLE in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD; Extended Data Fig. 1a).\n\nWe calculated hazard ratio (HR) values to compare ORACLE risk classes: concordant-high versus concordant-low, and discordant versus concordant-low. There was a clear association between ORACLE risk class and overall survival (OS) (Fig. 2a; concordant-high versus concordant-low HR 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2\u20133.9), discordant versus concordant-low HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.3\u20134.9), P = 0.0034).\n\nFig. 2: Prospective validation of survival association. a, A Kaplan\u2013Meier plot showing the OS association among patients at low risk (blue), high risk (red) and discordant risk (gray) classified by ORACLE in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). Statistical significance was tested with a two-sided log-rank test, P = 0.0034. b, The prognostic value of ORACLE adjusted for known clinicopathological risk factors in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). Multivariable Cox analysis was performed incorporating the ORACLE mean risk score, patient sex, patient age, pack-years (smoking packs and duration), adjuvant treatment status, tumor stage (TNM 8th edition) and histologic grade. P values or baseline (Ref.) are shown for each predictor in the last column. The center box indicating HR and the error bars indicating 95% CIs are shown for each predictor on a natural log scale.

The density plot shows the distribution of log-scaled HR values across 1,000 simulations. d, The prognostic value of ORACLE for patients with stage I (TNM 8th edition) LUAD in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 70). The Kaplan\u2013Meier plots show the OS association according to clinical staging (TNM 8th edition) (P = 0.43) and ORACLE (P = 0.003). Statistical significance was tested with a two-sided log-rank test. Source data Full size image\n\nWe next examined whether the association between ORACLE and survival was independent of known clinicopathological risk factors (sex, age, smoking pack-years, adjuvant treatment status, tumor stage (TNM 8th edition) and histologic grade). Adjusted HR (HR-adj) values were calculated using a multivariable analysis in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD; Extended Data Fig. 1a). ORACLE was used as a continuous risk measure, by calculating the mean score across regions per tumor. The ORACLE risk score was significantly associated with OS (HR-adj 2.27 (95% CI 1.3\u20133.9), P = 0.004; Fig. 2b) when adjusted for sex, age, smoking pack-years, adjuvant treatment status, tumor stage (TNM 8th edition) and histologic grade.\n\nIn clinical practice, typically only one biopsy is available per tumor to determine molecular risk scores. We generated a pseudo-single biopsy cohort to evaluate ORACLE in this context, by randomly sampling one region per tumor, calculating the risk score for that region, then testing the survival association. Running this simulation 1,000 times, the ORACLE risk score remained significantly associated with OS across every iteration (Fig. 2c, bootstrapped HR 2.2, bootstrapped CI 1.42\u20133.42).\n\nWe also evaluated ORACLE specifically in patients with stage I LUAD in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 70 patients with stage I LUAD), where a prognostic biomarker might have the greatest utility for adjuvant therapy use5. Classifying these patients according to the current clinical standard (TNM 8th edition, n = 38 in stage IA, n = 32 in stage IB), tumor substaging criteria were not prognostically informative (log-rank P = 0.43; Fig. 2d). By contrast, stratifying these patients into ORACLE risk classes (concordant-low n = 56, discordant n = 5, concordant-high n = 9) showed a significant association with OS (log-rank P = 0.003; Fig. 2d). The association between ORACLE risk score and OS in the stage I subgroup remained significant (HR-adj 5.48 (95% CI 1.6\u201318.8), P = 0.007; Extended Data Fig. 5a) when adjusted for sex, age, smoking pack-years, adjuvant treatment status, tumor stage (TNM 8th edition) and histologic grade. We further compared substaging classification with ORACLE risk class, finding that 8% (3/38) of patients with stage IA and 19% (6/32) of patients with stage IB were classified as ORACLE high risk (Extended Data Fig. 5b). To compare the predictive utility of ORACLE with other prognostic signatures, we calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values, finding that the ORACLE risk score exhibited higher concordance with OS in stage I disease (AUROC 0.73) than the other six signatures (AUROC 0.59\u20130.72; Table 1). Lastly, a meta-analysis of four microarray datasets7,27,28,29 from other institutions revealed that ORACLE risk score was significantly associated with survival outcome in the stage I subgroup (HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.2\u20135.4), P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22125; Extended Data Fig. 5c), providing additional validation in external cohorts.\n\nTable 1 AUROC and C index calculated for patients with stage I LUAD (n = 70) using survival endpoints for LUAD RNA-seq prognostic signatures Full size table\n\nORACLE as a biomarker of invasive and metastatic potential\n\nPreviously we had observed that ORACLE risk scores were significantly higher in metastatic samples from patients with LUAD, suggesting that ORACLE may serve as a signature for metastatic potential8. We wished to extend this finding by investigating whether high-risk clonal expression changes are present before tissue invasion and whether the lethal disseminating clone is detectable in the transcriptome of the primary tumor.\n\nFirst, we tested whether ORACLE, as a lung cancer marker, predicted lung-cancer-specific survival in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). A significant association was found between ORACLE risk class and lung-cancer-specific survival (concordant-high versus concordant-low HR 2.1 (95% CI 0.9\u20134.6), discordant versus concordant-low HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.4\u20137.0), P = 0.011; Fig. 3a). The association between ORACLE risk score and lung-cancer-specific survival remained significant in a subgroup analysis of patients with stage I disease (log-rank P = 0.0028; Fig. 3b) and when controlling for clinicopathological risk factors (HR-adj 2.15 (95% CI 1.1\u20134.3), P = 0.03; Extended Data Fig. 5d). ORACLE risk score was also a better predictor of lung-cancer-specific survival in stage I LUAD (AUROC 0.71) compared with the other six prognostic signatures (AUROC 0.55\u20130.69; Table 1).\n\nFig. 3: ORACLE as a marker of invasive and metastatic potential. a,b, Kaplan\u2013Meier plots showing the lung-cancer-specific survival association among patients at low risk (blue), high risk (red) and discordant risk (gray) classified by ORACLE in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD, P = 0.011) (a) and in stage I subgroup (n = 70 patients with stage I LUAD, P = 0.0028) (b). Statistical significance was tested with a two-sided log-rank test. c, ORACLE risk scores in 8 histological stages in a published dataset of preinvasive lung lesions (122 biopsies from 77 patients). Each histological stage was further grouped into different lesion grades according to the original article (Methods). The statistical significance was assessed by a linear mixed-effects model setting histological stages as fixed effect and accounting for individual patients as a random effect. No correction was made for multiple comparisons among developmental stages. Metaplasia versus normal stage, P = 0.0083; SCC versus metaplasia, P = 0.098. d, ORACLE risk scores compared between primary regions seeding and nonseeding metastatic clones determined by the phylogenies in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 17 tumors including 22 seeding regions and 31 nonseeding regions). The statistical significance was tested with a linear mixed-effects model using primary tumor regions as a fixed effect and accounting for individual patients as a random effect, P = 0.03. e, A Kaplan\u2013Meier curve showing the DFS of ORACLE in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients, with 54 of them having relapse). The percentages of patients developing relapse in each ORACLE risk class are annotated. Statistical significance was tested with a two-sided log-rank test. f, A Kaplan\u2013Meier curve showing the DFS of ORACLE in stage I subgroup (n = 70 patients with stage I LUAD). The statistical significance was tested by a two-sided log-rank test. For c and d, the center line of the boxplot indicates the median and the box spans from the 25th to 75th percentile. The lower and upper whiskers define the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively. Source data Full size image\n\nNext, to track the transition from normal tissue to cancer, we examined ORACLE risk scores across eight histological stages (n = 77 patients, including 27 normal tissues, 15 hyperplasia, 15 metaplasia, 13 mild dysplasia, 13 moderate dysplasia, 12 severe dysplasia, 13 carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 14 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC))30. Charting ORACLE risk scores by developmental stages revealed an increase in expression from normal to metaplasia (linear mixed-effects model P = 0.0083; Fig. 3c).\n\nWe evaluated whether a lethal disseminating phenotype could be detected in the transcriptome of primary tumor regions harboring a metastatic subclone. Leveraging paired primary-metastasis phylogenies31 within the TRACERx exploratory cohort, we superimposed ORACLE risk scores onto metastatic competence at the level of tumor regions (53 tumor regions from n = 17 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD with paired metastasis-seeding regions (22) and non-metastasis-seeding regions (31)). In this analysis, seeding regions displayed significantly higher ORACLE risk scores than nonseeding regions (linear mixed-effects model P = 0.03; Fig. 3d). To examine whether ORACLE risk was informative for predicting early systemic dissemination, we assessed the time to relapse or death using disease-free survival (DFS) in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). A significant association was found between ORACLE risk class and DFS (concordant-high versus concordant-low HR 2.3 (95% CI 1.2\u20134.2), discordant versus concordant-low HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.0\u20132.9), P = 0.015; Fig. 3e). We also performed a subgroup analysis finding that ORACLE risk class was significantly associated with DFS in patients with stage I disease (P = 0.025, Fig. 3f; ORACLE AUROC 0.59, other signatures AUROC values 0.55\u20130.66; Table 1). The association between ORACLE risk score and DFS was not significant when adjusted for clinicopathological risk factors (HR-adj 1.3 (95% CI 0.8\u20132.0), P = 0.3; Extended Data Fig. 5e). Relapse rates at 5 year follow-up were higher for concordant-high (37%, 13/35) and discordant (52%, 12/23) risk classes than for the concordant-low (29%, 29/100) group (Fig. 3e). Notably, the rate of progression was more rapid in the high-risk (median DFS 1.8 years) and discordant-risk groups (median DFS 0.99 years) compared with the low-risk group (median DFS not reached).\n\nOverall, these data indicate that high-risk clonal expression changes are present in preinvasive lesions, remain detectable in primary tumors that achieve early systemic dissemination and can serve as a molecular fingerprint for the lethal metastasizing subclone.\n\nORACLE delineates chemosensitive cells\n\nPredicting patient benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is a major challenge in early-stage NSCLC32,33. We therefore investigated the utility of ORACLE for identifying chemosensitivity in treatment-naive patients.\n\nFirst, we examined the relationship between ORACLE risk score and sensitivity to cytotoxic or targeted chemotherapies by leveraging drug sensitivity screening data in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database34, which are linked to transcriptomic profiles for LUAD cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia35. Cell lines and compounds with missing data were filtered (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 6a). For each compound, we ranked LUAD cell lines according to ORACLE risk score, then examined the correlation with drug response determined by half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) (Extended Data Fig. 6b); multiple-testing correction was not applied for this exploratory analysis. Focusing on the 17 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for NSCLC, only cisplatin was significantly correlated with efficacy in ORACLE high-risk cell lines (Fig. 4a, P = 0.045, Spearman coefficient 0.33). Furthermore, across all compounds screened, responses to 23 drugs positively correlated with ORACLE risk score. GSK1904529A, a small molecule inhibiting insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) harbored the strongest association with ORACLE risk score (P = 0.0089, Spearman coefficient 0.42). Notably, the main mechanism of GSK1904529A is cell cycle arrest36 and we have previously observed cell cycle genes to be enriched among clonal transcriptional signals8. Only one drug, a B-Raf serine-threonine kinase (BRAF) inhibitor KIN001-206, was negatively correlated with ORACLE risk score (P = 0.0045, Spearman coefficient \u22120.46; Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6b). By categorizing therapeutic compounds on the basis of targeted pathways, we identified four pathways\u2014hormone-related, chromatin histone methylation, DNA replication and genome integrity\u2014where all compounds exhibited positive correlation with ORACLE risk. By contrast, compounds involved in inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling tended to display a negative correlation with ORACLE risk (Fig. 4b).\n\nFig. 4: ORACLE delineates chemosensitive cells. a, A volcano plot showing the correlation between ORACLE risk scores and the sensitivity to anticancer drugs available from the GDSC database (n = 37 LUAD cell lines; 359 compounds; Methods). The analysis was performed using Spearman correlation with the coefficient (\u03c1) labeled on the x axis and the P value labeled on the y axis. Drugs labeled in red indicate a significant association with ORACLE risk scores. FDA-approved drugs for NSCLC are annotated and circled with black color. b, A dot plot showing the distribution of Spearman coefficients for drugs categorized according to their targeting pathways. The targeting pathways for each drug (359 compounds) were obtained from the GDSC database34. Drugs showing significant association with ORACLE risk scores are labeled in red. The center line of the boxplot indicates the median, and the box spans from the 25th to 75th percentile. The lower and upper whiskers define the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively. c, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of ORACLE as a predictive marker for response to adjuvant therapies, dividing patients by the adjuvant treatment status in the TRACERx validation cohort (n = 102 without adjuvant therapy, n = 56 with adjuvant therapy). The statistical significance was tested with a two-sided log-rank test, no adjuvant therapy P = 0.00031 and with adjuvant therapy P = 0.0087. Source data Full size image\n\nTo test whether adjuvant chemotherapy modulates the prognostic information captured by ORACLE, we divided patients from the TRACERx validation cohort into two subgroups according to their adjuvant treatment status (n = 102 non-adjuvant-treated, n = 56 adjuvant-treated; patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD) and then stratified by ORACLE risk class (Fig. 4c). In the non-adjuvant-treated subgroup, a significant difference in OS rates was observed between ORACLE concordant-high risk patients (5-year OS rate 36%) and concordant-low risk patients (5-year OS rate 70%) (Cox regression P = 0.0001, HR 4.0 (95% CI 1.9\u20138.3)). By contrast, in the adjuvant-treated subgroup, there was no difference in OS rates between ORACLE concordant-high risk patients (5-year OS rate 69%) and concordant-low risk patients (5-year OS rate 60%) (Cox regression P = 0.8, HR 0.9 (95% CI 0.3\u20132.5)). This result, wherein ORACLE high-risk classification was more discriminatory among patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy, remained consistent when controlling for nodal status in this cohort of patients (Extended Data Fig. 7).\n\nTaken together, these in vitro drug screen data and exploratory clinical data suggest that ORACLE high-risk LUAD tumors may be sensitive to platinum chemotherapy agents.\n\nORACLE as a summary metric of lung cancer evolution\n\nTo explore the underpinnings of clonal expression signals, we evaluated clinicopathological correlates in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 184 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD, Extended Data Fig. 1a; Methods). The mean ORACLE risk score was calculated as a summary measure per tumor, for use in multiple linear regression analyses. We identified two clinicopathological features that were significantly associated with ORACLE risk scores: tumor stage III (P = 0.002), as shown previously8, and Ki67 (P = 0.0009; Fig. 5a).\n\nFig. 5: ORACLE as a summary metric of lung cancer evolution. a, Clinicopathological and genetic correlates with ORACLE magnitude in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 184 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). A multiple linear model was applied separately for clinicopathological or genetic features (Methods). #Biopsy, number of biopsies. Each predictor is shown in the column with its model coefficient represented by color scales and labeled with significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005). For categorical variables including female, ex-smoker and smoker, stage II and stage III, the references are male, non-smoker and stage I, respectively. No correction was made for multiple comparisons. b, The OS association of six biomarkers identified in the TRACERx study14 was examined in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 111 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD with all biomarker data available). Multivariable Cox analysis was performed on ORACLE, recent subclonal expansion, SCNA-ITH, subclonal WGD, detection of preoperative ctDNA status and STAS, adjusted for known clinicopathological risk factors. P values or baseline (Ref.) are shown for each predictor in the last column. The center box indicating HR and the error bars indicating 95% CIs are shown for each predictor on a natural log scale. c, The percentages of variation of survival outcome explained by the six TRACERx biomarkers were examined by a generalized linear model. Source data Full size image\n\nWe next examined genetic features defined in the TRACERx study14: whole-genome doubling (WGD) events, chromosomal complexity (fraction of loss of heterozygosity, FLOH), somatic copy-number alteration (SCNA)-ITH, and clonal and subclonal mutations in driver genes. The mean ORACLE risk score per tumor significantly correlated with SCNA-ITH (P = 0.02), FLOH (P = 0.01) and the number of clonal driver mutations (P = 0.009; Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8).\n\nTo contextualize ORACLE-associated somatic alterations to specific driver genes, we compared frequencies of each driver at gene level between low-risk (n = 308) and high-risk (n = 142) tumor regions in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 184 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD). ORACLE high-risk tumor regions were enriched (P < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) >1) in clonal mutations occurring in eight driver genes (PTPRB, TP53, MGA, KEAP1, SETD2, NOTCH2, ARID1A and NRAS) and depleted (P < 0.05, OR <1) in tumor regions with clonal mutations of EGFR or STK11 genes (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Performing the same analysis for subclonal SNVs in driver genes revealed FAT1 gene enrichment in ORACLE high-risk regions (P = 0.03, OR 5.6), possibly due to this gene\u2019s putative role in maintaining genome integrity37.\n\nAs ORACLE risk score reflected chromosomal instability and complexity, we wished to identify recurrent SCNA events using GISTIC2.038 to compare positive-selection scores (G score) between ORACLE concordant high-risk and low-risk patients in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 158 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD with concordant high- or low-risk classification, Extended Data Fig. 1a; Methods). Identifying cytobands associated with ORACLE high-risk (G-score difference >0, false discovery rate q < 0.05), significant enrichment was observed for 14 amplifications (Extended Data Fig. 9c): 1q22, 8q22.3, 8q24.11-13, 8q24.21-23, 8q24.3, 14q12, 19q12 and 19q13.11-13. These amplified chromosome arms include the NKX2-1 gene (which encodes thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) an established histopathology marker for LUAD) as well as MDM4, MYC, CCNE1 and AKT2. Significant enrichment was also observed for ten cytoband deletions (8p23.1, 8p22, 8p21.3-1, 8p12, 9p24.3 and 20p12.3-1), including FGFR1, CDKN2A and PAX5 genes (Extended Data Fig. 9c).\n\nSix biomarkers have been identified as associated with survival in the TRACERx study: recent subclonal expansion14, subclonal WGD14, preoperative circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)15, SCNA-ITH16, spread through airway spaces (STAS)17, and ORACLE8. We performed multivariable analysis to quantify the comparative prognostic information between these biomarkers, including clinical risk factors in the TRACERx exploratory cohort (n = 111 patients with stage I\u2013III LUAD with all biomarker data available). Three biomarkers remained significantly associated with OS (Fig. 5b): ORACLE (P = 0.008, HR 2.06), STAS (P = 0.023, HR 2.2) and preoperative ctDNA (P = 0.025, HR 2.27). We also calculated the percentage variance explained (PVE) encoded by each of these six biomarkers to examine the dynamics of their prognostic association (Fig. 5c). This analysis showed that ORACLE risk score was responsible for the greatest variance in OS outcomes in the first year after LUAD diagnosis (PVE 16.7%) and remained informative (PVE range 6.1\u20139.7%) alongside ctDNA and STAS over a 5-year follow-up period.\n\nOverall, these results suggest that clonal expression signals correspond to single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and SCNAs occurring early in tumor evolution. Further, genetic evolutionary metrics previously identified in the TRACERx study (SCNA-ITH, FLOH and clonal drivers) were captured by ORACLE as a simple 23-transcript assay. Lastly, ORACLE, preoperative ctDNA and STAS encoded complementary forms of prognostic information.",

            "content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain\n\nResearchers at the Francis Crick Institute, the UCL Cancer Institute and UCLH have shown that a test called ORACLE can predict lung cancer survival at the point of diagnosis better than currently used clinical risk factors. This could help doctors make more informed treatment decisions for people with stage 1 lung cancer, potentially reducing the risk of the cancer returning or spreading.\n\nIn research published in Nature Cancer, the team tested ORACLE in 158 people with lung cancer as part of the TRACERx study. They found that ORACLE could better predict patient survival than currently used clinical standards like tumor stage.\n\nORACLE was developed in 2019 to overcome the lack of biological markers in lung cancer, which can indicate to doctors who might be at a greater risk of their cancer coming back or spreading to another part of the body.\n\nThis is particularly important for people with stage 1 lung cancer, who are normally given surgery without chemotherapy. For a quarter of stage 1 patients, their cancer returns, suggesting they may have benefited from more frequent monitoring or chemotherapy.\n\nWhen doctors take a sample from a tumor, they typically only capture less than 1% of the tumor, and the genetics can vary massively from region to region within the same tumor. ORACLE overcomes this by looking at genes expressed at a high or low level in every part in the tumor.\n\nThe new findings show that ORACLE could predict which patients with stage 1 lung cancer had a lower chance of survival, and might benefit from chemotherapy as well as surgery. Currently used clinical standards weren't able to give this information for stage 1 patients.\n\nThe researchers also found that high ORACLE risk scores were linked to regions of the tumor that were more likely to spread to another part of the body.\n\nFinally, by looking at 359 current and potential lung cancer drugs, they found that a high ORACLE risk score predicted better response to some types of chemotherapy, particularly platinum drugs like cisplatin\n\nThis is because tumor regions with high ORACLE scores are associated with unstable DNA (called 'chromosomal instability'), which is particularly targeted by platinum drugs. The same lab has recently found that changes in a key gene called FAT1 drive chromosomal instability, which is also one of the genetic variations ORACLE looks for.\n\nThe next steps for the researchers are to compare people with high ORACLE scores receiving standard care and those receiving more surveillance or chemotherapy to determine if the test improves survival, even for people diagnosed at the earliest stage.\n\nDhruva Biswas, Translation Fellow at the Crick, Postdoctoral Fellow at the UCL Cancer Institute, Associate Research Scientist at Yale School of Medicine, and co-first author, said, \"ORACLE can now predict survival rates in patients diagnosed at the earliest stage. If validated in larger cohorts of patients with lung cancer, doctors could one day use ORACLE to help make informed treatment decisions, bringing lessons from cancer evolution into the clinic.\"\n\nYun-Hsin Liu, Research Assistant at the UCL Cancer Institute, and co-first author, said, \"We wanted to build on the previous work developing ORACLE and show that it can predict survival at the point of a lung cancer diagnosis. We've also shown that it can predict who would benefit from certain types of chemotherapy drugs or if someone's cancer is likely to spread, giving a holistic measure of how a patient's cancer might progress and respond.\"\n\nCharles Swanton, Deputy Clinical Director and Head of the Cancer Evolution and Genome Instability Laboratory at the Crick, medical oncologist at University College London Hospitals, Chair in Personalized Cancer Medicine at the UCL Cancer Institute, Chief Investigator for TRACERx, and co-senior author of the study, said, \"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death throughout the world, so it's clear we need better markers to accurately classify tumors and predict who is at high risk.\n\n\"We're now working with the Translation team at the Crick and industry partners to progress ORACLE into a test which could hopefully be used in the clinic as soon as possible.\"\n\nPaul Mercer, Head of Industry Partnerships in the Crick Translation team, said, \"This is an important step forward, translating our understanding of the infinite complexities of lung cancer mutation into a diagnostic tool, prioritizing patients for the most effective therapies. We look forward to working with partners to take this work forward and maximize patient benefit from ORACLE.\"\n\nDani Edmunds, Science Engagement Manager at Cancer Research UK, said, \"In the last 50 years, cancer survival has doubled in the UK. However, progress has not been equal across all types of cancer. Although survival for lung cancer has improved since the 1970s, it's still one of the most challenging cancers to treat.\n\n\"New tests to predict lung cancer's behavior could help doctors tailor treatment strategies to each person's condition, giving the best chance of a successful outcome.\n\n\"This research reflects Cancer Research UK's commitment to tackle this hard-to-treat cancer. While ORACLE still needs testing in larger-scale trials, these initial results show it could take us a step closer to more personalized approaches to treating lung cancer, so more people live longer, better lives.\"\n\nMore information: Prospective validation of ORACLE, a clonal expression biomarker associated with survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma., Nature Cancer (2025).

By automating the procure-to-pay workflow, staff could track details in real time and provide management with visualizations of the workflow.\n\nPrior to implementing Oracle Cloud ERP, Lexington Medical Center\u2019s expense report process was paper-based, making it difficult to validate approvers or track spending limits. Now employees route their reports to the proper approvers, then to payables for disbursement. This gives managers a full audit trail for every report. Lexington Medical reduced employee expense reimbursement waits from weeks to days, while at the same time systematically enforcing spend policy. As a result, the company saw an 85% decrease in processing time.\n\nThe procure-to-pay cycle also vastly improved. Previously, the paper-based process had numerous holes, where purchase orders were often created without the proper approvals, leaving managers to uncover expenditures in their end-of-the-month reports, long after the money had been spent. Now managers are automatically part of the approval workflow and have access to dashboards that provide real-time data for expenditures. The company also tapped Oracle Intelligent Document Recognition to automate input of invoices.\n\nGoing forward, Lexington Medical Center is looking to take its HR functions to the cloud.

            "content": "A software engineer left a FAANG company for Oracle in 2024 due to a cultural mismatch.\n\nHe felt micromanaged and a lack of trust at the FAANG company even though he worked intense hours.\n\nOracle offered a structured onboarding process and a collaborative environment, and he plans to stay.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a 27-year-old software engineer at Oracle who previously worked at a FAANG company. The source's name and full employment history are known to Business Insider but are not named to protect their privacy. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn March 2022, I interviewed with a FAANG company for a software engineering role.\n\nI heard back from my final round within a few days and started about three weeks after signing the offer. I didn't stay at the FAANG company very long because the culture was not a fit for me.\n\nI'm now at Oracle and don't plan on leaving. Here's how my work experiences at both companies compare.\n\nThe FAANG company seemed more focused on personality fit during the interview process\n\nAfter an HR screen and a tech screen, I had a final round of four interviews back-to-back, each lasting 45 minutes. Three interviewers were senior engineers, and one was the hiring manager.\n\nThe personality questions were more detailed than the technical questions. They wanted to know if I demonstrated the company's leadership principles, so they asked questions like \"Can you tell me about a time you affected change in a company?\" and \"Can you tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer?\"\n\nThe technical questions were on standard LeetCode and system design. I was asked to whiteboard and design a service similar to Instagram and discuss how I'd engineer it to scale to a billion users.\n\nThe FAANG company sought candidates willing to work long hours\n\nThe interviewers didn't ask directly how long I was willing to work, but they asked: \"Tell me about a time when you had to meet an aggressive deadline.\" The hiring manager also told me the team I'd be joining was fairly new and wanted to roll out the technology they were developing quickly.\n\nI did notice a few more red flags. Everyone I interviewed with had joined within the past year and a half. Most folks I interviewed with at Oracle had been at the company for four to six years.\n\nOne of the senior engineers at the FAANG company said it's fast-paced and has a work-hard culture, so there's a lot of turnover. However, I'd also get to learn a lot and work on features that millions of customers would use, and I was looking forward to that experience.\n\nMy Oracle interview process took longer\n\nI interviewed with Oracle in February 2024 and started in March.\n\nThe steps were the same, but the Oracle process focused more on technical ability than the FAANG company.\n\nIn the final round, I was interviewed by two senior engineers, the hiring manager, and a product manager. The senior engineers and my hiring manager also asked me standard LeetCode and system design questions. My hiring manager asked if I had data center experience, which I didn't. The product manager asked me to go deep into the technical stuff I previously worked on.\n\nThe offer negotiation process was pretty similar for both companies\n\nBoth times, I had competing offers and asked them to match compensation. They matched it by increasing the amount of vested stock they'd give me, and I got a 10% total compensation increase from both.\n\nOracle's RSU vesting is spread evenly across four years. At the FAANG company, the four-year stock vest schedule was 5% for year one, 15% for year two, 40% for year three, and 40% for year four.\n\nAfter my first year at the FAANG company, I received a 3% raise on my base pay. I haven't received a raise at Oracle yet.\n\nI found Oracle's onboarding process to be much more structured\n\nThe initial few weeks at both companies were spent getting access to code bases, familiarizing myself with the teams' work, and having a lot of 1:1 meetings.\n\nAt Oracle, everyone helped explain the organization's overall mission. The team had an onboarding document that I could follow that outlined expectations.\n\nThere was no structure or clear expectations in the first few weeks at the FAANG company. Management also didn't focus much on helping people get onboarded.\n\nMy FAANG coworkers seemed very focused on their level of seniority\n\nAlmost every single engineer I met in my first week at the FAANG company either asked me a question about how I could help them get a promotion or was very closed off and wouldn't communicate much. One midlevel engineer asked me in our first meeting whether I'd be open to being \"mentored\" by him so he could use me as a data point to support his coming promotion.\n\nAnother engineer I met with told me, \"That is between me and my manager,\" when I asked him about his long-term career goals during our first meeting. I asked my skip-level manager a question about the team, and he told me my question was better suited for a lower-level manager, not him.\n\nAt Oracle, everyone was friendly and gave me information and advice on succeeding.\n\nOracle has a sense of teamwork and collaboration that the FAANG company did not have\n\nIn my experience, micromanagement is virtually nonexistent at Oracle. Management and executives allow engineers and other contributors to set their own deadlines and expectations. I felt trusted.\n\nThe culture at the FAANG company was one of the most intense I've been part of. My teammates and I regularly worked until late into the night, and there was lots of micromanagement, which is one of the reasons I left. It felt like there was a lack of trust in lower-level employees.\n\nIt affected both my mental and physical health. My sleep pattern was chaotic, and I skipped a lot of meals because of the constant stress and anxiety.\n\nSince I left the FAANG company for Oracle, I haven't looked back\n\nThe final straw was when the FAANG company asked me to relocate to a different state with three-months notice. I told my manager I'd move but immediately started searching for external jobs.\n\nI got my Oracle offer shortly after. When I finally gave my two weeks' notice at the FAANG company, I felt a huge weight lifted off my chest.\n\nChanging companies improved my mental health, and my stress levels dropped dramatically. I plan to stay at Oracle long-term.\n\nWant to share your Big Tech job experience? Email Lauryn Haas at lhaas@businessinsider.com.",

            "content": "As the deadline looms closer for Oracle to sunset all customer Oracle GRC support, now is the time to understand what it means for your company, your user security and how to maintain continuous security after May 2025 deadline. On July 23rd, Fastpath, now part of Delinea, experts Frank Vukovits and Pat Wadland discussed what is being affected, what your options are post sunsetting, typical internal controls challenges and what your options are moving forward to maintain strong controls inside Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS).\n\nWhat is being affected after sustaining support?\n\nOracle\u2019s sustaining support doesn\u2019t go beyond programme essentials, including updates, fixes, security alerts of upgrade scripts. Fundamentally, if your question is not about program updates, fixes, security alerts, or upgrade scripts from the Premier and Extended Support periods, you are responsible for your own support.\n\nOracle may provide updates for products and technologies, including general maintenance, selected features, and documentation. However, they are not required to make any improvements or add new functionality. As Pat remarks \u201cgood luck with software on Sustaining Support, customers!\u201d\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nWhat are your options?\n\nNow that we know what the challenge is, what are your current options to consider moving forward?\n\nOption One \u2013 Continue to use the Oracle GRC product\n\nWhilst this is a viable selection for current customers, as outlined earlier, support options are extremely limited. The biggest consideration here, as Frank explains, that you could be paying the same licence fee for a product that isn\u2019t supported. In addition, any Oracle GRC licences could be linked to Oracle EBS and as more licences get added Oracle EBS, there is a scenario where you\u2019re paying for a product that is out of support. Wise to check your sales agreement to see exactly how your current Oracle GRC is licensed.\n\nOption Two \u2013 Manual Reports / Spreadsheet\n\nA far less effective option would be to run reports manually, using offline tools such as spreadsheets. This approach is extremely time-consuming, prone to errors and will reduce overall effectiveness dramatically. Reports that are run automatically in Oracle GRC will need to be pulled by IT teams, and anomalies or control issues will need to be identified manually. This labor-intensive exercise is also one auditors tend to examine closely, due to the manual nature.\n\nOption Three \u2013 Third Party Solutions\n\nThere are options out there that allow you to stay with Oracle EBS, even without Oracle GRC. Frank explains, \u201cFastpath\u2019s GRC module is a great option!\u201d. Fastpath has many Oracle EBS customers who have run Fastpath\u2019s Access Control and Change Tracking modules for a long time, to compliment Oracle EBS and provide a comprehensive GRC solution. There are strong solutions in the marketplace, including Fastpath, to help replace the functionality of Oracle GRC and work alongside Oracle EBS. Fastpath\u2019s GRC module goes beyond traditional financial GRC, providing Separation of Duties (SoD) capabilities, user access reviews, tracking of changes to master data and monitoring of sensitive access along with elevated privileges.\n\nInternal Control Challenges\n\nWithin Oracle business applications, such as Oracle EBS or Oracle Cloud Fusion specifically, strong controls are a must, if financials are to be trusted.\n\nControl challenges specific to Oracle applications include:\n\nApplication Controls (P2P, O2C, R2R, etc.) Duplicate Invoice Payments Complexity of Configurations \u2013 Multiple configurations must be synchronized appropriately for many essential control activities to operate effectively. P2P = Invoice Matching O2C = Customer Credit Checking R2R = Journal Approval IT General Controls (ITGC) \u2013 User Access AZN Menus (EBS) \u2013 Backdoor access via Processes tab Obtaining Reports of Active User-Job Role & User-Responsibility Assignments \u2013 Especially during EBS to Cloud migrations, these reports can help validate whether EBS user-responsibility assignments were mapped appropriately to Cloud user-job role assignments. IT General Controls (ITGC) \u2013 Change Management Diagnostics Menu (EBS) \u2013 Users can directly edit data, potentially bypassing controls Oracle Cloud \u2013 Tracking key configuration changes not covered by Oracle\u2019s native Audit Policies\n\n\n\nDownload the webinar slides to take a deeper dive into the specific Oracle Internal Control challenges. You can find out more about the importance of having a best-in-class Oracle GRC solution after sunsetting.\n\nInternal Control Technology Buy-in best practices\n\nWhen it comes to replacing Oracle GRC, this question always comes up at conferences or when talking to our peers in the industry \u2013 how can you convince stakeholders to invest in new technology, like a GRC tool? What benefits move the investment needle?\n\nMoving to a GRC is not just an IT project or finance project. Using a tool to help with automation of internal controls can help your team and your organization with operational effectiveness. Some of the benefits that can help convince internal stakeholders include:\n\nCross-department commitment required, cannot just be a Finance project\n\nOrganizational Change Management (OCM) Linkage\n\nOperational benefits\n\nRedeploying resources\n\nDoing more with less\n\nTo maximise the benefits of any GRC solution, Frank Vukovits always refers back to the compliance equation \u2013 people, process, technology. All three need to work harmoniously together, to ensure you meet compliance needs. Again, download the webinar slides and see how Frank dives deeper into the equation and maximise any internal controls solution.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith time running out fast for the sunsetting of Oracle GRC support, it\u2019s imperative to a solution to keep your organisation compliant and to maintain strong internal controls. As Frank outlined, in most cases, Oracle GRC users have three options \u2013 stick with Oracle GRC, go offline and manual, or look for an alternative solution. Whilst there are positives and negatives for each, Fastpath\u2019s GRC module works seamlessly with Oracle EBS, making for a stronger internal business case to stay on Oracle EBS and run an automated GRC solution.\n\nFind out more about alternative GRC solutions available by visiting the Fastpath for Oracle EBS dedicated page.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to learn more about Fastpath\u2019s automated access certifications module, speak to one of our experts.",

The vulnerability does not allow file modification or privilege escalation, Mitel says.\n\nBoth vulnerabilities were reported to Mitel by watchTowr researcher Sonny Macdonald. Two months after the patch for CVE-2024-41713 had been made available, he shared details about them publicly, as well as a proof-of-concept exploit chaining them together.\n\nCVE-2024-55550 did not have a CVE number at the time and still doesn\u2019t have a fix, but it\u2019s \u201csubstantially mitigated\u201d in MiCollab 9.8 SP2 (9.8.2.12) and will be addressed by Mitel in future product updates. (Patches for older MiCollab versions are also available.)\n\nThe Oracle WebLogic Server vulnerability\n\nCVE-2020-2883 is an \u201ceasily exploitable\u201d vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access via IIOP or T3 protocols to execute code in the context of the service account and thus to compromise / take over a vulnerable Oracle WebLogic Server.\n\nThe vulnerability, which was a bypass of a patch for a previous one (CVE-2020-2555), was fixed in April 2020.\n\nCISA\u2019s additional advice\n\nBy adding the three flaws to its KEV catalog, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency effectively confirms their in-the-wild exploitation and tells US federal civilian executive branch agencies that they have three weeks to remediate them. Details about the attacks are usually not shared.\n\nThe interesting thing about this latest KEV update is that CVE-2020-2883 was flagged as exploited by CISA back in May 2020, before the KEV catalog was created. It\u2019s unknown why the agency decided to add the flaw to it now, but it\u2019s possible they received more recent reports of attacks in the wild.\n\nIn this latest KEV update, CISA has also urged users and administrators to review threat briefs and security bulletins related to CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474, two vulnerabilities in Palo Alto Networks firewalls that have been exploited (as zero-days) by attackers in November 2024.",

            "content": "From FHIR-based APIs to \u201chybrid data models\u201d and blockchain-enabled audit trails, biopharma companies are exploring a range of strategies in their quest to incorporate Real World Data (RWD) into clinical trials. But technology alone won\u2019t resolve the deeper issues at play. From bridging disparate data sources to safeguarding patient privacy under evolving regulations, sponsors face significant operational and ethical dilemmas. In this Q&A, Chris Boone, Ph.D., group vice president of research services at Oracle Health & Life Sciences, takes a look at the hurdles\u2014and possibilities\u2014shaping tomorrow\u2019s clinical trial landscape.\n\nIn the Q&A below, Boone sheds light on everything from specific operational bottlenecks to the infrastructure needed for continuous, embedded clinical trials\u2014offering concrete examples drawn from real-world collaborations and technologies. He also reveals how sponsors can incorporate genuine patient feedback without derailing trial timelines, explains the interplay of evolving data standards like FHIR and CDISC, and underscores privacy frameworks that respect patient data ownership while advancing scientific discovery. Rounding out the discussion are the key ROI metrics organizations should track to measure value from RWD initiatives and a candid look at how teams can future-proof their trials amid shifting regulatory landscapes.\n\nTo jump directly to a specific section\u2019s detailed analysis, click on the corresponding question below:\n\nWhat specific operational and regulatory barriers impede RWD integration into clinical trials, and what solutions have proven effective in overcoming these challenges?\n\nIncorporating Real-World Data (RWD) into clinical trials can involve considerable operational and regulatory hurdles. However, innovative solutions are arising from industry collaboration and technological progress. It is essential for organizations aiming to utilize RWD effectively in clinical research to comprehend these obstacles and their validated solutions.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, data quality and standardization pose significant challenges. Healthcare data comes from various sources \u2013 electronic health records, claims databases, patient registries, and wearable devices \u2013 each with its own formats and standards. The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) has effectively tackled this issue through its Healthcare Link Initiative (https://www.cdisc.org/healthcare-link), showcasing how organizations can integrate data across platforms while preserving integrity.\n\nModern solutions have effectively addressed technical infrastructure challenges, particularly legacy systems and interoperability issues. For example, the FDA\u2019s Sentinel Initiative (https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/) demonstrates how distributed networks can enable secure collaboration across multiple sites while maintaining privacy compliance. Organizations have successfully implemented FHIR-based APIs and \u201chybrid data models\u201d that seamlessly integrate real-world data with traditional clinical trial data.\n\nResource and expertise constraints represent another significant challenge. Establishing more academic and formal training programs to educate the next generation of research scientists and leaders is necessary to address the skills gap in this emerging field effectively.\n\nOn the regulatory front, data privacy and consent requirements pose complex challenges across jurisdictions. Organizations have adopted dynamic consent management systems that empower patients to control their data-sharing preferences while ensuring compliance with diverse international privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. Advanced de-identification techniques and secure computing enclaves have been effective in safeguarding patient privacy while facilitating meaningful data sharing.\n\nThe evolving regulatory framework for RWD use in clinical trials has created uncertainty regarding the acceptance of RWD-derived evidence. Success has been achieved through early and consistent engagement with regulatory authorities during the development of Real World Evidence guidance. Organizations that proactively establish clear protocols for data quality assurance have experienced greater success in navigating these challenges.\n\nTo meet validation and reliability requirements, organizations have adopted blockchain-based audit trails that capture every touchpoint in the data lifecycle. Comprehensive quality assurance programs incorporating automated data quality checking systems and ongoing monitoring processes ensure reliability and transparency.\n\nOrganizations that have successfully integrated RWD into clinical trials typically follow a comprehensive framework that includes:\n\nStrategic partnerships between healthcare providers and sponsors\n\nStandardized operating procedures for data curation\n\nAutomated quality control systems\n\nContinuous monitoring processes\n\nStructured documentation practices\n\nThe most successful implementations adopt a phased approach, prioritizing solutions based on particular organizational challenges while progressively developing more sophisticated capabilities. This methodical strategy guarantees sustainable implementation and enables adaptation as the regulatory and technical landscape evolves.\n\nDespite these challenges, integrating RWD into clinical trials signifies a transformative shift in generating evidence and delivering healthcare. Achieving success requires ongoing investment in data infrastructure, interoperability standards, and privacy-preserving technologies. Organizations that adopt these solutions as part of a comprehensive strategy, backed by sufficient resources and executive commitment, are best equipped to overcome the obstacles to RWD integration and fully harness its potential to advance clinical research.\n\nDescribe the technical infrastructure requirements and governance frameworks needed to implement continuous, embedded clinical trials while maintaining data integrity and compliance.\n\nImplementing continuous, embedded clinical trials demands a sophisticated integration of technical infrastructure and governance frameworks to uphold data integrity and ensure regulatory compliance. This comprehensive strategy must balance real-time data operations with strong security measures while maintaining adherence to regulations.\n\nTechnical Infrastructure\n\nThe technical infrastructure foundation starts with a scalable data collection and integration layer. For instance, the FDA\u2019s MyStudies platform (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/fdas-mystudies-application) illustrates how cloud-based architecture can support real-time data ingestion from various sources while ensuring compliance. Organizations need to implement standardized APIs and interoperability protocols, such as FHIR and HL7, to guarantee seamless data exchange across platforms. The success of this integration is evident in the Sentinel Initiative\u2019s distributed database system (https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/), which processes healthcare data while upholding security and compliance across multiple institutions.\n\nAt the core of this infrastructure is the data storage and processing layer. Distributed database systems optimized for healthcare data must be paired with secure data lakes to manage unstructured and semi-structured data. High-performance computing resources enable complex analytics, while versioning systems preserve data lineage and ensure reproducibility. The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) offers frameworks for standardizing these processes (https://www.cdisc.org/).\n\nSecurity infrastructure is a vital element that requires end-to-end encryption for data both at rest and in transit. Strong identity and access management systems, multi-factor authentication, and network security controls protect sensitive trial data. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems provide continuous monitoring and threat detection.\n\nThe analytics and reporting layer must facilitate real-time analysis and monitoring of trial data, encompassing statistical computing environments, visualization tools, and machine learning infrastructure for pattern detection. Automated alert and notification systems guarantee a timely response to adverse events or data quality issues.\n\nGovernance Frameworks\n\nGovernance frameworks are vital for supporting compliance and maintaining data quality. Data governance frameworks should define clear ownership and stewardship roles, establish standard operating procedures for data handling, and implement comprehensive data quality management protocols. This encompasses detailed metadata management policies and data lifecycle management procedures.\n\nRegulatory compliance frameworks should document and monitor adherence to relevant requirements, maintaining comprehensive audit trails and risk assessment protocols. Privacy and security governance frameworks must include regular impact assessments, incident response plans, and thorough data-sharing agreements to protect patient information while allowing necessary access for trial operations.\n\nImplementation success relies significantly on effective system integration and quality control measures. Organizations must establish clear performance monitoring frameworks that track system performance metrics, data quality indicators, and compliance checks. The training and support infrastructure plays a vital role, requiring comprehensive staff training programs, technical support systems, and thorough documentation.\n\nThe integration of these technical and governance components creates a comprehensive ecosystem that facilitates efficient trial execution while supporting regulatory compliance and data integrity. Organizations must invest in continuously developing and refining these systems, adapting to changing regulatory requirements and technological advancements.\n\nConclusion\n\nSuccess involves a balanced approach that emphasizes both technical capability and governance rigor while retaining flexibility to adapt to evolving requirements. By paying careful attention to these infrastructure and governance standards, organizations can create sustainable platforms for conducting continuous, embedded clinical trials that can advance medical research, protect patient interests, and maintain regulatory compliance.\n\nThe key is to create an integrated ecosystem that balances the needs for data integrity, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency while enabling continuous learning and improvement in the execution of clinical trials.\n\nHow can sponsors effectively incorporate patient feedback into protocol design while preserving scientific rigor and operational efficiency?\n\nEffectively integrating patient feedback into clinical trial protocol design while upholding scientific rigor and operational efficiency demands a well-structured approach. Recent industry initiatives illustrate how early engagement through patient advisory boards and organized feedback mechanisms can enhance protocol development.\n\nFor example, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), a public-private partnership with the FDA, developed the Patient Groups and Clinical Trials project, which offers evidence-based recommendations for involving patient groups in clinical trials (source: https://ctti-clinicaltrials.org/topics/patient-engagement/). Their framework demonstrates how early patient engagement can result in more feasible protocols and better recruitment rates.\n\nA systematic approach to feedback collection and integration is crucial. The Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) program by the FDA illustrates this through its organized collection of patient experience data to inform trial design (source: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/patient-focused-drug-development-guidance). Its structured methodology for incorporating patient input has become a standard for the industry.\n\nTransCelerate BioPharma\u2019s Patient Protocol Engagement Toolkit (P-PET) has successfully demonstrated that it is possible to maintain scientific rigor while incorporating patient feedback. This toolkit offers standardized methods for gathering and implementing patient input, all while preserving trial integrity (source: https://www.transceleratebiopharmainc.com/patient-experience/patient-protocol/).\n\nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has established comprehensive methodological standards for engaging patients in research. These standards demonstrate how operational efficiency can be sustained through streamlined processes and optimized resource use (source: https://www.pcori.org/research-results/about-our-research/research-methodology).\n\nQuality management is vital for successful implementation. The European Patients\u2019 Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) has developed guidelines for patient involvement in clinical trials that illustrate how maintaining clear audit trails for regulatory compliance can align with patient-centric design (source: https://eupati.eu/).\n\nCommunication is a critical element. The Drug Information Association (DIA) has documented successful case studies of sponsor-patient collaboration in protocol design, demonstrating how regular updates and ongoing dialogue with patient representatives can foster continuous engagement throughout the protocol development process (source: https://www.diaglobal.org/).\n\nSuccess requires a careful balance of various perspectives. The NHS Health Research Authority\u2019s framework for public involvement standards offers a structured method for integrating patient input while upholding scientific and operational requirements (source: https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/public-involvement/).\n\nSponsors can integrate patient perspectives into protocol design through this structured approach, resulting in more patient-centered trials while upholding scientific rigor. The documented successes of these organizations show that patient engagement in protocol design isn\u2019t just theoretically sound \u2013 it\u2019s practically attainable and beneficial for all stakeholders involved.\n\nWhich data standards and interoperability initiatives should life sciences organizations prioritize by 2025 to enable integrated research-care systems?\n\nAs healthcare and clinical research increasingly converge, life sciences organizations face an essential dilemma: Which data standards and interoperability efforts should be prioritized to develop integrated research-care systems? The situation is complex, yet a few key initiatives stand out as critical for achieving success in 2025.\n\nAt the core are FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and CDISC standards, which are recognized as the gold standards for healthcare data exchange and clinical research data. These serve as universal languages that enable seamless communication between various healthcare and research systems. The most recent version, FHIR R5, offers improved support for research data elements, while the CDISC standards ensure regulatory compliance and data consistency across clinical trials.\n\nParticipating in significant initiatives like HL7 and the DARWIN EU network from the European Medicines Agency has become vital for organizations looking to enhance their data interoperability skills. The DARWIN EU network illustrates how coordinated networks can effectively generate real-world evidence from healthcare data across different countries while complying with rigorous scientific and regulatory standards.\n\nOrganizations need to focus on three key areas:\n\nFirst, the integration of data standards must prioritize the alignment between research and healthcare data. This involves implementing FHIR R5 alongside established CDISC standards while consistently applying clinical terminologies (e.g., RxNorm, SNOMED CT). The FDA\u2019s recent guidance emphasizes this approach, especially for organizations planning to use real-world evidence in regulatory submissions. Second, interoperability frameworks should prioritize security and accessibility. SMART on FHIR protocols facilitate secure application integration, while FAIR data principles ensure that research data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. These frameworks serve as guardrails, guaranteeing that data flows safely and efficiently between systems. Third, technical infrastructure must facilitate real-time data exchange. Cloud-native platforms and API-first architectures allow for scalable data processing, while blockchain-based audit trails ensure data provenance. This infrastructure serves as the backbone of successful integration efforts.\n\nFor organizations beginning this journey, a phased approach is most effective:\n\nStart with a comprehensive assessment of current standards implementation\n\nIdentify gaps in relation to 2025 requirements\n\nDevelop a prioritized roadmap for adoption\n\nInvest in technology and staff training support\n\nImplement ongoing monitoring and improvement processes\n\nLooking ahead, successful organizations will focus on developing capabilities that facilitate:\n\nAutomated mapping between healthcare and research standards\n\nReal-time data quality validation\n\nSeamless integration between research and care systems\n\nEfficient cross-organizational collaboration\n\nAchieving the goals of 2025 requires strategic investments in these standards and initiatives. Organizations that prioritize this integration now will strengthen their position for participating in the future of clinical research and healthcare delivery.\n\nWhat data access and privacy frameworks should drug developers implement to balance patient data ownership rights with research requirements?\n\nIn the modern era of drug development, pharmaceutical companies encounter a significant challenge: how to safeguard patient privacy while facilitating essential medical research. The solution involves establishing intelligent, balanced frameworks that benefit patients and scientific progress.\n\nConsider contemporary data privacy frameworks like an advanced safety deposit box system. Patients possess their personal health data, similar to items within a safety deposit box, but they can provide researchers with limited access to foster medical advancements. This method is transforming the way drug developers manage sensitive health information.\n\nThree essential elements contribute to the success of these frameworks:\n\nFirst, dynamic consent management gives patients real control over their data. Unlike traditional one-time consent forms, modern systems allow patients to update their preferences over time. Imagine a smartphone app where patients can easily view how their data is being used and adjust their sharing preferences with a few taps. This transparency builds trust and encourages participation in research. Second, privacy-preserving technologies serve as a protective shield. New methods enable researchers to analyze data patterns without accessing individual patient records\u2014akin to appreciating the forest while keeping the individual trees private. For example, federated learning allows researchers to train AI models across multiple hospitals without patient data leaving their secure local systems. Third, clear governance structures ensure accountability. This includes: Simple rules for data access\n\nRegular privacy assessments\n\nAccurate documentation of data usage\n\nTransparent communication with patients\n\nIndependent oversight committees\n\nRecent technological advances have made it easier to maintain privacy while conducting sophisticated research. These innovations include:\n\nAdvanced encryption that enables the analysis of encrypted data\n\nAI-generated synthetic data for testing\n\nPrivacy-focused analytical tools\n\nFor patients, these frameworks offer peace of mind, knowing their personal information remains protected while contributing to medical advances. For researchers, they provide clear guidelines for accessing and using data responsibly, speeding up the drug development process. The future of drug development depends on finding this balance between privacy and progress. Organizations that embrace these modern frameworks now will be better positioned to develop life-saving treatments while maintaining the patients\u2019 trust.\n\nWhat quantifiable metrics best evaluate ROI for investments in continuous data capture and RWD integration technologies?\n\nThe business value of investing in various data capture and RWD systems is often in question. How can we determine if it\u2019s worth it?\n\nDifferent approaches exist to address this question, each designed for a particular audience. When interacting with senior leaders at a biopharma company, it\u2019s essential to emphasize the key strategic advantages: faster drug development, more effective study designs, enhanced real-world evidence, and a fortified market position. While evaluating the ROI for these technologies might seem daunting, breaking it down into clear, measurable metrics can simplify the task.\n\nThese measurements tend to fit into three major categories:\n\nFirst, operational efficiency indicates how well systems streamline daily tasks. For instance, a leading pharmaceutical company recently reported that its new data integration platform reduced data processing time by nearly half and cut manual data entry by 60%. These enhancements lead directly to cost savings and quicker study completion times. Secondly, quality and compliance metrics reveal the effectiveness of systems in preserving data integrity and adhering to regulatory standards. Consider this as the technology\u2019s immune system\u2014its efficiency in preventing errors and sustaining optimal performance. Some examples of measures to consider (with fictitious percentages): 40-60% reduction in data errors\n\n50% quicker issue resolution\n\n30-40% less time dedicated to audit preparations\n\n25-35% enhancement in data completeness Lastly, metrics reflecting business impact showcase the advantages for the bottom line. They indicate long-term health outcomes and illustrate how the investment improves overall organizational performance. Examples can include: Studies started 20-30% faster\n\nReduced cost per patient by 15-25%\n\nRegulatory submissions accelerated by 20-30%\n\nPatient retention improved by 15-25%\n\nEffectively measuring ROI requires ongoing monitoring and regular evaluations. Organizations should select metrics that align with their specific goals, balancing immediate efficiency with long-term strategic value. It\u2019s essential to remember that true value often goes beyond mere financial figures. While cost reductions are significant, the real benefits arise from improved decision-making, better patient outcomes, and quicker development of new therapies. By tracking relevant metrics, organizations can showcase the full value of their technological investments and inform future resource allocation decisions.\n\nHow should drug development teams prepare for evolving regulatory requirements in embedded clinical trials while maintaining compliance?\n\nWhen constructing a house, the best home developers aim not only to comply with current building codes but also to have the ability to adapt to future changes. This mirrors the challenge faced by drug developers involved in embedded clinical trials: balancing adherence to existing regulations with foresight toward future needs. The objective extends beyond compliance with today\u2019s standards; it focuses on creating a program that can seamlessly evolve as requirements shift. Organizations that prioritize flexible methodologies now will find it easier to navigate future adjustments while working to ensure trials remain safe and effective. By incorporating adaptability today, these organizations can address new demands while upholding the rigorous standards expected by patients and regulators.\n\nInnovative organizations are taking a three-pronged approach to navigate the evolving landscape of clinical trial regulations. Their success offers valuable lessons for the broader industry.\n\nFirst, they are creating what can be termed a \u201cflexible foundation\u201d for their clinical operations. The FDA\u2019s most recent guidance on digital health technologies highlights the necessity for adaptability. Forward-thinking companies are implementing easily updatable digital documentation systems and flexible quality management processes that can evolve alongside changing requirements. They are also adopting monitoring methods that effectively operate both on-site and remotely, all while maintaining comprehensive oversight of all trial activities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the value of this approach \u2013 organizations with adaptable systems quickly transitioned to remote monitoring and virtual visits, while those with inflexible processes found it difficult to adapt.\n\nTechnology is the second pillar of their strategy. Leading organizations are investing in modular systems that can evolve with regulatory requirements. This encompasses cloud-based platforms that update automatically, data systems that seamlessly integrate new features, and advanced compliance tools that offer real-time monitoring and issue detection. These technological solutions provide a foundation for maintaining compliance while facilitating swift adaptation to new requirements.\n\nThe third crucial element centers on people and processes. Even the most advanced technology requires skilled professionals to operate effectively. Forward-thinking organizations build dedicated teams to monitor regulatory changes, implement ongoing training programs to keep staff updated, and establish clear procedures for executing updates. They are also investing in strong relationships with regulatory agencies to stay ahead of emerging requirements.\n\nAs they look to the future, successful organizations are focusing on understanding regulatory trends, developing staff expertise, and creating efficient processes to implement changes. This comprehensive approach can help to ensure they maintain compliance today while being prepared for tomorrow\u2019s requirements.",

OLTP: Up to 25 percent faster serial transaction processing, up to 25 percent greater concurrent transaction throughput, and up to 21 percent lower SQL 8K I/O read latency\u2014now only 14us. This enables customers to do more and spend less by running more transactions faster with a smaller database system footprint.\n\nUp to 25 percent faster serial transaction processing, up to 25 percent greater concurrent transaction throughput, and up to 21 percent lower SQL 8K I/O read latency\u2014now only 14us. This enables customers to do more and spend less by running more transactions faster with a smaller database system footprint. Analytics: Up to 25 percent faster analytic query processing, up to 2.2X faster analytic I/O on storage servers, and an increase of up to 500GB/sec Database In-Memory Scan. When combined with other Exadata innovations, this enables customers to run real-time analytics on transactional data and more rapidly scan terabyte to petabyte data warehouses to gain critical business insights.\n\nImproved energy efficiency and sustainability\n\nExadata X11M also helps customers significantly reduce power and costs in four different ways. First, Exadata X11M\u2019s high performance enables customers to run their portfolio of database workloads on fewer systems, helping save on infrastructure, power and cooling, and data center space. Second, Exadata X11M improves utilization efficiency by enabling more workloads to be consolidated on smaller systems. Third, intelligent power management is built directly into Exadata X11M, helping customers address energy efficiency and sustainability goals by letting them turn off unneeded CPU cores, cap power consumption, and optimize power utilization during periods of low usage. Finally, customers can benefit from built-in automation through Oracle Autonomous Database, which helps eliminate manual database management tasks and human error.\n\nMore deployment flexibility for data and AI workloads\n\nExadata X11M can be deployed on-premises, or with Exadata Database Service and Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and multicloud environments. Customers have access to the same Oracle Database and the same capabilities running on the same Exadata architecture in all these environments. Oracle Database is 100-percent compatible across deployments enabling customers to run their workloads wherever they need without any application changes.\n\nIn multicloud deployments, Oracle Database will run on Exadata X11M in OCI, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure data centers. With this option, customers have access to all Oracle Database capabilities, including Oracle Real Application Clusters, which uniquely enables scaling and high availability during planned and unplanned downtime. In addition, customers can combine their applications, AI models, or analytics tools in AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure with their data in Oracle databases supported by a low-latency network connection.\n\nCustomer and Analyst Quotes\n\n\u201cWe have Exadata Database Machine as well as Exadata Cloud@Customer deployed in our Swisscom data centers,\u201d said Moritz Werning, product manager, Swisscom Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s great news that Oracle Exadata X11M is available at the same time in all deployment options, including multicloud deployment. We look forward to gaining all the performance and price performance benefits as well as the efficiencies that Exadata X11M delivers. Higher efficiency can help us to achieve our energy and sustainability goals while continuously improving our customer service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been more clear than today that Exadata is the industry standard platform to run Oracle Database,\u201d said Ron Westfall, research director, The Futurum Group. \u201cWhether its powering Oracle Database 23ai in hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud\u2014or outperforming on-premises infrastructure from any major vendor out there\u2014the latest Exadata X11M allows organizations to decide where they want to gain the best performance for their Oracle Database workloads. And for everything from extreme vector processing to stock exchange-level transactions. Exadata X11M is clearly the gold standard by which all other platforms that try to run Oracle Database are measured.\u201d\n\nAdditional Resources",

            "content": "In a recent ERP Today roundtable discussion, industry leaders from IBM, Oracle, and Accelalpha unveiled the core vision of their newly formed partnership: delivering client success through enhanced business vitality.\n\nCorinne Koppel, Global Oracle Practice Leader at IBM, emphasized the importance of helping businesses thrive in both stable and uncertain times. The collaborative intent is not only to improve client relationships but also to build a robust foundation for enterprise success, she said about IBM\u2019s acquisition of Oracle-services provider Accelalpha that was finalized in Q4 2024.\n\nThe acquisition marks a significant milestone in IBM\u2019s growth trajectory as it adds crucial finance and supply chain capabilities to its offerings. Moreover, the company has grown its geographic reach with Accelalpha\u2019s team of consultants across North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America, onboarding at IBM on the completion of the deal.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nKoppel noted, \u201cWe\u2019re focused on four key geographies for growth: the Americas, the UK & Ireland, and Japan. Now, with Accelalpha, we\u2019re able to enhance that reach across all these regions while adding focus to our key markets.\u201d\n\nPaul Pessutti, Senior Vice President at Oracle, expressed his optimism about the acquisition, describing it as \u201cthe coming together of two exceptional firms where we already have strong, deep relationships and trust built up within Oracle and with our clients.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment resonated with Dan Haller, Group Vice President at Oracle, who observed that customers, especially in the supply chain space, who need enterprise transformations, could really benefit from the partnership. \u201c[We have] some strong functional supply chain capabilities, and IBM is well known as a global systems invitation partner that works with customers strategically in the industries it is focused on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe collaboration between Accelalpha and IBM is viewed as a \u201clogical marriage\u201d by Joe Spear, Partner at Accelalpha.\n\nThe combined capabilities of both organizations promise to deliver comprehensive solutions that address core business challenges globally. Spear noted that Accelalpha excels in Oracle implementations covering core ERP, Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), logistics, and customer experience suites\u2014components essential for addressing fundamental business issues.\n\nWith IBM\u2019s distinguished managed services portfolio, both companies are poised to deliver end-to-end support for clients, enhancing the client experience post-implementation.\n\nKevin Beyer, Managing Partner at Accelalpha, expressed enthusiasm about integrating this service with Accelalpha\u2019s offerings for continuous support and software lifecycle management. \u201cIBM is ranked as a global leader in the managed service offering, and we\u2019re able to bring that to our customers now,\u201d he said.\n\nAn exciting frontier of this partnership is the integration of Generative AI (GenAI). Teams from all three organizations are eager to collaborate and leverage AI capabilities to enhance business processes.\n\nChacko Thomas, Americas Oracle Practice Leader at IBM, illustrated practical applications where intelligent workflows can rapidly assess business processes and provide swift ROI assessments.\n\nAs the wheels of this partnership continue to turn, the collaboration between IBM, Oracle, and Accelalpha promises to be transformative for enterprises seeking innovative solutions and strategies.\n\nThomas concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about this right from our announcement of the acquisition. We are committed to keeping the Oracle channels whole. We have committed to keeping the business model, which includes pricing and other things. In fact, Accelalpha will now have access to all of IBM\u2019s enterprise bands, so it will only get better in terms of scale and depth.\u201d",

            "content": "Back in the early 90s I worked at a small New Age book & gift shop in San Diego. Among our most popular items were oracle decks. Which are cards, but not the same thing as tarot. We sold a lot of oracle decks.\n\nOur best-selling oracle decks fell into three categories. First, the \"messages from the angels\" (pretty young women with big fluffy wings and long floaty dresses). Second, the \"messages from the fairies\" (pretty young women with butterfly wings and short floaty dresses). Third, animal totem/spirit decks. Which often had a faux Native American vibe (cultural appropriation wasn't an issue for some authors). The advice being offered reminded me of fortune cookies.\n\nI decided that I didn't like oracle decks.\n\nI've recently had to revise my opinion somewhat.\n\nI held to that opinion for over thirty years. Until someone recently shared a picture online, of a bookcase in a Barnes & Noble. It was packed with divination decks of all kinds, and right in the middle was an oracle deck that I couldn't dismiss out of hand.\n\nOne of the authors also wrote the book at right.\n\nThe title and cover art caught my eye first. Seeing the name of one of my favorite Pagan authors clinched the deal for me. This deck and book are the work of three women- writers Stephanie Woodfield and Karen Storminger, and artist Naomi Cornock. They're all priestesses of the Morrigan.\n\nThe book is illustrated with black & white versions of the cards.\n\nAt 205 pages the guidebook is indeed a book, not a pamphlet. There are entries for each card; these go well beyond a basic explanation of the pictures. There are discussions of the images and symbols contained in each card, of the ancient sources they are drawn from (with citations), their historic meanings and their relevance to modern readers.\n\nEach card entry includes suggestions for meditations and spells; the cards are intended for use as altar images and in spellwork. The suggested spells are fairly simple and most use items we usually have on hand like candles, paper, salt, and water. There's a chapter on oracle spreads, another on spells and rituals, and a pronunciation guide for possibly unfamiliar Irish words. The suggested reading list includes titles by other authors (including Morgan Daimler, another of my favorites) and online resources.\n\nLeft, the reverse of each card. Right, an illustration I especially like.\n\nThe deck consists of forty-five cards, divided into five suits- Guises of the Morrigan, Otherworldly Guides, Spirits of the Land, Outer Worlds, and Inner Worlds. The cards themselves are beautifully printed in rich colors on nice, heavy cardstock with a smooth low-gloss finish.\n\nThe Guises of the Morrigan suit explores the many faces and facets of this complex and surprising goddess; some are individual goddesses, others are archetypes.\n\nFrom Guises of the Morrigan suit- 1 Badb, 6 Shapeshifter, 9 Lady of Sovereignty.\n\nOtherworldly Guides presents deities, heroes, and magical treasures drawn from the lore of Irish deities and faery folk.\n\nFrom Otherworldly Guides suit- 13 Sword of Nuada, 12 Lia Fail, 14 Cauldron of the Dagda.\n\nThe Spirits of the Land suit represents sacred places throughout Ireland. While mentioned in Irish mythology as the sites of supernatural events, each is also a place that actually exists.\n\nFrom Spirits of the Land suit- 20 Well of Slaine, 21 Oweynagat, 19 Paps of Anu.\n\nThe Outer Worlds suit represents forces and things existing in the world around us which are outside of our control.\n\nFrom Outer Worlds suit- 30 Battle, 34 Fate, 32 Peace.\n\nThe Inner Worlds suit represents our inner life and experiences. These are explored through the lens of ancient myths.\n\nFrom Inner Worlds suit- 39 Forgiveness, 40 Consequences, 43 Oath.\n\nI'm enjoying exploring this deck; I think it could be a good fit for others who worship and work with Celtic/Irish deities. Persons who are interested in goddess religion and magic, and are looking to expand their practice to include Celtic goddesses might also like it. Also those with an interest in what I can only describe as badass feminine archetypes.\n\nI find the text well-written and insightful, the artwork beautiful and powerful; it is, while not overly graphic, somewhat gruesome at times. Which is honestly to be expected; the Morrigan is, among other things, a goddess of war. The advice and suggested actions are more challenging than comforting. Which makes this oracle deck a good choice for me.\n\nCall of the Morrigan Oracle: A 45-Card Deck & Guidebook. Copyright 2024, by Stephanie Woodfield, Karen Storminger, and Naomi Cornock.

            "content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Oracle, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.14 = US$17b \u00f7 (US$148b - US$29b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2024).\n\nSo, Oracle has an ROCE of 14%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 8.2% it's much better.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Oracle\n\nNYSE:ORCL Return on Capital Employed January 7th 2025\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Oracle compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Oracle .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Oracle's ROCE Trend?\n\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 42% in that time. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Oracle has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Oracle's ROCE\n\nTo sum it up, Oracle has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 226% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Oracle, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.",

(If you didn\u2019t patch your servers for 60 months, welcome to a world of hurt anyhow.)\n\nCVE-2020-2883 was reported by Bui Duong of Viettel Cyber Security via the ZDI. The underlying bug is in Oracle\u2019s \u201cCoherence\u201d library and any application with the Coherence library in its code path where there is a path to deserialization is also vulnerable, researchers warned at the time.\n\nAlso new to KEV this week are CVE-2024-41713 (a Mitel MiCollab path traversal bug) and CVE-2024-55550 (ditto). Both have been known to be exploited in the wild for at least a month, so those (hopefully a limited number of people) relying on CVEs being added to KEV to enforce patching, are firmly shutting the stable door after the horse has not only bolted but been found with a broken leg and turned into dogfood.\n\nWith regard to the Mitel vulnerabilities, as attack surface specialist WatchTowr noted in December: \u201cVoIP platforms, which handle telephone calls for an organization, are a really juicy target for an APT. Imagine being able to listen in on the phone calls of your target, as they're happening - or even to interfere with them and block them at will! It's a very powerful thing to be able to do, and a godsend for an outcome-motivated attacker.\n\nA tear-down of the Mitel platform revealed some dubious product development decisions in the underlying code and what looks like a juicy attack surface, so\u2026 stay up to speed with ongoing patching and advisories from your VoIP providers, even if KEV is late to the party. ...\n\nJoin peers following The Stack on LinkedIn",

As of January 2025, the majority of JD Edwards customers are utilizing EnterpriseOne Release 9.2, which was initially launched in October 2015. Oracle has continued to enhance this release with subsequent updates, including Release 23, Release 24, and the most recent Release 25. Approximately 86% of the JD Edwards customer base has adopted version 9.2, and Oracle has announced support for JD Edwards products through at least 2035, providing customers with a clear roadmap for future planning and upgrades.

Each episode provides insights and perspectives around the \u201creimagination machine\u201d that is the cloud.\n\nIn today\u2019s Cloud Wars Minute, I kick off our CEO Outlook 2025 series with a look at my conversation featuring Oracle CEO Safra Catz, discussing key trends in cloud adoption, bold business transformations, and Oracle\u2019s strategic initiatives.\n\nHighlights\n\n00:01 \u2014 One of the big messages from Oracle CEO Safra Catz was that customers in 2025 are going to be all in on the cloud. They know that\u2019s how to modernize, take advantage of all their data, become full participants in the AI revolution, and achieve their business objectives of growth, getting closer to customers, dazzling those customers, and moving into new areas.\n\n01:00 \u2014 Catz almost never speaks in public. This is a pretty cool opportunity to see what Safra Catz thinks about a lot of things in this very unscripted conversation. She said the customer is embracing this idea that they need to be bold. They can\u2019t just have the cloud become a replacement for technology they had before without changing what they do.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n01:54 \u2014 She talked about customers working with technology partners who can help them solve end-to-end processes. She said otherwise, you just end up with fragmented pieces and have different vendors pointing at each other about where the problem lies.\n\n03:14 \u2014 Catz said that fragementation is out of whack with the needs of the healthcare field, where hospitals, clinics, and laboratories had to take up that effort to integrate and make it all work together. Customers need complete, end-to-end systems. She talked about the multi-cloud miracle when Oracle signed agreements with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS.\n\n04:01 \u2014 We talked about the significance of giving customers more openness and flexibility. For her CTO, whose name happens to be Larry Ellison, Catz assured me that it\u2019s going to be a busy year for him, and talked about some of the fun that Ellison is having in different areas. We have the full-length video that you can watch, and also an article later today.\n\nSee the full interview with Safra Catz\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

            "content": "It looks like Oracle Corporation ( ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Oracle's shares before the 10th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of January.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.40 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Oracle stock has a trailing yield of around 1.0% on the current share price of US$166.32. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Oracle's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Oracle paying out a modest 38% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's positive to see that Oracle's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Oracle earnings per share are up 6.4% per annum over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Oracle has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Oracle? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Oracle is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Oracle is halfway there. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in Oracle for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Industries, especially healthcare and finance, will demand more explainable models, further driving innovation and transforming business operations.\n\nBy Enterprise Size, Large Enterprises Lead, While SMEs Drive Rapid Growth\n\nIn 2023, Large Enterprises led the machine learning market, capturing around 69% of the total revenue share. This is due to their substantial financial resources, infrastructure, and access to vast data, which enhance the effectiveness of ML models. These enterprises are increasingly using ML to drive automation and data-driven decision-making, maintaining their competitive edge.\n\nThe Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) segment is set to experience the fastest growth, with a projected CAGR of 38.04% from 2024 to 2032.

            "content": "Welcome to this exclusive interview with Safra Catz, CEO of Oracle, as part of the Cloud Wars Top 10 CEO Outlook 2025 series. In the discussion, Catz shares with Cloud Wars Founder Bob Evans her insights on the company\u2019s impressive cloud growth, bolstered by Oracle\u2019s multi-cloud agreements with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS. Additionally, Catz talks about Oracle\u2019s ambitious revenue goals, innovative cloud data centers, and the relentless technological advancements driven by the company\u2019s CTO, Larry Ellison.\n\nHighlights\n\nCustomer Boldness (00:21)\n\nIn previous keynotes, Catz has encouraged customers to be more bold \u2013 and customers are responding to that. Oracle\u2019s cloud business is growing at a rate of 50% a year. \u201cMore and more of our customers are willing to not only jump in with one foot but their entire bodies because they\u2019re getting more comfortable and they\u2019re also seeing that competition is moving,\u201d Catz says.\n\n\u201cTransformation and transforming yourself and modernizing yourself, that is not a destination; it\u2019s a constant journey.\u201d Businesses are recognizing that they become more adaptable to meet customer expectations when they embrace these new technologies.\n\nMulti-Cloud Agreements (04:25)\n\nMulti-cloud agreements with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS kicked off in 2024. \u201cWe have always believed that the customer should get to choose what they want to use and what environment they want to run in and how to really advance their agenda,\u201d Catz expresses. Oracle doesn\u2019t believe in building walls or trapping customers; being open to this idea is central to Oracle\u2019s success. Because Oracle Cloud has different capabilities, the company has been able to collaborate with other providers to make their offerings work together to best meet customer needs.\n\nHealthcare Industry Offerings (08:55)\n\nOracle has put extra energy into its industry suites, particularly for the healthcare industry. It aims to be able to handle everything from clinical trials to inventory to nursing schedules and more. At a recent health summit, Oracle launched new AI-powered capabilities for healthcare. While the company competes in several industries, Oracle acquired Cerner because \u201cwe knew that we needed to bring healthcare into the 21st century.\u201d\n\nLarry Ellison previously shared that \u201cwe can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d This means partnering with customers and being open to partner with other companies to apply their capabilities to ensure a quality customer experience is being delivered for patients, doctors, administrators, and others in the healthcare industry. \u201cDo more, spend less doing it \u2013 that\u2019s our job, to give them that ability,\u201d Catz summarizes.\n\nRevenue Goals (17:06)\n\nAt its financial analyst meeting last fall, Oracle released its vision for $100 billion in revenue a few years out. Catz describes what that will look like within Oracle and how customers will contribute to the company achieving those figures. \u201cWe\u2019re telling you now, every year is going to be bigger and accelerating more,\u201d Catz says. \u201cThe way that that curve works \u2013 it\u2019s almost unstoppable once it starts.\u201d\n\nCloud Data Centers (22:30)\n\nOracle has been developing cloud data centers that are \u201csmall enough to go on a ship\u201d as well as what Ellison has called the world\u2019s largest data centers, Evans notes. This will be important to Oracle customers in the coming years and beyond because \u201cit gives them flexibility,\u201d Catz explains. \u201cWe can start at any size and expand as they need it.\u201d\n\nEllison and New Products (24:59)\n\n2024 was a busy year for Ellison and 2025 will continue in the same manner. \u201cThis fellow does not rest,\u201d Catz says. The Oracle team loves the new capabilities and new product lines that they\u2019ve been rolling out to customers that there are no signs of slowing down.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies.

            "content": "The Nashville Tennessean's 25 stories to watch in 2025 from Tennessee Titans to politics\n\nWill our world change in 2025?\n\nWill the new president alter the cultural, political or international landscape, make government more efficient, chase grievances, fix the border, roll back rights?\n\nWill Oracle inject prosperity into Middle Tennessee? Will the East Bank development be beautifully executed, with a new football stadium that is more attractive than the current offense of the team it houses? Will automakers win their billion dollar wager that Tennesseans (and Americans) will buy electric cars?\n\nWill the Titans ever be relevant again? Should they draft another quarterback? Will Diego Pavia propel a Vandy football resurgence (Anchor down!)?\n\nIn 2024, we survived a national election, weather disasters and the NCAA transfer portal. We lived through Tennessee State fiscal woes, a transit referendum and Beyonce's foray into country music. The Taylor Swift Eras Tour ended and so did the run of Nashville's popular Sinema restaurant.\n\nWe lost Kris Kristofferson and Toby Keith among many Nashville and country music heroes. A new generation of stars climbed the charts.\n\nCan anyone in 2025 be as hot as Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson were in 2024?\n\nIn 2025, there's no doubt Gov. Bill Lee will take up school vouchers. There is some doubt that interest rates will go down enough to revitalize the housing market. Is there a market for women's professional sports (soccer? basketball?) in Nashville?\n\nSafety for the tourists and regular denizens of Lower Broadway will be a hot topic in the coming year. As will the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on transgender rights in Tennessee, which could have national implications.\n\nWe'll find out in 2025. Here are 25 storylines to watch.\n\nWill Nashville housing prices surge?\n\nNashville\u2019s home market is expected to stay competitive in 2025 \u2014 especially following the typical post-presidential election surge. Analysts expect demand to remain strong due to promising job growth and continued in-migration to the Metro area. With slowdowns in development due to high interest rates this year, that strong demand could dramatically outpace supply.\n\nTariffs and trade relations with Mexico and Canada, changes to immigration policy and labor shortages in the construction industry could all impact Nashville\u2019s home market over the next several years, so those policy developments will be key to watch heading into 2025.\n\n\u2014 Molly Davis\n\nNashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell's next priority\n\nPassage of Nashville\u2019s transit improvement plan this year was a major win for Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell\u2019s administration. That success took a nearly single-minded focus from O\u2019Connell and his staff, who tout the victorious plan as a win for Nashville families concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nNow that voters approved the $3.1 billion transit expansion program and sales tax hike, what will be O'Connell's next priority? He has indicated housing affordability is of chief concern and The Tennessean will closely follow those details.\n\n\u2014 Molly Davis\n\nDowntown's East Bank expansion\n\nThe past year set the stage for what\u2019s to come on Nashville\u2019s East Bank, from construction starting on the new Nissan Stadium to Oracle\u2019s intention to make it\u2019s planned River North campus a world headquarters. The next steps to look out for in 2025 will be Metro\u2019s hiring of an East Bank Development Authority CEO, tasked with overseeing the development of the new district for years to come.\n\nAlso still in the works are major infrastructure upgrades to facilitate development and a legal agreement between Tennessee Performing Arts Center and Metro Nashville, which is needed to initiate the organization\u2019s move from its downtown location across the river.\n\n\u2014 Molly Davis\n\nSwan Ball and Cheekwood\n\nIf a couple years ago you told Swan Ball attendees they should move the party to Edwin Warner Park, they would have looked at you like you showed up in Crocs.\n\nYet that\u2019s what\u2019s happening this year as the gala in 2024 split from Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art, its beneficiary since its inception in 1961.\n\nWhile the 2025 gala will not be on Cheekwood\u2019s Swan Lawn for which it was named, it will keep the name nonetheless, as part of the terms of a settlement between the botanical garden and the SB Initiative, the group of planners who sued Cheekwood in July.\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking to see how things shape up for the 2025 Swan Ball. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on how Cheekwood pivots to other sorts of programming it expects to bring in an increasingly diverse and broad audience.\n\n\u2014 Evan Mealins\n\nTax talk\n\nMayor Freddie O\u2019Connell said it may be \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what will happen with Nashville\u2019s local grocery tax. The city starts its budget process in earnest in January when it begins receiving revenue forecasts. For now, the city will track grocery tax bills filed at the state level; Tennessee House Republicans filed a bill to eliminate the state\u2019s 4% sales tax on groceries in early December.\n\nAs for property taxes, Davidson County property values are reappraised every four years, and 2025 is the next year in the cycle. O\u2019Connell said outside of a couple of \u201cvery unusual\u201d occasions, reappraisal years have indeed come with property tax rate adjustments.\n\n\u2014 Austin Hornbostel\n\nTransit upgrades\n\nEarly this year, the city will hire the transit improvement plan\u2019s chief program officer. On Feb. 1, the half-cent per dollar sales tax surcharge will go into effect in Davidson County, and the Metro government will begin receiving revenue from the sales tax increase by two months later in April. The city plans to implement bus service enhancements, safety and lighting improvements, and sidewalk and traffic signal upgrades in the plan\u2019s first year.\n\n\u2014 Austin Hornbostel\n\nTennessee State University\n\nAfter a year of leadership upheavals and major financial issues, Tennessee State University\u2019s new interim President Dwayne Tucker is expected to deliver a new plan to stabilize the school.\n\nTucker, the CEO of LEAD Schools, is a TSU graduate who served on its board until his appointment in mid-December. He takes over the historically Black, public university after state leaders ousted its previous board and appointed a new one last spring.\n\nWhile there is a tentative plan in place to get the school through April or May, it faces yet another financial cliff as Tucker quickly acclimates and works to decide what\u2019s best. Meanwhile, TSU plans to launch an accelerated search for a new president, with the goal of appointing a permanent president by July 1.\n\n\u2014 Rachel Wegner\n\nThe state of crime\n\nCrime in Nashville is largely unchanged when compared to 2023. Violent crimes are trending down, but homicide cases remain above 100, and rape cases are climbing. Arrests are up, according to data kept by the police department, and juveniles are increasingly involved as victims and suspects.\n\nIn recent years, Nashville police have pushed for better surveillance, first with license plate readers then with FUSUS, a program that allows MNPD to access business cameras. While Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell historically shied away from plate readers, he supported a FUSUS contract. Both initiatives failed.\n\nWhere Nashville\u2019s children are concerned, a new city office aims to address gun violence proactively and without police or legal intervention. In the coming year, the Office of Youth Safety is expected to start assessing youth programming, collecting data on violence prevention and collaborating with other Metro departments.\n\n\u2015 Kirsten Fiscus\n\nHow will Tennessee's heated electric-vehicle landscape shift?\n\nThe race to electrify America\u2019s cars has been on for years. Since 2015, Tennessee automakers have positioned the state as a leader in the industry with $17.5 billion in EV investment and 20,000 jobs added.\n\nBut as of late, some EV manufacturers are stumbling. Issues include Nissan\u2019s declining profits and layoffs, Ford\u2019s delayed production in BlueOval City and reports that incoming President Donald Trump will get rid of a tax credit incentivizing consumers to buy electric.\n\nFrom a potential Nissan-Honda merger to pending Trump policies, there are many moving parts to watch within the EV industry in 2025.\n\n\u2014 Hadley Hitson\n\nOracle HQ construction and community investment\n\nSome of the biggest business news in 2024 came from Oracle Corp. cofounder Larry Ellison in April when he announced that the massive Nashville campus his company is building on the East Bank of the Cumberland River will be its global headquarters.\n\nBeyond Oracle\u2019s trailblazing work with artificial intelligence and cloud software in health care, the company is poised to make a significant impact on Nashville directly in the coming years. Its $1.2 billion campus aims to employ 8,500 people by 2031. Plus, the company has plans for a \u201chealth innovation hub\u201d with Meharry and a pedestrian bridge.\n\n\u2014 Hadley Hitson\n\nNonstop growth at Nashville International Airport\n\nOngoing renovations at the Nashville International Airport total over $3 billion since 2017 and show no signs of stopping any time soon.\n\nThe number of people travelling through BNA increased by almost 10 million over the last seven years \u2014 from 14.1 million to a projected 24 million this year. BNA is on the path to exceed 38 million by 2036 and require a second terminal shortly thereafter.\n\nFor now, 2025 will bring with it two new European nonstop flights to Ireland and Iceland, the completion of Concourse D\u2019s expansion and start of construction for the new Concourse A.\n\n\u2014 Hadley Hitson\n\nSafety and crowds on Lower Broadway\n\nNashville continues to see growth when it comes to its annual number of visitors. In 2023, more than 16 million people traveled to Nashville and generated $9 billion in revenue for the area, according to tourism figures. The Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp believes the numbers will continue to rise as bachelorette and family visits are expected to surpass 17 million in 2024. There are also forecasts for more growth each year through 2027.\n\nWith such an increase, can Metro Nashville Police continue keeping residents and tourists safe?MNPD\u2018s newly-created entertainment district has been tasked with that job while working with the community to create deeper relationships with the people they interact with. The district will continue to unveil new initiatives and plans in 2025 as they work towards greater public safety on Broadway.\n\n\u2015 Craig Shoup\n\nNashville cops versus Community Review Board\n\nLongstanding tensions between the Metro Nashville Police Department and its Community Review Board eased a bit as the two sides agreed in November to a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement is a partnership that lays out the two sides' agreement on how the Community Review Board, or CRB, receives public records from Nashville police, or MNPD, as it continues to act as an independent reviewer of police misconduct.\n\nThe CRB, formerly known as the Community Oversight Board, was formed in 2023 after state lawmakers voted to disband community oversight boards, stripping them of their investigative powers. Instead of obtaining records related to a police complaint, the CRB now must wait until police close their internal investigation to obtain any records.\n\n\u2015 Craig Shoup\n\nGrowth in Nashville's suburbs\n\nThe Greater Nashville Regional Council\u2019s year 2050 outlook projects a 37% population increase for its 14-county Middle Tennessee area, a rate that's much higher than the state's 19% estimate. Much of that growth will come from the suburbs outside Davidson County, which is expected to see a 13% gain, or about 95,000 more people, in the next 25 years, officials note.\n\nWhile it's true that some Suburban growth can be accounted for by Nashville residents seeking more affordable housing options, the majority of the increase is coming from out-of-state move-ins and newborns \u2013 a trend the GNRC expects to continue.\n\n\u201cCounties like Maury, Dickson, Sumner and others allow buyers to attain homeownership at a more affordable price while still being in close proximity to where they work, whether that is in the Nashville MSA or not,\u201d 2024 Greater Nashville REALTORS\u00ae Vice President of Member Engagement Jack Gaughan explained.\n\n\u2015 Andy Humbles\n\nWhat about the weather?\n\nMiddle Tennessee has seen more than its fair share of severe weather in recent years, including some deadly tornadoes. The most recent outbreak was in May 2024, when areas of Maury and Rutherford Counties were among the hardest hit. In December 2023, Nashville, Clarksville, Sumner and Robertson Counties were among the most damaged after a series of tornadoes touched down. Multiple lives were lost in both events.\n\nIn 2025, Tennessee will be swinging into a global La Ni\u00f1a pattern, which is typically kind of warmer than normal, National Weather Service Nashville Meteorologist Faith Borden explained. Climate predictions indicate that Tennessee will see above normal temperatures all year, but with an earlier spring, earlier spring tornadoes are also possible, Borden warned.\n\n\"That would tend to favor late winter, early spring for potential for tornadoes,\u201d NWS Nashville Lead Meteorologist and \u201ctornado king\u201d Sam Shamburger said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what the rest of the winter holds.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Katie Nixon\n\nNashville's changing food scene\n\nAs recently as the end of last year, Nashville had a scarcity of quality Asian options for a city its size. But that all changed in 2024. The city positively exploded with premium Japanese and other pan-Asian fare. As such, a city that\u2019s heretofore been primarily known for hot chicken and Southern fare now has two omakase options in Sushi | Bar and the newly opened Kase, a vinyl listening room and upscale sushi restaurant in 888, a gorgeous fine-dining Chinese spot in Choy and even more to come.\n\n\u2015 Mackensy Lunsford\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court and Tennessee's transgender health case\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2025 will rule on Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender transition treatments for transgender minors after a Nashville family sued the state over the law last year. The ruling will likely have wide impact on transgender rights across the country, setting precedent for other trans treatment bans. The court\u2019s ruling could also set case precedent for other constitutional protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nThe nation's highest court is expected to rule by summer.\n\n\u2014 Melissa Brown\n\nTennessee and the Trump administration\n\nWill Tennessee leaders work with Trump to enact widespread deportations in the state? Gov. Bill Lee and others have pledged to use state tools at their disposal to assist Trump, who has called for widespread deportations and even ending birthright citizenship.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear what exactly will be implemented when Trump takes office, federal deportation initiatives would likely require state cooperation with the assistance of state National Guard units. Large-scale deportations would likely heavily impact mixed-immigration status families and Tennessee\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u2014 Melissa Brown\n\nWill Lee succeed in expanding vouchers?\n\nAt legislature, state-funded private school vouchers will again be front and center. A proposal championed last year by Gov. Bill Lee fell short when House and Senate members could not agree on significant elements of the bill.But while key voucher allies were ousted \u2013 and others elected \u2013 in contentious Republican primaries, the bill will still face a tough path forward in the legislature.\n\nLee is proposing to fund 20,000 vouchers worth about $7,000 each, while guaranteeing state funding to cover enrollment gaps school districts could see. The bill also includes one-time $2,000 bonuses for teachers, and establishes a new state funding source for school building construction. If approved, the program would take immediate effect, making use of $144 million in funding lawmakers allocated in last year\u2019s budget for a statewide voucher program \u2013 that did not yet exist.\n\n\u2014 Vivian Jones\n\n2026 gubernatorial race will take shape in 2025\n\nCandidates are already gearing up to launch bids in the 2026 race for Tennessee governor. The race will be the first open contest since 2018, when a heated Republican primary become the most expensive in state history. With Gov. Bill Lee term-limited, the GOP primary is likely to be crowded and cutthroat.\n\nSome candidates will make it official this year, with some even announcing bids as early as spring. In a deeply red state, the GOP primary will be a key to watch. Among those rumored to be considering bids are U.S. Rep. John Rose, R-Cookeville, Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs, Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, Ole Smoky Moonshine CEO Joe Baker, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Columbia.\n\n\u2014 Vivian Jones\n\nTitans enter 2025 after woeful 2024 season\n\nThe 2024 NFL season was a transition year for the Titans, and not necessarily a smooth one. Wins were hard to come by because of poor offense, bad fourth quarters and too many turnovers and penalties. Heading into 2025, coach Brian Callahan's staff is confronted with yet another quarterback question as needs pile up at places like defensive end, wide receiver and offensive line. The incentive to get things rolling is huge, with the new Nissan Stadium expected to finish exterior construction in early 2025 and to open doors for football by 2027.\n\n\u2014 Nick Suss\n\nWill TSSAA - state legislature face one-time free transfer rule crossroads\n\nTennessee's high school sports governing body doesn't allow athletes to transfer schools without eligibility restrictions unless they have a bona fide change in address. That could change with incoming pressure from the Tennessee state legislature. Rep. Scott Cepicky, R-Culleoka, proposed a bill that, if passed, would force the TSSAA to adopt a one-time transfer rule. Most TSSAA member schools want to keep the current transfer rule in place. But that philosophy is being challenged with the discussion of school vouchers and the new wide-open transfer rules in the NCAA. A one-time transfer rule would be the most significant TSSAA bylaw change since adding a private-school classification in 1996.\n\n\u2014 Tyler Palmateer\n\nCan Vanderbilt football go bowling again in 2025?\n\nVanderbilt football had its best season in years in 2024, finishing 6-6 and qualifying for its first bowl since 2018. How sustainable is this? The depth of the SEC has made it more and more difficult for teams to rack up wins. The Commodores may still be left waiting for their first 10-win season. But NIL and the transfer portal have leveled the field in college football\u2019s middle pack, allowing teams that have had very little historical success to get more talent. There\u2019s no reason Vanderbilt can\u2019t continue to make bowls regularly now that paying players is fully legal.\n\n\u2014 Aria Gerson\n\nWill Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway bring NASCAR back?\n\nCan Nashville cut a deal with Bristol Motor Speedway to renovate Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway and bring NASCAR back to the historic track? Bristol has been incredibly patient in trying to get this deal done. BMS vice president Jerry Caldwell first submitted a proposal on behalf of Speedway Motorsports founder and CEO Bruton Smith to the Fair Board on Sept. 6, 2017. Since then Smith has died (2022), Caldwell has been promoted to BMS president and the deal is still in the works. Smith\u2019s son Marcus, who replaced him as the CEO, has said he continues pursuing the proposal to honor his father\u2019s vision. However, Smith and Caldwell may have to give up on the deal and that time could come in 2025.\n\n\u2014 Mike Organ\n\nNashville Predators headed to rare lottery pick\n\nThe Nashville Predators are headed for unfamiliar territory this year: a lottery pick in the NHL draft. With a dismal start to the 2024-25 season, the Predators are on pace for their worst season in franchise history and earning a top-three draft pick for the first time since 2013. When general manager Barry Trotz took over in 2023, he prioritized finding a transcendent forward in the draft that would \"get fans out of their seats.\" Even after spending over $100 million on free agents this summer, he may get his first shot at doing so this year.\n\n\u2014 Alex Daugherty",

            "content": "Red Bull\u2019s motorsport advisor Helmut Marko has offered clear and candid advice to Liam Lawson as the young New Zealander prepares for his debut season as four-time Formula 1 World Champion Max Verstappen\u2019s teammate.\n\nMarko stressed the importance of understanding 27-year-old Verstappen\u2019s status as the dominant force in Formula 1, warning Lawson not to overreach. Marko told RTL: \u201cAccept that Max Verstappen is the best and see how far you can get. But don\u2019t come into our team thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to beat him.\u2019 That\u2019s where it went wrong with all his teammates.\u201d\n\nLawson, stepping into the seat vacated by Sergio P\u00e9rez, joins Red Bull after honing his skills at VCARB for 11 races in all, Marko believes Lawson\u2019s mindset will be critical to his success at Red Bull, especially given the challenges faced by Verstappen\u2019s previous teammates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReflecting on past pairings alongside Verstappen, Marko emphasised the pitfalls of trying to outsmart the four-time world champion with unconventional strategies: \u201cSome of Max\u2019s former teammates made the mistake of attempting to outdo him with technological experiments, absurd set-ups, and strategic games.

That should be enough for points in the constructors\u2019 championship. In addition, Lawson must continue to develop steadily.\u201d\n\nAs Lawson prepares to join the grid alongside Verstappen, the rookie faces not only one of the sport\u2019s toughest challenges but also an opportunity to cement his place in Formula 1 under the mentorship of Red Bull\u2019s dominant driver.\n\nVerstappen victims over the years include Daniel Ricciardo who shied away from a fight and imploded his career by departing Red Bull. Then began the spell, that continues, to find the right teammate for the team\u2019s number one driver.\n\nStep up from within the Red Bull driver programme Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon, to no avail. Then Sergio Perez who was arguably the best of the bunch but ultimately was destroyed by Verstappen this past season when the Red Bull RB20 took a ballsy genius to drive, let alone win with and become World Champ.\n\nBack to the drawing board with Liam Lawson getting the nod by Horner and Marko over Yuki Tsunoda to try his luck in the Lion\u2019s den.\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn",

This move puts both teams on equal footing in terms of financial backing, setting the stage for a highly competitive Formula 1 season.\n\nFerrari\u2019s title sponsor will be HP, a leading technology company that will also supply cutting-edge tools such as computers and 3D printers. On the other hand, Red Bull has maintained its long-standing relationship with Oracle, which has been a key financial supporter, providing software solutions to enhance the team\u2019s performance.\n\nThe sponsorship landscape in Formula 1 continues to evolve, with several high-profile companies joining forces with top teams. Alongside Oracle and HP, some of the other significant sponsors in the sport include Aramco, which backs Aston Martin, Petronas for Mercedes, and Stake, a sponsor of Sauber.\n\nThese deals highlight the increasing role of corporate partnerships in shaping the future of the sport, not only through financial support but also in driving technological advancements that can influence the success of each team.\n\nALSO READ: F1 season wraps up with Hamilton\u2019s farewell, McLaren\u2019s victory\n\nIn recent changes to their sponsorship lineup, Red Bull has parted ways with Bybit, the cryptocurrency exchange, after a three-year deal worth $150 million. However, the team has quickly adjusted, securing new partners such as AvaTrade and Neat.\n\nThese new sponsors are expected to bring fresh energy and resources to the team as they continue their pursuit of excellence in Formula 1.\n\nTechnological partnerships have become a vital part of Formula 1\u2019s competitive edge. Both Ferrari and Red Bull are keenly aware of this, emphasizing the importance of not just financial backing but also the technological advancements that come with these deals.\n\nWith HP\u2019s expertise in innovation and Oracle\u2019s powerful software solutions, both teams are set to leverage these partnerships for greater success on the track.\n\nALSO READ: F1 leads Motorsport sustainability with SAF initiative\n\nSpeaking about Ferrari\u2019s new partnership, an HP representative said, \u201cOur collaboration with Ferrari is a testament to our commitment to innovation and technology in Formula 1.\u201d This marks a significant step forward for Ferrari, whose team principal expressed enthusiasm, stating, \u201cSecuring HP as our title sponsor is a major milestone for Ferrari, and we look forward to a successful partnership.\u201d\n\nOn the Red Bull side, team principal Christian Horner also shared his excitement about their evolving sponsorship landscape. \u201cEveryone at Oracle Red Bull Racing is excited to be welcoming AvaTrade to the Red Bull family and to see them proudly displayed on the RB20 in Abu Dhabi as we celebrate the end of the 2024 season.\u201d\n\nAs both teams gear up for 2025, these sponsorships and technological collaborations will likely play a crucial role in their performance on the track, fueling the rivalry between the two powerhouses of Formula 1.",

            "content": "At the start of 2024, Oracle was the largest external sponsor of a Formula 1 team. The American brand has been associated with Red Bull for many years, playing a major role in software in addition to finance. Since the Miami Grand Prix, however, Oracle has had to share the role of largest F1 sponsor with HP, which struck a huge sponsorship deal with Ferrari. HP also supplies the latest equipment to the Scuderia, which in addition to computers includes 3D printers. RacingNews365 understands that Red Bull and Ferrari receive around $100 million in sponsorship money from Oracle and HP. As a result, the two brands top the list of biggest outside sponsors in F1, with Aramco in third place. The Saudi Arabian-based brand works closely with Aston Martin and is said to contribute $75 million a year. Petronas (Mercedes' title sponsor) and Stake (Sauber's title partner) complete the top five. Red Bull has also lost an important sponsor. The contract between Red Bull and Bybit expired at the end of 2024 and will not be renewed, leaving a hole for the team to fill. Red Bull is still expected to announce new sponsors soon. In the table below, we have listed the five largest, external team sponsors currently, based on the amount of money they transfer to the team. Looking at the total value of the deals, including software and hardware products provided by different sponsors, RacingNews365 understands that Oracle is probably still the largest external sponsor of an F1 team.\n\n\n\nNote: all the figures below are estimates, based on consultations with different sources within the F1 paddock and at different teams.\n\nTop 5 external sponsors of F1 teams in 2024 Position Sponsor Team Deal value ($) 1 Oracle Red Bull Racing 100 million 1 HP Ferrari 100 million 3 Aramco Aston Martin 75 million 4 Petronas Mercedes 70 million 5 Stake Stake F1 Team 50 million\n\nOracle Oracle is a software company that has long been active in F1. Currently, the American company is active as a sponsor of Red Bull, but in the 1990s it was also active in the championship. At that time, it worked with the Benetton team, for which Jos Verstappen also drove. Besides transferring a huge amount of money to Red Bull every year, it also helps in the field of software. For example, Oracle's software supports Red Bull's tactical team whilst making calculations for pit stop strategies.\n\nHP In Miami, Ferrari announced a major partnership with HP. The American tech company even became title sponsor of the Scuderia, and for that they had to dig deep. In fact, HP has to transfer roughly $100 million annually to Maranello. That is a huge sum, but looking at Oracle's partnership with Red Bull, it seems to be more than paying off. HP is featured large on the Ferrari car and will be for the next few years. The company develops hardware, including computers and 3D printing machines. On top of the money, therefore, HP will supply a lot of new technology to Ferrari.\n\nAramco The Saudi oil group from Saudi Arabia is almost impossible to imagine F1 without. The sponsor is active not only as a partner of Aston Martin, but also as a sponsor of F1. As a result, we see Aramco not only on the cars of Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso, but also at various circuits as a sponsor of the race itself. This makes the oil group an important, if not the most important external sponsor in the sport. As of 2024, the company is the only sponsor name in Aston Martin's team name, making the sponsorship amount towards the team even larger. Rumours are circulating that Aramco has shares in Lawrence Stroll's team, but that remains purely speculation.\n\nPetronas The fuel supplier from Malaysia has also been running within F1 for many years. Petronas has a strong partnership with Mercedes, for which it also supplies the fuel. Together the two parties work to provide the best fuel for both the team and the customer teams. In addition to the intensive cooperation on fuel development, Petronas also provides the Mercedes F1 team with an annual $70 million sum.",

            "content": "So they decided on Liam Lawson to partner Max Verstappen at Red Bull from 2025 and with it sent Sergio Perez packing, which was rather expected as the Mexican veteran\u2019s form disappeared shortly after the season began.\n\nNevertheless, Lawson\u2019s a big gamble for Red Bull, and I like him a lot. I have a hunch about him and see something special in the kid. Call it the eye of a tiger. He\u2019s not scared to pick fights, irrespective of who it is, and he shows a certain grit that reminds me of most recently Oscar Piastri and many of those Antipodeans who have come up and done so well in our sport.\n\nThe good feeling about Lawson is perhaps also influenced by optimism. As mentioned above, \u201ca hunch\u201d rather than anything factual to go by. If any driver deserved the upward shove to the lion\u2019s den, it was Yuki Tsunoda. He paid his dues. He\u2019s raced more for the RBR junior team than any other.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet, after only 11 races of assessing Lawson at VCARB, Red Bull saw something in the entire \u2018package\u2019 that gave them the confidence to thrust the 22-year-old New Zealander into the hottest seat in Formula 1. How he will \u2018swim\u2019 against the fastest and most ruthless fish in the pond remains to be seen.\n\nWhatever the case, Red Bull owes him time and lots of it. The folly of the Daniel Ricciardo waste of precious experience, when the seat should have gone to Lawson from the beginning of this season, as the Australian was well past his sell by date.\n\nIs Lawson the future of Red Bull?\n\nRed Bull is signalling that Lawson is their future. I doubt Max will be with Red Bull beyond the 2026 Formula 1 season if they do not provide him with a winning car from the moment the new rules package becomes a reality.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s lasted this long. Equally surprised that Ferrari broke the bank to scoop Lewis Hamilton and not the Dutch ace. In choosing Lawson Red Bull bosses, Helmut Marko and Christian Horner stated that on the evidence they have, the Kiwi is the best of their pool of drivers to handle the pressure that has destroyed every driver that has come to share the garage.\n\nVerstappen, of course, was going to want Perez to stay on. He was no threat at all. But in Lawson, he\u2019ll have a young driver who will perhaps test him for the first time, and that is the hope. That is what I kind of detect in Lawson. He\u2019s going there to flex his muscles and not to play second fiddle to Verstappen.\n\nSo really, what does Lawson have to do? Does he have to beat Verstappen? No. But in every session, FP1, FP2, FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3, Sprint, and race, he\u2019s got to be right there a tenth or two from Max all the time. That\u2019s a big ask.\n\nHope is what Formula 1 is all about.\n\nAsk anyone who Max has destroyed in their team. Daniel Ricciardo, to start with, shied away from taking Verstappen on as his teammate at Red Bull, which ultimately torpedoed the Australian\u2019s F1 career. Add to the list of drivers destroyed: Pierre Gasly, Alex Albon, and now Sergio Perez.\n\nBut that\u2019s Lawson\u2019s plight. The first course of action for him in his first serious full season as a Red Bull driver is to just be as close to Max as possible.\n\nThus we have already another salubrious contest between teammates that will have Netflix salivating as the young gun of Red Bull\u2019s future takes on the four-time F1 World Champion.\n\nLawson\u2019s template is 27-year-old Verstappen\u2019s career, which began by sending Ricciardo packing before becoming the team\u2019s main man. Can the 22-year-old New Zealander make history repeat itself? It\u2019s hard to imagine, but hope is what Formula 1 is all about. Step up, Liam Lawson; it\u2019s your time to shine.\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn",

And again, similar vibes from the images of the pair together at the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Peace is upon them or some Oscar-level acting going on in the Red Bullpen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this year, when Red Bull famously lost their way, Jos, father of reigning world champion Max Verstappen, emerged as a highly vocal critic, openly placing blame for an \u201cexplosive\u201d situation within Red Bull on team principal Horner.\n\nIt will explode\n\nThe tensions, which had been simmering since late 2022, culminated during the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend. Reports suggested Horner had sought to consolidate power within the team at the expense of Red Bull\u2019s senior advisor, Helmut Marko, creating divisions within the organisation.\n\nJos became one of Horner\u2019s most outspoken critics, saying at the time, \u201cThere is tension here while he remains in position. The team is in danger of being torn apart. It can\u2019t go on the way it is. It will explode. He is playing the victim when he is the one causing the problems.\n\nJos even suggested the RBR team boss should step aside to restore harmony within the Red Bull hierarchy, a stance exacerbated by the brain drain of Adrian Newey and other senior team members in the wake of the Horner \u2018sexting\u2019 saga.\n\nEntente Cordiale\n\nDespite the apparent entente cordiale that exists now between the duo, Verstappen senior expressed no regrets about his earlier criticisms and suggested he understands the factors contributing to the team\u2019s apparent return to stability.\n\nKnown for his candid and forthright manner, quoted by several German media outlets, Jos has doubled down on his previous statements, maintaining that his actions were in the best interest of the team and his son Max.\n\nAsked if his harsh words directed at Horner were regrettable, Verstappen senior insisted, \u201cNo, not at all. Of course, what the team boss does or doesn\u2019t do has an influence on everything that goes on around the team. And therefore around Max.\n\n\u201cOf course, I get involved in that. I see it all happening, and I do think I am in a position to say something about it. If I am put on the spot, I will give my opinion. I will never harm Max. I look at the overall picture. In the end, I stand by everything I said.\u201d\n\nHappy Daddy\n\nVerstappen\u2019s remarks underline his commitment to safeguarding his son\u2019s environment within the team while hinting at the broader challenges Red Bull faced earlier in the season.\n\nWith the team now seemingly moving past its internal discord, attention will turn to whether this stability can translate into sustained success on the track as the quest for Max\u2019s fifth straight F1 title begins\n\nClearly, Team Verstappen is happiest when Red Bull builds Max a car he enjoys driving (e.g., the Red Bull RB19), as history shows he will do the rest where others will falter in the same machine.\n\nA good car for Bahrain F1 Testing will make Daddy happy, a bad car will certainly make Daddy unhappy, which would be a good time to revisit the status of the peace between Jos the Boss and Horner the Other Boss.\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn",

However, their RB20 car proved to be a nightmare for the team, especially for Perez. While Verstappen somehow managed to wrestle the car into competitiveness, securing 437 points, Perez struggled to adapt, finishing with just 152 points\u2014well below expectations.\n\nDespite Perez\u2019s performance gap, Verstappen insists that the Mexican driver isn\u2019t solely to blame for the team\u2019s failure.\n\n\u201cFor us, of course, it was a miserable failure,\u201d Verstappen admitted. \u201cOn the one hand, it was obviously difficult for Checo, and I think it wasn\u2019t always his fault. We also had a very difficult car at the time. I absolutely don\u2019t want to criticize him, and I can clearly say that it wasn\u2019t all his fault if things went so bad.\u201d\n\nThe RB20: A Driver\u2019s Nightmare\n\nThe RB20\u2019s fundamental design flaws caused headaches for both drivers. While Verstappen\u2019s adaptable driving style allowed him to extract some level of performance, the car\u2019s rigidity and unpredictability made it nearly impossible for Perez to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem we had this season was that the machine wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Verstappen explained. \u201cObviously, I know Checo\u2019s driving style. The car we had at one point was very difficult to drive. It was like that for me too, and that doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nVerstappen further criticized the team\u2019s lack of urgency in addressing the car\u2019s flaws, suggesting that earlier adjustments could have helped Perez deliver better results.\n\n\u201cWe should have started working on it earlier, because that would have helped him a lot too.\u201d\n\nLiam Lawson: The Next Big Test\n\nWith Perez now gone, Red Bull has placed its faith in 22-year-old Liam Lawson, who steps into one of the most pressure-packed seats in Formula 1. Lawson\u2019s promotion comes with high expectations, but he faces the daunting task of partnering with Verstappen and navigating the RB21\u2014a car that may inherit some of the RB20\u2019s deficiencies.\n\nWhile Lawson enters the team with significant hype, Verstappen\u2019s dominance and the team\u2019s reputation for being harsh on second drivers raise questions about whether the young Kiwi can handle the challenge.\n\nCan Red Bull Rebound in 2025?\n\nThe 2025 season represents a fresh start for Red Bull, but it also comes with heightened scrutiny. With a car that struggled to deliver consistency in 2024, the pressure will be on the team to provide Verstappen and Lawson with a more competitive package. For Lawson, the stakes are even higher, as he must prove he belongs at the pinnacle of motorsport while navigating the intense spotlight of racing alongside Verstappen.\n\nAs Verstappen reflected on his four years with Perez, he praised their strong partnership and lamented the circumstances that led to Red Bull\u2019s struggles. The Dutchman now faces the challenge of leading a team in transition, while Lawson will aim to avoid becoming the latest casualty of Red Bull\u2019s unforgiving second seat.",

Four-time F1 world champion, Max Verstappen has himself hinted on many occasions that he is considering to race at Le Mans in the future, but his most recent title triumph has already caught the eye of the most successful driver in the history of Le Mans.\n\nTom Kristensen, who is often dubbed as \u2018Mr. Le Mans\u2019 for a record-breaking nine wins, has always admired Verstappen. Looking back on his 2024 title defense, the 57-year-old expressed that now was the time that he wanted the Red Bull driver on his team.\n\n\u201cYes, if we look at the Max Verstappen of the past four years, then this year\u2019s [2024\u2019s] Max is the one I would like to have in my team. There is no doubt about that,\u201d he told F1Maximaal.nl in an exclusive interview.\n\nSIMPLY LOVELY MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS HIS FOURTH CONSECUTIVE TITLE pic.twitter.com/b9UpnewAhB \u2014 ESPN (@espn) November 24, 2024\n\nThe Danish racing driver was in awe of Verstappen\u2019s maturity last season. \u201cHe\u2019s learned a lot and won\u2019t get upset when he drives a few bad laps,\u201d he adds whilst regarding the 27-year-old\u2019s 2024 triumph higher than his maiden title win in 2021.\n\nDespite enduring a tough middle part of the season where the Dutchman only won twice in 14 races, he secured his title at the Las Vegas GP with two races to spare. Many would argue that last season, Verstappen proved he was invincible. But Kristensen has a few words of wisdom for his rivals to beat him in 2025.\n\nVerstappen needs a taste of his own medicine\n\n2025 is set to become one of the most competitive grids in the recent history of the sport. But Verstappen still holds the edge over his rivals owing to his aggressive on-track mentality as per Kristensen.\n\nSo, he suggests that the likes of Charles Leclerc and Lando Norris should fight fire by fire when going wheel-to-wheel with the Dutchman. \u201cIf you race against him, you have to be more robust. You have to make sure you don\u2019t go to the side, because you know Max won\u2019t give way anyway,\u201d concluded the former Audi driver.\n\nKristensen cites Lewis Hamilton to make his point. He believes that the #44 driver was spooked by Verstappen in 2021 \u2014 eventually leading to him losing out on his eighth world title.\n\nBut 2025 presents the best opportunity for the Briton to make amends as the top three teams are very closely bunched together in terms of performance. And Hamilton is not going to drop the ball in capitalizing his Ferrari\u2019s potential, if they provide him a race-winning car.",

However, Oracle's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 69.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 26%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n\nNYSE:ORCL Historic Dividend January 3rd 2025\n\nOracle Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $0.48, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.60. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Oracle has impressed us by growing EPS at 5.1% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.\n\nWe Really Like Oracle's Dividend\n\nIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Hernandez said this amounts to individuals making $37,500 a year or less.\n\nStudio rent starts at $406 a month, one bedroom at $437 a month, and two bedrooms at $524 a month, but rents vary depending on the renter\u2019s annual income.

The company strengthened its open-source commitment that year by also selling Linux directly to its customers on its workstations. Sun moved even more forcefully into the open-source movement in 2005, releasing some 1,600 patents to the public domain, and followed up the next year by making Java open-source. In 2008 Sun bought the software developer MySQL AB and continued to support MySQL as an open-source database program.\n\nIn 2002 market pressures forced Sun to adopt x86 microprocessors. Instead of buying them from Intel, Sun bought them from Intel\u2019s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. However, soon after Jonathan Schwartz replaced McNealy as CEO in 2006, the company started working closely with Intel and chose that company\u2019s chip set for some of its servers.\n\nBy the spring of 2009, Sun\u2019s business was suffering because of the Great Recession and lower-priced competitors. In April, after the company failed to come to an agreement to be acquired by IBM, Oracle stepped in and offered to buy Sun in a deal estimated at $7.4 billion. Although the acquisition passed U.S. antitrust scrutiny, the European Union (EU) slowed the purchase down by questioning whether Oracle would continue to support the MySQL database.

We think of it as a kid\u2019s toy, but theoretical computer scientists employ a similar tool. They often imagine they can consult hypothetical devices called oracles that can instantly, and correctly, answer specific questions. These fanciful thought experiments have inspired new algorithms and helped researchers map the landscape of computation.\n\nThe researchers who invoke oracles work in a subfield of computer science called computational complexity theory. They\u2019re concerned with the inherent difficulty of problems such as determining whether a number is prime or finding the shortest path between two points in a network. Some problems are easy to solve, others seem much harder but have solutions that are easy to check, while still others are easy for quantum computers but seemingly hard for ordinary ones.\n\nComplexity theorists want to understand whether these apparent differences in difficulty are fundamental. Is there something intrinsically hard about certain problems, or are we just not clever enough to come up with a good solution? Researchers address such questions by sorting problems into \u201ccomplexity classes\u201d \u2014 all the easy problems go in one class, for example, and all the easy-to-check problems go in another \u2014 and proving theorems about the relationships between those classes.\n\nUnfortunately, mapping the landscape of computational difficulty has turned out to be, well, difficult. So in the mid-1970s, some researchers began to study what would happen if the rules of computation were different. That\u2019s where oracles come in.\n\nLike Magic 8 Balls, oracles are devices that immediately answer yes-or-no questions without revealing anything about their inner workings. Unlike Magic 8 Balls, they always say either yes or no, and they\u2019re always correct \u2014 an advantage of being fictional. In addition, any given oracle will only answer a specific type of question, such as \u201cIs this number prime?\u201d\n\nWhat makes these fictional devices useful for understanding the real world? In brief, they can reveal hidden connections between different complexity classes.\n\nTake the two most famous complexity classes. There\u2019s the class of problems that are easy to solve, which researchers call \u201cP,\u201d and the class of problems that are easy to check, which researchers call \u201cNP.\u201d Are all easy-to-check problems also easy to solve? If so, that would mean that NP would equal P, and all encryption would be easy to crack (among other consequences). Complexity theorists suspect that NP does not equal P, but they can\u2019t prove it, even though they\u2019ve been trying to pin down the relationship between the two classes for over 50 years.\n\nOracles have helped them better understand what they\u2019re working with. Researchers have invented oracles that answer questions that help solve many different problems. In a world where every computer had a hotline to one of these oracles, all easy-to-check problems would also be easy to solve, and P would equal NP. But other, less helpful oracles have the opposite effect. In a world populated by these oracles, P and NP would be provably different.\n\nResearchers have used this knowledge to get a better grasp on the P versus NP problem. The first attempts at determining the relationship between P and NP used an elegant trick called diagonalization that had been essential for other major results in computer science. But researchers soon realized that any proof based on diagonalization would also apply to any world where every computer can consult the same oracle. This spelled doom, as oracles change the answer to the P versus NP question. If researchers could use diagonalization to prove that P and NP are different in the real world, the same proof would imply that P and NP are different in an oracle-infused world where they\u2019re clearly equivalent. That means any diagonalization-based solution to the P versus NP problem would be self-contradictory. Researchers concluded that they\u2019d need new techniques to make progress.\n\nOracles have also been helpful in the study of quantum computing. In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers discovered ways to harness quantum physics to rapidly solve certain problems that seemed hard for ordinary \u201cclassical\u201d computers. But did these problems just seem hard, or were they truly hard? Proving it one way or another would require radically new mathematical techniques.\n\nBecause of this, researchers have studied how quantum computers fare on problems involving oracles. These efforts can provide indirect evidence that quantum computers really are more powerful than classical ones, and they can help researchers explore qualitatively new tasks where quantum computers might excel. Sometimes, they can even have practical applications. In 1994, the applied mathematician Peter Shor was inspired by a recent oracle result to develop a fast quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers \u2014 a task whose apparent difficulty underlies the cryptographic systems that keep our online data secure. Shor\u2019s discovery kicked off a race to build powerful quantum computers that continues to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict the future of complexity theory, but not every question about the trajectory of the field is equally hard to answer. Will researchers continue to consult oracles? Signs point to yes.",

            "content": "Ford Motor Company has developed a system to estimate the life of individual parts on its vehicles. In early January 2025, the automaker released a patent after filing it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in September 2021.\n\nThis patent \u2014- number 12,189,383 \u2014 includes a new system to survey the parts continually while relying on cloud-based software. Ford\u2019s latest innovation competes with Tesla\u2019s long-running predictive maintenance system for its electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nFord will implement its new technology through sensors placed around each car. With the Internet of Things (IoT), these gadgets can send vehicle health information to a central database for further analysis. Then, artificial intelligence (AI)-backed systems evaluate how long the part has left.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\n2025 Ford Mache-E electric SUV. Credit: Ford Motor Company.\n\nAnother critical element of Ford\u2019s new patent is leveraging connected vehicles. When cars exchange information, they better understand mechanical health standards.\n\nFord\u2019s plan suggests dividing its fleet into specific vehicle classes. In the patent, the automaker outlines an example of the fuel injector\u2019s remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. Ford would train the RUL model based on the vehicle class and ground truth degradation data.\n\nWhile these technologies will help Ford drivers, they are already present in Tesla vehicles. The EV automaker has leveraged predictive analytics for over a decade to monitor and improve vehicle health.\n\nIn 2012, the company released over-the-air firmware to assist its cars. Then, in 2014, Tesla unveiled its tech package that included cameras and sensors.\n\nIn this decade, Tesla Motors still uses predictive analytics to optimize battery health and ensure smooth motor operation. With real-time monitoring, Tesla can predict fleet needs based on driving habits and acquired data.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s technology predates other manufacturers, it has continued improving its predictive maintenance software. In the fall of 2023, the automaker introduced a distributed sensor network to determine how many drivers were using specific Supercharger stations.\n\nFord\u2019s patent Methods and Systems for Anomaly Detection of a Vehicle (Figure 2). Credit: US Patent Office / Ford.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nThis information helps drivers understand wait times at charging stations and how many stalls are available. Advanced algorithms drive Tesla\u2019s ability to predict wait times for its owners.\n\nThe automotive industry ebbs and flows with innovations. When one manufacturer invents something, other companies follow with similar technologies. Tesla and Ford have seen this phenomenon in the past and present.\n\nIn 1997, Ford unveiled the first natural gas-powered fleet for commercial sales. Following this innovation, other automakers created natural gas engines primarily for heavy-duty trucks.\n\nTesla is no stranger to other companies that are emulating its innovative features. Besides Ford, General Motors (GM) has also built upon Tesla\u2019s predictive maintenance software.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nGM has used its OnStar program to help drivers after getting into an accident. Then, the manufacturer updated the software to estimate when engine components would fail.\n\nPredictive analytics are also a part of GM\u2019s production process. With these advanced technologies, the automaker can detect malfunctions through anomalous patterns. The AI models predict when intervention is necessary, thus mitigating potential disruptions.\n\nTesla\u2019s AI innovations have inspired other automakers outside predictive analytics. For instance, the automaker released Autopilot in late 2015 and made it available for the Model S. Since then, it has been a cornerstone of Tesla vehicles.\n\nIn the last decade, other manufacturers have followed up with various semi-autonomous solutions. Ford unveiled BlueCruise in 2021, allowing operators to take advantage of hands-free driving in specific areas. Since 2021, the Michigan-based company has expanded access to its Blue Zones.\n\nSometimes, other manufacturers inspire Tesla with their innovative software. One example is FordPass and its automated valet parking feature. With this assistance, drivers can locate parking spots and exit their vehicles before they enter a space.\n\nTesla\u2019s answer to this innovation was the Vision Park Assist feature, launched in spring 2023. The software update leveraged Tesla cameras to measure how far away objects are. Then, it could help the driver park in their desired space.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nThe most recent update is Smart Summon, which lets drivers find parking lots and bring their cars to them. The software is functional for Tesla Model Y owners within 65 meters of their vehicle.\n\nStay tuned for constant Tesla updates, follow us on:\n\nGoogle News | Flipboard | X (Twitter) | WhatsApp Channel | RSS (Feedly).\n\nRelated News",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is taking steps to resume deployments of an Oracle electronic health record after largely pausing the rollout for more than a year.\n\nThe VA will roll out the record to four facilities in Michigan \u2014 VA Battle Creek Medical Center, VA Detroit Healthcare System, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System and VA Saginaw Healthcare System \u2014 in mid-2026, the agency said.\n\nNew deployments have mostly been paused since April 2023 to focus on system improvements after reports of patient safety and technical issues. The VA plans to kick off pre-deployment work for the Michigan facilities in the coming weeks, the agency said in a Dec. 20 news release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEHR vendor Cerner \u2014 later acquired by technology giant Oracle \u2014 originally scored the contract to replace the VA\u2019s legacy medical record in 2018.\n\nBut only six medical centers have gone live with the new EHR to date, as the modernization project has faced growing costs, technical issues and errors that have been linked to patient harm.\n\nThe VA largely paused the rollout a year and a half ago to prioritize system improvements at medical centers currently using the new record, with the exception of a new deployment last spring at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois.\n\nDuring the pause, the agency negotiated a new contract with Oracle that it says increases its ability to hold the company accountable for outages, responsiveness to clinician requests and interoperability with other health systems and applications.\n\nThe hold on new deployments has been helpful at driving system improvements, VA officials say. The EHR has functioned 100% of the time in 10 of the last 16 months, and it has been more than 200 days since the last EHR outage as of early December, according to the agency.\n\nVA leaders have said the agency is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the modernization project, estimating the pause would come to an end soon. In April, VA Secretary Denis McDonough told lawmakers the agency planned to resume its rollout by the end of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nBut lawmakers have raised concerns about resuming deployments. Though VA and Oracle officials said the rollout at Lovell went well, some legislators argued in a July hearing the go-live used more resources and staff than would be available at future facilities.",

            "content": "Feature Twenty years ago next week, Oracle closed the $10.3 billion deal to buy HR and finance software specialist PeopleSoft after a fraught, drawn-out, hostile takeover.\n\nIt marked the high point in a period of tech industry takeover mania, and the zenith of Oracle\u2019s transition from a database company which also does applications to a business apps giant also present in the database market. Days after its completion, Oracle announced it was laying off around half of PeopleSoft\u2019s workforce.\n\n\"It was very dramatic,\" Bo Lykkegaard, IDC associate vice president for enterprise software, told The Register. \"The thing about the Oracle acquisition of PeopleSoft was that it was a hostile takeover. It was two very different cultures and a time when a lot of market consolidation went on. It was very large \u2014 the leading companies buying each other in the apps space \u2014 and the kind of takeover that I'd not seen before in that space.\"\n\nIt was a deal nearly 18 months in the making. From mid-2003, Oracle had made overtures to the tune of a PeopleSoft acquisition. In early June of '03, it launched a hostile bid, initially valued at $5.1 billion. Crucially, the move came only days after Peoplesoft had agreed a $1.7 billion share offer for JD Edwards, at the time one of the leading companies in ERP.\n\nThe sudden move irked both of the companies Oracle was proposing to buy in one move. On June 13 2003, JD Edwards filed a suit against Oracle in Colorado and another in California against Oracle\u2019s voluble CEO Larry Ellison and executive vice president Chuck Phillips. In the action against Oracle the company, the ERP vendor sought $1.7 billion in damages for bad behavior.\n\nA day later, PeopleSoft filed its own suit, alleging legal action against Oracle was the only way to protect its business against a \"sham\" takeover bid.\n\nPoison pills and lawsuits\n\nBy June 18, Oracle raise its offer to $19.50 per share, or around $6.3 billion in cash. Oracle had hoped its bid would undermine PeopleSoft's sales and compel shareholders to accept its offer. However, the HR and finance software vendor had other ideas. In July, PeopleSoft retaliated with a scheme that promised customers massive refunds on licenses should the deal go ahead, creating a so-called \"poison pill\" for Oracle to swallow along with its target company.\n\nLater in July, the PeopleSoft-JD Edwards deal went through, having seen 88 percent of its shares tendered, making PeopleSoft the world's second-largest enterprise software company and Oracle the third-largest. It put several new hurdles in Oracle's way.\n\nUsers, too, were soon making their voices heard. In October 2003, users of Peoplesoft and JD Edwards ERP packages in Europe said they dreaded the Oracle acquisition. A survey found 95 percent did not want the bid to succeed.\n\nIn February the following year, Big Red raised its bid for Peoplesoft again, to $26 per share, valuing its target at $9.4 billion.\n\nAfter a further knock-back from the PeopleSoft board later that month, Ellison began going over their heads to court the shareholders directly. In a letter, co-signed by then CFO Jeff Henley, Oracle said it was the \"final price,\" and a generous offer of \"compelling value\", before attacking the PeopleSoft board of directors.\n\nThen, the authorities got involved. On February 26, 2004, the US Department of Justice filed a suit to block the deal, alleging that it would result in higher prices, less innovation and fewer choices for customers.\n\nThe next month, the European Commission objected to the deal, while Oracle said it would work with the EU's enforcer to allay its concerns.\n\nIn May, Oracle cut its bid for PeopleSoft by 20 percent from $26 to $21 per share, valuing its quarry at $7.7 billion rather than $9.4 billion.\n\nIn September of 2004, Oracle scored a stunning victory as a federal judge ruled that its hostile bid for Peoplesoft was not anticompetitive. The next month, the EC case went the same way.\n\nOracle then decided to up its offer again to a \"best and final\" offer of $24 per share \u2013 or just less than $9 billion. A few days later, the PeopleSoft board rejected this.\n\nAnd then, it looked like Oracle might admit defeat. In a filing to a Delaware Court, Oracle said PeopleSoft's poison-pill promise to give its customers between two to five times their licensing fees back following a takeover could scupper its bid.\n\n\"If the PeopleSoft board is permitted to continue to issue self-serving, entrenchment-motivated contracts under the revised money-back offer, Oracle may be forced to abandon its bid as it will no longer be economically viable,\" the filing said.\n\nNonetheless, PeopleSoft investors opted to back the deal, with more than 60 percent tendering their shares to Oracle, giving the database maker the go-ahead to pursue its acquisition bid.\n\nArmed with shareholder approval, Oracle continued with its legal claim to get the PeopleSoft board to remove the poison pill blocking the takeover.\n\nLater in November, Oracle has put forth a list of four directors it wanted to nominate to PeopleSoft's board as a lever to get its merger over the line. By the middle of December, 2004, PeopleSoft admitted defeat and accepted Oracle's improved offer of $26.50 a share or $10.3 billion, roughly twice its original offer.\n\nBy the end of the year, PeopleSoft CEO David Duffield had resigned, and Oracle had parted with other senior executives including PeopleSoft CFO Kevin Parker, co-president W Phillip Wilmington, and chief marketing officer Nanci Caldwell, and went on to replace the PeopleSoft board.\n\nThe deal was finalized on January 7, 2005, and almost immediately, Oracle fired 5,000 PeopleSoft workers. Months later, Oracle acquired Siebel, the company that established the market for CRM software, for $3.61 billion, a deal it closed early the next year.\n\nWhile Oracle's E-business suite already gave it a presence in enterprise applications, so with the JD Edwards, Siebel and PeopleSoft mergers, it established deep hooks into the markets for CRM, ERP, HR and finance software.\n\nArguably, Big Red's 2009 takeover of Sun Microsystems was equally significant, giving Oracle access to Sun's high-end hardware, as well as the Solaris operating system, Java programming language, and MySQL database. That might be a story for another time, but the price was certainly lower at $7.4 billion.\n\nFusion food\n\nIt raises the question about why Oracle was prepared to pay so much for a rival application vendor and what happened next.\n\nFor a start, Oracle decided to play nicely with users. Through its Applications Unlimited policy, the vendor said it would provide comprehensive maintenance and software upgrades for its PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Siebel users \u2014 as well as users of its own E-Business Suite \u2014 until at least 2035.\n\nOk, so it is not unlimited in the literal sense, but it is more than some rivals. SAP, for example, only commits to providing mainstream support for its legacy ERP platform, ECC, until the end of 2027.\n\n\"There are still JD Edwards user groups, these guys are still out there. Applications Unlimited was one thing that ensured some consistency and stability for those acquired customers,\" said IDC's Lykkegaard. Nonetheless, Oracle does have a plan to move users of the applications it acquired to its own system. Launched in 2010, Oracle Fusion is a set of cloud-based applications the vendor claims is designed for the new fluffy platform from the ground up. The plan was to include features and functions from the Oracle E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft, and Siebel products.\n\nLykkegaard said Oracle was the only one of the big applications companies to create a next-generation platform from scratch. \"From one point of view, it devised a strategy and followed it,\" he said.\n\nBut there were a few bumps along the road. \"One of them was that Fusion was not originally intended as a cloud product, as in it was not really engineered for multi-tenancy. Oracle later architected Fusion as a cloud only, multi-tenant platform. So there was some big changes along the way.\n\n\"There was not like a beautiful, smoothly executed process, but Oracle did create a new, next generation enterprise application, which is the foundation for the cloud ERP you see today,\" he said.\n\nBut JD Edwards users might not see familiar features and functionality in Fusion, he said. \"JD Edwards was strong in certain verticals, such as food manufacturing and agriculture, and I'm not sure you can just replace that one-to-one,\" he said.\n\nOracle's Apps Unlimited policy, together with PeopleSoft and JD Edwards popularity among users, have created barriers to the preferred upgrade path.\n\nForrester industry research analyst Akshara Naik Lopez said within PeopleSoft users \u2014 and particularly JD Edward's \u2014 there is a very strong base of customer dedicated to using individual products.\n\n\"In fact, we still see a very strong base of PeopleSoft clients, the clients who actually have not moved to the full stack offering by Oracle,\" she told The Register. \"What they are doing is modernization of their PeopleSoft applications by moving from on-prem to hosting it on hyper-scalers. We are seeing a big trend of Oracle E-Business Suite clients when they look for their next upgrade, move to Fusion ERP. But any time it's a HCM-only discussion, with PeopleSoft clients, the decision is not just as straightforward as just going to Fusion HCM. They also consider the full HCM market and there are multiple options that are good competitors for Oracle in that space.\n\n\"If you look at the base of PeopleSoft and JD Edwards by themselves, they appear to be in no rush to move to Fusion or any other SaaS. They are taking their time because any time you talk about back office applications going from cap-ex to op-ex, it is a big shift for organizations,\" Lopez said. \"Although we've seen a steady adoption of SaaS in this space, it has not been exponential.\"\n\nOracle's giant PeopleSoft acquisition marked a wider consolidation in the enterprise software market: Lawson and Dutch ERP vendor Baan both became part of what would become Infor in ERP, HR software SuccessFactors became part of SAP, which also bought supply chain software Ariba and made investments in CRM. Oracle also went on to buy NetSuite, a cloud-only player for smaller enterprises.\n\nBut the mega-deal also saw a deeper integration in the software stack. Historically, SAP ERP systems \u2014 the 1990s' R/3 for example \u2014 were available on multiple databases, including Oracle, SQL Servers and IBMs\u2019 Db2. But its latest iteration of ERP software, S/4HANA is only available on its own in-memory database (HANA).\n\nOracle's E-Business Suite was only ever available on its Oracle Database Enterprise Edition, but the applications its acquired with PeopleSoft continued to be supported on multiple databases. For example, Oracle JD Edward\u2019s EnterpriseOne supports multiple databases including Db2 for i, DB2 UDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Until recently, PeopleSoft did more or less the same, although Oracle recently announced the retirement of the Db2 z/OS Database Platform for PeopleSoft.\n\nWith the market consolidation around SAP and Oracle, together with the move to an integrated SaaS stack, your enterprise applications are going to come with a database, whether you like it or not. SaaS-only Workday comes with its own in-memory database, and while older versions of Infor run on SQL Server and versions that derive from Lawson have also run on Db2, Infor has its own databases for SaaS.\n\nGartner vice president and analyst Chris Pang said CIOs tend do want to avoid being locked in, but once they had chosen an ERP system, they were effectively locked in by inertia, at least for a decade, and switching a database under an ERP system would be very rare indeed.\n\nBut the consolidation in the market and integration of the stack has created high barriers to entry, and less choice for users, particularly in ERP and supply chain.\n\nWhile Oracle may not have shifted PeopleSoft and JD Edwards users to its own platform, it's not necessarily a bad thing for the vendor.\n\n\"Oracle does not disclose numbers around the [on-prem install-base] but we estimate that it is certainly in the thousands of customers. It's not on the same scale as SAP, but certainly, in terms of the margins which are being made on the support, it is significant, so from a shareholder perspective, and an Oracle perspective, that's been a success. If you can keep the customer, and get them ready to move across, then that's a win-win situation,\" Pang told The Register.\n\nOracle declined the invitation to comment. In the 20 years since it finally closed the deal on one of the largest and hard-fought tech takeovers of the century, it might not have converted as many acquired customers to its preferred upgrade path as it would like. But then, through its generous support margins, it wins anyway. Enterprise users looking for more choice in the market might not see it the same way. \u00ae",

More than 200 days have passed since the last outage.\n\n\"We paused deployments of the EHR for more than a year and a half to listen to veterans and clinicians, understand the issues, and make improvements to the system,\" VA Deputy Secretary Tanya Bradsher said in a statement. \"As a result of those efforts, veteran trust and system performance have improved across the board.\"\n\nThe system was introduced to one facility during the VA's pause, a joint deployment with the Defense Department at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe launch marked the end of the Pentagon's adoption of the system across its medical facilities and was deemed a success by VA officials.\n\n\"It's going better than anyone expected,\" Dr. Robert Buckley, the facility's director, said during a House hearing in May. \"And I'm going to say that because we have phenomenal staff, we have staff that are committed to being a high-reliability health care organization, to use whatever tools we need to, um, to make sure that our patients get the very best care possible.\"\n\nAccording to the VA, the Michigan sites will begin the lengthy process required for a successful deployment in the coming weeks.\n\nRelated: VA Delays Rollout of Troubled Electronic Medical Records System to More Hospitals",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL), a major player in the tech industry, has taken crucial steps this year to make up for lost time and catch up with its competitors in AI and quantum computing. Despite entering the AI race later than some of its peers, Oracle\u2019s recent initiatives and strategic investments show its commitment to becoming a key player in these life-changing fields. The company\u2019s latest Q2 2025 earnings were strong overall, but it did miss revenue and EPS estimates, which tempered down the general good vibes a bit.\n\nDon't Miss Our New Year's Offers:\n\nDiscover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks\n\nMake smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter\n\nI recommend reading what our analyst at Tipranks, Oliver Rodzianko, has written about the ORCL\u2019s long-term prospects here.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore Oracle\u2019s financial performance, its AI and quantum computing collaborations, and the implications of its Smart Score of 8.\n\nFinancial Performance and Q2 2025 Results: Oracle\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings report paints a picture of a company on the move. With total revenue hitting $14.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and a GAAP EPS of $1.10, up 24% year-over-year, Oracle is showing strong financial health. The company\u2019s cloud revenue, which includes AI-driven services, rose to $5.9 billion, marking a 24% increase year-over-year. Additionally, Oracle\u2019s investment in AI and quantum computing is evident, with approximately $4 billion spent in Q2 2025 alone, a 72% increase from the previous quarter. These investments are crucial as Oracle aims to enhance its technological capabilities and secure its position in the market.\n\nAI and Quantum Collaborations: Oracle\u2019s collaborations with tech giants solidify its AI industry status despite arriving late to the party. The partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA) stands out, as it aims to deliver accelerated computing and generative AI services, integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure across Oracle\u2019s cloud services. Furthermore, Oracle\u2019s multi-cloud partnership with Google Cloud (GOOGL) allows customers to combine Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Google Cloud technologies. Another notable collaboration is with Microsoft Azure (MSFT), offering multi-cloud services to run Oracle software on Azure and Oracle Cloud. Finally, Oracle has probably learned its lesson and is not waiting for an invitation to the quantum party. It has collaborated with VMware and Nvidia to advance hybrid quantum computing services in cloud infrastructure, using Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and the CUDA quantum open-source platform.\n\nSmart Score of 8 and Its Implications: Oracle\u2019s Smart Score of 8 on TipRanks indicates an outperform rating and reflects a positive outlook for the company. This score is based on various metrics, including analyst consensus, blogger sentiment, hedge fund trends, and insider transactions. This Smart Score of 8 highlights the market\u2019s confidence in Oracle\u2019s strategic direction and potential for future growth.\n\nIs ORCL Stock a Buy?\n\nOn Wall Street, Oracle is a Moderate Buy. The average price target of ORCL stock is $193.38, implying a 16.05% upside potential.\n\nSee more ORCL analyst ratings\n\nTakeaway\n\nOracle recently posted strong results for Q2 2025, albeit slightly missing estimates for revenues and EPS. Its commitment to AI and now to the quantic industry showcases the company\u2019s long-term foresight. As one of the big actors in the tech industry, where no one can stagnate for too long, otherwise, they\u2019ll just dissipate, ORCL\u2019s crafting a solid niche for themselves in the AI and quantum future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

It is transforming the technology industry through advancing innovation, efficiency, and new opportunities across multiple sectors. Top tech companies such as Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, and Nvidia NVDA continue to control the stock market.\n\nAside from these well-known tech stocks, there are a few other undervalued options under $250 that could be valuable additions to your portfolio in 2025. With a market capitalization of $466 billion, Oracle ORCL has been a long-standing player in the tech industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs analysts, led by Ryan Hammond, believe platform stocks such as MongoDB MDB could be the \"primary beneficiaries of the next wave of generative AI investments.\" Let\u2019s see if now is a good time to buy these great tech stocks.\n\nTech Stock #1: Oracle Corporation\n\nThe first tech stock on my list is Oracle Corporation, the largest enterprise-grade database and application software provider. Its products and services include Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Cloud, and Oracle Engineered Systems, among others.\n\nThe company\u2019s better-than-expected earnings in 2024 boosted investor confidence, leading to a surge in its stock price. The stock soared 60.1% in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 Index\u2019s SPX gain of 24%.\n\nThe company operates in three segments. The cloud and license segment generates the majority of Oracle\u2019s revenue. It includes Oracle cloud service subscriptions as well as on-premises software license support. The company\u2019s cloud offerings include Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Fusion Cloud Applications, among others. The other two segments are hardware, which includes Oracle Engineered Systems, and services, which assist customers in optimizing the performance of their Oracle applications and infrastructure.\n\nOracle has integrated AI capabilities into its cloud services and applications, thereby enhancing their functionality and appeal. In the third quarter, total revenue increased 9% to $14.1 billion, with the cloud and license segment up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.47. The total remaining performance obligation (RPO), which refers to contracted revenue that has yet to be earned, increased by 49% to $97 billion.\n\nOracle also pays dividends, which adds to its appeal to income investors. It yields 0.95%, compared to the technology sector\u2019s average of 1.37%. Its low payout ratio of 19.5% also makes the dividend payments sustainable for now.\n\nThe global cloud computing market is expected to reach $2.29 trillion by 2030. Oracle\u2019s investments in cloud infrastructure and applications position it to benefit from this growth. However, it operates in a highly competitive environment, with rivals such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon\u2019s AWS, and Google GOOGL Cloud, which together account for 63% of the cloud market. Oracle owns just 3% of this market.\n\nOracle\u2019s prospects are dependent on its ability to implement its growth strategy effectively. Sustained double-digit growth in cloud services is critical to maintaining investor confidence.\n\nAt the end of the quarter, Oracle\u2019s balance sheet showed cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $11.3 billion. The company also generated free cash flow of $9.5 billion, which allowed it to effectively manage its debt while funding acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders via dividends.\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s balance sheet remains strong, competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft have significant capital and resources, posing a constant threat.\n\nAnalysts that cover Oracle stock expect its revenue and earnings to increase by 8.9% and 10.7% in fiscal 2025. Revenue and earnings are further expected to grow by 12.5% and 14.5%, respectively, in fiscal 2026. Trading at 23x forward 2026 earnings, Oracle is a reasonable tech stock to buy now, backed by its strong financial performance, competitive advantages, and exposure to high-growth markets.\n\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About ORCL Stock?\n\nOverall, analysts\u2019 ratings for Oracle are generally positive, with 20 maintaining a \"Strong Buy\" or \"Outperform\" rating out of the 32 analysts covering the stock. Plus, 11 analysts recommend a \u201cHold,\u201d and one suggests a \u201cStrong Sell.\" The average target price for Oracle stock is $193.63, representing potential upside of 16.2% from its current levels. The high price estimate of $220 suggests the stock can rally as much as 32% this year.\n\nTech Stock#2: MongoDB\n\nThe second on my list is an emerging AI company, MongoDB. With a market cap of $17.3 billion, MongoDB is emerging as a leading name in the database management space. Its business is built around database solutions, with MongoDB Atlas serving as its flagship product, a cloud-based database-as-a-service (DBaaS). Atlas has been deployed on major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, accounting for a majority of MongoDB\u2019s revenue, and has been a key driver of its growth.\n\nMongoDB stock has fallen 36% over the past 52 weeks compared to the broader market\u2019s 24% gain. This dip could be a great buying opportunity, as Wall Street expects the stock to soar this year.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue increased by an impressive 22% year on year to $529.4 million, with Atlas revenue growing by 26%. The company\u2019s subscription-based revenue model guarantees a consistent stream of recurring income, which increased by 22% in the quarter.\n\nMongoDB offers consulting, training, and implementation services to help businesses make the most of their database solutions. Services revenue increased by 18% to $17.2 million in Q3. Adjusted earnings per share stood at $1.16, an increase of 20.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nCompared to $1.68 billion in revenue and EPS of $3.33 in fiscal 2024, management expects fiscal 2025 revenue of $1.975 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.02. Analysts predict that the company\u2019s revenue will increase by 17.6%, but earnings may fall to $3.05, higher than the company\u2019s estimate.\n\nHowever, in fiscal 2026, the company\u2019s earnings could increase by 9.3% to $3.33 per share, followed by a 17.2% increase in revenue. MDB stock is trading at seven times forward 2026 sales, compared to its five-year historical average of 21x.\n\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About MDB Stock?\n\nOverall, Wall Street rates MDB stock a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d Out of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 22 rate it a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d three suggest it\u2019s a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d five rate it a \u201cHold,\" and two recommend a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThe average target price for MDB stock is $378.86, representing potential upside of 62.7% from its current levels. The high price estimate of $430 suggests the stock can rally as much as 84.7% this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Earnings Growth 75.49% See Full Analysis\n\nMicron NASDAQ: MU is a leading memory chipmaker for legacy technologies and is now the AI leader. AI requires lots of memory for training and inference, and the solution is HBM. High bandwidth memory provides the capacity and power needed, and Micron\u2019s HBM3E technology is the best. The HBM3E architecture provides industry-leading capacity and power usage, which is critical for AI function and cost. The more advanced AI becomes, the more power it consumes, increasing operating costs.\n\nRegarding demand, the legacy business continues to weigh on results but is offset by robust growth in the higher-margin data center and AI industries. The company is taking share in those categories, growing its data center business 40% sequentially in Q3, 400% compared to the previous year, and is expecting strength to continue. The forecast is for the HBM market to double sequentially in Q4 and then quadruple in size over the next few years. The estimates for systemwide revenue growth is for it to double within the next two years and sustain record levels for the subsequent three to five years.\n\nThe analysts moderated the price target outlook at the end of 2024 but continue to expect a robust gain.

Today, Oracle\u2019s subscription-based cloud business has surpassed its legacy product business in terms of its contribution to the net, and its share is growing.\n\nOracle is not only a budding hyperscaler building some of the most advanced data centers on the planet but also a leading provider of services for AI developers and AI-enhanced data management services. It has partnerships with the three leading hyperscalers, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, embedding its tools into their networks, making it the most readily accessible and easy-to-use database on the market.\n\nResults in 2024 include slowing growth, with legacy business offsetting the cloud, but also evidence of mounting leverage. The company\u2019s remaining performance obligation, RPO, was up nearly 50% at the end of CQ3 due to strength in next-gen technologies. This suggests revenue growth will accelerate as the year progresses and remain strong well into 2026 or later. Analysts rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and see it advancing at least 8% from 2024\u2019s closing price. However, the revisions trend is positive, with the consensus up 7% in December and 45% for the year, pointing to a much larger 25% gain at the range\u2019s high end.\n\nPalo Alto Changes With the Times: Secures AI Using AI\n\nPalo Alto Networks MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 88th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 12.5% Upside Short Interest Level Bearish Dividend Strength N/A Environmental Score -0.58 News Sentiment 1.58 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj.

Not only is AI driving an increase in cyber threats and their severity, but Palo Alto\u2019s ability to detect, prevent, and mitigate those threats.\n\nThe critical development for Palo Alto Networks investors is the move to platformization. Unifying its tool into a single, easier-to-use format is critical to retaining existing clients and gaining new ones. Results from 2024 reveal that the near-term impact of the plan on revenue and earnings growth was less than feared, and the potential for gains was more than forecasted. Analysts rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and see it rising 10% at MarketBeat\u2019s reported consensus and another 20% at the high-end range.\n\nBefore you consider Micron Technology, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Micron Technology wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Micron Technology currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "Oracle Corporation Japan's ( ) recent earnings report didn't offer any surprises, with the shares unchanged over the last week. We did some analysis to find out why and believe that investors might be missing some encouraging factors contained in the earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZooming In On Oracle Corporation Japan's Earnings\n\nAs finance nerds would already know, the accrual ratio from cashflow is a key measure for assessing how well a company's free cash flow (FCF) matches its profit. The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. This ratio tells us how much of a company's profit is not backed by free cashflow.\n\nAs a result, a negative accrual ratio is a positive for the company, and a positive accrual ratio is a negative. That is not intended to imply we should worry about a positive accrual ratio, but it's worth noting where the accrual ratio is rather high. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nOver the twelve months to November 2024, Oracle Corporation Japan recorded an accrual ratio of -0.17. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. In fact, it had free cash flow of JP\u00a571b in the last year, which was a lot more than its statutory profit of JP\u00a558.3b. Oracle Corporation Japan did see its free cash flow drop year on year, which is less than ideal, like a Simpson's episode without Groundskeeper Willie.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Oracle Corporation Japan's Profit Performance\n\nHappily for shareholders, Oracle Corporation Japan produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that Oracle Corporation Japan's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 17% per year over the last three years. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. Obviously, we love to consider the historical data to inform our opinion of a company. But it can be really valuable to consider what other analysts are forecasting. Luckily, you can check out .\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Oracle Corporation Japan's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Oracle Corp's (ORCL, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-01, Oracle Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $79.16. It's currently trading at a price of $166.64. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -110.51%. The company is significantly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Oracle Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $5.46 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 8.50%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 48.26 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 30.91 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 79.16\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $38.95. This valuation indicates that the Oracle Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -327.83%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\n\nNavigating with GuruFocus:\n\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

            "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on Friday from TikTok and its China-based owner ByteDance, which is seeking to block a law signed by President Joe Biden that will ban the short-form video app beginning Jan. 19 unless it is divested from ByteDance, due to national security concerns. TikTok requested an injunction to pause the ban during the legal process, but the Supreme Court did not immediately act on the request.\n\nHere\u2019s what could happen on Jan. 19.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nWhat happens to the app?\n\nNew users will not be able to download TikTok from app stores and existing users will not be able to update the app, because the law prohibits any entity from facilitating the download or maintenance of the TikTok application. In a Dec. 13 letter, U.S. lawmakers told Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which operate the two main mobile app stores, that they must be ready to remove TikTok from their stores on Jan. 19.\n\nCloud service provider Oracle could see some disruption to its work with TikTok. Oracle hosts TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data on its servers, reviews the app\u2019s source code and delivers the app to the app stores.\n\nGoogle declined to comment, while Oracle and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHow will users be affected?\n\nTikTok\u2019s 170 million users in the U.S. will likely still be able to use the app because it is already downloaded on their phones, experts say. But over time, without software and security updates, the app will become unusable.\n\nSome users have begun posting TikTok videos instructing others on how to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which mask an internet user\u2019s location, as a way to circumvent the possible ban.\n\nContent creators who have built businesses from their TikTok followings are preparing for the worst. Nadya Okamoto, who has 4.1 million followers and founded August, a menstrual products brand, said TikTok helped her business grow organically through viral videos. A TikTok ban could force her and other small businesses to spend more on marketing and raise their costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cIf TikTok goes away, we\u2019ll be okay, but it is going to be a hard hit.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to TikTok\u2019s employees?\n\nTikTok\u2019s 7,000 employees in the U.S. are still trying to figure out their fate. After a U.S. appeals court upheld the sell-or-ban law on Dec. 6, pessimism spread among staffers who began worrying about layoffs, said one current employee.\n\nBut the company has continued to make job offers for new roles, prompting some confused job seekers to seek advice on Blind, an anonymous forum for employees to discuss companies.\n\nOne user posted on Blind that they received a job offer from ByteDance in San Jose, California, starting in February. Others commented on the post, counseling the user to accept the offer and use it as leverage in other interviews.\n\n\u201cI signed the offer and will wait and watch how the situation unfolds,\u201d the user said in the Blind post.\n\nWhat will advertisers do?\n\nTikTok\u2019s U.S. ad revenue is expected to total $12.3 billion in 2024, according to research firm Emarketer, and while that is much smaller than Instagram owner Meta Platforms, advertisers say TikTok\u2019s devoted user base means some brands will try to advertise beyond Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing assumption is the app might not be updatable, but you\u2019ll see a groundswell of usage,\u201d said Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3. The app\u2019s ecommerce feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, has no direct competitor that advertisers can easily switch to, Atkinson said, adding that his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns even as of late December.\n\nSome advertisers may continue spending beyond Jan. 19 on TikTok and reevaluate if the app sees declining usage or performance, said Jason Lee, executive vice president of brand safety at media agency Horizon Media.\n\nAre there potential buyers?\n\nTikTok has repeatedly said it cannot be sold from ByteDance. That hasn\u2019t deterred billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team who said he has secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.\n\nMcCourt has not yet spoken with ByteDance, but said he believes the Supreme Court will uphold the law requiring TikTok\u2019s divestment.",

Tesla (TSLA) has some good news for potential customers of its Cybertruck pickup truck.\n\nToday, on 1st January 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) updated its website to include new hybrid and electric vehicles for this year\u2019s tax eligibility.\n\nInterestingly, when you select the year 2025 and Tesla as the manufacturer, the page shows Cybertruck as qualified for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit. Just a day before (31st Dec 2024), the EPA website did not show Cybertruck as qualified for this tax break.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nAerial photo of a Cybertruck parked at a Tesla Supercharger station. Credit: Courtesy of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n\nAccording to the EPA, only two variants of the Cybertruck are eligible for the full $7,500 Federal Tax Credit in 2025:\n\nCybertruck Single Motor\n\nCybertruck Dual-Motor AWD\n\nThese two variants qualify for the federal tax incentive because their MSRP is below $80,000. The price tag of Tesla Cybertruck AWD is $79,990 \u2014 barely below the threshold.\n\nTesla hasn\u2019t started production of the Single Motor Cybertruck variant. Therefore, it\u2019s not yet available. However, looking at the price difference of the top-end Cyberbeast ($99,990), the Cybertruck Single Motor should be priced at around $59,990.\n\nScreenshot: EPA website showing Tesla EVs qualified for the 2025 Federal Tax Credit of $7,500.

The online Cybertruck vehicle configurator, but apparently, it hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect the latest tax savings on the EV pickup truck purchase.\n\nThe Cybertruck configurator still shows the old tax credit for business and commercial customers. But as of 1st January 2025, retail buyers will also be able to get a $7,500 federal tax incentive on the purchase of Cybertruck AWD and Single Motor (not yet in production).\n\nEPA mentioning the Cybertruck Single Motor RWD variant in the tax incentive list suggests that Tesla plans to start production of this base variant this year.\n\nThe good thing about this tax incentive is that the $7,500 will be directly deducted from the price of the Tesla Cybertruck at the time of its purchase. For eligible individuals and families, Cybertruck AWD now starts at $72,490.\n\n\u2013 Sponsored \u2013\n\nStay tuned for constant Tesla updates, follow us on:\n\nGoogle News | Flipboard | X (Twitter) | WhatsApp Channel | RSS (Feedly).\n\nRelated Cybertruck News",

The band had shown on early singles that they held a great talent for penning their own original material, with songs such as \u2018She\u2019s Not There\u2019 being the most notable tracks from the record that showcased this. However, their decision to fill the majority of the record with covers of other artists was what ultimately saw them fail to hit the highs that were promised and left them languishing behind their contemporaries in the Beatles and the Kinks, who were beginning to establish themselves with more forward-thinking original material.\n\nThe band opted to self-fund their follow-up album, and in 1968, after plenty of reinvention, they released Odessey and Oracle, an album that saw them delve further into ambitious psychedelic pop with lush arrangements and inspired production. Songs such as \u2018Care of Cell 44\u2019 and \u2018Beechwood Park\u2019 are indicative of the genius songwriting that core members Rod Argent and Chris White had in their arsenal, and the distinct lack of covers meant that they had afforded themselves an entire album to show off their talents.\n\nReleased via CBS, the critical and commercial response to the record deserved to be much greater than what they had experienced for Begin Here three years prior, and they had rectified all of the errors that held back their debut album from being a success. However, the band were once again on the receiving end of a lukewarm reaction, and fearing that they\u2019d never manage to make it out of the mire they had found themselves in, the band called it a day and pursued their own projects.\n\nAfter the band\u2019s demise, people began to recognise the brilliance of Odessey and Oracle, and slowly, over time, it has begun to experience a reappraisal that has rightfully recognised it as a lost masterpiece by the general public. Many other musicians cite the record as being on par with some of the other classic psychedelic pop records of the era and either hold it in high regard or look to it as having been a major influence on their own work.\n\nWhen interviewed by Filter in 2005 about their favourite records of all time, Foo Fighters\u2019 Taylor Hawkins and Nate Mendel heaped praise on Odessey and Oracle, with Hawkins stating that he believed it to be \u201cthe lost Sgt. Pepper.\u201d\n\nContinuing to explain the unusual legacy behind the record, he divulged that it \u201cwas recorded at Abbey Road around the same time, but it tanked\u201d before acknowledging the sudden resurgence it had after the band called it a day. \u201cA year later, \u2018Time Of The Season\u2019 got big in America,\u201d Hawkins explained, referring to the album\u2019s closing track, which was released via Date Records as a single in 1969.\n\n\u201cNobody talked about that record forever,\u201d Mendel added, \u201cI thought I was the only one.\u201d\n\nWhile there are now plenty who talk about this unsung treasure of a record, it took far too long for it to get its flowers, and was sadly the last thing the band would do together for 23 years before they reformed for New World. The band\u2019s legacy is now far stronger thanks to the delayed praise they received for Odessey and Oracle, but who knows what they could have gone on to achieve if they had been rightfully lauded for it at the time.",

            "content": "\"This WIP is a GCC front-end for Algol 68, the fascinating, generally poorly understood and often vilified programming language. It is common knowledge that Algol 68 was well ahead of its time back when it was introduced, and anyone who knows the language well will suspect this probably still holds true today, but more than fifty years after the publication of the Revised Report the world may finally be ready for it, or perhaps not, we shall see ;) At the very least having support in GCC will make it easier for Algol 68 enthusiasts to write, share and use their programs in modern systems.\n\n\n\nThis is work in progress, but the front-end can already compile most of the main language constructs and many full programs.\"\n\nMere hours into 2025 and some news I didn't expect to be writing about... An Oracle engineer has posted a set of patches implementing an ALGOL 68 programming language front-end for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). These are work-in-progress patches for the half century old niche programming language.It was last month that the COBOL front-end patches for GCC were seeing new patch activity. Many criticized that as being old and out of place. Well, the ALGOL 68 front-end patches are even more unexpected and not something I expected to be writing about in 2025.ALGOL 68 is an imperative programming language that debuted in 1968. But it's usage has always been rather niche and with very limited use. Back in the early 2000s there was a GPL-licensed ALGOL 68 GPL-based compiler published (a68g) and experimental GCC front-end patches before... Jose Marchesi of Oracle worked on the ALGOL 68 experimental front-end patches before but it wasn't on my bingo card to see this work trying to go mainline in GCC in 2025.Marchesi wrote this New Year's day on the GCC mailing list:But not all of the ALGOL 68 language features are yet to be implemented. The hope is for GNU Algol 68 to be a strict super-language of the Algol 68 report.For those wanting to see some ALGOL 68 code samples\n\nThose interested in the ALGOL 68 programming language in 2025 can find the work-in-progress patches on the GCC mailing list . We'll see how the progress and review on these patches go and if the ALGOL 68 front-end manages to become accepted in mainline GCC in 2025.",

            "content": "Oracle (ORCL) was down slightly as 2024 drew to a close, but count the year as its best this century. Oracle is on pace to close 2024 up by roughly 60%, the tech stalwart's best performance since it rocketed nearly 300% in 1999.\n\nShares of the database software company, founded in 1977, have soared as Oracle's cloud infrastructure business is attracting AI startups that need cloud computing power to train their algorithms. AI demand is among factors that helped Oracle give an upbeat long-term sales outlook this fall. You can read more about what's behind Oracle's big year here.\n\nOracle's gains have boosted the fortunes of its founder Larry Ellison. Ellison's net worth has climbed to just under $210 billion, according to Forbes estimates, trailing only Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for the title of richest man in the world. The 80-year-old Ellison stepped down as chief executive a decade ago but remains Oracle's chairman.\n\nOn the stock market today, Oracle stock shed a fraction to 166.13. ORCL shares have slumped in recent weeks from a high of 198.31 that the stock reached on Dec. 9. Oracle's earnings report that same day missed expectations for earnings and sales. The stock fell 7% and has mostly traded lower since then.\n\nAI Debate Spills Over Into 2025\n\nThe late slump previews the scrutiny Oracle stock will be under from investors next year as its seeks to build on its big 2024. Oracle's November-quarter results didn't miss estimates by much, but analysts noted that the company faced elevated investor expectations heading into the report.\n\nThat will certainly continue into 2025. Oracle will need to continue the strong growth of its cloud infrastructure business to prove it can benefit from AI in a cloud market still dominated by Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Oracle stock was downgraded to a sell call from neutral by Brian White, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt.\n\n\"Oracle represents a high-quality company with the opportunity to participate in a cloud transformation and benefit from the generative AI trend,\" White wrote. \"However, valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Oracle stock was named a top 2025 software pick by analysts at Evercore ISI earlier this month. Evercore's Kirk Materne wrote that he expects that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business can maintain a sales growth rate of more than 50%, helped by AI.\n\n\"We believe the risk/reward continues to look attractive as we head into 2025, especially after the recent post-earnings pullback,\" Evercore ISI's Kirk Materne wrote.\n\nOracle Stock's Relative Strength\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks typically have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nOracle's IBD Relative Strength Rating is 86 out of 99, down from a score of 92 four weeks ago.

            "content": "The year 2024 was again one of change for the power generation industry. Increasing electricity demand projections have brought with them concerns about grid reliability and potential clashes with sustainability goals. New opportunities for natural gas and nuclear power emerged. Utility-scale solar and battery storage capacity additions again broke records. Former President Donald Trump won the November election and is set to take office in January, likely meaning changes for power plant emission rules and clean energy legislative provisions.\n\nAs we turn the page toward 2025, we\u2019re taking a look back at some of the biggest headlines throughout the year.\n\n1. Oracle Designing Data Center Powered by Small Modular Reactors \u2013 Sept. 11\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Oracle announced it would be designing a data center to be powered by three small modular reactors (SMRs). The company\u2019s Chairman, Larry Ellison, highlighted this project as part of Oracle\u2019s response to the growing electricity demands driven by AI and cloud services. Like other tech companies, Oracle is turning to next-generation nuclear power to support its massive data center operations globally.\n\n2. Vogtle Unit 4 Reaches First Criticality \u2013 Feb. 14\n\nGeorgia Power announced a significant step with Vogtle Unit 4, marking the achievement of initial criticality, a key milestone in nuclear reactor startup. Unit 4 officially entered commercial operations on April 29. The long-awaited completion of Vogtle\u2019s two new AP-1000 reactors (3 & 4) was a major development in the U.S. nuclear industry after decades without new nuclear units.\n\n3. Here Comes the Gas Boom (Again) \u2013 June 19\n\nNatural gas is back in the spotlight as utilities plan for a significant increase in gas plants to ensure grid reliability, amid growing demand for energy from data centers, AI and manufacturing. This re-published article from Burns & McDonnell highlighted long-lead times for equipment and that the gas sector\u2019s role in the energy transition would remain critical in the coming years.\n\n4. Corrosion Cracking at Palisades Nuclear Plant Exceeds Estimates \u2013 Oct. 3\n\nThe Palisades Nuclear Plant, which ceased operations in 2022, is on the path to unretirement. However, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) found unexpected challenges with stress corrosion cracking in the plant\u2019s steam generators. Despite these setbacks, Holtec International aims to restart the plant in 2025, marking the first-ever recommissioning of a retired U.S. nuclear plant. Holtec also has future plans to install small modular reactors on-site.\n\n5. AWS Acquires Data Center Campus at Susquehanna Nuclear Station \u2013 Mar. 5\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) acquired a data center campus connected to the Susquehanna Nuclear Station in Pennsylvania, with plans to expand its operations and consume up to 960 MW of power. The deal underscores the growing trend of tech giants and developers seeking reliable, carbon-free nuclear energy for their data centers. In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order denying a revised Interconnection Service Agreement (ISA) proposal that would have allowed expanded co-located load at the Susquehanna-AWS data center colocation site.\n\nWe appreciate the power generation and utility industry for their readership and support. We would like to remind you to register for POWERGEN International, the industry\u2019s leading event, which is back in Dallas at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, February 11-13, 2025.\n\nSincerely,",

Technology stocks have been some of the market's best long-term performers, and the technology sector's total weighting in the S&P 500 has expanded to about 31%.\n\n\n\nEven mega-cap companies like Alphabet Inc. (ticker: GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) that aren't technically classified as tech companies by the Global Industry Classification Standard have businesses that revolve around disruptive technology, such as artificial intelligence and cloud services. Here's a look at the 10 biggest U.S.-listed public tech companies:\n\nCompany Market Capitalization Apple Inc. (AAPL) $3.8 trillion Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) $3.32 trillion Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) $3.15 trillion Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) $1.09 trillion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) $1.03 trillion Oracle Corp. (ORCL) $454 billion Salesforce Inc. (CRM) $320 billion SAP SE (SAP) $290 billion ASML Holding NV (ASML) $280 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) $236 billion\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nNot only is Apple the most valuable company in the world, it is also one of the most profitable companies. While Apple's revenue growth has slowed, it reported a whopping $93.7 billion in net income in fiscal 2024. Its massive profits supported $94.9 billion in annual buybacks. One of Apple's next profit growth opportunities could be the rollout of its long-awaited, internally designed cellular modem chips starting in 2025. Apple's vertical integration strategy and ongoing product innovation could help the company improve iPhone profit margins in the next several years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.8 trillion\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nHigh-end semiconductor maker Nvidia has been one of the most spectacular growth stories in the entire stock market since the 2008 financial crisis. In March 2009, Nvidia's market cap was under $5 billion. Just 16 years later, Nvidia's historic bull run has sent the stock's market capitalization soaring above $3 trillion, and the company continues to churn out impressive growth numbers thanks to booming AI infrastructure demand. Not only was Nvidia the best-performing stock on this list in 2024, it was the third best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 for the year.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.32 trillion\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest software company and is known for its Windows operating system, Azure cloud services, LinkedIn social media platform, Office professional software suite and Xbox gaming brand. Microsoft is one of the oldest companies on this list. The company was founded in 1975 and went public in 1986. Nearly half a century after its founding, Microsoft's pivot to subscription-based software, professional cloud services and AI technology has helped it maintain the revenue growth long-term investors have come to expect. Microsoft is hoping its investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will help usher in its next era of growth.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.15 trillion\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

(AVGO)\n\nBroadcom is a diversified designer, developer and supplier of analog semiconductor devices. Broadcom has been a 20-bagger stock for investors in the past decade, gaining more than 2,234%. Those returns don't even include the stock's 1.1% dividend. In addition to its impressive organic revenue growth, Broadcom's 2023 acquisition of VMware could significantly boost its software capabilities. Broadcom is highly exposed to Apple device sales and should also continue to benefit from growth in data center networking and AI infrastructure spending. VMware could help Broadcom diversify into higher-margin, recurring software sales, providing additional financial visibility for investors.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.09 trillion\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest contract chipmaker, producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips designed by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and other customers. Taiwan Semiconductor was founded back in 1987 and has been the leading dedicated global semiconductor foundry ever since, generating a 793% return for investors in the past decade. In recent years, Taiwan Semi's foundries have become even more important to the tech world given Intel Corp. (INTC) has struggled with its in-house manufacturing processes. Taiwan Semiconductor holds an impressive 64% share of the global semiconductor foundry market.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.03 trillion\n\n\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nOracle is one of the world's largest enterprise software and cloud services providers, specializing in database management software. Oracle has stable top-line growth, generates consistent profits, has an attractive valuation and is reinvesting excess income in stock buybacks and its 0.8% dividend. Oracle has world-class data center infrastructure, and its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system helps manufacturers manage their processes, including planning and purchasing materials. The company claims its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Supercluster is currently the largest, fastest AI supercomputer available in the cloud. AI chipmaker Nvidia is one of Oracle's major cloud computing customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $454 billion\n\nSalesforce Inc. (CRM)\n\nSalesforce is the world's largest provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software. While Salesforce's revenue growth has slowed in recent years, its profits and margins have increased. Salesforce was a pioneer of the software-as-a-service model, and the company's aggressive acquisition strategy has allowed it to build the most comprehensive portfolio of CRM products in the market. Salesforce's large customer base creates opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, and the company has a history of high customer retention rates. Salesforce automation remains a high-growth market, and AI technology investments could help Salesforce capture even more market share in the coming years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $320 billion\n\nSAP SE (SAP)\n\nSAP is a global leader in ERP software. The company offers several AI-driven business solutions to help companies optimize finance, supply chains, procurement, sales and marketing. SAP's Qualtrics segment sells experience management cloud solutions. The company's intelligent spending category includes Ariba and Concur, which focus on procurement, travel and expense reporting. SAP is transitioning its business to a cloud-based model, and it has reported early success with its AI products, including its digital copilot, Joule. SAP's ability to consistently secure large-scale deals is a testament to its value to customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $290 billion\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML)\n\nASML is headquartered in the Netherlands and is one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers. The global semiconductor market could become a $1 trillion industry by 2032, and ASML is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Chipmakers use EUV technology to print increasingly smaller chip designs. ASML doesn't design or produce any chips itself, it simply designs the machines that create cutting-edge chips for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other chipmakers. Given ASML's key role in semiconductor manufacturing and its lack of competition, the company has plenty of growth opportunities ahead.\n\nMarket capitalization: $280 billion\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)\n\nCisco Systems provides networking, cloud, and cybersecurity hardware and software. Cisco is a rare value among mega-cap tech stocks given its shares trade at just a 16 forward earnings multiple. It also pays an attractive 2.7% dividend. Cisco is a market leader in enterprise networking, including switching, routing and wireless access. The company also has complementary businesses in security and collaboration services, adding diversification and cross-selling opportunities. While the rise of the public cloud has threatened Cisco's legacy business, the company has successfully pivoted its networking business to focus more on software and public cloud services.",

            "content": "Over the past few months, there\u2019s been quite an online furor about Tesla Cybertruck\u2019s third-party insurance status and whether the elite electric vehicle faces insurance coverage problems. Although rumors about Cybertruck\u2019s negative insurable status still surface, these have primarily proven unfounded.\n\nThe Cybertruck was unveiled by Tesla as a concept vehicle in 2019 and was first released to the public four and a half years later. Since its November 2023 release, Tesla has issued six Cybertruck recalls, with adjustments to warning lights, accelerator pedals, trim parts, windshield wipers, trunk beds, rear cameras, and drive inverters.\n\nIn January 2024, Tesla recalled Cybertrucks to amend warning lights to be larger, as they were difficult to see. It then secured its accelerator pedals after an April recall. In June, trucks recalled had trim pieces altered for greater road safety and adjustments to front windshield wipers to alleviate risks of malfunction under electrical overstress. The fifth recall in September involved a firmware update on the Cybertruck\u2019s backup camera.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nTesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen hits the Cybertruck body with a sledgehammer at the first unveiling event in 2019. Credit: Courtesy of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).\n\nFinally, in November, Tesla recalled the Cybertruck to rectify a loss of wheel drive power because of faulty drive inverters. The most recent voluntary recall came almost a year after its initial release \u2014 a month after an X post alleged that the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) had canceled third-party insurance on the Tesla electric pickup truck.\n\nThe post included a letter from GEICO stating that \u201cthis type of vehicle doesn\u2019t meet our underwriting guidelines,\u201d which appeared to substantiate the claim. The same letter also refers directly to the recipient\u2019s policy, however, further stating that \u201call coverage on the 2024 Tesla Cybertruck provided by GEICO Casualty Co., under the above policy number, will non-renew.\u201d This indicated that the cancellation pertained directly to the concerned individual policy.\n\nThe since-deleted post went viral on X and the social platform Reddit. Some believed the fifth Cybertruck recall, which happened only days before the X post, combined with the previous ones, might have prompted the auto insurance giant to act.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nBaseball bat bents after beating the Cybertruck (video here). Credit: Unknown via @Greggertruck / X (Twitter).\n\nWhen posed the question, GEICO quickly quashed the rumors, denying a blanket cancellation of all Cybertruck policies. The individual nature of the details in the abovementioned letter appears to substantiate this. The second-largest vehicle insurance underwriter stated, \u201cGEICO has coverage available nationwide for the Tesla Cybertruck.\u201d\n\nSince the fourth Cybertruck recall in June 2024, the Tesla model\u2019s sales have soared in the year\u2019s third quarter. It\u2019s estimated that 16,692 in sales far eclipsed the 11,558 Cybertrucks sold in the first two quarters of 2024. With this sharp rise in sales and Tesla\u2019s propensity for quick recalls to rectify discovered minor flaws, it\u2019s unlikely that auto insurance companies would enforce blanket policy cancelations.\n\nIn light of the recent social media claim, some Cybertruck owners might still consider taking out optional insurance with other policies. Signs indicate that Tesla\u2019s electric pickup trucks and additional models are performing well in the market and should continue receiving mandatory coverage.\n\nHowever, mandatory coverage often provides only third-party insurance, covering injuries and property damage to others affected in accidents. Optional insurance, regularly taken through different providers at additional cost, affords the owner protection for their own vehicle and injuries and is valuable in case of an accident.\n\nAn emerging truth is that GEICO will cancel specific Cybertruck policies for many owners with private passenger automobile (PPA) policies. The insurer aims to encourage these Tesla owners to switch to commercial policies as the Cybertruck\u2019s gross weight, combined with repair establishment difficulties in sourcing replacement parts, aligns it more closely with a commercial vehicle.\n\nAlthough GEICO is not refusing to insure Tesla Cybertrucks in a blanket fashion, the form of the offered insurance policies may still change to encompass specifics relating to the fast-selling electric truck. Rumors abound that other insurance companies may soon follow suit, so more Cybertruck owners can likely expect letters similar to the one displayed on X in October.\n\n\u2013 Advertisement \u2013\n\nTesla Cybertruck in the snow.

            "content": "After the failure of talks with Google and Amazon to build Israel's supercomputer, and the re-issuing of the tender by the Israel Innovation Authority, \"Globes\" has learned that tech giant Oracle plans to bid for the tender. Oracle already operates Israel's biggest data center for local cloud operation, which it leases from Binat in Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim technology park.\n\nThe Innovation Authority has been trying for several years to build a supercomputer in Israel that would allow academia and tech companies to undertake exceptional AI calculations and simulations that cannot be performed on regular computing servers. Most recently, it tried to persuade Google and Amazon, the winners of the Israeli government's Nimbus cloud tender, to build the supercomputer with a budget of up to NIS 290 million, including a NIS 160 million grant. \"Globes\" reported earlier this week that Google did not bid in the tender due to a lack of economic viability, while Amazon did bid but did not proceed to the final stages of the tender for various reasons.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES Amazon, Google Israel supercomputer talks fail\n\nA senior figure in the computing industry told \"Globes\" on condition of anonymity that \"The tender was defined in detail: the number of processors needed and their type, which does not allow flexibility for the cloud providers to plan how to solve the need that the supercomputer is supposed to provide, and it also did not define the manner in which the processors will be upgraded as technology advances. There would be no point in building a supercomputer in six months or a year that consists of graphics processors that are not leading edge.\n\n\"If they had wanted to persuade Amazon and Google to build the supercomputer, they would have had to define for them what goal they wanted to achieve and not the exact manner in which the supercomputer would be built. Therefore, the tender is not suitable for cloud providers from the start, but rather for local integration companies such as Bynet, Med1, Server Farm or EdgeConneX - companies that receive precise definitions, lower pricing and perform the work required of them.\" Despite this, if Oracle bids for the tender or even wins it, this would mark its return to major Israeli government tenders after its loss in the Nimbus tender three years ago.\n\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on December 31, 2024\n\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2024",

Kimi Raikkonen. To be fair, Mateschitz wasn't the only sceptic, indeed, FIA President, Max Mosley, insisted that the young Finn be given a provisional licence, such was the feeling in F1 that Raikkonen was too inexperienced to be racing at such a level.\n\nMateschitz sold his shares in Sauber and almost immediately began looking for his own team, taking time out to get involved in IRL, courtesy of Eddie Cheever's race team.\n\nWhen, in late 2004, Ford announced that it was pulling out of F1, it seemed obvious that Red Bull would snap up its team, but Mateschitz opted to play 'hard ball', leaving the purchase until the last possible moment.\n\nOn Monday November 15, just days before the 2005 entry deadline, Ford confirmed that Red Bull had bought Jaguar Racing, while Kevin Kalkhoven and Gerald Forsythe, co-owners of the Champ Car World Series and heads of the PKV and Forsythe Championship Racing Champ Car teams, respectively, had bought Cosworth.\n\nIt wasn't long before the new Austrian owner was making his presence felt at Milton Keynes, with Tony Purnell and David Pitchforth being dumped in favour of Arden International boss Christian Horner, just days after the Christmas Party.\n\nDavid Coulthard had already been recruited as number one driver, but the team seemed unable to decide on who should support him. Mateschitz favoured, fellow-Austrian, Christian Klien, however, F3000 Champion, Tonio Liuzzi, who had won his title with Arden, courtesy of Red Bull sponsorship, was also in the frame. Throw into the mix Scott Speed, a product of the (over?) ambitious Red Bull Driver Search Programme, designed to discover American F1 talent, and it was soon a case of too many drivers for too few seats. But more of that later.\n\nRed Bull would have you believe that it is all about fun, fun, fun, but the reality is that like any other business it is out to make money, and part of that process is world domination, at least as far as its particular product is concerned.\n\nRed Bull has targeted a particular consumer group, and for the time being, Formula One, along with other adventure sports, is the best way to attract that group's attention.\n\nAnyone who has any doubts as to how ruthless Red Bull can be when it comes to business only has to look at the way Purnell and Pitchforth were dumped, much of this down to Dietrich Mateschitz' 'personal rottweiler', Helmut Marko.\n\n2005 began well enough, as the Milton Keynes based outfit benefited from the Jaguar Racing inheritance. However, as the season progressed, the team didn't.\n\nThe choice of David Coulthard was inspired, though Pitchforth and Purnell had already done much of the groundwork before their firing - indeed Mateschitz had previously said that the Scot was \"not an option\". As it happened however, DC was given a new lease of life, and responded in style.\n\nThe situation on the other side of the garage however, was, frankly, ludicrous, with the team unable to decide on Christian Klien or Tonio Liuzzi, the end result being that nobody benefited, not least the 'hot shot' Italian.\n\nAhead of the 2006 season, Red Bull stunned the paddock with two major signings, design guru Adrian Newey leaving McLaren for the Austrian owned team, followed, shortly afterwards, by the Woking team's chief aerodynamicist, Peter Prodromou.\n\nNeither would have any input in the RBR2, the team's first self-penned car, other than a few tweaks as the season developed. That said, just weeks before the start of the season Pitpass heard that all was not well within the team and that Newey might have to introduce the RBR3 earlier than planned.\n\nAlthough the season got off to a good start, by the end of the year it was going through the motions, desperate for the new year, which meant new (Renault) engines and a Newey chassis.\n\nRed Bull's lack of form wasn't helped by the fact that the team had punched well above its weight the previous season, helped by some stirring performances from Coulthard.\n\nIn addition to the RB2 not working well with the Ferrari V8 the Milton Keynes outfit fell victim to a problem of its own creation, having sided with the Italian team regarding the reintroduction of in-race tyre stops, a move which really only suited one team.\n\nAlthough locked in to a two-year deal with Maranello, Red Bull was already looking at an alternative, and in much the same way as it saw fit to juggle drivers, chose to negotiate a deal which would see the Italian powerplants dumped on Toro Rosso - which Mateschitz had now bought - while Newey's RB3 would be fitted with the championship winning Renault unit.\n\n2006 was about limiting the damage and trying to get through the season as best it could, in the firm hope that - thanks to Newey and Renault - salvation was at hand in 2007.\n\nThe season highlight - in a year of absolute lows - was Coulthard's inspired performance at Monaco, the Scot giving the Austrian team its first podium.\n\nIt was to be expected that the team would not get through a whole season without at least one episode of musical chairs, and therefore it came as no surprise when Christian Klien was dumped with three races remaining, Robert Doornbos being promoted from test driver to a full race seat for the second successive season.\n\nFor 2007, Coulthard was joined by Mark Webber, giving the 'yoof orientated' outfit one of the oldest line-ups on the grid.\n\nIn addition to Coulthard and Webber, Red Bull had the engine deal with Renault. Therefore, the first all-Adrian Newey car would have the benefit of a championship winning engine, seemingly the perfect combination.\n\nIt was on the way back from one of the first major tests of the year that Newey realised there was a calibration problem with the team's windtunnel, a problem that was to set the team back by more than a month. Nonetheless, Newey persisted, being the driving force behind the Milton Keynes outfit throughout the year, pushing his design team and engineers constantly, thinking two or three races ahead.\n\nThe key problem for Red Bull in 2007 was reliability, or rather the lack of it. The main problem was the transmission, but there were also retirements due to the brakes, hydraulics, driveshaft and differential. It comes as no surprise that the RB3 was one of the most unreliable cars out there, completing only 74% of the season's race laps.\n\nNewey was baffled and frustrated by the failures: \"We've had a lot of reoccurring problems,\" he said, \"which is always the thing in F1 which is not excusable. Problems do happen, but the golden rule is making sure they don't happen again, and we didn't achieve that. Is it manufacturing, quality control or packaging? Tick all the boxes really\".\n\nWhereas the Austrian team should have been capable of mixing it with the midfield group, with Williams and Renault, it struggled, scoring just 6 points in the first 9 races. Both drivers profited from the freak race in Germany, giving the team it's only double points finish, indeed, one of only four double finishes, of the entire season.\n\nThere was a late-season improvement following the test at Jerez, which saw points scored in three successive races, but it was too little too late. Coulthard finished the season in tenth place with 14 points, while Webber finished twelfth on ten. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, an improvement on 2006, but, in all honesty, not where the Austrian outfit expected to be and not where it ought to be considering its budget.\n\nFor 2008, Coulthard and Webber were both retained, with Swiss newcomer Sebastien Buemi recruited as test driver. With several other key appointments, most notably Newey's former colleague Geoff Willis, it was widely expected the team would make a serious step forward.\n\nAhead of the season our sources at Milton Keynes assured us that the team was confident it had sorted many of its reliability issues, including the gearbox, a particular worry in 2008 considering the new four-race rule.\n\nAs it happens, reliability was much improved, with the RB4 only failing to finish eight times over the course of the season, only twice due a genuine technical problem. However, despite a strong start to the year the Milton Keynes outfit lost ground in the latter stages, ironically finding itself totally overshadowed by its 'sister' team.\n\nWhile the RB4 looked much like its predecessor, appearances were deceptive, most notably courtesy of an all-new gearbox.\n\nThe RB3 had a long wheelbase but the RB4's was even longer, allowing the team to move the weight distribution forwards. Indeed, in this department the Austrian team had the edge over its rivals for it meant better aerodynamic efficiency. That said, the downside meant the car was not impressive in slow corners where it struggled for traction.\n\nWhile Singapore was the team's first mechanical retirement of the season, the oil leak in Germany not really counting, it should not be forgotten that the team suffered a number of suspension failures, most notably in Australia after Coulthard made contact with Massa. There was another failure in Malaysia when the wishbones disintegrated after Coulthard hit a kerb, the team subsequently admitting that it was slow to react to an obvious problem.\n\nThe other problem for the Milton Keynes team was the Renault powerplant, which lost more and more ground to its rivals as the season progressed. With Toro Rosso using the same chassis, albeit with a totally different set-up and different braking systems, the Renault's power deficit was notable when compared to the Ferrari.\n\nBy and large it was a poor season for Coulthard who had more than his fair share of incidents over the course of the year, even what was to be his final Grand Prix ended at the first corner. However, a typically mature performance in Canada saw the Scotsman finish third, giving the team its best result of the season.\n\nThe first half of the season was good for Webber, who scored points in seven of the first nine races. However, as the team lost ground in the latter stages of the season, the Australian had to battle for whatever scraps he could find.\n\nThe raft of new regulations for 2009 were a godsend for Adrian Newey, who was finally able to make his mark at Milton Keynes. For a start the RB5 looked good, Newey demonstrating that the new breed of F1 car didn't have to be ugly.\n\nHowever, looks aside, the RB5 was radical, not least in terms of returning to pull-rod rear suspension. Newey interpreted the new rules brilliantly, lowering the centre of gravity and using the profiled upper wishbone to add extra downforce. In short, the RB5 was a masterpiece, however, Newey has missed out on one little trick\u2026 the double diffuser.\n\nThat said, in the opening part of the season, the RB5 gave the Brawn a run for its money, and once the double diffuser was given the all-clear by the FIA, and the Milton Keynes outfit was successfully running its own version, it was the Austrian car that led the way.\n\nFor the new season, Webber was joined by German hot-shot Sebastian Vettel, giving the team one of the most dynamic line-ups on the grid.\n\nWhile both drivers finished well outside the points in Australia, a few weeks later in China the team claimed its first pole position and went on to score its first victory, indeed, it was a 1-2 with Vettel leading his Australian teammate home.\n\nThe double diffuser was introduced in time for Monaco but made no real impression. Indeed, despite the lack of time and resources in the weeks that followed the team was forced having to make all manner of changes to the car in order to get the best out of the new package. Consequently, by the time of the British Grand Prix the car was effectively the RB5B.\n\nThe fast flowing corners of the Northamptonshire track perfectly suited the Red Bull and it came as no surprise to see the team take another 1-2. A couple of weeks later the Milton Keynes outfit score another 1-2 this time Mark Webber doing the honours.\n\nBy this stage in the season Brawn was clearly suffering, the Brackley car proving uncompetitive in the cooler conditions. However, it wasn't all plain sailing for Red Bull, other than being hard on their tyres both drivers suffered more than their fair share of engine problems. Indeed, by the time of the Belgian GP Vettel had used his allocation of new units forcing his team into a 'mix and match' situation.\n\nWith an eye of the engine situation - Webber had used up his allocation by Brazil - the team had to resort to limiting its track time, though both drivers handled the situation admirably.\n\nIn the closing stages both drivers were in with a shout of claiming the title but a poor weekend in Italy ended all hopes for Webber while Vettel's challenge lasted just a few weeks longer.\n\nThe season ended with Red Bull second in the Constructors' Championship, 19 points down on Brawn, but with 6 wins, 5 poles and 6 fastest laps. Not a bad haul when you think about it.\n\nOther than Brawn's early advantage, mainly courtesy of the double diffuser, it was poor reliability and the odd mistake that cost the Milton Keynes outfit any hope of robbing its Brackley rival of its fairytale result. In that one season, the Austrian outfit had moved up from the midfield to the big league, and they not only did it in style they looked as though they belonged there.\n\nWebber and Vettel were retained for 2010, while, to the surprise of many, the Austrian outfit also opted to remain with Renault. Australian Daniel Ricciardo and New Zealander Brendon Hartley were recruited as test and reserve drivers, the pair alternating on a race by race basis.\n\nWithout doubt, the RB6 was the class of the 2010 grid. However, reliability issues, certainly during the early part of the season, not to mention over-enthusiasm on the part of its two drivers, meant the Milton Keynes outfit made hard work of winning both titles.\n\nAdrian Newey made full use of the change in attitude towards double diffusers, essentially designing the car around the concept. As in 2009, the new Red Bull looked good, courtesy of a new longer, slimmer gearbox and the fact that Newey stuck with the rear suspension package introduced the previous year.\n\nWith Renault failing to make progress, Red Bull looked at an engine deal with Mercedes, however, and quite unsurprisingly, McLaren vetoed the move. The Austrian team also considered Cosworth but the Northamptonshire company didn't have the financial resources to develop the engine and Red Bull wasn't prepared to bankroll such a programme.\n\nAt the final pre-season test, the team played its ace card, reverting to a concept first introduced by Renault in the early 80s, the blown diffuser. In it attempts to fool its rivals, the Austrian team stuck dummy exhaust exits on the car, but few fell for it, certainly when it came to studying the stop-watch.\n\nDespite its obvious superiority, a fact compounded by a convincing 1-2 in Malaysia, the third race of the season. Poor reliability and strategy meant that after the first four rounds the team trailed McLaren and Ferrari and was even under pressure from Mercedes.\n\nHowever, once the European season got underway the RB6 finally began to show its class. Through Barcelona's fast sweeping corners it was mouthwateringly smooth, giving Webber his first win of the season, having taken pole the previous day.\n\nFollowing Webber's win in Monaco, the team headed to Turkey feeling understandably confident, its rivals fearing that they were in for a long, hot summer. However, an incident on the fortieth lap of the race was to impact the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nWith Webber and Vettel looking set for a convincing 1-2, the team's third of the season. The German made a move on his Australian teammate. They clashed, the German eliminated on the spot, while Webber was able to struggle home in third. As Vettel walked away from the scene of the incident, gesticulating in a manner that made it clear he though his teammate was mad, the media got to work.\n\nWhile the RB6 and the team's driver pairing had looked unbeatable, certainly on track, it now appeared that there were cracks beneath the surface. There was talk of a split within the team, rival camps, and as the sensational headlines continued fingers were pointed at the perceived trouble makers, Dietrich Mateschitz' motor sport advisor Helmut Marko usually appearing in the firing line.\n\nThe Red Bull PR machine spun into action, hosting a 'clear the air' get together for its drivers and issuing a couple of cringeworthy, totally staged, pictures that were meant to suggest 'nothing to see here, move along', but actually conveyed the totally opposite message.\n\nOver the summer, the team carried on with its remorseless development programme, the drivers continued their remorseless battle for in-house supremacy, the media persisted with its remorseless speculation as to favouritism within the team and rivals complained remorselessly to the FIA over perceived irregularities including a flexing front wing.\n\nDespite the obvious superiority of the RB6, the team and its drivers continued to shoot itself in the foot. At Silverstone Vettel picked up a puncture after running wide in the first corner and dropped to the back of the field. However, matters weren't helped when race-winner Webber took a wipe at Christian Horner over the team radio after crossing the line; \"not bad for a number two\", said the Australian, much to the Englishman's obvious embarrassment.\n\nThere was further embarrassment when it was revealed that after complaints about his own car, Vettel had been given his teammate's earlier in the season, while at Silverstone, having damaged his own front wing, the German had been given the replacement originally made for his teammate.\n\nIn Hungary, while running second, the German was penalised for leaving too big a gap between himself and the Safety Car. In Belgium Vettel made a needless challenge on Button which saw both eliminated, while in Korea Webber went out following a needless mistake and Vettel suffered a late engine failure.\n\nAs the season reached its climax, with five drivers still in with a shout, the internal spat continued, much to the delight of the media. While Webber had effectively blown his chances in Korea, he was still second in the championship behind Alonso. Therefore, going into the final race the big question was not only whether Red Bull would use team orders but whether its drivers would respect them.\n\nAs it happens, team orders weren't needed. A faultless performance from Vettel in Brazil was followed by an equally flawless drive in Abu Dhabi, while a disastrous strategy from Ferrari and a lacklustre performance from Alonso certainly helped.\n\nIn its sixth season, Red Bull had won the double. Vettel was quite rightly lauded, despite some of his sillier mistakes, but one couldn't help but fail to marvel at the wonder that is Adrian Newey, the man having added yet another title to an already mightily impressive CV.\n\nVettel pretty much set the precedent for the 2011 season in Melbourne, taking pole position with apparent ease and converting this in to a win the following day.\n\nThe German continued in Malaysia, taking pole from Hamilton in the dying moments of the session by just one tenth of a second and going on to win the race by three seconds from Jenson Button.\n\nHaving shown a remarkable improvement on 2010 in terms of mistakes, there was a rare error from Vettel in Canada, a last lap mistake allowing Button to take his first win of the season. That said, the constantly changing conditions in a race that goes down as the longest in F1 history, perfectly suited the Englishman.\n\nEven the (temporary) ban on blown diffusers at Silverstone had little impact of the Red Bull/Sebastian Vettel steamroller, for although Alonso took the win - Ferrari's only win of the season - Vettel and Webber finished a strong second and third.\n\nThe inaugural Indian Grand Prix saw Vettel take pole, fastest lap and lead every lap of the race, the German showing no sign of easing up despite having already won the title.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, Vettel equalled Nigel Mansell's record of fourteen pole positions in a season when he took pole. At the final race of the season in Brazil, Vettel broke Mansell's record, taking his fifteenth pole position of the season.\n\nIf 2010 was good, 2011 was an absolute tour de force, the team only suffering one retirement, and that due to damage caused by a damaged tyre in Abu Dhabi. The team led the way in reliability, completing 95.5% of the total season laps, while the pit work was amongst the best in the pitlane.\n\nThe only down side in 2011 was surely the team's failure to get its KERS working consistently, particularly in the early stages of the season, and further strategic errors.\n\nThough the team won its third successive Constructors' (and Drivers') title in 2012, it didn't make things easy for itself.\n\nLike its rivals, the Austrian outfit spent the first part of the season attempting to get to grips with the new Pirelli rubber however, matters were further complicated by the fact it no longer had the advantage of the blown diffuser.\n\nDespite that, the team scored three wins in the first half of the season, ironically, two of them coming from Webber who had never quite got to grips with the advantage offered by the blown-diffuser the previous year.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the season the team discovered the secrets of the 2012 rubber, not to mention overcoming the problem with its DRS, Vettel came into his own, the German scoring four straight wins that were to put him back in the thick of the title fight.\n\nNot for the first time, the legality of Newey's creation was questioned, most notably the hole in the rear floor of the RB8 which passed numerous investigations by the official before finally being outlawed in Canada. Then there was the throttle mapping row which, again, saw the car declared legal only for the authorities to subsequently change the rules and force Red Bull to amend the car accordingly.\n\nDespite the two wins in the opening stages of the season, Webber was unable to capitalise and once again was reduced to watching his teammate storm to the title. At a time many were linking the Australian with a move to Ferrari, the Austrian team retained him on a one-year deal, though his drop-off in the second half of the season probably had Helmut Marko wishing he hadn't jumped the gun.\n\nThough Vettel took the title, becoming the youngest driver to win three successive titles, Fernando Alonso - in the underperforming Ferrari - was widely seen as the 'driver of the year', the 'peoples' champion' if you will.\n\nNonetheless, there were some inspired performances from the German, not least in Abu Dhabi and Brazil where he silenced many of those that still insisted he can only win from the front.\n\nWith the regulations largely unchanged, few were prepared to bet against Red Bull - now renamed Infiniti Red Bull Racing - and Vettel making it four in a row in 2013. Once again the German was partnered by Webber, as in 2012 the Australian retained on a one-year contract.\n\nIn Australia, Vettel put the RB9 on pole but struggled in the race eventually finishing 3rd, with Webber coming home in sixth. In Malaysia, Vettel again put the RB9 on pole, this time going on to covert it in to a win... but not without controversy. Against team orders, the German passed his teammate who was leading the race, breaking the so-called 'Multi 21' protocol. Webber's obvious frustration, not to mention Vettel's total lack of remorse, not only soured the relationship (such as it was) between the two but also damaged the German (still further) in the eyes of many race fans and the media.\n\nIn China, Vettel qualified 9th whilst Webber qualified 14th following an issue with his fuel pick up which caused him to stop the car on track. The team subsequently failed to give the stewards the required fuel sample therefore getting the Australian demoted to the back of the grid. While Vettel finished the race 4th, Webber's misery was compounded when a collision dislodged a wheel nut which led to him retiring.\n\nFor the remainder of the first half of the season Red Bull looked strong however, Ferrari and Mercedes were also clearly in hunt, even if Lotus had begun to lose its early shine.\n\nAt the British Grand Prix Webber, after weeks of rumour, Webber confirmed that he would be leaving F1 for Sports Cars at season end, while Vettel had already announced a new deal with Red Bull taking him through to the end of 2015, thereby ending talk of a move to Maranello.\n\nThe second half of the season was entirely different to the first. Following a number of incidents - possibly the understatement of all understatements - Pirelli had been forced to change its tyres. While the change greatly damaged some teams this was not the case with the RB9.\n\nIn Belgium, Vettel began a sequence of nine wins that gave him his fourth title, and Red Bull its fourth Constructors' Championship. A late surge also saw Webber claim third in the title fight, though the Australian had failed to score a single win.\n\nAt times Vettel's dominance was reminiscent of that of his countryman, Michael Schumacher, and similarly his success - and perceived arrogance - was not appreciated by the fans or media. Indeed, at a number of events the German was booed during and after the podium ceremony, many putting this down to his actions in Malaysia.\n\nFor 2014, Vettel was joined by another Australian, the ever smiling Daniel Ricciardo. In the wake of the German's domination, certainly in 2013, coupled with the manner in which he had seen off Webber it remained to be seen whether Vettel would break Ricciardo's spirit, or whether the Australian would be able to assert himself within the team.\n\nThe raft of new rules had most of the teams worried, and no doubt Adrian Newey's deeper than ever frown reflected this, that and a number of high profile 'defections' including; Head of Aerodynamics, Peter Prodromou, to McLaren and Chief Engineer Vehicle Dynamics, Mark Ellis, to Mercedes.\n\nConsidering where Red Bull (and Renault) began in 2014, the comeback was remarkable, even if the Austrian team found itself under increasing pressure from Williams in the final stages of the season.\n\nThe opening test at Jerez saw the team complete less mileage than any other, while the second test (in Bahrain) was little better. Though all the Renault powered teams were suffering, the RB10's problems were exacerbated by the tight packaging of the power unit.\n\nThe final test, again in Bahrain, showed a slight sign of improvement, but still Ricciardo remained 2.485s off (pace-setter) Felipe Massa's best, and reliability continued to cause concern.\n\nConsequently, when Ricciardo finished second in the season opener, there were some who ventured that maybe the Austrian team had been sandbagging (for all three tests?), though teammate Vettel's retirement (engine) after just 4 laps appeared to paint the more accurate picture.\n\nInterestingly, not for the first time, the stewards took a closer look at Ricciardo's RB10 and the Australian was subsequently disqualified for fuel irregularities.\n\nA number of drivers had problems with the new regulations and none more so than Vettel, who struggled from the outset. Those who had previously opined that much of his success came from the fact that he had the best car will feel validated, especially when one compares the German's season to that of his new teammate.\n\nOn those rare occasions when Mercedes failed to deliver, there was Ricciardo to pick up the pieces, sometimes fortuitously, sometimes not (Hungary). Rather than being intimidated by his illustrious teammate, who famously said \"tough luck\" when told in Bahrain that Ricciardo was quicker, the Australian got on with the job in hand... and continued smiling.\n\nStat of the season, should proof be needed, Vettel only once actually led a race in 2014 \u2013 Singapore when Hamilton pitted.\n\nOn circuits where high downforce was essential the RB10 was strong but where pure grunt was needed it lost ground to almost all the Mercedes powered cars.\n\nHaving begun the season with a disqualification it was only right that one of the most consistently controversial teams of recent times should end the year in similar style, both drivers excluded from qualifying in Abu Dhabi due to a flexing front wing.\n\nWhile Ricciardo, quite rightly, got the plaudits for the manner in which he stepped up to the plate and refused to be intimidated by his teammate - who at season end headed off to Ferrari - there was some great racing from the German particularly his battle with Fernando Alonso at Silverstone.\n\nUltimately, 2014 was a bit of a nightmare for the Austrian team which returned to earth with a bump after several years of domination. Though it ended the season runner-up, one wondered how it would fare in 2015, especially if Mercedes maintained its stance in terms of the engine unfreeze.\n\nWhilst Ricciardo looked more than capable of assuming the leader's role from Vettel, it was noted that since Daniil Kvyat got the second seat, alongside the Australian, his performance had not been as impressive as earlier in 2014.\n\nAs feared, 2015 was not a good year for Red Bull. Ignoring its on-track weakness, there was the (none too) little matter of its constant complaining. Be it Renault, the rules or whatever; little wonder we took to Twitter to proclaim that 'Red Bull gives you whinge'.\n\nIn many ways, the Austrian outfit reverted to type. Whereas when it first entered the sport it was all about the pouting pit princesses - aka the Formula Una Girls - now it was about the pouting Mateschitz, Marko and Horner.\n\nOne can understand the frustration with Renault, but the constant, public criticism and threats didn't help matters. When the Milton Keynes based outfit was winning successive titles it was all down to Red Bull, when it was losing it was all down to Renault.\n\nThe continued threats to walk away from F1, insisting that the contract tying it to the sport until 2020 meant nothing, led many to wish they'd simply just get on with it and go\u2026 sprout wings and fly away, so to speak.\n\nAnd as the threats and hissy fits continued, one was minded of the quiet dignity of Williams during its bad times, not forgetting McLaren's annus horribilis.\n\nPre-season testing looked somewhat promising, for while off the pace of the Mercedes - who wasn't! - the RB11 appeared to be holding its own in terms of the pack behind. However, once the season got underway it was clear that whilst Renault had improved its reliability, power (or the lack of it) was still a major issue.\n\nIndeed, the season opener saw Kvyat stop on the way to the grid with a gearbox issue, whilst Ricciardo could only manage sixth, behind Nasr in the Sauber.\n\nAs the team struggled to resolve its power issues, and attention was focussed fully on slower tracks, it became clear that it was missing the input from Adrian Newey.\n\nFourth and fifth was a good result at the notoriously slow and twisty Monaco, though an issue with Ricciardo's engine settings in qualifying may well have cost the Australian a podium finish.\n\nNo surprises that another slow and twisty track, the Hungaroring, saw the team takes its biggest points haul of the year. Indeed, but for a clash with Rosberg which necessitated an extra stop for a front wing, Ricciardo might well have finished second.\n\nStarting from the front row in Singapore, another track which clearly suited the RB11, Ricciardo really needed the help a Safety Car if he was to take the fight to his former teammate. Sadly, in the absence of a Nelson Piquet type mishap, it never happened.\n\nAs the team continued its very public criticism of Renault, then found itself turned down by Mercedes and Ferrari, Ricciardo and Kvyat gamely battled on.\n\nA convincing drive in Monaco was followed by another excellent performance in Hungary, thereby giving Kvyat (and Russia) its first F1 podium. Then there was Austin, a race he might even have won, only to crash out whilst battling Rosberg on the final lap of the race.\n\nDespite the hootin' and hollerin', Red Bull finally found an engine package for 2016, and 2016 only. After all that whinging, the Austrian outfit found itself having to eat a large helping of humble pie and stick with Renault, albeit badged as a Tag Heuer.\n\nTurned down by Mercedes and Ferrari, Red Bull's threats to leave F1 even got FIA president Jean Todt to shift his backside, the Frenchman joining Bernie Ecclestone in calling for a new independent engine supplier - a traditional 'smoke 'n' mirrors' move aimed at making the existing manufacturers agree to their terms.\n\nInterestingly, when Renault finally introduced its upgraded engine, in Brazil, only Ricciardo used it. Then again, the unit actually proved to be less powerful than its predecessor, causing the Australian to revert to the old unit for the final race.\n\nDespite the hootin' and hollerin', Red Bull finally found an engine package for 2016, and 2016 only.

Then again, the unit actually proved to be less powerful than its predecessor, causing the Australian to revert to the old unit for the final race.\n\nFollowing months of speculation Renault finally bought the struggling Lotus team, and as the French manufacturer set about its latest venture as a constructor, one couldn't help but wonder how this might impact its engine development not only in terms of the works team but customers like Red Bull.\n\nWhile the eleventh hour purchase of Lotus meant that as a team Renault was on a hiding to nothing, the engine boys at Viry did a sterling job, much to Red Bull's delight and benefit.\n\nOn the back of 2015 and its failings both on track and in terms of threats to the sport, the Austrian team will have come into 2016 expecting very little, hoping upon hope that it might be in a position to battle with Williams for third as Ferrari sought about closing the gap to Mercedes.\n\nThe first few races did little to dispel this line of thinking, Kvyat failing to make it to the Melbourne grid for the second successive year and then suffering a number of close encounters with Sebastian Vettel, which, if nothing else, led to one of the greatest put downs ever witnessed in the podium ante-room.\n\nPulling up Kvyat for a first lap incident which saw Vettel hit his Ferrari teammate putting him into a spin, the German accused the Russian of a stupid move.\n\n\"You crash into all three of us,\" snarled Vettel. \"You came like a torpedo!\"\n\n\"That's racing,\" grinned Kvyat.\n\nThe pair subsequently renewed their close association in Sochi a couple of weeks later, while Ricciardo got his season underway with a string of fourth places.\n\nThen came Spain.\n\nIn the same way that Barcelona marked a watershed moment for Mercedes, so too Red Bull can look back on that particular weekend as a real game changer.\n\nDespite his podium finish in China, and perhaps influenced by those two clashes with its former protege Vettel, the Austrian team opted to return Kvyat to Toro Rosso while promoting Max Verstappen to the 'big team'. It was to prove a historic decision, literally.\n\nHaving already impressed on his debut a year earlier, young Max now took the world by storm. Courtesy of the Mercedes demolition derby on lap 1, the Red Bulls looked set to pull off one of the biggest shocks of the season, Ricciardo and his new teammate taking a 1-2.\n\nHowever, concerned at the pace of the Ferraris, the team put its drivers on different strategies and while this worked against the Australian, his teenage teammate was able to take victory on his debut with the Austrian team, thereby becoming the youngest race winner in the history of F1.\n\nSadly, a team error was to rob Ricciardo two weeks later in Monaco, the Australian seemingly destined to make it two in a row for the Milton Keynes based outfit. Finishing second in a race which was his, the sight of Ricciardo on the Monaco podium, holding his trophy like a heartbroken schoolkid, it was impossible not to feel pity for the popular Aussie, for once that infectious grin replaced by a look of utter despair and loss.\n\nAs ever, Red Bull had been busy behind the scenes. Having pushed hard for the new aero regulations for 2017 the Austrian team was also keen to wrap up regulations intended at converging engine performance, two areas where it felt the gap to Mercedes could be closed on track with a little help from political manoeuvring in the offices of the powers that be.\n\nEven though it was looking ahead to 2017, there were some updates, though most of these came from Renault.\n\nTalking of which, remember all those threats about leaving the sport? Well, they were only joking.\n\nYes, you heard that right. Even though early in 2016 Dietrich Mateschitz was still threatening to walk away from the sport unless... it turned out he was only messing about.\n\nPhew!\n\nCourtesy of those updates, not to mention having one of the strongest driver pairings, though unable to mount a serious challenge to Mercedes, Red Bull was at least able to leave Ferrari for dust and claim runner-up sport.\n\nAfter the disappointment of Spain and Monaco, Ricciardo finally got his win in Malaysia, albeit courtesy of Hamilton's late engine failure, the Australian subjecting the world - and subsequently actor Gerard Butler and several of his racing rivals - to the infamous 'shoey'.\n\nComing off the back of a hugely disappointing 2015, and with such obvious low expectations for the new season, finishing runner-up was a massive result for Red Bull.\n\nHowever, the real pay-off could come in 2017 as the team, armed with its enviable driver line-up, an ever improving engine, Adrian Newey and regulations that were almost custom made, the Austrian team must fancy its chances.\n\nOn the other hand, though quick to attack Renault, the Austrian team rarely complimented the French manufacturer on its improvements; odd when one considers the failure of 2015 almost drove it out of the sport. Or not.\n\nFor 2017 the Renault engines continued to be badged Tag Heuer while sister team Toro Rosso was also understood to be seeking an alternative name for its power units.\n\nThe Austrian team continued to involve itself in the political machinations of the sport, cleverly using its sister outfit to play the other side of the fence, but just as importantly it was going to be interesting to see how the relationship between Ricciardo and Verstappen would develop. Or not.\n\nFor much of 2016 it had been all smiles, but as we saw during the Vettel/Webber era, things can quickly change, and it was going to be interesting to see how the ever grinning Aussie accepted the situation as young Max forced his feet further and further under the table.\n\nFrom the outset the Austrian team has made much of its 'unique' approach to F1, its irreverence, it's whacky sense of humour - yet has anyone else noticed that at the merest hint of an issue the team's social media presence goes into hiding?\n\nTo the accompaniment of Stevie Wonder's 70s classic, Superstition, Red Bull showed sneak images of its 2017 contender, the RB13. While triskaidekaphobia's everywhere grimaced, the team poo-pooed the notion that it was tempting fate, dismissing such things as black cats, broken mirrors and ladders.\n\nHowever, reflecting on a season in which Ricciardo only finished 14 of the 20 races he started and teammate Verstappen just 13, between them completing just 72% of the 2,392 laps that comprised the season, one must wonder if the team feels it was correct in tempting fate so openly. Indeed, as we look ahead to the 13th Toro Rosso chassis it will be interesting to see if the Faenza outfit also thinks it wise to push its luck... especially with a Honda in the back.\n\nOf course, 2017 wasn't all about luck, while Verstappen's early elimination in Spain and Singapore were mainly the result of others over enthusiasm, many of his DNF's - and those of his teammate - were down to the poor reliability of the Renault engine.\n\nIndeed, almost in a sign of pay back, Lady Luck had it that the Dutchman spent much of the first part of the season watching the races from the sidelines, while his teammate suffered his purple patch at the end. \"They're not laughing any more\", sang The Call's Michael Been in the excellent 1980s single The Walls Came Down.\n\nDespite 3 wins, the Austrian team finished 300 points down on Mercedes and 154 down on Ferrari, Ricciardo losing fourth in the driver standings at the final race when his hydraulics gave up.\n\nThe drivers formed arguably one of the strongest pairings on the grid, Ricciardo confirming his reputation as king of the overtakes and Verstappen giving further glimpses of his bravery and what we might expect when given the right equipment.\n\nReturning to the subject of luck, around mid-season Renault appeared to have sorted its reliability issues, only for them to return in the latter stages, albeit with a different driver.\n\nThe pace of the car meant that qualifying was a struggle and therefore the Austrian cars regularly started from the third row. However, in race trim, and with Daniel and Max giving their all, the RB13 regularly punched above its weight come Sunday.\n\nAs ever, other than the drivers, much of this was down to the team's aero department which produced a basic package and subsequent upgrades that would have struck fear into the hearts of Mercedes and Ferrari had the Austrian team had a better power unit in the back\u2026 no wonder both baulked at the idea of supplying their rival.\n\nFor 2018 the team would have a new title sponsor in Aston Martin, and while this should eventually bear fruit, for the time being the Austrian outfit is stuck with the Renault engine. That said, it could get worse, for at the end of 2018 the French manufacturer will stop supplying Red Bull which could mean a switch to Honda, which sister-team Toro Rosso will experiment with this season.\n\nTo the surprise of many, Verstappen signed a new three-year deal with the team, while Ricciardo had yet to reveal his plans post-2018.\n\n2018 was likely to be a tough season for Red Bull. While its drivers would continue to give their all and the team would no doubt produce a strong chassis, despite having moved on to RB14 the team was likely to find itself cursing its luck on more than a few occasions.\n\nIndeed, it was a season very much of two halves for the Austrian team and its two drivers, albeit for different reasons.\n\nVirtually reduced to the role of spectators in Melbourne, Ricciardo and Verstappen could only look on as, too quick to battle with the midfielders, the RB14 was nowhere near to matching the pace of the Mercedes and Ferrari. Of course, the situation wasn't helped when a mistake from the Dutchman allowed Alonso through to claim a surprise fifth.\n\nVerstappen had a torrid start to his season, crashing needlessly in qualifying in Bahrain, then retiring early in the race following a clash with Hamilton. While teammate Ricciardo claimed the team's first win of the season in China, Verstappen clashed with Vettel, but worse was to follow.\n\nIn Baku, having been passed by his teammate, Verstappen warned the team about his tyres, but shortly after the Australian pitted the Dutchman's lap times began to improve. A couple of laps later the team suffered a double DNF when the pair collided as Verstappen refused to yield to his (quicker) teammate.\n\nBy now 'at war' with the media, which had accused him of being tempestuous in some of his tactics, Verstappen's mood worsened when Ricciardo took pole and then a lights to flag victory in Monaco.\n\nHowever, that was the turning point of the season, for while the Australian was never to stand atop the podium again, Verstappen went from strength to strength.\n\nIn 2017, Pitpass had opined that it would make sense for Red Bull to partner with Honda, and in June 2018 so it came to be.\n\nHowever, while the Austrian team patted itself on the back over the new deal, and ramped up the invective in terms of Renault, the team was dealt a blow when Ricciardo revealed that for 2019 he would be jumping ship to the French outfit.\n\nJust a couple of weeks before the announcement, Verstappen had claimed his first win of the season - at Red Bull's own circuit - and while the youngster enjoyed a strong run-in to the season, claiming podiums in seven of the final nine races, by an amazing coincidence his Australian teammate suffered six DNFs from eleven outings.\n\nDespite the obvious strengths of the RB14, its power deficit meant there were only certain tracks at which it could realistically compete, while at the others it would be forced to play a Melbourne-like role in the netherworld behind Mercedes and Ferrari but ahead of the rest.\n\nA convincing, and well-deserved, win in Mexico was almost followed by a follow-up in Brazil, until Verstappen got entangled with back-marker Ocon. The Dutchman did himself no favours by subsequently earning himself public service duty after seeking down and shoving the Frenchman in the moments after the race.\n\nLooking ahead to 2019, while we could expect the RB15 to be up to the usual standard, it remained to be seen how the Honda performed. Though the Japanese manufacturer took a significant step forward with Toro Rosso in 2018, would it be enough to please a team not known for its patience.\n\nThen there was the driver line-up, and other than the infectious charm of Ricciardo, the team would surely miss his calming effect. Indeed, with Pierre Gasly stepping up to partner Verstappen, neither driver known for their easy going attitude, Messrs Horner and Marko were likely to have their hands full.\n\nIn pre-season testing Red Bull was infuriating, like Mercedes opting to give little away. Indeed, it is hard to recall if Verstappen ran on anything other than mediums over the whole eight days.\n\nThe toxic marriage to Renault at an end, Red Bull was expecting much of its new love, and Honda delivered.\n\nWhile the Austrian team spent the year continually developing its car, so too the Japanese manufacturer was constantly developing its power unit.\n\nAdmittedly, the team was one of several seemingly caught on the back foot by the front wing regulations. Indeed, it was really not until a revised version was fitted in Austria that the team got on top of the problem.\n\nWhile Verstappen's dismissal of Vettel in Melbourne was clear proof of the progress that Honda had made, it was some time before the entire package came together, but when it did...\n\nFerrari's own issues saw Verstappen begin the season with a podium, but it was Barcelona before he repeated the feat. And then came Austria.\n\nWhile Verstappen's move on Leclerc was questionable, Austria signalled that Red Bull - and Honda - was back. A few weeks later, the Dutchman claimed the first pole of his F1 career, with further poles in Mexico and Brazil.\n\nVerstappen also proved victorious in the madness that was Hockenheim, while taking a well-deserved win in Brazil, scene of his silliness just twelve months earlier.\n\nWith Honda continuing to develop its engine in terms of reliability and performance, this meant the team suffered more than its fair share of grid penalties, but for the most part Red Bull took this on the chin, after all it was reaping the benefits of the Japanese manufacturer\u2019s determination to improve.\n\nWhile nobody appeared sorry to see the back of Renault - Marko, Horner and Verstappen never missing an opportunity to take a swipe at their old partner - the same cannot be said of Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nWith Gasly seemingly out of his depth, and consequently dropped at the start of the summer break, rookie Alex Albon was brought in from Toro Rosso. Though the Thai did brilliantly - as did Gasly back at Toro Rosso - the team clearly missed Ricciardo in terms of his calming influence, his experience and his talent. How ironic that he had chosen 'old flame' Renault as his new partner.\n\nWhile Red Bull made a determined effort to improve, and did take a significant step forward, it will have to dig deep in 2020. Though the RB15 definitely had its moments, it took the team far too long to get there, and for that brief period that Ferrari ruled the roost, the Austrian team was very much third best again.\n\nAfter the disappointment of McLaren, Honda will have breathed a sigh of relief that its first season with Toro Rosso went fairly well, certainly enough to persuade Red Bull to take the plunge.\n\nThough there is continued speculation over the futures of a number of manufacturers, and Honda having made clear that costs need to be curbed, those three wins will have done wonders. Indeed, in the wake of Verstappen's win in Austria, the relief was clear, as Honda bosses openly wept in joy.\n\nHonda became the first manufacturer to commit to F1 post-2020, albeit for just one season, but Helmut Marko believes that 2019's success, coupled with the fact that Verstappen has agreed a new deal to stay until the end of 2023, should be enough to persuade the Japanese giant to hang around a while longer.\n\nThough Mercedes remains the benchmark and Ferrari continues to do what it always does - and that's not a positive thing - Red Bull and Honda have the opportunity to finally take the fight to its German rival in terms of a sustained title bid.\n\nThat said, with the big three already focussing on 2021, 2020 is going to be all about spending and strength, and in that department the Three Pointed Star would appear to have the advantage.",

Now, the squad wants a big bat, and Pete Alonso can give them that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThe Giants see Pete Alonso as a suitable option\n\nNow the Giants don\u2019t have many options, as most of the top-tier first basemen have already been taken. The Astros signed with Christian Walker, and the Yanks got Paul Goldschmidt. That being said, Pete Alonso\u2019s market has shrunk too. He was once the most sought-after player when the offseason started, but gradually all major teams found their first baseman in someone else. Nevertheless, the Giants interest in Alonso is not without reason. Oracle Park is known as one of the toughest ballparks for hitters, with its deep alleys and tricky wind patterns.\n\nIn fact, the last time a Giants player hit 30 home runs in a season was back in 2004, when none other than Barry Bonds did it. However, recent data suggests that Pete Alonso could be an intriguing fit for the park\u2019s unique conditions. The Polar Bear has shown he can thrive at Oracle Park, boasting a solid .273/.347/.563 slash line with a .910 OPS. The Florida native has hit 11 home runs in just 33 games.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nThose numbers suggest that the Mets\u2019 slugger could be a perfect fit for the Giants\u2019 home ballpark, which tends to challenge even the most powerful hitters. Now, the question is whether the Giants can land him or not because previously the club has failed to sign big players.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 failure to land big players in the past\n\nWhen we recall the San Francisco Giants under Farhan Zaidi\u2019s tenure, all we remember are missed opportunities. Since Zaidi took over as president of baseball operations in 2018, the Giants made the playoffs just once, in 2021. After another disappointing season in 2024, the Giants made the decision to part ways with Zaidi. The franchise has now trusted former catcher Buster Posey with its future.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSo far, Posey has already begun to make his mark. He signed shortstop Willy Adames to the largest contract in the team\u2019s history, signaling that the Giants are positioning themselves as serious contenders. One of the many complaints when Zaidi was the GM of the San Francisco team was his failure to get elite free agents. Posey is clearly aiming to address that issue. A prime example of this is Aaron Judge. The Californian native was on the brink of joining the Giants; now, news has surfaced that the highest bid was put forth in San Francisco.\n\nIn the end, the Yankees offered a more appealing offer. Next was Carlos Correa, who was on the brink of joining the Giants following the near completion of a deal. However, as luck would have it, the team failed again\u2014the Giants also lost out on Shohei Ohtani last year, another near miss that left the fanbase a little sour. However, with Posey, there is a fresh wave of optimism among the Giants fans as well as in the clubhouse.",
