            "content": "Things have not been great for beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) of late. With weight-loss drugs cutting into snack purchases and more and more people eschewing sugary beverages for health reasons, a lot of people just are not buying what PepsiCo offers any more. But PepsiCo is not taking this lightly, and that shows up in today\u2019s trading, as shareholders piled in and gave the stock a nearly 2.5% boost in share price.\n\nIndeed, PepsiCo is not taking this lightly at all. The head of the United States beverage business, Ram Krishnan, reportedly starts his day at 5:00 in the morning, with a local sales team meeting. A manager meeting follows at 7:00, and then, at 8:00, he\u2014along with another team\u2014starts visiting stores to see how displays of PepsiCo goods are presented.\n\nThis comes at a time when there is not only declining interest, but also active pushback from the government itself. With the new Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., referring to large portions of the product line as \u201cpoison,\u201d that does make selling a little harder than it used to be. But Krishnan is fighting back in a hundred different ways, including some that emphasis an old adage about the advantages of joining them when beating them just does not work.\n\nWhat Joining Them Looks Like\n\nWe have already heard about PepsiCo\u2019s moves to bring out more healthy alternatives. It recently bought the Poppi line to drive up interest in the healthier notion, and it is also putting some extra marketing capability to work with a new hire.\n\nPepsiCo brought in Mark Kirkham to serve as chief marketing officer for the United States beverage market, and his position will start April 7. Kirkham\u2014a 14 year veteran of PepsiCo\u2014will step in for Greg Lyons, who is leaving PepsiCo to \u201cpursue an external opportunity.\u201d Lyons, interestingly enough, held that slot since 2018. That spot is reportedly \u201cprone to churn,\u201d which means Lyons\u2019 nearly eight-year run was impressive by any standard. Kirkham, therefore, will have big shoes to fill and in a market that is increasingly arrayed against him.\n\nIs PepsiCo a Buy, Sell or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on PEP stock based on nine Buys and seven Holds assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 7.13% loss in its share price over the past year, the average PEP price target of $164.43 per share implies 8.09% upside potential.\n\nSee more PEP analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

That percentage will increase by 10% annually until it reaches 60% by fiscal 2028-29.\n\nThe end goal of this new rule is a sustainable circular economy where plastic bottles are collected, recycled, and made into new bottles.\n\nFor everyday consumers, this could mean slightly higher prices in the short term, as companies may pass on some of the estimated 30% cost increase. However, the long-term benefits include less plastic pollution in public spaces and waterways.\n\nThe policy could also inspire innovation in packaging, with companies exploring alternatives such as biodegradable or plant-based materials.\n\nBut the transition won't be easy. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India authorizes only five plants to produce food-grade recycled PET, and the capacity of all five combined meets just 15% of average demand.\n\nPET bottles currently account for about 70% of beverage packaging in India, as they're considered more convenient than glass and cheaper than cans.\n\nSome companies are considering legal action, with one unnamed executive telling The Economic Times: \"We may have to take legal recourse and take anticipatory stay if the deadline is not extended. The timing is bad, ahead of peak summer. We are investing in capacity, but capacity increases are two-three years away.\"\n\nWhile this policy pushes big beverage companies in a greener direction, helping them take more responsibility for their environmental impacts, they still have a long way to go to address their environmental footprints.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PEP options chain for the new May 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $146.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.54. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $146.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $144.46 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PEP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $152.21/share today.\n\nBecause the $146.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.05% return on the cash commitment, or 7.70% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for PepsiCo Inc, and highlighting in green where the $146.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.84. If an investor was to purchase shares of PEP stock at the current price level of $152.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.70% if the stock gets called away at the May 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PEP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PepsiCo Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PEP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.87% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.62% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 21%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 23%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $152.21) to be 18%.

With the recent acquisition of prebiotic soda brand Poppi, PepsiCo is doubling down on health-driven beverages to compete in the evolving soft drinks market.\n\nPepsiCo doubles down on functional beverages with a leadership shake-up and a $2 billion bet on prebiotic soda. Credit: Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo has appointed Mark Kirkham as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of its U.S. beverages division, effective 7 April 2025. His promotion comes as the company strengthens its focus on functional drinks.\n\nThe move follows PepsiCo\u2019s recent $2 billion acquisition of Poppi, a prebiotic soda brand gaining popularity among health-conscious consumers. This deal positions PepsiCo to compete in the fast-growing gut-health beverage market.\n\nA leader in global beverage marketing\n\nKirkham, a PepsiCo veteran with over 14 years of experience, previously led international beverage marketing. He played a key role in expanding zero-sugar options and refreshing PepsiCo\u2019s global branding. He replaces Greg Lyons, who is leaving the company for an external opportunity.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s leadership change reflects its strategy to meet shifting consumer demands. More people are choosing functional drinks that offer added health benefits, such as prebiotics, electrolytes, and enhanced hydration.\n\nCompeting in the functional drinks market\n\nThe acquisition of Poppi signals PepsiCo\u2019s intent to strengthen its position in the functional beverage sector. The brand competes with disruptors like Olipop and challenges Coca-Cola, which has also been expanding its health-focused offerings.\n\nRam Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., praised Kirkham\u2019s expertise. \u201cMark\u2019s ability to drive consumer engagement and build strong brand identities will be key as we evolve our portfolio to meet changing preferences,\u201d he said.\n\nNavigating a changing market\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s marketing strategy is shifting as consumer habits change. Although organic revenue increased by 2.1% in late 2024, North American beverage sales declined. Many shoppers are now more price-conscious, making strategic marketing even more important.\n\nThe company has also refreshed Mountain Dew\u2019s branding with a new campaign and character, the \u201cMountain Dude,\u201d in an effort to keep the brand relevant.\n\nAs Kirkham steps into his new role, PepsiCo is expected to further integrate Poppi into its marketing strategy. His leadership will likely shape the company\u2019s approach to next-generation health-focused drinks.",

            "content": "The job of rescuing Pepsi-Cola starts very early in the morning for Ram Krishnan.\n\nOn a recent trip to San Antonio, the head of PepsiCo\u2019s U.S. beverage business was up before sunrise for a 5 a.m. meeting with the local sales team, followed by a roundtable discussion at 7 a.m. with managers.\n\nAt 8 a.m., they hit the streets. They split into four teams and started visiting stores\u2014Walmart, Dollar General, Circle K, 7-Eleven and four others. They walked through the aisles with scorecards. Are the shelves full? Are the right PepsiCo drinks highlighted? What about the product mix? The shelf tags? The drink cooler at the checkout?\n\nSince taking charge of PepsiCo\u2019s all-important U.S. beverage business in February 2024, Krishnan has been trying to fix a big problem. The U.S. market share for Pepsi\u2019s classic cola\u2014which once aspired to overtake Coca-Cola\u2019s as the nation\u2019s favorite soda\u2014had slipped to No. 3, behind Dr Pepper. And some of the company\u2019s other drinks, including Gatorade, had been steadily bleeding market share.\n\n\u201cMaybe we lost the focus,\" Krishnan said in an interview from Texas.\n\nHis campaign to claw back customers has kept him on the road almost nonstop, traipsing through stores, Monday through Thursday, week after week, all over the country. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the situation you\u2019re in and want to make some big transformative moves, I think it helps keep the pace and intensity up,\" he said.\n\nTimes are tough for legacy sodas, and they aren\u2019t likely to be helped by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. referring to sugary, carbonated drinks as \u201cpoison.\" Energy drinks and niche beverages billed as healthier have been grabbing market share for years, and the U.S. soda market now resembles a slowly melting ice cube.\n\nU.S. sales volume of Coca-Cola branded sodas slid 14% between 2010 and 2023, according to the most recent annual data from industry tracker Beverage Digest, but Pepsi\u2019s volume, including for Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar, plummeted 32%.\n\nIn February, an analyst put the obvious question to PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta: What was going on?\n\nLaguarta didn\u2019t bother with spin. \u201cWe are seeing some hope, but hope is not where we want to be,\" he told analysts gathered for a conference in Orlando. \u201cWe are disappointed we have not been able to gain share in the last few years. It\u2019s a miss, I would say, from our side.\"\n\nPepsiCo has been focusing for years on beefing up its food business, anchored by brands such as Doritos, Cheetos and Lay\u2019s, and food accounted for 58% of its revenue in 2024. But Laguarta told analysts that the Pepsi brand remains vital to expanding the drinks business.\n\nTo that end, the company is trying to recapture some of its old beverage magic, which arguably peaked with the \u201ccola wars\" of the 1970s and 1980s, when its high-profile \u201cPepsi Challenge\" marketing campaign helped it narrow the gap with No. 1 Coke.\n\nIn February, the company dusted off the Pepsi Challenge, this time pitting Pepsi Zero Sugar against Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. In advertising, it aims to position Pepsi as better than Coke or other beverages for pairing with food. The pitch: Food deserves Pepsi.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s scientific evidence that because of a unique mix of spices, the level of carbonation and the sweetness in a bottle of Pepsi, that it actually goes well with most foods,\" said Krishnan, referring to the company\u2019s own research.\n\nThe broader plan is to bring the soda and snacks businesses closer together, uniting distribution under the same executive. One aim is to cut costs\u2014to avoid sending separate trucks stocked with Pepsi and Lay\u2019s to the same store.\n\nYet some of PepsiCo\u2019s independent distributors\u2014many of them family businesses that have bottled Pepsi for generations\u2014said they had never seen a worse time for the brand. The company had pivoted so hard away from its soft-drinks business, they said, that they now wonder whether it is too late to resurrect it.\n\nPepsi Generation\n\nPepsiCo launched the cola wars in the 1960s with its Pepsi Generation campaign. It cast Pepsi as the hip, upstart cola for young people, and Coke as staid and old-fashioned. Pepsi didn\u2019t catch up to Coke, but it eventually reached a close second\u2014thanks in part to Coke\u2019s disastrous introduction of New Coke.\n\nMichael Jackson, who starred in Pepsi commercials, at a company event in New York in 1992.\n\nPepsi-Cola\u2019s U.S. market share peaked in the 1980s, when Pepsi ads featured edgy stars like Madonna and David Bowie, and the company signed a then-record $5 million sponsorship deal with Michael Jackson.\n\nOver the years, PepsiCo had gotten into snacks and restaurants in a big way with the acquisitions of Frito-Lay, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken. It spun off its restaurants in the late 90s, and in 2001 bought Quaker Oats, maker of oatmeal, Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal and Gatorade drinks. But Pepsi remained its most prestigious brand\u2014a plum assignment for its executives.\n\nThat began changing in 2006 with the arrival of Chief Executive Indra Nooyi. Consumers were reading food labels more carefully, and per capita consumption of soda, long a growth engine, had begun to decline in the U.S.\n\nNooyi shifted marketing spending away from the company\u2019s namesake cola, part of a push into healthier foods and drinks. She directed research and development spending toward lower- and zero-sugar drinks. The company bought Naked Juice and KeVita kombucha and formed a joint venture to sell Sabra hummus.\n\nIts pivot into food was the opposite of Coca-Cola\u2019s strategy. James Quincey, Coke\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview that his company\u2019s decision not to expand beyond drinks had enabled it to outperform Pepsi. \u201cWe have focused on being a beverage company,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017, PepsiCo acknowledged that Pepsi and Mountain Dew had lost market share because the company had shifted too much advertising spending away from them.\n\nWhen Laguarta took over as CEO in 2018, he pledged to revive the company\u2019s U.S. soda business. Still, PepsiCo devoted considerable resources to energy drinks and food. It acquired the Rockstar energy-drink brand for $3.85 billion and introduced energy-drink versions of Mountain Dew and Gatorade. It struck a short-lived distribution deal with energy-drink brand Bang, and later took a small stake in the fast-growing startup Celsius.\n\nPepsi celebrated the 125th anniversary of the brand in New York in 2023.\n\nLaguarta boosted marketing and research-and-development spending for the company\u2019s biggest snack brands, creating new variations such as mini Doritos and Cheetos Mac \u2019n Cheese. He wants people to think of PepsiCo as a food and agriculture business. He considered changing the company\u2019s name but decided he couldn\u2019t justify the expense.\n\nWhen Americans hunkered down in the Covid-19 pandemic, they reached for nostalgic brands like Coke and Pepsi. Pepsi-Cola\u2019s share of U.S. carbonated soft drinks sales volume bumped up in 2020 and 2021, then resumed its downward trajectory the following year, according to industry tracker Beverage Digest.\n\nAlthough Pepsi\u2019s classic \u201cblue can\" soda fell to No. 3 in market share, the company notes that it has held on to the No. 2 market-share slot when all Pepsi-branded sodas, including Pepsi Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi, are taken into account.\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said recently of the company\u2019s soda business: \u2018We are seeing some hope, but hope is not where we want to be.\u2019\n\nIn 2023, PepsiCo made two moves to try to jump-start soda sales. It introduced a new brand logo for Pepsi, marking the cola\u2019s 125th anniversary, and launched a new lemon-lime soda called Starry to compete with Coca-Cola\u2019s Sprite and Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s 7UP.\n\nBut its ad spending has continued to lag behind. In 2023, the Pepsi brand spent about half as much as Coke did on U.S. ads, estimated ad-tracking firm MediaRadar, and in the first 11 months of 2024, Coke outspent Pepsi by even more.\n\nKrishnan said his first priority was to reverse the decline in Gatorade\u2019s market share, which he said he accomplished last year. His next goal was turning around the soft drinks business.\n\nAfter speaking to retailers, bottling operators and previous PepsiCo beverage executives, he concluded that the Pepsi brand had lost its way. \u201cWe were doing too many things,\" he said. \u201cWe were doing music, we were doing sports\u2014every different communication was a little different.\"\n\nEven when shoppers wanted the company\u2019s drinks, he said, they often couldn\u2019t find them on store shelves.\n\nRoughly 25% of PepsiCo\u2019s U.S. beverage distribution is handled by independent businesses. The declining sales volume has affected independent bottling businesses like the one Tim Tenney runs in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley.\n\nHis family\u2019s ties to Pepsi go back nearly a century. In 1931, his grandfather, an investment banker, helped a candy executive buy Pepsi-Cola out of bankruptcy, and he subsequently served on the soda company\u2019s board. His father worked at PepsiCo\u2019s offices in Queens, N.Y.\u2014where a Pepsi-Cola sign still overlooks the East River\u2014before buying a bottling franchise.\n\nTenney said he started working in that business at age 13. Now 75, he remains its CEO. Pepsi\u2019s falling sales volume, he said, has hurt the company. In recent years, he has begun stocking new products, including Keurig Dr Pepper-backed C4 Energy. Tenney\u2019s company is currently involved in litigation with PepsiCo about the rights to distribute Gatorade.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the team in Purchase can turn it around,\" he said of Pepsi\u2019s sales.\n\nOther independent bottlers around the country said in interviews that Pepsi\u2019s declining sales volumes and distribution problems had hurt the brand and their own businesses.\n\nSome have said that PepsiCo\u2019s North American beverage business would fare better as a stand-alone company\u2014a change activist investor Nelson Peltz unsuccessfully pushed for more than a decade ago. If the business were in the hands of a private-equity firm or hedge fund, the bottlers contend, it would get more attention than it does now from PepsiCo.\n\nOverhaul plans\n\nIn recent years, the company has had problems keeping stores shelves stocked with its beverages.\n\nLate last year, Krishan said, the company made important changes to his sales operation that he hopes will fix some of the problems. It overhauled its sales management structure. \u201cThere will be consistency on who goes to the store and who the store manager sees,\" he said.\n\nPepsiCo has long been good at keeping store shelves stocked with its snacks and other food offerings. In December, it appointed its food chief, Steven Williams, to head a new group that will unite the operational parts of the food and beverage businesses, including PepsiCo\u2019s own bottling and distribution. The idea is to eliminate such wasteful practice as sending separate trucks for food and beverages to the same stores.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest ads lean into its claim that Pepsi goes well with food. One recent online campaign portrays \u201cundercover agents\" swiping drinks from unsuspecting customers at McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food restaurants and replacing them with Pepsi. \u201cEvery burger deserves Pepsi,\" the ad asserts.\n\nKrishnan said the company is spending more to market Pepsi, Mountain Dew and sports drinks, and focusing more on social-media advertising.\n\nThe new taste-oriented campaign, he said, is working. Sales in retail stores, by dollar amount, of classic blue-can Pepsi, after slipping 1.5% in 2024, have increased 5.8% so far this year, he said. Sales of Wild Cherry Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar have been growing double digits.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to pour money into other beverages. It recently agreed to acquire prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion. The acquisition, Krishnan said, helps PepsiCo appeal to health-conscious younger drinkers.\n\nKrishnan said he hopes that PepsiCo\u2019s critics, including independent bottlers, see that the new initiatives are paying off in increased sales of its beverages.\n\n\u201cNot celebrating at all because it is very, very early in the game,\" he said. But proof was emerging, he said, to show that \u201csome of the pivots that we are making are working.\"\n\nWrite to Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com",

            "content": "In times of economic downturns, with much uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy and Trump\u2019s infamous import tariffs, a strong portfolio needs some defensive picks to weather the storm. Historically, PepsiCo (PEP) has been a reliable defensive dividend stock that many investors have turned to for diversification. I like to think of PepsiCo as a giant ocean liner\u2014it moves slowly but reaches its destination unscathed, keeping the passengers happy through service and price.\n\nHowever, at the moment, this massive ship is facing some headwinds that have slowed its progress. Specifically, PepsiCo is struggling with weakness in its snack segment, which has been hit by health-conscious consumers and users of weight-loss drugs stepping back from sugary drinks in favor of healthier alternatives. Additionally, in FY2024, PepsiCo could not fully cover its dividend distribution as free cash flow shrank compared to the previous year.\n\nWhile I think there\u2019s a good chance the management team can steer this ship through the current storm and eventually return to strong cash flow growth, I\u2019m not sure how long that process will take. Until we get more clarity, PepsiCo may continue to underperform. Given this scenario, I don\u2019t think now is the ideal time to buy PEP, and I\u2019m adopting a neutral rating for now.\n\nPepsiCo Battles Declining Snack Sales and Shifting Trends\n\nEven though PepsiCo\u2019s strategy is built on slow growth and dividends, the company has experienced an interesting growth trend over the past five years, posting a CAGR of around 6.5%. This growth was primarily driven by the pandemic, which significantly increased spending as people ate more at home and dined out less.\n\nHowever, such growth rates are unlikely to be repeated anytime soon. Shareholders may be lucky if PepsiCo can grow its top line in the low to mid-single digits. This is because PepsiCo\u2019s products face increasing resistance as consumers choose more health-conscious options and turn to GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. These drugs already have around 15 million regular users in the U.S. As a result, PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay North America segment saw operating profits drop by 7% in FY2024, with organic volume falling 0.5% year-over-year.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s go-to strategy to drive volume growth and efficiency in this segment is raising prices and adjusting package sizes. As CEO Ramon Laguarta explains: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have much more surgical offerings to consumers, especially around price partitions. I think we can manage pricing and sizing in a way that gives consumers options without diluting the pricing of our business or the category.\u201d\n\nMain Street Data showing PepsiCo\u2019s quarterly revenues in various regional segments\n\nAs the market increasingly sees PepsiCo as a food company and the company works to pivot the snack category back to growth, we\u2019ve seen the stock underperform. The real question is whether PepsiCo is facing a true crisis, producing foods no longer popular with the broader public, or if this is just a temporary trend in consumer behavior.\n\nIs PepsiCo\u2019s Dividend Strategy Sustainable?\n\nRegardless of PEP\u2019s share price gyrations, passive income investors care about PepsiCo\u2019s ability to consistently distribute dividends to shareholders. PepsiCo has rightfully claimed its title of \u201cDividend King\u201d following its long history of paying and increasing dividends for at least 52 consecutive years. Once again, it was good news when PepsiCo announced a 5% dividend increase this year, well above inflation, although it was lower than the 7% increase from the same period last year.\n\nCurrently, PepsiCo offers a dividend yield of 3.55%, which is relatively strong compared to other U.S. dividend stocks. But of course, just paying a dividend isn\u2019t enough\u2014what matters most is how sustainable that payment will be in the future.\n\nLooking at PepsiCo\u2019s free cash flow generation in 2024, we see the company produced $7.19 billion. While that\u2019s a dramatic drop of 9.2% from the previous year, it still represents a 2.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last five years. However, last year, the free cash flow generated wasn\u2019t enough to cover the $7.22 billion in dividends distributed. This is a cautionary sign that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how quickly PepsiCo will overcome the headwinds in its snack business and report better growth metrics for free cash flow. On the flip side, the company trades at 16.4x cash flows, about 15% below its historical average over the last five years. The market does expect operating cash flows to increase by 7.2% in 2025, but that\u2019s still short of the growth rates seen in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIs PepsiCo a Buy or Sell?\n\nOn Wall Street, PEP stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buy, seven Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. PEP\u2019s average price target of $164.43 per share implies approximately 10% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Dividend Outlook Clouded by Structural Challenges\n\nPepsiCo remains a renowned defensive stock with a low beta and attractive dividends, but whether the current moment is a good time to initiate a long position is another matter. There are some critical issues that make me uncomfortable about the company\u2019s ability to sustain its appeal to passive income investors. Specifically, the headwinds in its snack segment\u2014 which could be structural\u2014continue to impact the company\u2019s cash generation, making it challenging to cover dividends adequately and sustainably. This is a key factor for me when selecting dividend stocks, as it only makes sense to include them in a portfolio if they can provide long-term stability.\n\nGiven the above, I prefer to stay cautious on PepsiCo for now. More clarity is essential on how quickly\u2014and if\u2014the snack segment can recover in terms of volume and operating margins to get PepsiCo\u2019s cash generation back on a sustainable path.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other stocks insiders were selling in Q1 2025.\n\nThe broader market index rose 0.2% on Tuesday amid volatility as investors awaited clarity on President Trump\u2019s tariff policy. The market also faced pressure from weaker-than-expected economic data, including a disappointing manufacturing survey and lower-than-expected job openings, according to CNBC. The blue chip companies and Nasdaq Composite also saw modest gains, with the market continuing to react to uncertainty.\n\nAs this market uncertainty persists, insider trading often draws attention. While executive stock purchases can signal optimism, insider sales may stem from personal financial reasons or diversification needs. Executives typically follow pre-arranged plans, like 10b5-1, to ensure transparency. Insider trading offers insights but should be considered alongside a company\u2019s financial health and market conditions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWhat are some of the stocks that insiders have been selling the most in the first quarter of the year? To find out, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener, focusing only on stocks where at least five insiders had sold shares in January, February, or March. From there, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest number of insiders selling shares.\n\nToday, we\u2019re focusing on stocks that insiders have been heavily selling during the first three months of the year. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading screener, we identified stocks where at least five insider sales totaled $1 million or more. While the overall value of insider sales for these stocks may be higher, we specifically focused on sales worth $1 million or more. From the stocks that met this criterion, we selected the 20 with the highest number of insider sales of $1 million or more.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWith each stock, we note the average price per share of these purchases and the stock\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPepsiCo named Mark Kirkham as CMO of U.S. beverages, effective April 7, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The unit houses brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Bubly, Starry and Gatorade. Kirkham, who has over 14 years of experience at the company, takes over the role from longtime marketing chief Greg Lyons, who is leaving PepsiCo to pursue an external opportunity.\n\nKirkham in October became senior vice president of sparkling beverages for PepsiCo North America, a move that saw him return to the U.S. after overseeing international beverages for the CPG giant. Lyons had served as CMO of the sprawling U.S. beverages group since 2018, an impressive run for a C-suite spot that is prone to churn. Former Pepsi CMO Todd Kaplan, another longtime PepsiCo executive, left the company last June for Kraft Heinz.\n\n\u201cMark is a multi-disciplined marketer and creative storyteller with deep, global experience in the beverage business. He led the step-changed international approach to accelerating zero sugar and expanding our portfolio to address the needs of evolving consumers,\u201d said Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., in a statement around the promotion. \u201cIn working with Mark over the years, I\u2019ve been impressed by his imaginative approach to scalable problem solving; he is well-poised to take on this role and lead us into the next chapter of innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo in the announcement highlighted several of Kirkham\u2019s past wins, such as leading a well-received rebrand for Pepsi in international markets and an iteration of the soft drink\u2019s famous Pepsi Challenge campaign centered on its zero-sugar offering. Kirkham\u2019s bona fides in the better-for-you arena speak to where PepsiCo\u2019s strategic focus is shifting.\n\nThe company earlier this month acquired prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion, teeing up another battle in the soda wars saga as chief rival Coca-Cola also dips its toes into a category that is winning favor with key Gen Z and millennial consumers. Prebiotic sodas, which promote benefits to gut health and also encompass disruptor brands like Olipop, make up a market that is estimated to reach $3.5 billion in value by 2032. How Poppi will be handled on the marketing front likely won\u2019t be clear until the closing of the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nPepsiCo switching up marketing leadership for one of its flagship divisions comes at a challenging juncture. Like many in the food and beverage industry, the marketer is grappling with more price-conscious shoppers and ongoing global uncertainty. Demand for its snacks and beverages again dropped in North America in Q4 2024, though organic revenue climbed 2.1% for the end-of-year period.\n\nOther changes of late at PepsiCo beverages include a visual refresh and repositioning for Mountain Dew that has seen the soda embrace what executives call \u201cenergizing refreshment\u201d and ramp up marketing around a new brand character, the Mountain Dude.",

The QFNA segment, which includes brands like Quaker Oats, has been affected by product recalls due to contamination concerns, including Salmonella, leading to lower sales and profits in recent quarters.\n\n\n\nThe North American convenient foods business has also faced weak demand, influenced by rising prices and ongoing product recalls. Additionally, business disruptions from escalating geopolitical tensions in certain international markets have weighed on revenue. PepsiCo\u2019s aggressive price hikes in response to inflation have pressured volumes as consumers adjust their spending.\n\n\n\nInvestor skepticism persists as these challenges continue. In the fourth quarter of 2024, revenues declined 0.2% year over year, with unit volume down 1% in both the convenient foods and beverage businesses. Foreign currency fluctuations further impacted revenues by 2%.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s pricing strategy and ongoing product recalls remain key concerns, particularly in North America. Higher prices have contributed to declining volumes, while contamination-related recalls in the QFNA segment have added further pressure on performance.",

            "content": "This blue chip stalwart might struggle to stay ahead of the S&P 500.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP 1.72%) is often considered a resilient stock for long-term investors. It's one of the world's largest beverage and packaged food makers, it consistently buys back its own shares, and it's raised its dividend annually for 52 consecutive years.\n\nBut over the past three years, PepsiCo's stock declined 11% as the S&P 500 rose 21%. Let's see why this blue chip stalwart underperformed the market, and if it has a shot at outperforming it again over the next three years.\n\nWhat happened to PepsiCo over the past three years?\n\nPepsiCo's beverage division sells its namesake soda, other carbonated drinks, and a broad range of fruit juices, teas, sports drinks, and bottled water. It also sells packaged foods through its Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods, and Pioneer Foods businesses.\n\nPepsiCo's scale and diversification usually make it a dependable stock. But over the past three years, its growth in net and organic revenues slowed. On a constant currency basis, its core earnings per share (EPS) growth also cooled.\n\nMetric 2022 2023 2024 Net Revenue Growth 8.7% 5.9% 0.4% Organic Revenue Growth 14.4% 9.5% 2% Core Gross Margin Growth (7 bps) 101 bps 72 bps Core Constant Currency EPS Growth 11% 14% 9% EPS Growth 17% 2% 6%\n\nThree major challenges throttled PepsiCo's growth. First, inflation drove it to raise its prices and shrink its packages. Second, it grappled with slower spending and weaker pricing power in China and Latin America, which largely offset the benefits from those price hikes in North America. Lastly, it issued several major recalls, including one for a salmonella outbreak at Quaker Foods and another one for a mass mislabeling of its \"zero sugar\" beverages.\n\nQuaker's North America unit is now PepsiCo's weakest link. Its organic revenue rose 13% in 2022, but grew just 1% in 2023 and declined 14% in 2024. Without any near-term catalysts, Quaker could continue to struggle over the next few years.\n\nWhat will happen to PepsiCo over the next three years?\n\nFor 2025, PepsiCo expects organic revenue to grow by the low single digits as its core constant currency EPS rises by the mid-single digits. That would be consistent with its growth rates in 2024, which suggests current headwinds will continue.\n\nDuring its latest conference call in February, CFO Jamie Caulfield said PepsiCo would \"continue to invest\" in its infrastructure, technology, and automation solutions to get some \"momentum back\" for its Frito-Lay North America segment, which suffered a 0.5% decline in organic sales in 2024 as it seemingly maxed out pricing power in an inflationary environment.\n\nCaulfield also expects \"North America's performance to improve gradually\" throughout 2025 as its international business remains \"quite resilient and a major contributor\" to its overall growth.\n\nAs for Quaker, Caulfield believes it still has room to expand by launching new products in the high-protein breakfast market. To stabilize the growth of PepsiCo's North American beverage unit, it plans to \"de-emphasize\" its weaker and lower-margin brands while buying higher-growth brands like Poppi.\n\nFrom 2024 to 2027 (on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis), analysts expect PepsiCo's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 9%. Those estimates seem stable, but they assume the company can overcome its near-term challenges and won't be hit by more recalls.\n\nWhere will PepsiCo's stock be in three years?\n\nAssuming PepsiCo matches analysts' expectations, grows its EPS by another 9% in 2028, and still trades at 19 times forward earnings, its stock could rise 19% to $177 in three years. That would be a decent gain, but it could still probably underperform the S&P 500 -- which has historically delivered average annual returns of more than 10% since its inception.\n\nPepsiCo should keep raising its dividends over the next three years, since it currently has a sustainable trailing payout ratio of 77%, and continue to buy back shares. It should remain a steady investment at these levels, and its high forward yield of 3.6% could attract more income investors as interest rates decline. That said, PepsiCo could continue to underperform the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future -- so it might not be the best consumer staples play for long-term investors.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best consumer staples stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs the US Economy Headed for a Recession?\n\nConsumer confidence is plunging in the US. It dropped further in March, with the Conference Board reporting the future outlook falling to the lowest level in more than a decade. The Conference Board\u2019s monthly confidence index dropped to 92.9, reflecting a 7.2-point slip and making March the fourth consecutive month of index contraction. The index calculates respondents\u2019 outlook on job prospects, business, and income. The fall was higher than analyst estimates, as economists surveyed by Dow Jones estimated a reading of 93.5.\n\nThat is not all: the measure for future estimates is painting an even bleaker story with the index falling to 65.2, reflecting a 9.6-point drop and making it the lowest number in 12 years. The reading is also considerably below the 80 level, which is typically considered a benchmark signal for an incoming recession.\n\nWhile the confidence drop was spread across income groups, it was primarily driven by a decline in consumers aged 55 or older. These readings are materializing at a time uncertainty and concerns regarding President Trump\u2019s tariffs are already looming on the market. These concerns have coincided with other surveys exhibiting waning consumer sentiment and a volatile stock market. CNBC reported that Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cConsumers\u2019 optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers\u2019 assessments of their personal situations.\u201d\n\nOn March 14, CNBC reported that while headwinds like persistent inflation and high interest rates were already affecting companies, they now have to deal with additional obstacles such as worsening consumer sentiment, tariffs that go on and off, and mass government layoffs. Over the last weeks, investor presentations and earnings calls have shown a distinct trend: consumer-facing businesses and retailers are warning that fiscal Q1 2025 sales are coming in softer than expected. 2025 may prove to be a year tougher than what analysts initially estimated.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best Coffee Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Department Store Stocks to Invest in.\n\nConsumer Staples: Are They a Safe Haven Amid Recession Concerns?\n\nConsumer staples are generally considered a safe haven amid recession and market volatility.

            "content": "PepsiCo named Mark Kirkham as CMO of U.S. beverages, effective April 7, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The unit houses brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Bubly, Starry and Gatorade. Kirkham, who has over 14 years of experience at the company, takes over the role from longtime marketing chief Greg Lyons, who is leaving PepsiCo to pursue an external opportunity.\n\nKirkham in October became senior vice president of sparkling beverages for PepsiCo North America, a move that saw him return to the U.S. after overseeing international beverages for the CPG giant. Lyons had served as CMO of the sprawling U.S. beverages group since 2018, an impressive run for a C-suite spot that is prone to churn. Former Pepsi CMO Todd Kaplan, another longtime PepsiCo executive, left the company last June for Kraft Heinz.\n\n\u201cMark is a multi-disciplined marketer and creative storyteller with deep, global experience in the beverage business. He led the step-changed international approach to accelerating zero sugar and expanding our portfolio to address the needs of evolving consumers,\u201d said Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., in a statement around the promotion. \u201cIn working with Mark over the years, I\u2019ve been impressed by his imaginative approach to scalable problem solving; he is well-poised to take on this role and lead us into the next chapter of innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo in the announcement highlighted several of Kirkham\u2019s past wins, such as leading a well-received rebrand for Pepsi in international markets and an iteration of the soft drink\u2019s famous Pepsi Challenge campaign centered on its zero-sugar offering. Kirkham\u2019s bona fides in the better-for-you arena speak to where PepsiCo\u2019s strategic focus is shifting.\n\nThe company earlier this month acquired prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion, teeing up another battle in the soda wars saga as chief rival Coca-Cola also dips its toes into a category that is winning favor with key Gen Z and millennial consumers. Prebiotic sodas, which promote benefits to gut health and also encompass disruptor brands like Olipop, make up a market that is estimated to reach $3.5 billion in value by 2032. How Poppi will be handled on the marketing front likely won\u2019t be clear until the closing of the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval.\n\nPepsiCo switching up marketing leadership for one of its flagship divisions comes at a challenging juncture. Like many in the food and beverage industry, the marketer is grappling with more price-conscious shoppers and ongoing global uncertainty. Demand for its snacks and beverages again dropped in North America in Q4 2024, though organic revenue climbed 2.1% for the end-of-year period.\n\nOther changes of late at PepsiCo beverages include a visual refresh and repositioning for Mountain Dew that has seen the soda embrace what executives call \u201cenergizing refreshment\u201d and ramp up marketing around a new brand character, the Mountain Dude.",

Subscribe to Adweek newsletters .\n\nPepsiCo has appointed Mark Kirkham as chief marketing officer of PepsiCo Beverages North America, the company confirmed to ADWEEK.\n\nHe succeeds Greg Lyons, who served as the division\u2019s CMO since January 2017. According to PepsiCo, Lyons is leaving to pursue an external opportunity, though his next job has not been disclosed.\n\nKirkham most recently served as senior vice president of marketing for sparkling brands and returned to the U.S. six months ago after holding international leadership roles, including CMO of PepsiCo International Beverages. A 15-year PepsiCo veteran, he brings 25 years of experience across insights, innovation, and global brand building.\n\nHe steps into the CMO role at a pivotal time for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage business, as the company doubles down on healthier options and looks to revitalize its portfolio of brands. Kirkham played a key role in expanding the company\u2019s zero sugar offerings globally, particularly with the Pepsi Zero Sugar Challenge, an initiative aimed at converting regular soda drinkers to the zero-calorie variety.\n\nOther major campaigns under Kirkham\u2019s leadership include Pepsi\u2019s global rebrand, Gatorade\u2019s \u201cFuel Tomorrow\u201d brand platform, the \u201cFood Deserves Pepsi\u201d campaign, and the recent restage of Mountain Dew\u2014all focused on modernizing the portfolio and courting younger, health-conscious consumers.\n\nRam Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, called Kirkham \u201ca multi-disciplined marketer and creative storyteller\u201d in a statement to ADWEEK, praising his \u201cimaginative approach to scalable problem solving.\u201d\n\nKirkham\u2019s appointment comes as PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola compete for dominance in a shifting beverage landscape. Both companies have placed major marketing bets on zero sugar variants as consumers increasingly avoid sugary drinks.\n\nCoca-Cola recently retooled its Coke Zero Sugar formula and launched Gen Z-focused campaigns including an AI-generated music studio, a collaboration with K-pop group NewJeans, and creator-led content experiences tied to the Share a Coke platform.\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to acquiring prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion earlier this month, PepsiCo has worked to refresh its flagship brand while tying Pepsi more closely to meals.\n\nKirkham was unavailable for interviews at the time of publication. But he shared on ADWEEK\u2019s Speed of Culture podcast in September 2024: \u201cThe day I stop learning is the day I stop being a marketer. As a marketer, you should be fundamentally curious and always be looking to understand your consumer better.\u201d",

            "content": "\"You could make it redder if you wanted to.\"\n\nFor decades, artificial food dyes have made snack foods pop with eye-catching reds, electric blues, and vivid yellows \u2014 but at what cost? Concerns over synthetic dyes, from potential health risks to consumer demand for more natural ingredients, have major food companies rethinking their formulas.\n\nNow, PepsiCo is joining the shift with its new Simply Ruffles Hot & Spicy, reported Bloomberg. The chips bring the heat without the signature bright red dust of Flamin' Hot snacks. Instead of using artificial colors like Red No. 40, they get their spice-speckled look from real ingredients like tomato powder and red chile pepper.\n\nThis launch is part of a bigger shift at PepsiCo to phase out synthetic dyes across its snack lineup.\n\n\"You could make it redder if you wanted to,\" said Ian Puddephat, PepsiCo's vice president of research and development for food ingredients, according to Bloomberg. But the company decided against it, betting that a lighter color signals to consumers that the chip isn't just spicy \u2014 it's made with real ingredients, too.\n\nThe Simply brand, which has been around since 2013, is now getting more attention as PepsiCo leans into utilizing natural ingredients. CEO Ramon Laguarta recently called it a key part of the company's push to meet changing consumer expectations. \"There's a higher level of awareness in general of American consumers toward health and wellness,\" Laguarta said.\n\nFood companies across the industry are under increasing pressure to eliminate artificial dyes, especially as regulators crack down. The Food and Drug Administration recently banned Red No. 3 for food products, effective January 2027, and health advocates continue pushing for broader changes. Critics argue that artificial dyes contribute nothing to taste or nutrition while potentially posing health risks.\n\nPepsiCo is working to remove them from eight additional brands over the next year, though Puddephat acknowledges it's a challenge. \"It's really, really hard to reformulate existing products. Consumers are very good at noticing very small changes,\" he said.\n\nDespite the difficulty, some companies have successfully swapped out artificial dyes without backlash.\n\nKraft Heinz quietly removed them from its mac and cheese years ago, and Conagra Brands Inc., which owns Slim Jim, says that 92% of its products are now synthetic-dye free, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDye manufacturers are also adapting to the growing demand for natural alternatives. \"Certainly in the last few months, the slope has accelerated significantly,\" said Paul Manning, CEO of Sensient Technologies, a major supplier of both synthetic and natural food colors.\n\nThis shift gives consumers more natural choices without losing out on flavor while also cutting back on synthetic additives. By making the switch, companies are responding to the demand for cleaner labels and more transparency \u2014 proving that snack foods can be both bold and better for you.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

            "content": "As highlighted above, dividend aristocrats have shown lower volatility as compared to the broader market index. Their ability to provide downside protection can be seen in the upside and downside capture ratios. The S&P report highlighted that the dividend aristocrats index has outperformed the market index 66.67% of the time in down months and 43.88% of the time in up months. Notably, the index also has a lower drawdown level compared with the benchmark index. In addition, the dividend aristocrats index provided an average excess return of 0.87% in down months over the broader market. To further emphasize their low volatility, the report mentioned that the dividend aristocrats had a market beta of 0.8 between December 29, 1989, and February 28, 2025.\n\nIn addition to dividend growth, dividend yield is also an important component of total return. The ability to increase dividends does not come at the expense of lower yields; in fact, the dividend aristocrats index has consistently delivered higher yields than its benchmark. The index had dividend yields within the range of 2.0% to 2.8% over the 28-year period, as reported by S&P Global. Moreover, the average dividend yield of the index was 2.5%, compared with a 1.8% dividend yield of the broader market.\n\nInvestors are more inclined toward dividend growth stocks, and the performance of these equities has also remained stable over the years. According to a report by S&P Global, dividend aristocrats have reported higher returns with lower volatility over the long run as compared to the broader market, which eventually resulted in higher risk-adjusted returns.\n\nGrowing dividends consistently highlight the companies\u2019 confidence in their firms\u2019 prospects as market participants see this as a sign of corporate maturity and strong balance sheets. Dividend aristocrats reveal characteristics of both capital growth and dividend income, as opposed to alternative income strategies that mainly pay attention to pure yield or pure capital appreciation.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. Dividends have been an important part of the overall market return for a very long time. According to a report by S&P Global, dividends have represented approximately 31% of the total return of the broader market from 1926 to February 2025, while capital appreciation has accounted for 69%.\n\nWe recently published a list of the 15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks with Over 3% Yield . In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best dividend aristocrats with a high yield.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith the AI boom and tech stocks taking center stage, dividend stocks are somehow overlooked by the market. However, the recent market sell-off has restored their importance, as the Dividend Aristocrats Index has surged by over 2% since the start of 2025, compared with a nearly 5% decline in the broader market. The significance of these equities is much more apparent over long periods of time. According to the S&P Global report, the dividend aristocrats index outperformed its benchmark by an average of 1.59% per year between January 2000 and February 2025. This outperformance was because of the fundamental characteristics of the constituents of the index.\n\n15 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks with Over 3% Yield\n\nA close up of a glass of a refreshing carbonated beverage illustrating the company's different beverages.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned a list of the Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with dividend yields above 3%, as of March 29. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nDividend Yield as of March 29: 3.63%\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American food, snack, and beverage company, headquartered in New York. The company posted strong earnings in the FY24, with revenues coming in at $91.8 billion, up from $91.4 billion in 2023. Its operating profit also grew to $12.8 billion from $11.9 billion in FY23. The company reported a net income of $9.6 billion. For FY25, it expects low single-digit organic revenue growth and mid-single-digit growth in core constant currency EPS.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has expanded over the years, following its strategy of continuous acquisitions. The company recently announced the acquisition of poppi, which is a prebiotic soda brand. This would mark PepsiCo\u2019s entry into the functional soda market and would expand its portfolio with \u2018better-for-you\u2019 options.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a strong cash position, which makes it one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. In FY24, the company generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. It also plans to return around $7.6 billion to shareholders through dividends in the upcoming fiscal year. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.63%, as recorded on March 29. In February, PEP achieved its 53rd consecutive annual dividend hike, becoming a reliable choice for investors.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2024 indicated that 69 hedge funds held stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), up from 58 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $4.5 billion. With over 5.6 million shares, Fundsmith LLP was one of the company\u2019s most prominent stakeholders at the end of Q4.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 6th on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "As the 18th season of the Indian Premier League coincides with soaring summer temperatures, the soft drink market has become a battleground for an intensified modern Cola War. With Campa challenging industry titans Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the competition has escalated, marked by aggressive pricing strategies and high-profile advertising campaigns.\n\nIn an effort to capture market share, all three brands have embraced an accessible pricing model, offering products at Rs 10. Campa Cola has positioned its 200 ml bottle at this price point, while Coca-Cola has reduced its 250 ml variant from Rs 20 to Rs 15. Meanwhile, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have expanded their portfolios with sugar-free options, trying to address health-conscious consumers and Campa's fast-paced growth and marketing.\n\nCoca-Cola, reinforcing its commitment to affordability, introduced a Rs 10 Coke Zero pack, while PepsiCo countered with Pepsi Black in a comparable price range. But the race to attract consumers is as much about nostalgia and branding as it is about affordability.\n\nAt the Storyboard18 Global Pioneers Summit, Jagrut Kotecha, PepsiCo\u2019s CEO for India and South Asia, spoke about the company\u2019s strategic evolution. \"For PepsiCo, consumers are at the heart of every campaign, and we design products with them in mind,\" Kotecha said, positioning the company as a brand that goes beyond cola.\n\nThe competition has been highlighted by a series of advertising face-offs. Earlier this month, PepsiCo took a direct shot at Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201cHalf Time\u201d campaign during a marquee India-Pakistan match, flipping the narrative with: Why stop at halftime when it's ALWAYS Pepsi Time? The campaign leveraged nostalgia, which Kotecha described as a key driver of consumer engagement.\n\nWhile the Coca-Cola and PepsiCo rivalry is decades-old, the reemergence of Campa Cola has added a new dimension. Kotecha acknowledged that while PepsiCo maintains a challenger mindset, adaptability remains key. \"Whether as a market leader or follower, agility enables us to stay ahead,\" he noted.\n\n\u201cAll our campaigns - past and present - are deeply consumer-centric. We are consumer mavericks, putting them at the core of everything we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nostalgia factor resonated strongly. That\u2019s why Pepsi remains a beloved trademark.\u201d\n\nBeyond competition, Kotecha emphasized collaboration on sustainability initiatives, particularly in plastic waste management. He highlighted PepsiCo\u2019s role in the \u201cWeCare\u201d forum, an alliance of 25-27 companies dedicated to recycling efforts. \"When we share a common goal, we can put competition aside,\" he said, citing the program\u2019s success in achieving 100% recycling of materials.\n\nAddressing the growing skepticism around purpose-driven brands, Kotecha argued that authenticity is critical. \"Consumers are astute; they can sense when a brand's purpose isn\u2019t genuine,\" he said, citing Lay\u2019s partnerships with 27,000 farmers as an example of corporate social responsibility embedded in business strategy.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of risk-taking and innovation, asserting that \u201cpredictable ideas don\u2019t lead to breakthroughs.\u201d On failure, Kotecha offered a pragmatic view: \"Failure is just the first attempt at learning. The real issue is not taking action; failing is part of the process.\"",

The rapid fall surprised several investors, mainly considering the favorable underlying conditions US stocks carried into 2025. The broader markets are reacting primarily to the potential economic consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Most critical are the new trade policies focused on raising tariffs for goods imported to the US. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management, the uncertainty remains the key driver around the market\u2019s recent decline. There are increased concerns related to the potential economic weakness, mainly because of tariff impacts.\n\nSector Performance in 2025\n\nAs per US Bank (Wealth Management), in 2023 and 2024, stocks were aided by consistent economic growth as technology stocks dominated the broader market performance. The revenues of technology companies were aided by significant spending on AI-related investment. As per Haworth, it is of utmost importance for other sectors to make increased earnings contributions. In the early months of 2025, there was a shift in investor sentiment. The sectors that supported the prior year\u2019s market performance, i.e., IT, communication services, and consumer discretionary, have been dragging the market down.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nUnderlying Fundamentals Remain Strong\n\nUS Bank (Wealth Management) stated that the markets fluctuated through most of Q1 2025. That being said, by February 19, the S&P 500 gained 4.5%, says the firm. Furthermore, the firm added that YTD through March 17, the broader S&P 500\u2019s total return was down 3.23%. This comes after 2 years of 25%+ S&P 500 total returns. Despite the uncertainty, for the time being, many underlying fundamentals remain positive. According to Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management, the consumers remain in a good spot, and companies are flush with cash.\n\nAs per Haworth, while US markets were impacted in Q1 2025, global stocks delivered positive returns. In the current environment, Haworth believes that a globally diversified portfolio places the investors in a position to capitalize on numerous opportunities. Notably, investors tend to respond to the perceived potential corporate earnings based on specific policies or events. Even though there have been struggles in early 2025, most of the underlying data is favorable.",

            "content": "recently encountered shareholder activism, with various proposals rejected by the company's board. This series of shareholder proposals demanding increased corporate accountability coincided with a 2.6% price increase in PepsiCo's shares over the past week. Contrary to PepsiCo's upward movement, the broader market faced headwinds, recording a 1.8% decline amid renewed concerns over tariffs and global trade. These elements underscore the distinct divergence between the company's performance and broader market trends during the same period, highlighting PepsiCo's resilience even as market sentiment overall trended downward.\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, PepsiCo's total shareholder return, which combines share price appreciation and dividends, has reached 38.62%. This performance highlights the company's capacity to deliver value to its shareholders, setting it apart from many industry peers. Notably, the broader US Beverage industry saw a negative return of 3% over the past year, demonstrating PepsiCo's resilience and adaptability in a challenging market.\n\nA series of strategic developments have contributed to PepsiCo's performance. The company invested over US$235.91 million in share repurchases, a move that often supports share prices. Additionally, PepsiCo pursued advances in sustainability and product innovation, including the launch of new health-conscious beverages. Recently, acquisition talks with Poppi and a renewed partnership with Madison Square Garden underscored PepsiCo's commitment to growth through diversification and enhanced market presence. These endeavors, alongside a robust dividend policy, have helped strengthen PepsiCo's position in the global market.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

The transaction also includes an additional potential earnout consideration subject to the achievement of certain performance milestones within a specified period after closing of the transaction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been evolving our food and beverage portfolio over many years, including by innovating with our brands in new spaces and through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enable us to offer more positive choices to our consumers,\u201d said Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and CEO, PepsiCo. \u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness. poppi is a great complement to our portfolio transformation efforts to meet these needs.\u201d\n\npoppi is a fast-growing functional soda brand that combines prebiotics, fruit juice, and apple cider vinegar to create a deliciously refreshing low calorie soda with no more than five grams of sugar per serving. poppi\u2019s consumer-first approach, cultural cache, and nutritional profile have nurtured a loyal fan base and driven rapid growth. poppi was created by Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, discovered on Shark Tank by Rohan Oza and funded by CAVU Consumer Partners from their initial seed round to today.\n\n\u201cAs we look to reorient our portfolio offerings to address white space consumer needs, the poppi brand\u2019s unique intersection with wellness and culture is a perfect addition to our portfolio,\u201d said Ram Krishnan, CEO, PepsiCo Beverages U.S. \u201cAllison and the poppi team have built a magnetic brand that\u2019s ahead of the trends, with a loyal consumer base and a demonstrated capacity for growth. We are big fans of the poppi brand movement and believe this incredible brand paired with our commercial capabilities will drive continued growth and innovation for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I created poppi in our kitchen, it was fueled by a desire to create a better-for-you soda,\u201d said Allison Ellsworth, Co-Founder of poppi. \u201cWe never imagined how many people we could reach through hard work, determination and a clear mission to create a functional soda that stands the test of time. We believe poppi is the soda that will be embraced for generations to come, and we\u2019re beyond grateful to the amazing poppi team, our partners who believed in us from the very beginning and most importantly our incredible community. We can\u2019t wait to begin this next chapter with PepsiCo to bring our soda to more people \u2013 and I know they will honor what makes poppi so special while supporting our next phase of growth and innovation. I hope our story inspires others to explore their passions, take the risk, and believe that anything is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transaction for PepsiCo to acquire poppi is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. Additional terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\n\n\u201cpoppi is a true testament to the American Dream! From the kitchen to Shark Tank to becoming an iconic brand, this couldn\u2019t have been done without the amazing founders Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, the incredible team in place led by CEO Chris Hall, the unmatched support of CAVU\u2019s Uncommon team led by Stevie Clements, and the extraordinary poppi community,\u201d said Rohan Oza, Guest Shark on ABC\u2019s Shark Tank and Co-Founder at CAVU Consumer Partners. \u201cWe\u2019re beyond thrilled to be partnering with PepsiCo so that even more consumers across America, and the world, can enjoy poppi \u2013 a truly modern soda for the next generation.\u201d\n\nCenterview Partners LLC is acting as lead financial advisor to PepsiCo, and J.P.

            "content": "If you like boring companies that reward you well for sticking around, you'll love high-yield Dividend King and consumer staples giant PepsiCo (PEP 1.72%). It is out of favor on Wall Street right now, but it is actively working to get its business back on track. If history is any guide, the current situation is an opportunity for long-term dividend investors to buy a great company.\n\nIf you wait for some distant tomorrow there's a good chance you'll miss out. Here are three reasons to buy this stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Buy PepsiCo for the dividend\n\nOne of the very first reasons to be attracted to PepsiCo today is its 3.7% dividend yield. The average consumer staples stock has a yield of 2.6%. The S&P 500 has an even lower yield of just 1.2%. So, on a relative basis compared to peers and the broader market, PepsiCo's yield is highly attractive.\n\nPepsiCo's dividend yield is also attractive relative to its own history, sitting at the high end of the company's historical yield range. That suggests that PepsiCo is historically cheap, a fact that's backed up by more traditional valuation metrics like the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios. Those metrics, and others, are below their five-year averages.\n\nOn top of the yield story, there's another dividend fact to know about: PepsiCo is a Dividend King, with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases behind it. So not only does the stock have a high yield and look cheap, but it also has an incredible history of returning value to investors via regular dividend growth in both good times and bad.\n\n2. PepsiCo's business has a strong and diversified foundation\n\nNo company gets to be a Dividend King by accident. It requires a strong business model that is executed well through the inevitable business swings it will face. One of the key aspects of PepsiCo's approach is to diversify its portfolio.\n\nFor starters, PepsiCo is a consumer staples maker, which means it sells products that tend to be purchased regardless of the economic environment. From a big-picture perspective, it sells food. But there's more to the story.\n\nPepsiCo is the dominant salty snack food company, it is the second biggest U.S. beverage maker, and it has a solid position in the packaged food space. It is probably among the most diversified food makers you can buy.\n\nGiven the company's massive size (it has a market cap of roughly $200 billion), it has scale advantages that set it apart as well. The company's portfolio is large and varied, it has a global distribution network, the marketing team is industry-leading, and the company can, and does, use acquisitions to update its portfolio. PepsiCo is, without a doubt, an industry-leading consumer staples company.\n\n3. PepsiCo is executing its playbook to maintain growth\n\nHaving a good playbook is great, but every company goes through hard times. That's the case right now with PepsiCo, as growth has cooled off following a strong growth period driven by post-coronavirus pandemic inflation. The snack category, where the company is most dominant, appears to be facing particular headwinds.\n\nPepsiCo isn't sitting around waiting for things to get better -- it is actively working to shift and change with the world around it. That has included buying the 50% of Sabra, a spread maker, it didn't own. It also bought Siete, a Mexican-American food maker with products that touch on both snacks and packaged foods. And most recently, PepsiCo agreed to buy Poppi, a prebiotic soda brand.\n\nAll three moves are right in line with the company's long-term playbook and should help it boost growth. In fact, for Siete and Poppi, all PepsiCo needs to do is plug the products into its vast distribution network and growth should be significant.\n\nThe big takeaway here, however, is that PepsiCo is taking steps to get back on track. Historically it has managed that feat each time it has hit a soft patch. There's no particular reason to believe, given its actions, that it won't succeed again this time around.\n\nDon't wait -- this opportunity won't last forever\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the stock market today, and it might be hard to pull the trigger and buy an out-of-favor stock. But PepsiCo is an incredibly well-run company, and its valuation and yield are very attractive, historically speaking and relative to other investment options. Now is the time to buy like there's no tomorrow -- because tomorrow, this opportunity to buy at a discount might be gone.",

How about ordering a parmegiana shepherd\u2019s pie or a vegan moqueca sandwich? That\u2019s the idea behind PEPSI\u00ae\u2018s latest campaign, \u201cYour Bites, Your Rights.\u201d The brand, part of PepsiCo, tapped into Artificial Intelligence to mix and match ingredients and design brand-new dishes for Piraj\u00e1, a Rio-style bar and restaurant in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nTailored to each customer\u2019s taste, the project, created by AMPFY , encourages creative food choices and expands consumption possibilities. Aligned with the brand\u2019s global positioning \u201cBetter with\u201d, PEPSI\u00ae invites consumers to be daring and discover new culinary experiences. To bring the concept to life, the restaurant menu was replaced with a tablet that allowed users to combine ingredients, using a simple voice command, generating AI-created images. After that, the chef was challenged to bring that image to life.\n\nThis is PEPSI\u00ae\u2019s first fully meal-focused campaign in Latin America. According to Diego Bastian, Head of Carbonated Beverages Marketing at PepsiCo Brazil, the initiative demonstrates how technology can create immersive experiences and connect with consumers beyond the digital space.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Your Bites, Your Rights\u2019 campaign brings PEPSI\u00ae\u2019s irreverence to the table and shows the brand as a choice full of personality. From the surprise of the AI-generated images to the excitement of tasting something completely new, this action redefines brand experience,\u201d he says.\n\nThe campaign extends to social media (Meta and TikTok), supported by brand lovers and influencers like Camila Trianda, Caju, and Mustache.\n\nSource: Ampfy",

            "content": "At a time when industries are increasingly defined by competition and data-driven decision-making, Jagrut Kotecha, CEO of PepsiCo India and South Asia, has a different vision: one of collaboration, shared resources, and collective progress.\n\nSpeaking at Storyboard18\u2019s Global Pioneers Summit, Kotecha highlighted the need for businesses, governments, and communities to work in tandem, setting aside corporate rivalries for the greater good. True transformation, he argued, is only possible when entities commit to transparency and mutual support.\n\n\u201cIf we want to achieve the goal of \u2018Viksit Bharat,\u2019 organizations\u2014whether corporations, companies, or governments\u2014must put their egos aside and collaborate. That\u2019s when real transformation happens,\u201d Kotecha said, referring to India\u2019s aspiration to become a fully developed nation by 2047.\n\nThe executive\u2019s remarks reflected a broader shift in corporate thinking, where long-term sustainability takes precedence over short-term gains. For transformation to be meaningful, he noted, companies must drive intentionality in capacity and capability building, ensuring that growth is both responsible and enduring.\n\nAt PepsiCo, such principles are already at play. The company has embedded a culture of partnership throughout its operations, recognizing that large-scale change cannot be achieved in isolation.\n\n\u201cIf you want to achieve big transformation and be part of that journey for the nation, we will need partnerships, and we are not ashamed about that. We are pivoting our entire business around \u2018partnership through progress,\u2019\u201d Kotecha said.\n\nThat philosophy, he explained, requires a fundamental shift in mindset: dialing up collaboration while tempering cutthroat competition. \u201cWhen you have a shared goal and we are all moving in the right direction, I think we can leave our egos aside,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile PepsiCo has built its legacy on iconic brands and memorable advertising, Kotecha was keen to highlight the company\u2019s deeper initiatives\u2014particularly its work with India\u2019s agricultural sector. PepsiCo collaborates with over 27,000 farmers across the country, supplying seeds, fertilizers, and expert guidance from more than 250 agronomists throughout the growing season.\n\nFor Kotecha, business and purpose are inextricably linked. He believes that a company\u2019s longevity depends on its ability to drive meaningful impact. But does every brand need a purpose? He remains cautious.\n\n\u201cA brand\u2019s purpose must be authentic. If it isn\u2019t, consumers will see right through it,\u201d he said.\n\nA Challenger Mindset in the Consumer Market\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s approach to branding and marketing is equally rooted in consumer insight. Discussing the company\u2019s recently launched \u201cAnytime is Pepsi Time\u201d campaign, Kotecha emphasized three key pillars that define its strategy: a deep consumer focus, a challenger mindset that fosters innovation, and an emphasis on maximizing cultural moments.\n\n\u201cAll our campaigns\u2014past and present\u2014are deeply consumer-centric. We are consumer mavericks, putting them at the core of everything we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nostalgia factor resonated strongly. That\u2019s why Pepsi remains a beloved trademark.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, which evokes Pepsi\u2019s legacy while appealing to a new generation, has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response, reinforcing the brand\u2019s enduring cultural relevance.\n\nA Call for Bold Leadership\n\nAs businesses navigate an increasingly complex landscape, Kotecha\u2019s message to future leaders is clear: whether in sales, marketing, or finance, success will favor those who are bold, agile, and willing to take calculated risks.\n\nThe Global Pioneers Summit, themed \u201cPowering Change Through Creative Catalysts,\u201d explored the intersection of creativity and commerce, illustrating how innovation drives breakthroughs across industries. This year\u2019s event featured an impressive lineup of speakers, including government officials, corporate executives, and marketing visionaries. Among the notable participants were Jyotiraditya Scindia, Minister of Communications and Development of North Eastern Region; Prabha Narasimhan, MD and CEO of Colgate-Palmolive (India); Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and MD of Nestl\u00e9 India; and Devika Bulchandani, Global CEO of Ogilvy.\n\nAs the summit showcased, the future of business will belong to those who embrace openness, collaboration, and a commitment to progress\u2014principles that, according to Kotecha, are already shaping PepsiCo\u2019s journey in India and beyond.\n\nMore about the Storyboard18 Global Pioneers Summit\n\nThe Global Pioneers Summit is a celebration and exploration of the transformative potential of creativity, empowering individuals and businesses to think differently, act boldly, and craft a future that resonates with purpose and vision. Creativity is not just about artistic expression \u2014 it is a force for solving real-world problems, innovating products, and creating connections in ways that traditional methods cannot. And there are pioneers behind this shift, who have dared to think different.\n\nThe Global Pioneers Summit stands as a premier celebration of the visionary forces propelling businesses forward, spotlighting the global brands emerging from India \u2014 an ever-growing hub of creativity and innovation on the world stage.\n\nFrom groundbreaking innovations to impactful storytelling, key decision-makers and innovators from business, marketing, advertising, tech, and academia exchange insights, build connections, and draw inspiration from some of the most compelling work driving industries forward globally.",

In February, Reliance Consumer Products Limited (RCPL) launched Campa Cola in the UAE, marking RCPL\u2019s first entry into the United Arab Emirates.\n\nNotably, Mukesh Ambani\u2019s company acquired Campa Cola in 2022 and reintroduced it in 2023.\n\nCampa Cola\n\nA year after its launch by Reliance Industries, Campa Cola is facing renewed competition from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. To counter Campa Cola\u2019s Rs 10 price point, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have introduced their diet and light versions\u2014Thums Up X Force, Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, and Pepsi No-Sugar\u2014at the same price. This marks the first time the Indian branches of these companies have launched products at this price level.\n\nAs per a report from ICRIER, the soft drink market of India was estimated Rs 67,100 crore in 2019. It is expected to touch Rs 1.47 trillion by the year 2030. Hence, both local and global brands are now trying to capture the biggest portion of the beverage market by introducing more products.\n\nRs 10 Price War Between Major Giants\n\nReliance\u2019s entry into the Rs 10 beverage market isn\u2019t limited to Campa. The company also launched the Rs 10 sports drink Spinner in February 2024, in collaboration with Muttiah Muralitharan, and RasKik Gluco Energy in January 2025, priced at Rs 10 per serving.\n\nNotably, the entry of global giants \u2013 Coca Cola and PepsiCo \u2013 in Rs 10 price range suggests their strategy of avoiding price cuts on their big brands. \u201cThe multinational drinks makers are in a wait-and-watch mode on whether to reduce prices upfront nationally,\u201d Economic Times quoted a senior beverage industry insider.\n\nNo-Sugar Pepsi\n\nPepsiCo has introduced a smaller, 200ml bottle of its sugar-free Pepsi, priced at 10 rupees. This launch, initially in major markets like Andhra Pradesh, coincides with Campa\u2019s 2023 entry into the same state.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

This year, the company will provide 750,000+ meals near its operational sites across Punjab, continuing its collaborative efforts with PepsiCo Foundation \u2013 the company\u2019s philanthropic arm \u2013 to support underserved communities during the holy month.\n\nThis year\u2019s program emerges from a substantial foundation of community support, including over 7 million meals previously distributed through the \u201cMillions of Meals\u201d programs. Filling Hearts is part of a long-term approach to addressing food security challenges in Pakistan, which spans immediate relief and explores sustainable community support strategies.\n\n\u201cAt PepsiCo Pakistan, #InWithForPakistan is more than a hashtag \u2013 it\u2019s our operational philosophy,\u201d said Khurram Shah, Director of Corporate Affairs. \u201cOur Filling Hearts initiative represents our continuous journey of standing alongside local communities, understanding their challenges, and supporting their aspirations. This year, a special focus of our food drive has been creating meaningful moments for families, particularly during \u201cRoza Kushai\u201d \u2013 a memorable rite of passage when children break their first fast.\u201d\n\nThe initiative is part of a broader strategy that includes comprehensive programs like She Feeds the World, which has been instrumental in supporting women farmers, introducing sustainable agricultural practices, and building community resilience. Through these efforts, PepsiCo has been exploring ways to address the root causes of food insecurity by supporting local agricultural ecosystems and creating economic opportunities.\n\n\u201cOur approach to food security recognizes that sustainable solutions require multi-dimensional interventions,\u201d said Hatim Khan, Senior Director of International Programs at the PepsiCo Foundation. \u201cBeyond immediate relief, we\u2019re focused on programs that empower communities, create economic opportunities, and build resilience for the future.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo employees poured their hearts into the Filling Hearts food drive, passionately contributing their time and energy. This spirit of dedication shone through during a community iftar at SOS Children\u2019s Village Lahore, where employees celebrated alongside the children, many of whom were breaking their first Ramadan fast.\n\nThis year\u2019s Ramadan campaign supports communities across multiple countries, with PepsiCo teams in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, UAE, Turkey, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Ivory Coast engaging in similar community support activities. As part of the PepsiCo Foundation\u2019s global \u201cFood For Good\u201d program, this initiative contributes to the broader goal of supporting global food security, with aspirations to support 50 million people worldwide by 2030.",

under the Suntory and PepsiCo brands in Thailand, has unveiled its strategic plans for 2025, aimed at strengthening its presence in the local market with its \"Must Win\" strategy.\n\nSeven Years of Success\n\nTanuj Chadha, chief executive officer of Suntory PepsiCo Beverage (Thailand) Co., Ltd., said that over the past seven years the company has achieved consistent growth.\n\n\"From 2018 to 2024, we had a compound annual growth rate averaging 8.2%, which is twice the gains of the Thai non-alcoholic beverage market,\" said Mr Chadha.\n\nMoreover, the company has enhanced its market share in the carbonated soft drink segment, particularly in low and no-sugar categories, aligning with the growing trend of health-conscious consumers.\n\nMr Chadha said one reason for this achievement is the company's 'Must Win' strategy.\n\nRecognising the rising trend of health-conscious consumers, the company continues to strengthen its core business of carbonated beverages by launching new flavours, especially low and no-sugar products, delivering outstanding performance with an average growth of 16.1% for Pepsi Zero Sugar.\n\nOver the past seven years, the company has launched several new products such as new flavours for ready-to-drink TEA+ oolong tea, ready-to-drink BOSS Coffee, and the new energy drink Sting.\n\nMr Chadha said the company has integrated artificial intelligence to enhance workload capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, it aims to strengthen relationships between the company, distributors, customers and consumers, further expanding its market presence.\n\nRegarding sustainability, with its production capacity of 1.3 billion litres per year, the company is dedicated to efficient water management, minimising water loss at every production process, and using less than 1.40 litres of water to produce 1 litre of beverage, Mr Chadha said.\n\nAdditionally, the company also actively promotes proper segregation and collection of used PET bottles for recycling into new ones, known as Bottle-to-Bottle Recycling.\n\nHe noted that the company has expanded the use of 100% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) bottles to 18 items in its portfolio, representing the highest adoption of rPET bottles in the Thai beverage market.\n\nFrom March 2018 to December 2024, these initiatives enabled the company to significantly reduce the use of virgin PET plastic by over 8,300 tonnes.\n\nPeople -First\n\nYosayut Sahawatcharin, chief people & culture and corporate affairs officer at Suntory PepsiCo Beverage (Thailand) Co., Ltd., said the company was dedicated to a performance-driven culture and a \"people-first\" approach to promote employees' career path.\n\nThe company provides skill-enhancement opportunities and career development across various functions.\n\nIt also fosters an inclusive culture, encouraging employees to voice their ideas and feel integral to the organisation.\n\nSuntory PepsiCo Thailand was honoured as one of the \"Top 50 Companies in Thailand 2025\" by WorkVenture, celebrated as a top workplace for young professionals for 2024 and 2025.\n\nAccelerating Future Growth\n\nAnawat Sangkhasap, chief marketing officer at Suntory PepsiCo Beverage (Thailand) Co., Ltd., said the company will continue to penetrate the Thai beverage market by targeting the carbonated drinks market, ready-to-drink tea and coffee, and energy and hydration drinks.\n\nOne key initiative is to implement marketing campaigns that could connect with the younger generation, such as Generation Z.\n\nMr Chadha said that Suntory PepsiCo Thailand aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.\n\nThe company is committed to minimising water loss at the production stage, using less than 1.38 litres of water to produce one litre of beverage by 2030.\n\nBy 2030, the company promises to use 100% rPET, which is recycled PET plastic bottles, for 50% of its total bottle usage in production.\n\nFor the company's key strategy in 2025, Mr Chadha said the company will continue to expand its portfolio of new beverages to accommodate rapidly changing customer demands.\n\nTo meet these demands, the company will continue to strengthen its supply chain capacity and sharpen commercial operations, increasing the use of technology to provide the best products to customers.\n\nThe company is expanding two production lines in Thailand to accommodate increased production capacity and support new product expansion.\n\nMr Chadha said the company's goal is to become \"The Most Beloved Beverage Company in Thailand with True Gemba Centricity\".\n\nHe said: \"Gemba is a concept that means learning from on-site experiences to gain insight from customers and stakeholders.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Chadha said the company will adopt its parent company Suntory's corporate value, \"Yatte Minahare\", embodying the ambition to dream big and take bold steps without fear of failure, Growing for Good and Giving Back to Society.\n\nThe company will integrate these values and drive forward with its Must Win strategy to ensure continued growth, he said.",

For PepsiCo, India at present ranks among the top 15 markets globally. However, Kotecha expects the country to move up the ranks, though he refrained from sharing any specific projections. About investments in India, Kotecha stated PepsiCo has set up a green field plant near Mathura in UP and planned another in the North East India in Assam by the end of this year.\n\nJagrut Kotecha , CEO of PepsiCo India & South Asia, said that the beverage and food company aims to double its revenue in India over the next five years, viewing the country as a 'key anchor market' where it is making \"aggressive\" investments to expand its capacity.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Kotecha said India will be the \"engine of growth for PepsiCo\" in driving its global revenue, as it ranks among the top three markets for the food, snack, and beverage multinational, where the company is experiencing double-digit growth.\n\nKotecha said PepsiCo has invested in greenfield plants in Uttar Pradesh and Assam, focusing on staying ahead of the demand curve. He further added that the company will not be \"investment shy\" in India and plans to open two more facilities, including one in the southern region.\n\n\"We believe India will be the engine of growth for PepsiCo to drive the top line. Yes, it's not as big as North America because it is a lot more evolved category. Our per capita consumption in India is still very low, not only for us on beverage and food, but we would expect one of PepsiCo's fastest growing economies to do that,\" Kotecha said as quoted by PTI.\n\nFor PepsiCo, India at present ranks among the top 15 markets globally. However, Kotecha expects the country to move up the ranks, though he refrained from sharing any specific projections.\n\nStating that India is one of the \"key anchor markets\" for the New York-headquartered food, snack, and beverage multinational, where it re-entered in the 1990s after a gap of 28 years, he said, \u201cWe have identified about 13 to 15 anchor markets for PepsiCo, of which India is there and the definition of anchor markets is where do we see our next five to seven years of incremental growth coming for PepsiCo globally and India being one of that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kotecha, PepsiCo \"sits very well\" within the Prime Minister's vision of 2030, being the top three economies in the world. \"It's one of the most stable economies, growth engine, etc and hence, PepsiCo also has been in this country for almost 30 years, good, strong, fundamentals,\" he said, adding , \u201cSo, we need to double that, dial that up and start investing. We have been investing but continue to aggressively invest to ensure that we also take that opportunity.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo is focusing on its three strategic pillars- \"faster, stronger, better\", tailoring its products to nine regional taste preferences and prioritizing sustainability. The company last month reported double-digit organic revenue growth in India, with increased market share in snacks and beverages.\n\nRegarding the timeline of achieving USD 2 billion (approximately Rs 17,000 crore) revenue in the Indian market, Kotecha said, as quoted by PTI, \u201cIt's a vision. (We have) Aspiration to reach there, if we get everything right with the India infrastructure, I think it is there to take.\u201d\n\n\"So, we are about over Rs 5,950 crore in 2023 (for nine months due to change in fiscal year) and since then we have been growing double digits from there. And if we continue to do that. So, that's where we are looking at what our numbers should be by that time,\" he added.\n\nIn 2023, PepsiCo had moved to a Calendar year as the financial year in sync with its global results. In that year, the company reported around Rs 5,950 crore revenue for the nine-month period from April to December. Cumulatively, after adding the rest of the January-March quarter based on previous year revenue, it would be extrapolated to around Rs 8,200 crore.\n\nSeparately, Varun Beverages, PepsiCo's bottling partner, which gets 90 per cent beverage sales volume of PepsiCo India, reported Rs 12,778.96 crore in standalone revenue in 2023.\n\nAbout investments in India, Kotecha stated PepsiCo has set up a green field plant near Mathura in UP and planned another in the North East India in Assam by the end of this year.\n\n\"The second one is in MP, which we have set up. Which again tells you where we are. We had built our Kosi plant about two or two and a half years ago, which we keep expanding. We have plans to open up in other parts of the country as part of that. So, we are not going to be investment shy. We are going to be investing forward to drive that growth because it is there for us to capture the (market),\" he said.\n\nOver the last three years, PepsiCo has invested close to Rs 3,500-4,000 crore in the Indian market. Besides, PepsiCo's bottling partner Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL) is also investing significantly.\n\n\u201cThey have 41 plants. They have just invested in capacities, increasing by 25 per cent this year. They are continuing that type of investment to grow with us. Our partnership is pretty strong to enable that growth. Both of us feel very good about this,\" said Kotecha.\n\nOn being asked about the Reliance's Campa Cola, a new player in the segment, which is disrupting the beverage market with its aggressive price points and increased margin to the distributors, Kotecha said it is always good to have competition. Competition only helps to grow the category.\"\n\n\u201cOur view is, yes, even before Pepsi and Coke were there, there were a lot of local, regional players,\" he said.\n\n\u201cNow Campa has also come with a lot of flair and expense and all. So our belief is the category will then grow and the consumption will grow,\u201d he added.\n\nThis will also help a lot of people to shift from unpackaged, unbranded into this category. Still per capita consumption is \"far less\", which is even lower than our neighbours such as Pakistan.\n\n\"We have to play to our strengths. And again, embedding everything that we do is consumer-centric, understanding the consumer and what their needs are, and play that game and play to our strengths,\" Kotecha said, adding \" Somebody else will come and play with a slightly different strategy and play to that strength. So that's where we see. So we see it will be good for the consumer and it will be good for the market.\"\n\nPepsiCo's beverage portfolio includes fizz brands - Mountain Dew, 7up, Pepsi and energy drink Sting and sports beverages Gatorade, while in juices, the company has Tropicana and Slice.\n\nIts food portfolio includes Kurkure, Lays, Quaker, and Doritos. In 2023, approximately 80 per cent of PepsiCo India's revenue came from food, and 20 the rest per cent from beverages, with Varun Beverages handling the beverage sales. The Indian beverage market is valued at around USD 12 billion and is growing at CAGR of 10-11 per cent.\n\nEnd of article",

The drivers, in short, include an increasingly health-conscious consumer, but also economic pressures that could be short-term.\n\n\"With alcohol per capita consumption likely to decline, we see the zero-alcohol segment as ripe for strong growth,\" Morgan Stanley wrote. \"We believe that beer is better positioned than spirits in this regard. We similarly see higher growth for soft drinks, aided by stronger pricing power, and with innovation to better satisfy the 'good for you' criteria increasingly demanded by the younger consumer.\"\n\nCompanies are making decisions informed by the same trends. PepsiCo (PEP) earlier this month agreed to buy prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.65 billion. Reed's, a company known for ginger ales that trades over the counter, on a recent conference call discussed a new \"multifunctional\" line of sodas made with ingredients like organic ginger and mushroom extracts and comparably low calorie counts.\n\n\"These beverages cater to the rising demand for health conscious, functional refreshment options and position us at the forefront of the evolving beverage market,\" Reed's CEO Norman Snyder said on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. Snyder added that \"the early response from retailers has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforced by their expansion of shelf space dedicated to the functional and better-for-you beverage category.\"\n\nAmong Morgan Stanley's recommendations: Buy Coca-Cola (KO), avoid Brown-Forman (BF.B). They're also positive on several European and Asian companies known for their beer offerings.\n\n\"We believe that, in developed markets spirits growth will slow, as consumers shift towards lower/non-alcoholic options,\" the analysts wrote. \"For the beer market, we see this as an opportunity.\"",

            "content": "This legendary dividend stock is in its worst decline in years.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP 0.71%) has been a productive investment for generations. The company makes enough money to share profits with investors via dividends and has raised the amount it pays for 52 consecutive years. You could call it a perk of selling beloved food and beverage products to a global customer base of roughly 8.2 billion people (and growing). There's just a seemingly endless runway for growth.\n\nHowever, shares are in a slump. PepsiCo has declined 25% since its all-time high in 2023. It's a rare drop for such a respected company, its farthest fall since the financial crisis in 2007-2009. Should investors buy PepsiCo in 2025, or has the company peaked?\n\nPepsiCo's growth could slow\n\nPepsiCo has grown for decades by selling more products, launching and acquiring new brands, and raising its prices. However, growth has increasingly depended on pricing since the COVID-19 pandemic. At face value, the chart below shows that business has been great, with impressive revenue growth over the past five years.\n\nYet it's not the whole story. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the price of 16 ounces of potato chips in the United States has increased by 44% since January 2020. A typical two-liter bottle of soda costs 33% more today than back then. This data isn't brand-specific, but PepsiCo is the largest snack food and second-largest non-alcoholic beverage company in the U.S. You can reasonably connect the dots here.\n\nIt's not that PepsiCo has padded its pockets; its gross margin is roughly the same today as five years ago. Instead, it reflects growth through inflation rather than consumers buying more. The problem is that consumers will only tolerate higher prices for so long. PepsiCo notched 2% organic revenue growth in 2024, but its volumes slipped by 1%, so it was all price-driven. Frito-Lay volumes dipped 2.5% in North America, and beverages fell 3%.\n\nConsumers seem to be fed up with higher prices. At least in the short term, further price hikes may cost it volume, offsetting the benefit of raising prices. I'm not saying PepsiCo won't grow, but the company could struggle to move the needle following these past five years.\n\nThe business still has a strong financial pulse\n\nDon't worry. PepsiCo isn't facing a collapse. This is still as dependable a business as investors could hope for.\n\nMost people buy PepsiCo stock for the dividend. The company is a Dividend King, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. The dividend payout ratio is approximately 65% of 2025 earnings estimates. PepsiCo's fortress-like balance sheet is a nice safety net, with $9.2 billion in cash and a credit rating comfortably in investment-grade territory.\n\nPepsiCo's prices may turn some shoppers away, but it's hard to imagine a major decline. The company's brands are household favorites and include products like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Doritos, Lay's, Cheetos, Ruffles, Crush, and Quaker, among many more. PepsiCo's trailing-12-month sales haven't declined more than 7.6% in 15 years.\n\nAgain, growth may slow, but investors can probably still expect modest growth and incremental dividend raises.\n\nValuation matters more than ever\n\nAs great as PepsiCo is, investors must be extra vigilant about valuation. Overpaying for a slow-growing stock can be disastrous for total investment returns.\n\nPepsiCo stock is mainly sliding because the market is adjusting to lower growth expectations. Both PepsiCo's price-to-earnings ratio and long-term growth estimates have fallen to multiyear lows:\n\nThe good news is that the dividend yield has risen to 3.7%, its highest ever. High dividend yields are often a red flag, but not in this case. Investors are getting more immediate dividend income for their money because the market anticipates lower growth (share price appreciation).\n\nSo, is PepsiCo a buy?\n\nFrom a pure growth standpoint, nearly 21 times earnings is a pricey valuation for 4% to 5% annualized growth. However, investors frequently pay more for blue chip companies like PepsiCo because they are dependable. You can reasonably assume PepsiCo will still be here decades from now.\n\nIt's hard to call PepsiCo a strong buy without more growth potential. Dividend investors could argue for the high and dependable yield, but otherwise, I think the stock would be more appealing at a P/E closer to 15 to 17.",

            "content": "I buy a lot of dividend stocks each year. They provide me with passive income that I use to buy more shares of dividend-paying companies. Dividend stocks have also historically produced much higher returns than non-dividend payers, with less volatility.\n\nOne dividend stock I can't seem to buy enough of right now is PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). I've bought shares several times this year and will likely continue adding to my position.\n\nHere's why I've been loading up on Pepsi stock.\n\nA satisfying income stream\n\nPepsiCo has a terrific track record of paying dividends. The beverage and snacking giant announced plans last month to raise its dividend by 5% in June. That will extend the company's dividend growth streak to 53 straight years. It will keep PepsiCo in the elite group of Dividend Kings -- companies with 50 or more years of delivering annual dividend increases.\n\nThe company's new annualized dividend rate will be $5.69 per share. With its stock price recently around $145 apiece, PepsiCo has a forward dividend yield of 3.9%. That's a very enticing level. It's about three times higher than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which currently has a 1.3% dividend yield.\n\nPepsiCo generated $12.5 billion in net cash from operating activities last year, more than covering the $7.2 billion it paid in dividends. The company also has a strong cash-rich balance sheet. It ended last year with nearly $9.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and has very healthy bond ratings (A+/A/A1). The company's strong cash flows and balance sheet give it lots of flexibility to invest in growing its business.\n\nBuilt to continue growing\n\nPepsiCo should have no trouble increasing its dividend in the future. The company's long-term target is to organically grow its revenue by 4% to 6% per year. It also expects to steadily expand its margins, which should drive annual earnings-per-share growth in the high single digits.\n\nThe company invests heavily to support its continued growth. PepsiCo's capital spending was $5 billion last year, which was about 5.4% of its revenue. The company spent that capital on initiatives that drive growth and productivity throughout its business.\n\nFor example, like most companies, Pepsi is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) for things like AI-generated forecasts. It's also investing in increasing its manufacturing capacity and new product innovation.\n\nPepsiCo is also using its financial flexibility to make acquisitions to accelerate growth. The company recently agreed to buy fast-growing low-calorie soda brand Poppi for about $1.7 billion to expand its better-for-you offerings. The company also recently closed its $1.2 billion purchase of Siete Foods to further expand its food portfolio. Meanwhile, it bought out the remaining 50% interest in Sabra and Obela that it didn't already own late last year, to expand its refrigerated fresh dips and spreads business.",

Company leaders cited market research indicating that consumers, especially younger generations, are \u201creally interested in juice and prebiotic sodas,\u201d said the CEO of Nutrition, Becca Kerr.

Created by Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, the brand's beverages combine prebiotics, fruit juice, and apple cider vinegar. \"When I created poppi in our kitchen, it was fueled by a desire to create a better-for-you soda,\" said Allison Ellsworth.\n\nIn 2018, the company appeared on an episode of the tv show Shark Tank. With an investment from Rohan Oza, the company underwent a rebranding initiative and began experiencing growth within the beverage market. \"We never imagined how many people we could reach through hard work, determination and a clear mission to create a functional soda that stands the test of time,\" said Allison Ellsworth. \"We believe poppi is the soda that will be embraced for generations to come, and we're beyond grateful to the amazing poppi team, our partners who believed in us from the very beginning and most importantly our incredible community.\"\n\nSpecifics of the acquisition deal include a purchase price of $1.95 billion, including $300 million of anticipated cash tax benefits for a net purchase price of $1.65 billion. Subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval, the agreement includes additional potential earnout consideration depending on the ability to meet specified performance milestones within a predetermined period after closing.\n\nRam Krishnan, CEO, PepsiCo Beverages U.S., explained the motivation behind the company's interest in adding the probiotic beverage to its beverage brand portfolio: \"As we look to reorient our portfolio offerings to address white space consumer needs, the poppi brand's unique intersection with wellness and culture is a perfect addition to our portfolio. Allison and the poppi team have built a magnetic brand that's ahead of the trends, with a loyal consumer base and a demonstrated capacity for growth. We are big fans of the poppi brand movement and believe this incredible brand paired with our commercial capabilities will drive continued growth and innovation for years to come.\"\n\nAllison Ellsworth expressed her enthusiasm for the brand's new venture: \"We can't wait to begin this next chapter with PepsiCo to bring our soda to more people \u2013 and I know they will honor what makes poppi so special while supporting our next phase of growth and innovation.

The Market for Prebiotic Soda: What\u2019s All the Fuss About?\n\nPrebiotic sodas like Poppi or Olipop are designed to support gut health by containing prebiotic fiber, which feeds beneficial gut bacteria. Traditional sodas lack this benefit and often contain high amounts of sugar. According to Euromonitor International data, the U.S. market for digestive health drinks, also called prebiotic soft drinks, grew from US $197 million in 2020 to US $440 million in 2024 and is expected to grow to US $3.5 billion by 2032. While growing rapidly, digestive health soft drinks remained just 1% of the US $42.4 billion soft drink market in 2024, with the share expected to rise to approximately 8% by 2034.\n\nHowever, sales volume is not the only thing soft drinks beverage companies chase; profitability is the name of the game. The profitability of prebiotic soda can be substantially higher than that of traditional soda\u2019s. Prebiotic sodas typically command a higher price point than conventional soft drinks, often costing around US $20-US $30 for a 12-pack, while traditional soft beverages like Coke and Pepsi cost around US $10.\n\n\n\nBeverage giants are seizing on the high growth opportunity and entering the market: In addition to Pepsi buying Poppi for US $1.95 billion, Coca-Cola recently announced the introduction of the Simply Pop drink. Starting in late February, consumers on the West Coast and Southeast could buy it in retail stores and on Amazon. The new drink, available in five fruit flavors, debuted under the Coca-Cola-owned Simply brand.\n\n2. Pepsi Buys Poppi: Marketing Spend of Prebiotic Soda Brands\n\nStartups in the highly competitive soft drink category, particularly companies like Poppi and Olipop, heavily invest in marketing and advertising. In fact, according to ad intelligence platform MediaRadar, during the first four months of 2024, Poppi\u2019s advertising outspent energy drink Gatorade, a US 7 billion-plus sales-a-year brand, vs. Poppi\u2019s approximately US $100 million in 2024. Poppi spent more than US $$43 million on advertising from January to April, nearly six times the US $7.3 million it spent for all of 2023 . Meanwhile, Gatorade spent US $40 million, and Dr. Pepper spent US $32 million; only Coca-Cola and Red Bull spent more, at US $78 million and US $60 million, respectively. During that period, most of Poppi\u2019s advertising focused on television ads and digital channels, with the company spending more than US $25 million on TV and US $18 million on digital ads. An essential part of the expense was Poppi\u2019s 2024 Super Bowl ad (Poppi also advertised at the Big Game in 2025).\n\nPoppi outspent energy drinks giant Gatorade in advertising.\n\n3. What\u2019s in it for Pepsi?\n\nCPG giants like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Keurig Dr. Pepper grow at a much lower rate than startups. They are constantly looking to enhance their brand portfolio with growing companies. This has been the case in the energy drinks category, e.g., PepsiCo\u2019s acquisition of Rock Star Energy in 2020. In the past few years, PepsiCo has acquired 50% of Sabra, a spread maker, that it didn\u2019t already own, and last October, It bought Siete, a diversified Mexican American food maker.\n\nPoppi is the largest of the three acquisitions. Relative to PepsiCo\u2019s US $200 billion market cap, none of the above are huge transactions. PepsiCo\u2019s most crucial growth factor in the Poppi acquisition for Pepsi is that it will plug Poppi into its vast distribution network.\n\nPepsi will plug Poppi into its vast distribution network.\n\n4. Pepsi Buys Poppi: What Pepsi Can Learn from Poppi\u2019s Marketing Practice\n\nStartups like Poppi are much more nimble and prone to unleash creativity in their marketing. Poppi has done a great job engaging the coveted GenZ and Millennial demographics. Features of their marketing and advertising include:\n\nClever use of social media. For example, the same color scheme is used for every 12 posts.\n\nUtilization of New Generation Creators like Alix Earle, comedian Jake Shane, and the star of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Rob Rausch\n\nAmplification of User Generated Content, mainly through Poppi\u2019s large TikTok community\n\nUse of big names attached to the Poppi product like Post Malone, Olivia Rodrigo, and Paris Hilton\n\nPlayful in-store presence\n\nBranding prebiotic science as being cool and modern\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a new day with these challenger brands in the last five years. The footprint that they have digitally and on social media, it resonates,\u201d Barry Thomas, a senior global thought leader at Kantar, told Modern Retail. \u201cIt\u2019s so different than the traditional legacy marketing that happens at these big Fortune 500 companies. They\u2019re just so wired into Gen Z, they\u2019re so digitally native with how they go to market, and they\u2019re radically changing CPG,\u201d Thomas added.\n\n\u201cPoppi\u2019s marketing is so different than the traditional legacy marketing that happens at these big Fortune 500 companies. They\u2019re just so wired into Gen Z, they\u2019re so digitally native with how they go to market and they\u2019re radically changing CPG.\u201d\n\nWhile traditional food advertising through TV, print, and radio still plays a role, digital marketing has taken center stage in engaging customers, building loyalty, and expanding reach. PepsiCo gains best practices and new marketing insights through the Poppi acquisition.\n\n5.

            "content": "Bank of America Securities analyst Bryan Spillane has maintained their bullish stance on PEP stock, giving a Buy rating on March 18.\n\nBryan Spillane has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight PepsiCo\u2019s potential for stability and growth. Despite the broader market experiencing some demand weakness, PepsiCo\u2019s position as a reliable compounder in the consumer staples sector makes it an attractive option for investors seeking defensiveness. The company\u2019s ability to maintain steady performance amidst economic uncertainties is a key factor in Spillane\u2019s positive outlook.\n\nFurthermore, PepsiCo\u2019s strategic initiatives and management\u2019s willingness to embrace self-help measures to drive growth contribute to the Buy rating. The company is seen as a leader in leveraging opportunities for expansion and efficiency improvements, which are expected to support its long-term growth trajectory. These elements, combined with its strong market presence, make PepsiCo a compelling investment choice according to Spillane\u2019s analysis.\n\nIn another report released on March 18, UBS also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $175.00 price target.\n\nBased on the recent corporate insider activity of 30 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of PEP in relation to earlier this year.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, PepsiCo's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nThe top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company\n\nRecent sales by insiders\n\nIf you want to know who really controls PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PepsiCo.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Ownership Breakdown March 23rd 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that PepsiCo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PepsiCo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Earnings and Revenue Growth March 23rd 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PepsiCo. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP -0.45%) is a company with more than 50 consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. You don't achieve a feat like that by accident. It requires having a strong business model that gets executed well in both good times and bad.\n\nPepsiCo's recently announced purchase of Poppi for $1.95 billion is an example of the company's strong business model being executed well during bad times. It makes PepsiCo's stock look like a buy.\n\nPepsiCo is out of favor\n\nPepsiCo's dividend yield is 3.5% at this writing, which is near the highest levels in the company's history. Using dividend yield as a rough gauge of valuation, it appears that Wall Street has put this iconic food and beverage company on the discount rack. That position is backed up by more traditional valuation metrics.\n\nFor example, PepsiCo's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently around 2.3x, while its five-year average P/S ratio is roughly 2.7x. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is just under 22x, versus a long-term average of nearly 27x. And its price-to-book value ratio is about 11.5x, versus a five-year average of a little more than 13x. Clearly, investors have placed PepsiCo in the valuation doghouse.\n\nThis valuation and the company's Dividend King status make it an attractive investment opportunity right now. Indeed, even well-run companies suffer through difficult periods. That's exactly what PepsiCo is doing, since its growth rate slowed after a spike during the post-pandemic period, when inflation allowed it to push through large price increases.\n\nPepsiCo is working on its portfolio\n\nTo be fair, just being historically cheap isn't the whole story. There's an important secondary condition that speaks to the business model that helped PepsiCo reach Dividend King status. That condition is that PepsiCo's management is working to address its growth challenges in the same way that it has many times before. It is attempting to revitalize its brand portfolio with new blood.\n\nThe effort started in 2024. It included management buying the 50% of Sabra, a spread maker, that it didn't already own. It also bought Siete, a diversified Mexican American food maker. Just recently, PepsiCo announced another purchase, this time of Poppi for $1.95 billion. Poppi makes prebiotic soda, which is a growing category in the beverage space.\n\nPoppi is the largest of the three acquisitions. Relative to PepsiCo's $200 billion market cap, none are huge transactions. But they are proof that PepsiCo is taking action. If history is any guide, these moves will help revitalize the company's brand portfolio and get this iconic food maker back on the growth track.\n\nIndeed, all PepsiCo needs to do with Siete and Poppi is plug them into its vast distribution network, and they'll both likely see robust growth. These types of acquisitions by PepsiCo are exactly what a long-term dividend investor should want to see.\n\nDon't wait -- buy while PepsiCo is still out of favor\n\nThere's no way to know how long PepsiCo's stock will remain in the dumps. There are real headwinds to deal with, including softness in the company's snack business. But management is clearly working to keep the company at the top of the markets it serves, executing a game plan that has worked year in and year out for decades. Now is the time for long-term dividend investors to buy the stock. If you wait for the business to see better days, the company will still be well run, but the stock probably won't be cheap anymore.",

            "content": "PepsiCo Acquires Prebiotic Soda Brand Poppi For $1.95 Billion The acquisition aims to enhance PepsiCo's healthier beverage offerings as consumer demand shifts towards wellness-focused options.\n\nIn a major strategic move to enhance its healthier beverage offerings, PepsiCo has announced its acquisition of the fast-growing prebiotic soda brand poppi for a staggering $1.95 billion. The deal, which includes a potential earnout consideration linked to performance milestones and $300 million in anticipated cash tax benefits for a net purchase price of $1.65 billion, marks a significant step into the prebiotic soda market, increasingly popular among health-conscious consumers.\n\nWith the soda landscape rapidly evolving, consumers are increasingly gravitating towards beverages that not only taste good but also provide functional health benefits. This acquisition represents PepsiCo's response to growing consumer preferences for convenient, healthier choices that cater to their lifestyles. As Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, stated, \"We\u2019ve been evolving our food and beverage portfolio over many years, including by innovating with our brands in new spaces to offer more positive choices to our consumers.\"\n\nPoppi's unique product combines the benefits of prebiotics, fruit juice, and apple cider vinegar to create a low-calorie soda that contains five grams or less of sugar per serving. The brand originally started as Mother Beverage, founded in a kitchen by Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, and gained national attention after appearing on the hit TV show Shark Tank in 2018. Rohan Oza, a notable investor and co-founder of CAVU Ventures, provided $400,000 in investment during that appearance, which was pivotal for poppi's journey.\n\nFast forward to 2024, poppi generated an impressive $500 million in sales, a testament to its explosive growth and the effective marketing strategies employed by its team. This success is particularly noteworthy given the competitive landscape which includes rival brands like Olipop and a slew of newcomers such as Coca-Cola's Simply Pop and Spindrift Soda.\n\nDespite this momentum, poppi faced setbacks, including a lawsuit in 2024 that questioned the extent of its prebiotic fiber content. The brand reached an $8.9 million settlement over claims that its drinks failed to provide meaningful gut health benefits. However, such challenges do not seem to have impacted its popularity significantly. Following its legal troubles, poppi solidified its presence by becoming the official soda of Inter Miami CF, further enhancing its visibility.\n\nMoving forward with PepsiCo backing, Allison Ellsworth expressed her excitement about the future, stating, \"We believe poppi is the soda that will be embraced for generations to come, and we\u2019re beyond grateful to the amazing poppi team...\" This sentiment reflects the brand's commitment to maintaining its unique identity while leveraging PepsiCo's considerable resources to scale operations and reach a broader audience.\n\nMeanwhile, the acquisition has sparked fresh discussions about competition in the prebiotic soda segment. As Olipop raised $50 million in Series C funding shortly after poppi's acquisition announcement, industry analysts highlight the need for both PepsiCo and poppi to navigate a challenging market landscape characterized by low margins. As noted by PitchBook senior analyst Alex Frederick, successful integration and brand equity management will be crucial for maintaining profitability.\n\nPepsiCo's entry into the prebiotic soda space not only diversifies its portfolio but also positions the company to respond effectively to shifting consumer interests towards health and wellness. The integration of poppi into PepsiCo's extensive distribution networks promises to enhance market accessibility for the brand.\n\nThe prebiotic soda movement is gaining momentum, and with major players now stepping into the arena, the next few years will likely see heightened competition and innovation. As PepsiCo continues to evaluate consumer demand and adapt its offerings, poppi is expected to play a key role in reshaping the landscape of healthier beverage choices for the next generation.\n\nWith the backing of PepsiCo, which boasts a legacy of launching successful food and beverage innovations, poppi is anticipated to reach consumers like never before. As Oza aptly noted, \"poppi is a true testament to the American Dream!\" The brand\u2019s journey from a kitchen invention to a monumental acquisition story exemplifies the potential for entrepreneurial spirit in today's market.",

This exclusive revelation unveils a transformative model that is not only enhancing environmental stewardship but also providing tangible economic benefits to agricultural communities.\n\nSeveral media reports confirm that in its inaugural year, this pioneering collaboration facilitated the procurement of 4,000 tons of sunflower oil from Argentine farmers across key provinces. These farmers, at the forefront of this agricultural revolution, implemented a suite of regenerative techniques, including strategic crop rotation, the deployment of cover crops, enhanced irrigation efficiency, the integration of biological products, and the establishment of vital pollinator habitats.\n\nCentral to this initiative is Syngenta\u2019s Sustainable Sourcing Program, which provides participating farmers with the means to meticulously trace and verify their environmentally responsible practices. Through rigorous, third-party validation, farmers unlock premium pricing for their produce, ensuring transparency and integrity throughout the supply chain. The sunflower grain is then seamlessly integrated into Syngenta\u2019s Agriculture Value Chain (AVC) program, facilitating efficient exchange and export.\n\nThe adoption of Syngenta\u2019s Cropwise digital platform has been a game-changer for participating farmers. This cutting-edge technology allows for precise tracking and verification of regenerative practices, enabling continuous improvement and ensuring adherence to the program\u2019s stringent sustainability goals.\n\n\"The Cropwise platform has been invaluable,\" one participating farmer shared exclusively with our publication. \"It's not just about compliance; it's about empowering us to make informed decisions and continuously improve our practices.\"\n\nMariale \u00c1lvarez, Head of Sustainability & Corporate Affairs for Syngenta in LATAM, emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to regenerative agriculture, stating, \"We're not just aiming for sustainability; we're striving for regeneration. This collaboration with PepsiCo is a testament to our belief that environmental and economic benefits can go hand in hand.\"\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s integration of this initiative into its global pep+ strategy underscores its commitment to sustainability. Santiago Desmery, Oils Category Leader for PepsiCo Southern Cone and Brazil, highlighted the significance of this milestone, noting, \"This project marks a pivotal moment for PepsiCo Southern Cone, as we become the first region in LATAM to achieve 100% regenerative agriculture for our sunflower oil. We're setting a new standard for responsible food production.\"\n\nAs this transformative partnership expands, with plans to increase the acreage dedicated to regenerative practices by at least 25%, it serves as a powerful model for the future of sustainable agriculture. This collaboration is not just changing how food is produced; it's changing how farmers are valued, ensuring a more sustainable and equitable future for all.",

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.8 billion, down 2.45% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.29 per share and revenue of $91.79 billion, which would represent changes of +1.59% and -0.07%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.58% lower. As of now, PepsiCo holds a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, PepsiCo is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.86. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 19 of its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that PEP has a PEG ratio of 3.12. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.58 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

Credit: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf anyone needed convincing that, in the US at least, \u2018better-for-you\u2019 soda isn\u2019t a flash in the pan, perhaps PepsiCo\u2019s latest acquisition will have persuaded them.\n\nOn Monday (17 March), just under 72 hours after Bloomberg reported PepsiCo was in late-stage talks to buy US prebiotic soda business Poppi, the US food and drinks giant announced a deal worth just under $2bn.\n\nPoppi, formerly known as Mother Beverage, was set up in 2015 and, after receiving funding on US business pitch TV show Shark Tank three years later, relaunched under its current brand in 2020.\n\nSince then, Poppi, co-founded by Allison Ellsworth and her husband Stephen, has built what has become one of the more recognisable names in the growing market for \u2018better-for-you\u2019 sodas in the US.\n\nRobert Moskow, a beverage-industry analyst at US investment bank TD Cowen, says Poppi generated sales of just over $391m in tracked channels in the last 52 weeks. A company spokesperson says Poppi ran up annual sales of \u201cnorth of $500m\u201d in 2024. Alongside Olipop, Poppi, with its low-calorie and low-sugar sodas in 15 flavours, has become a brand synonymous with \u2018healthier\u2019 soda in the US.\n\nThe purchase of Poppi is PepsiCo\u2019s second $1bn-plus acquisition in six months and the food-and-drinks major\u2019s latest attempt to tap into a growing part of the market through M&A.\n\nSpeaking at the annual CAGNY investment conference last month, PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta called out \u201cfunctionality\u201d and \u201cmulticultural\u201d as two product trends that would be central to the company\u2019s investment strategy \u2013 and its recent deal-making underlines that thesis. In October, the Lay\u2019s snacks maker agreed to buy Mexican-American snacks maker Siete Foods for a fee of $1.2bn.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness,\u201d Laguarta said on Monday. \u201cPoppi is a great complement to our portfolio transformation efforts to meet these needs.\u201d\n\nAfter attending last week\u2019s Expo West trade show in California, Moskow highlighted better-for-you soda as an area the major players in conventional fizzy drinks needed to focus on. \u201cWe believe carbonated soda leaders will need to take this segment of the market more seriously in 2025 rather than assuming it is a fad,\u201d Moskow said at the time and, this week, he praised PepsiCo\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2018functional soda\u2019 is becoming a mainstream segment of the market with sustainable appeal,\u201d he said on Monday.\n\nThe transaction includes $300m of anticipated cash tax benefits for a net purchase price of $1.65bn, PepsiCo said. The deal also features an additional potential \u201cearnout consideration\u201d based on whether certain undisclosed \u201cperformance milestones\u201d are reached, the company added.\n\nBarclays analyst Lauren Lieberman says the price tag works out at around four times Poppi\u2019s sales in the last 12 months, which, she says, \u201cstrikes us as more akin to a beauty valuation\u201d.\n\nHowever, Lieberman adds: \u201cWe see a lot of similarities between the fast-growth, emerging brand landscape of each industry. Poppi boasts both scale and credibility with consumers (the latter of which really coming to light in our data work), which screens particularly attractive, in our view, when considering the path for an internal build would be long and uncertain.\u201d\n\nNot all consumers have been happy, however. Poppi confirmed this week it had settled a lawsuit in the US filed by consumers who claimed they were misled by the company (Poppi said it \u201cacknowledges no fault, liability, or wrongdoing\u201d).\n\nCans of Poppi prebiotic soda in Key Food store in Queens, New York City, 6 January 2025. Credit: Artist Nadia Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe settlement will allow Poppi and PepsiCo to look forward. For PepsiCo, it\u2019s a chance to buy into a burgeoning market and attempt to grow the brand further. The company had planned to launch a similar soda under its Soulboost brand (which hit the market four years ago with a range of sparkling waters including \u201cfunctional\u201d ingredients like L-theanine and panax ginseng) but decided against the move (it\u2019s said the early indications for the new product were not positive) and pounced for Poppi instead.\n\n\u201cA frequent strategic dilemma when entering a new segment or category is whether to build or buy your way in,\u201d David Clark, a former General Mills executive and founder of the Avenir Strategies consultancy, says. \u201cBuying typically involves paying a premium based on anticipated growth derived from past performance \u2013 the more solid the track record, the higher the premium. Building avoids this purchase premium but has a slow build and a high failure rate, circa 80%.\u201d\n\nLast month, Coca-Cola introduced its first prebiotic soda line, launching the Simply Pop brand in the US.\n\nSimply Pop, initially set to go on sale \u201cat retail in select regions\u201d and via Amazon, is targeted at a product set that includes brands such as Poppi and Olipop.\n\n\u201cOf course, Coke may also be pursuing acquisitions \u2026 but these initial moves suggest that Coke and Pepsi may see the BFY soda opportunity and urgency differently. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this unfolds,\u201d Clark says.\n\nAfter Poppi, could Olipop be next?\n\nLast month, Olipop was valued at $1.85bn after raising $50m in a Series C funding round, led by JP Morgan Private Capital\u2019s Growth Equity Partners.\n\nIn 2023, CNBC quoted Ben Goodwin, Olipop\u2019s CEO, as saying PepsiCo and Coca-Cola had made an approach about a potential sale.\n\nOlipop said the new cash injection marked its \u201cfinal anticipated round of equity financing\u201d, after becoming profitable \u201cin early 2024\u201d.\n\nThe company, however, also confirmed that it fell short of its $500m sales target projected in May, generating over $400m in revenue for fiscal year 2024.\n\n\u201cThe other big player in this space is Olipop and we fully expect them to get acquired by one of PepsiCo\u2019s rivals in the near term,\u201d Richard Wyborn, a partner at UK-based consultancy Food Strategy Associates, says. \u201cInterest in prebiotics and gut health isn\u2019t going anywhere and is a trend we expect to appear in more and more categories in the future.\u201d\n\nIn the main, PepsiCo\u2019s acquisition of Poppi is seen by industry watchers as a deal that could benefit both sides. PepsiCo has snapped up a significant player in a buoyant product segment \u2013 and a segment that\u2019s expected to continue to grow.\n\nMeanwhile, Poppi gets the benefit of PepsiCo\u2019s distribution muscle. It wouldn\u2019t be a massive surprise if we saw, perhaps with some tweaks to recipes and flavours, Poppi products in more international markets in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cThey need to ensure they let management continue to do what they\u2019ve been doing \u2013 if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it \u2013 but also ensure that they don\u2019t turbo charge the growth too much,\u201d Wyborn says. \u201cDistribution should be built up gradually all the while ensuring velocities remain high.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone is sold on the prospects for such functional sodas.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s scale will undoubtedly help Poppi in the medium term and this type of bolt-on acquisition has delivered the best ROI in the FMCG industry. However, I remain sceptical about the long-term viability of these sodas,\u201d Ivan Torossian, a consulting director at GlobalData, Just Drinks\u2019 parent, says.\n\n\u201cAt $2.5\u2013$3 per can, Poppi lacks the \u2018instant gratification\u2019 factor. Red Bull gives you instant wings and electrolyte beverages instant hydration but prebiotics? Consumers too concerned with sugar and gut might as well stick to water for a quarter of the cost. Is there really enough differentiation to sustain Poppi\u2019s positioning?\u201d",

He has urged caution when considering buying American car stocks, and this time around, he discussed the impact of higher car prices due to the tariffs on the broader economy:\n\n\u201cYeah and I thought that was a great. . .look we kind of thought the President was transactional. Now we\u2019ve realized the President is in transit. Now I am less concerned about the President than I was before because when I look at the different, I\u2019ve been trying to get them to clarify what they\u2019re doing. But other than autos, you know look we\u2019re gonna have us a period where we\u2019re gonna go from two-and-a-half percent autos to 25% and that\u2019s gonna hurt Japan, it\u2019s gonna hurt Germany. It\u2019s gonna hurt Korea. And that\u2019s the real tariff. And when we do that, that\u2019s the day that the market\u2019s gonna go down big enough to buy. Because then they\u2019re kind of done. Remember, well here\u2019s the problem Carl, nobody buys anything that we make so it\u2019s really hard. . .President\u2019s not explained that well. At all.

The move, coupled with market worries about a recessionary impact from tariffs, led several analysts to cut their targets for the index. Commenting on the cuts, Cramer outlined:\n\n\u201cIt depends on what do you really want to do if you\u2019re the President and these, and expensive wine. And expensive champagne. Or make them expensive. Well I mean you basically want them to say will you stop it with the Jack Daniel\u2019s? I mean, come on. Come on. If you try to make Jack Daniel\u2019s expensive, everything you sell us is just gonna be too expensive and we\u2019re all gonna be drinking Kim Crawford. . .But I do think that this is a very, very high tariff and I think it would cause a lot of attention in France.\u201d\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on President Trump\u2019s latest set of tariffs. This time around, Trump targeted champagne in a bid to get European countries to reduce their restrictions on American whiskey brands such as Jack Daniel\u2019s. Cramer started out by explaining the effect of the tariffs on the consumer and the general trend in the alcoholic beverage market:\n\nWe recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 12 Stocks & Shares Big Buying Signal . In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cUsed car market unfortunately very much involved in the CPI. It\u2019s gonna be a convoluted sense of world trade. And I think that what people recognize is that there has been a big disadvantage, we\u2019ve been at a big disadvantage in our country. But the President has explained it so poorly, that you actually think that well wow, what\u2019s he doing to us. But it\u2019s been a big joke for a very long time. But no one\u2019s taking any action because everyone wants cheap goods for the American people. He\u2019s reversing it. He\u2019s reversing it.\u201d\n\nThe underlying theme of his latest appearances has been that while the President is right in pushing for tariffs, he could take a softer approach. According to Cramer, Trump\u2019s \u201cgonna make it so the goods aren\u2019t cheap. But our trading partners have to pay the price. With the idea that maybe if they start buying some of the stuff or put more plants here . . .then maybe the tariffs will come down.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on March 13th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): \"GLP-1 Is a Curse Word for Pepsi!\" \u2013 Jim Cramer\u2019s Take on the Snack Giant\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 69\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the largest consumer beverage companies in the world. Its shares are down by 13% over the past year due to high inflation, eroding demand, and an inability to consistently raise prices. Cramer\u2019s previous remarks about PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have praised the firm\u2019s CEO Ramon Laguarta. However, he also believes that the firm is struggling because of the impact of GLP-1 drugs on the snack industry. Yet, while Cramer thinks that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has to figure out how to navigate lower demand for snacks, he also believes that if there\u2019s one firm that can figure it out, it\u2019s Pepsi. Here are his latest comments:\n\n\u201cNo, Doritos obviously PepsiCo got a real hit, went down below 150.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 10th on our list of best stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Under the agreement, Pepsi will be required to make additional payments if Poppi reaches certain performance milestones within a set period after the acquisition closes. It remains unclear when the deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval.\n\nPoppi, a prebiotic soda that includes fruit juice and apple cider vinegar, was founded in 2018 by Allison and Stephen Ellsworth. The couple pitched Poppi, then named Mother Beverage, on an episode of \u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2018, which led to a $400,000 investment at 25% stake from guest shark Rohan Oza.\n\nBy 2023, Poppi surpassed $100 million in annual sales, according to CNBC.\n\nRamon Laguarta, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo., said the company\u2019s acquisition of Poppi \u201cis a great complement to our portfolio transformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been evolving our food and beverage portfolio over many years, including by innovating with our brands in new spaces and through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enable us to offer more positive choices to our consumers,\u201d Laguarta said in the release. \u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness.\u201d\n\nHowever, last summer Poppi faced a class-action lawsuit from consumers who claim the sodas don\u2019t have as many benefits for gut health as suggested. Poppi agreed to settle the suit for $8.9 million, according to a court filing March 14.",

            "content": "The soda industry has gone through many eras, from the early days of real sugar cane-sweetened sodas to the diet drink boom of the '70s and '80s. But this decade marks the rise of a new kind of soda\u2014one that follows today\u2019s biggest trend: wellness.\n\n\n\nFrom Olipop to Poppi to Slice, prebiotic sodas are popping up left and right, aiming to redefine an industry long considered one of the least healthy in the food system. With lower calorie counts, reduced sugar, and gut-friendly prebiotics, these modern sodas are reshaping the market, and it seems every major beverage company wants a piece of the new soda pie\u2014including PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo Acquires Poppi Sodas\n\nBeverage giant PepsiCo just made a massive move in the wellness drink space, acquiring Poppi in a $1.65 billion deal, according to a press release. The acquisition is part of PepsiCo\u2019s strategy to expand its \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d portfolio and meet evolving consumer preferences.\n\n\n\nPoppi is still a relative newcomer in the soda space, but has already built a major following since its 2018 debut on Shark Tank. The Austin, Texas-born brand started as a farmers\u2019 market favorite and has since found its way onto the shelves of major retailers nationwide. With a lineup of flavors like Wild Berry, Doc Pop, and its latest addition, Cream Soda, each can combines fruit juice, apple cider vinegar, sparkling water, and prebiotics for a refreshing, functional twist on soda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been evolving our food and beverage portfolio over many years, including by innovating with our brands in new spaces and through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enable us to offer more positive choices to our consumers,\u201d said Ramon Laguarta, CEO of PepsiCo, in a press release. \u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness. Poppi is a great complement to our portfolio transformation efforts to meet these needs.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe functional soda frenzy is real, folks. In fact, this move follows Coca-Cola\u2019s recent foray into the prebiotic soda space. But, rather than acquiring an established soda brand, Coca-Cola introduced a wellness soda line under its Simply brand, which has been a beverage aisle staple since 2001. While the Poppi deal is still subject to regulatory approval, its acquisition suggests that PepsiCo has opted to buy rather than build its own prebiotic soda brand from scratch\u2014at least for now.\n\nOne thing is for certain\u2014the modern soda revolution is changing the way consumers think about soft drinks. Once an occasional indulgence, soda is now becoming a daily habit, thanks in part to brands like Poppi that offer wellness benefits alongside bold flavors. This shift also means bigger sales potential, as soda drinkers move away from the once or twice a week splurge and toward an everyday \u2018little treat.\u2019\n\nWith the category continuing to grow, we're interested to see how these mega-brands adapt to the shifting trends. And, will Olipop be the next soda brand up for bidding? Time will soon tell.\n\n",

This acquisition comes following competitor Coca Cola launching Simply Pop just a few weeks ago and Olipop raising a $50 million Series C, valuing the rival prebiotic soda brand at nearly $2 billion.\n\nPoppi\u2019s brand and marketing, with a focus on wellness, fun, nostalgia, and lifestyle aspirations, have enabled its growing popularity. However, not all is going smoothly for the beverage company. In 2024, it faced a lawsuit claiming the drinks do not contain enough prebiotic fiber to \u201ccause meaningful gut health benefits for the consumer from just one can, and with 2 grams of prebiotic fiber, a person would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to see any potential health benefits.\u201d",

CAVU Consumer Partners invested in Poppi from its initial seed round through to its sale to PepsiCo, helping scale the brand\u2019s market presence and distribution.\n\nPoppi, which launched in 2018 with an investment from Shark Tank, has grown significantly, capturing 19% of the U.S. prebiotic soda market and surpassing Coca-Cola\u2019s Simply Pop. Its sales topped $100m by 2024, driven by endorsements from celebrities like Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, and Post Malone.\n\nThe acquisition underscores the rising investor interest in functional beverages, an emerging sector within consumer health. Private equity firms have increasingly backed companies in this space, capitalizing on the demand for alternatives to traditional sodas. With PepsiCo now moving aggressively into the category, private equity players will likely explore further consolidation and investment opportunities in functional drinks.\n\nAs PepsiCo integrates Poppi into its portfolio, the deal highlights the evolving landscape of beverage investments, where private equity and strategic buyers are competing for high-growth, health-focused brands.\n\n\n\n",

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhy was Poppi sued?\n\nIn June, Kristen Cobbs of San Francisco sued VNGR Beverage LLC, the Texas-based corporation that manufactures, markets and sells Poppi.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit alleges that one can of Poppi contains only 2 grams of prebiotic fiber, which means \"a consumer would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits.\" If a consumer were to drink this many sodas, the suit states, Poppi's high sugar content would offset most, if not all, of the reported gut health benefits.\n\nIn a statement previously provided to USA TODAY on Monday, Poppi said the company stands behind its products.\n\n\"Poppi acknowledges no fault, liability or wrongdoing, and instead, we are focused on bringing consumers the innovation they expect from the brand they love,\" the company said. \"We\u2019re excited to move forward and continue our passion to modernize soda for the next generation.\"\n\nPepsiCo did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on Monday.\n\nWhat is Poppi?\n\nKnown for its bright and bold cans, Poppi is a soda that contains prebiotics from agave insulin and cassava root fiber; apple cider vinegar; fruit juice; and sugar, according to the company's website. One can of soda is reported to contain 5 or less grams of sugar and 35 or less calories.\n\nPoppi made its first public appearance in 2018 on the ABC series, \"Shark Tank,\" when founders Allison and Stephen Ellsworth accepted a $400,000 investment in exchange for 25% of the company from Guest Shark Rohan Oza. Known as the time as Mother Beverage, the soda was rebranded and first Whole Foods Market shelves.\n\n\"With the help of an investment on Shark Tank, Poppi has gone from farmers'-market-favorite to sitting pretty on the shelves of every major retailer across the nation,\" the company's website says, noting that the sodas are \"beloved\" by stars like Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn.\n\nAccording the the lawsuit, Poppi's sales topped $100 million by 2024, and those numbers continue to grow as the drink represents 19% of the U.S. market share, surpassing Coke but 1.5 times.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to add new information.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nPepsiCo is purchasing prebiotic soda maker Poppi for $1.95 billion. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.\n\nThe CPG giant said the brand, which saw $500 million in sales last year, has amassed \u201ca loyal fan base and a demonstrated capacity for growth,\u201d PepsiCo\u2019s U.S. beverages CEO Ram Krishnan said in a statement.\n\nBeverage giants have expanded into the better-for-you soda category dominated by Poppi and Olipop, the latter of which was valued at nearly $2 billion following its latest funding round last month. PepsiCo rival Coca-Cola entered the space last month with a new product line, Simply Pop.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPepsiCo built its empire on the back of sugary, carbonated drinks such as its namesake cola, Mtn Dew and Mug Root Beer. Its purchase of Poppi signals a sea change in the soda category, validating the growing number of consumers craving more functional ingredients and less sugar in their soft drinks.\n\nRamon LaGuarta, PepsiCo\u2019s chairman and CEO, said the purchase follows the company\u2019s plan to strategically acquire brands in new spaces to evolve its portfolio.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness,\u201d LaGuarta said. \u201cpoppi is a great complement to our portfolio transformation efforts to meet these needs.\u201d\n\nPoppi first gained national attention after it appeared on an episode of Shark Tank in 2018, receiving an investment from Rohan Oza, the co-founder of Cavu Consumer Partners. It launched two years later at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The functional soda maker grew its presence in recent years following a $25 million funding round in late 2022.\n\nPepsiCo initially planned to launch a better-for-you soda under the brand name Soulboost, but the product was nixed in development amid indications that it wouldn\u2019t succeed, Bloomberg reported. PepsiCo appears to have decided that despite its deep financial, marketing and distribution resources, it was better to go out and buy the competition rather than struggle to compete against them with its own product.\n\nIts strategy stands in contrast to Coca-Cola, which instead of going out and buying a brand decided to launch its prebiotic soda offering under its Simply juice brand.\n\nPepsiCo has prioritized purchasing trendy brands with healthier ingredients to diversify its portfolio and better compete in beverages and snacks. Last October, it acquired Mexican-American tortilla chip maker Siete Foods, known for its clean-label ingredients, for $1.2 billion.\n\nPoppi\u2019s formula contains a blend of sparkling water, apple cider vinegar and prebiotics like agave inulin, with 5 grams of sugar per can. It\u2019s expanded with 14 flavors, including Orange Cream, Root Beer and Cherry Limeade.\n\nPoppi\u2019s health claims have also faced some scrutiny, with a class action lawsuit filed last summer claiming the drink is \u201cbasically sugared water.\u201d Its marketing campaigns, including a high-profile Super Bowl ad this year and a vending machine giveaway to social media influencers, have also drawn controversy.",

The deal, valued at over $1.5 billion, could be announced early next week, though discussions are still ongoing and may face potential delays.\n\nFounded by Allison and Stephen Ellsworth, Poppi has gained a loyal following for its refreshing, gut-friendly sodas made with apple cider vinegar. As consumers increasingly shift toward healthier beverage choices, PepsiCo sees this acquisition as an opportunity to strengthen its presence in the functional drink market.\n\nThe New York-based beverage giant had previously attempted to enter this space with its functional soda brand, Soulboost.

With growing consumer demand for low-sugar, probiotic-rich beverages, integrating Poppi into its lineup could help PepsiCo expand its market share and stay ahead of industry trends.\n\nWhile neither PepsiCo nor Poppi have officially commented on the deal, industry experts believe the acquisition would mark a significant step in PepsiCo\u2019s long-term growth strategy.

So that's on being consumer-centric and starting to work and drilling down on that. And then understanding what the trends are in terms of taste, profile, health and wellness,\" Kotecha told PTI.It is investing \"a significant amount\" in understanding consumers better as India has a rich heritage of food, cooking, beverages and drinks, he added.PepsiCo presently has manufacturing plants at Mathura in UP, Channo in Punjab, Ranjangaon in Pune and Sankrail near Kolkata in West Bengal. Moreover, its next plant is coming up in Assam, which will be operational this year.Besides, PepsiCo plans two more greenfield plants, including one for South to meet the growing demand there.Its food segment contributes nearly 80 per cent of its revenue, in which it operates through brands such as - Lays, Kurkure, Doritos and Quaker, and Kotecha expects growth in the coming years as the consumption in the Indian market is very low compared to other markets.In the oatmeal category, PepsiCo is facing competition from home-grown firms such as Marico and some other companies. However, it still leads in the base oatmeal category.\"Health and wellness is a good trend to grow. We have been growing on Quaker double-digits. On our base oatmeal, we still lead the category. Saffola, leads the category more on the flavored variety,\" he said.When asked about multiple India stories, Kotecha said PepsiCo will keep innovating. Products like the Magic Masala in Lays, are not the same across the country. It varies from region to region, he said.\"The masala profile which we have on Lays in Northern India is slightly different from the Western India, which is slightly on the sweeter side. And when you go to the southern part of India, it's very spicy,\" he said.Even the cooking oil used for products like Kurkure is changed based on the region, as in the East it's 'mustard-based profile' and in the South it's sesame oil (gingelly oil).\"Rice is a huge substrate in the South for snacks. Besan is a substrate in Western India and Central India. How do I use it? So we can create products for Indian consumers for multiple Indias. And that's the journey we have started, and that's what we want to keep growing on,\" he said.PepsiCo is working with 27,000 potato farmers in India to source over 400,000 tons of chip grade potatoes from states including Punjab, Gujarat, West Bengal, MP and now from Assam. It has an agro R&D Facility at Zahura in Punjab for potato breeding.",

Here is a breakdown of their recent ratings and the rationale behind them.\n\nCapital One Financial is catching the attention of investors as analysts David George and John Pancari both upgraded the stock to a \u2018Buy\u2019. George sees the recent dip in COF shares as a golden opportunity, predicting a strong future for the company post its Discover deal. He highlights COF\u2019s potential for high returns and robust growth in credit-sensitive financials. Pancari echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the long-term earnings potential despite some risks like a weakening U.S. consumer and possible delays in the Discover deal. Both analysts set a target price of $200, indicating significant upside.\n\nCervoMed is making waves in the healthcare sector with its promising new capsules for dementia treatment. Analyst Soumit Roy upgraded the stock to \u2018Buy\u2019, impressed by the marked cognitive improvements seen in recent trials. The new capsules showed significant benefits over the old ones, sparking optimism about future studies. With ongoing trials in France and potential FDA meetings on the horizon, CervoMed is poised for exciting developments. The high unmet need in dementia treatment could fast-track CervoMed\u2019s progress to Phase 3 trials.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise faces a challenging start to the year, leading analyst Louis Miscioscia to downgrade the stock to \u2018Hold\u2019. Despite a revenue beat in the first quarter, guidance for the second quarter fell short, raising concerns. Issues like excess Nvidia inventory and pricing competition in core servers are weighing on HPE. However, the company\u2019s AI server backlog remains strong, and its Intelligent Edge segment shows promise. Miscioscia\u2019s target price is now $16, reflecting cautious optimism amid industry and company-specific challenges.\n\nEaton is drawing positive attention from analysts, with Jeffrey Hammond upgrading the stock to \u2018Buy\u2019. Hammond sees Eaton as a standout in the industrial sector, particularly in electrification and aerospace. Despite broader economic uncertainties, Eaton\u2019s robust backlog and growth potential in data centers and utilities offer a clear path to earnings upside. The recent pullback in share price presents a compelling entry point for investors, with a target price set at $340.\n\nPepsiCo, on the other hand, is facing headwinds, leading analyst Kaumil Gajrawala to downgrade the stock to \u2018Hold\u2019. The company\u2019s U.S. business struggles, particularly in the Frito segment, are a concern. While international growth remains strong, the domestic challenges are overshadowing overall performance. Gajrawala sees limited upside potential, with a target price of $170. Investors are advised to look for better opportunities in other beverage companies as PepsiCo navigates its current challenges.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

Ahead of World Water Day 2025, the event showcased the success of water security measures implemented across 10 villages in the Hathras Block so far, reaching over 2,300 farming families. Aligned with PepsiCo India\u2019s philosophy of \u201cPartnership of Progress,\u201d it demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to fostering sustainable development and enabling communities by working closely with local partners and stakeholders.\n\nThe Watershed Health Initiative has resulted in the conservation of approximately 8.12 crore litres of water annually, creating 45 water-efficient farms, helping improve farmer livelihood. The model village of Chintagarhi serves as a blueprint for sustainable water conservation, featuring multiple rainwater harvesting structures, a revived pond, water efficient farming, and extensive community awareness efforts that can be replicated across the country.\n\nDistinguished guests, including Chief Guest Birendra Singh Rana, MLA Sikandra Rao, Hathras, graced the occasion, alongside Moti Ram, Gram Pradhan, Chintagarhi; Shrimati Poonam Pandey, Block Pramukh; Jyoti Sharma, Founder & President, FORCE, and PepsiCo India team among others.

Groundwater conservation is crucial for the future of agriculture and the well-being of our communities. The transformation seen in Chintagarhi is truly commendable, and I believe this model can be successfully replicated across other regions to ensure long-term water security.\u201d\n\nYashika Singh, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer and Sustainability Head, PepsiCo India and South Asia, said, \"The Watershed Health Initiative reinforces our commitment to water positivity by improving groundwater replenishment and promoting water-efficient farming. Located close to our Foods manufacturing plant in Kosi, the Model Water-Secure Village demonstrates how effective rainwater management can drive long-term water security. By working closely with local communities, we are enabling farmers access sustainable water sources, enhancing agricultural resilience, and improving livelihoods. Farmers and villagers are already witnessing a difference with increased water availability, better crop yields and therefore improved income. This initiative embodies our \u2018Partnership for Progress\u2019 philosophy\u2014where businesses, communities, and local governance come together to create lasting impact.\"\n\nShrimati Poonam Pandey, Block Pramukh, said, \"I commend PepsiCo India and FORCE Trust for their great work on Watershed Health initiative. \u2018Gaon Ka Pani Gaon Mein\u2019 is a remarkable effort, especially at a time when groundwater levels are depleting. Water conservation is not just a need of the present but a responsibility towards our future generations. This initiative will serve as a powerful reminder for communities to take charge of their water resources, ensuring long-term sustainability. After all, Jal hi Jeevan hai, and securing water today means securing the future of our villages.\"\n\nJyoti Sharma, Founder & President, FORCE, added, \u201cSustainable water management is critical for both environmental and economic resilience. In partnership with PepsiCo India through Gaon ka Pani Gaon Mein, Sampoorn Kheti and Jal Shakti Kendra, we have empowered farmers to become active participants in water conservation while improving their livelihoods and turning them into smart farmers.\u201d\n\nThe Watershed Health Initiative aims to create scalable models of water security, addressing the urgent need for groundwater recharge and efficient water management.\n\nGaon Ka Pani Gaon Mein focuses on zero rainwater flow-out planning, ensuring that villages harvest and recharge every drop of rainwater through multi-point groundwater recharge systems and pond revival efforts.\n\nSampoorn Kheti promotes climate-resilient, water-efficient farming that reduces water usage and enhances soil fertility and productivity, helping develop a community of Smart Farmers. By adopting precision irrigation, direct seeding, and improved soil management techniques, these farmers save more on input costs, earn more through better yields.\n\nJal Shakti Kendra is a community outreach and awareness program, ensuring that water conservation knowledge spreads beyond the immediate project area for a wider impact.\n\nWater conservation is a crucial pillar of sustainable agriculture and community resilience. By integrating traditional wisdom with modern techniques, projects like Watershed Health Initiative can help farmers secure their future while ensuring the long-term health of natural resources.",

            "content": "Since the start of 2023, the big story on Wall Street has been technology. The boring consumer staples sector has lagged far behind both the tech sector and the broader S&P 500 index (^GSPC 2.13%) over the past three to five years. Since the start of 2024, however, there's been a shift in the mood on Wall Street, with investors moving back toward boring, conservative investment choices. That's boosted consumer staples companies across the board.\n\nHowever, there are two Dividend Kings that are still trailing their peers and, potentially, offering long-term dividend investors a lot of opportunity.\n\nWhat's so special about consumer staples stocks?\n\nTechnology stocks are largely a growth story, with the hot theme right now being artificial intelligence (AI). That's all well and good, but hot investment themes generally lead to extended valuations. And when investors turn cautious, those valuations can compress quite quickly. It looks like that is what has happened over the past month or so, with a steep drop in the technology sector dragging the S&P 500 index lower.\n\nDuring periods like this, investors often shift toward more conservative investments, like stocks in the consumer staples sector. Consumer staples are, basically, products that people buy on a regular basis even if the economy has fallen into a recession. Think toilet paper, toothpaste, and food. You might be able to put off the purchase of Apple's next iPhone, but you can't stop buying Procter & Gamble's bathroom tissue, Unilever's toothpaste, or General Mills' soups and cereals.\n\nBasically, the consumer staples sector is filled with reliable and slow-growing companies. Two that are worth looking at right now are Dividend Kings PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) and Hormel Foods (HRL 0.17%). Both have lagged behind the broader consumer staples space and offer historically high dividend yields today.\n\nWhat's wrong with PepsiCo?\n\nFrom a business perspective, there's nothing wrong with PepsiCo. It managed to grow organic sales by 2% in 2024 and adjusted earnings increased by 9%. Those are solid numbers in the consumer staples space. Looking out to 2025, management projects low single-digit organic sales growth and mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth, also solid numbers.\n\nBut 2024 and 2025 are both slower than what PepsiCo achieved when it was able to push through large price increases thanks to the inflation coming out of the worst parts of the coronavirus pandemic. The slowdown led some investors to abandon the company's stock, which still trades off by around 20% from its most recent peak. It also offers a historically high 3.5% dividend yield.\n\nThat suggests you still have an opportunity to buy a very well-run and diversified business (with operations in beverages, snacks, and packaged foods) at an attractive price. Even the most conservative investors should feel comfortable owning PepsiCo, noting that the dividend has been increased annually for a huge 52 years and counting.\n\nWhat's wrong with Hormel Foods?\n\nHormel is a different story because it faces some material issues. Notably, the food maker had a fairly weak fiscal 2024 and its first quarter in fiscal 2025 was mixed, with organic sales up 1% but adjusted earnings lower by 11%. This is basically a continuation of a trend for the food maker, which wasn't able to push through price increases as quickly as peers, has been facing headwinds from avian flu, is being impacted by a slow recovery in China, and has faced production issues in its recently acquired Planters business.\n\nHormel is a bit of a turnaround play at this point, but management is doing what it can. And it remains confident enough in its long-term future that it keeps increasing its dividend each year. The streak is now up to 59 consecutive years. That said, the company's relatively weak financial performance has investors seriously downbeat on the stock, which has lost 40% of its value over the past three years. That's pushed the dividend yield up to a historically high 3.8%.\n\nManagement isn't sitting still, however, and it has a strong backstop in the form of The Hormel Foundation, which controls around 47% of the voting rights at the company. In other words, Hormel has the leeway to make long-term decisions instead of rushing to appease Wall Street, the latter of which could lead to short-term fixes that don't solve long-term problems. If you think in decades and not days and can handle investing in a contrarian manner, Hormel might be a good stock for your portfolio.\n\nI like underdogs and contrarian ideas\n\nIf you are like me, you don't mind stepping into areas that others avoid. I believe that's where you find the best values, though sometimes Wall Street even puts pretty good companies in the doghouse. That's the case today with PepsiCo, which isn't doing badly as a business despite what the stock price decline might indicate. Hormel is a bit more difficult to sell, given that it has been dealing with material headwinds for a while now. However, the Dividend King has a long history of success, and The Hormel Foundation gives it the leeway to adjust its business in ways that other companies can't.",

            "content": "With the recent return of volatility in the stock market, investors have fallen back in love with sturdy consumer staples businesses -- especially the ones that pay out predictably rising dividends. PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) has been one of those relative winners so far in 2025, with shares up slightly even as the S&P 500 index dropped 5%. Let's take a closer look at that beverage and snack food giant to see how it stacks up against its main drink rival, Coca-Cola (KO 0.07%).\n\nGrowth and outlook\n\nCoca-Cola is the clear growth winner, despite consumers becoming more price-sensitive in the past year. Organic sales rose 14% in the most recent quarter, trouncing PepsiCo's 2% uptick. The beverage giant is projecting another solid year ahead as organic revenue expands by between 5% and 6%. PepsiCo's management team, on the other hand, forecast another year of low-single-digit revenue gains in 2025 after organic sales rose by just 2% last year.\n\nInvestors will be watching both companies' results for signs of inflation fatigue. That's more of a challenge for PepsiCo, though, due to its exposure to rising food ingredient prices. Its sales volume fell by 1% last quarter, compared to Coca-Cola's 2% uptick. Coca-Cola was also able to raise prices more aggressively in 2024 while keeping volume in positive territory. These factors suggest that Coca-Cola has a clearer path toward improving shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond.\n\nCash flow and returns\n\nBoth PepsiCo and Coca-Cola promise to reward investors with ample cash returns this year, thanks to their efficient businesses. PepsiCo is planning to spend $7.6 billion on dividends in 2025, along with $1 billion in stock buyback spending.\n\nCoca-Cola executives also favor dividends as their main channel for cash returns. They spent $8 billion on dividend payments last year and $1.1 billion on stock buybacks. Yet PepsiCo delivers a higher yield at 3.55% today compared to Coca-Cola's 2.7% rate. Both companies hiked their dividend by the same 5% in 2025. As a result, income investors might prefer PepsiCo shares for their higher yield and attractive cash flow trends.\n\nThe price is right\n\nYou'll pay a premium to own Coca-Cola stock over PepsiCo, but the real question is whether it's worth the extra value. PepsiCo shares are trading at 18 times this year's expected earnings, compared to Coca-Cola's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 24. You see a similar valuation gap in terms of sales, with Pepsi trading at 2.3 times revenue to Coca-Cola's ratio of 6.5 times.\n\nFactors supporting Coca-Cola's premium include its faster growth, as mentioned above, but also its stellar profitability. The beverage giant's operating profit margin is a blazing 30% of sales, more than double PepsiCo's 14% rate.\n\nThe main reasons to prefer PepsiCo's stock over Coca-Cola's are its cheaper valuation and higher yield. Yet most investors will want to choose Coca-Cola for their portfolios today. Its beverage business dominates the industry, and that success shows up in pricing power, high profit margins, and faster sales growth. There's no denying the stability of its earnings power, either, as the company just announced its 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase. That payout gives Coca-Cola a prime spot in the exclusive club of Dividend Kings, or companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nIt's OK to pay a higher price for such a well-performing, financially sturdy business. Coca-Cola wins this investing matchup.",

Reports noted that the beverage and snacks mega-company was in advanced talks on the deal and an announcement could come as soon as next week.\n\nThis revelation comes on the heels of The Coca-Cola Co. and Talking Rain Beverage Co. each launching their own prebiotic soda brands in February, aiming to take advantage of the heightened interest consumers seem to have in better-for-you beverages, particularly those with functional ingredients. Functional sodas, as well, have been growing, offering consumers prebiotics, probiotics and fiber \u2014 typically not found in traditional carbonated sodas.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s Simply Pop launched in February through e-commerce and in select markets in the U.S., with expansion to additional markets expected throughout 2025, according to a release from the company upon launch. The sodas are housed under the Simply juice brand to build on its familiarity with consumers. Becca Kerr, CEO of Nutrition for The Coca-Cola Co., said that wellness-focused Gen Z and Millennial consumers are interested in juice and prebiotic sodas, and \u201csince many brands in this category are new, they were looking to align with names they know and trust for both quality and taste.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of February, Talking Rain \u2014 which is best-known for its zero-sugar Sparkling Ice carbonated beverage line \u2014 announced the release of its new Popwell line, which offers consumers prebiotics and immunity support in six flavors, three of which are caffeinated. Oscar Mayorqu\u00edn, COO at Talking Rain, said the company\u2019s research \u201csuggested that consumers were dissatisfied with the taste of some of the prebiotic beverages currently on the market,\u201d so Talking Rain added emphasis on its flavor-forward approach. Popwell has rolled out in e-commerce and retailers around the country.\n\nBack to Poppi, however. The company was founded in Austin, Texas, and has grown in popularity since appearing on the Shark Tank TV show, where it received an investment from one of the \u201csharks.\u201d An acquisition would shake up the better-for-you soda segment significantly, and it would certainly fit with the trends so far in 2025.\n\nNeither PepsiCo nor Poppi representatives had commented on these reports at presstime.",

Those affected by the goods slapped with levies are facing struggles, while those unaffected can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nUnfortunately for PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%), it is in the former category. Compounding that, on Hump Day it was also buffeted by a recommendation downgrade. As a result, its share price fell by nearly 3% on a day when the S&P 500 index recovered by notching a 0.5% gain.\n\nExemptions requested\n\nReuters reported that a group of top American food and drink makers formally requested that President Donald Trump exempt a range of comestible inputs from the current round of tariffs. These ingredients include such items as cocoa, used in the manufacture of chocolate, and fruit.\n\nIn a letter to the President, PepsiCo and peers such as J.M. Smucker and Conagra Brands asked that \"Trump exempt ingredients not available from U.S. sources to protect manufacturers who otherwise buy from domestic farmers and suppliers,\" the news agency wrote.\n\nReuters added that the companies are requesting that Trump engage in a \"targeted and carefully calibrated removal\" of these items. In their view, this would serve to both protect American food and drink manufacturers, and reduce consumer inflation.\n\nA prognosticator gets more bearish\n\nThe letter drew attention to PepsiCo's current vulnerability with inputs, while the analyst's downgrade highlighted ongoing struggles.\n\nThe company behind the downgrade was Jefferies, which now feels that PepsiCo only rates a hold rather than a buy as it previously believed. According to reports, the company cited general weakness and losses in market share as key reasons why an expected turnaround is taking longer to materialize.\n\nThis new analysis is concerning, as is the potential fallout from even a limited trade war. This might very well be a stock to avoid for the moment.",

The recent pullback in the shares provides a \"unique entry point\" into one of the \"highest-quality names\" in the sector, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nEvercore ISI upgraded Capital One (COF) to Outperform from In Line with an unchanged price target of $200. The firm believes the stock's valuation does not fully discount the company's long-term upside to earnings and returns driven by the combined Capital One/Discover (DFS) franchise.\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Rubrik (RBRK) to Buy from Neutral with a $77 price target ahead of the company reporting Q4 on March 13. The firm expects in-line to marginally better results in Q4 and notes that since the firm's initiation report on December 16 the stock has declined about 25%.\n\nLoop Capital upgraded Crocs (CROX) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $110. The stock's valuation is attractive, and management \"sounded on plan\" at Loop's conference this week, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nBarclays upgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Overweight from Equal Weight with an unchanged price target of $815. The firm cites the company's near-term benefit from a price increase, new core customer ramp, and easier compares for the upgrade.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\n\n\nJefferies downgraded PepsiCo (PEP) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $170, down from $171. The stock offers limited upside after rallying 7% from the January lows, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nDaiwa downgraded HP Enterprise (HPE) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $16, down from $25, following the company's Q1 report on March 6. The year is \"starting with many issues\" and Dell (DELL) and NetApp (NTAP) also saw choppiness in January, says the firm, which calls \"the most materiel concern\" whether President Trump will push the economy into a recession and higher inflation due to tariffs.\n\nWolfe Research downgraded Verizon (VZ) to Peer Perform from Outperform after the company's investor presentation at the Deutsche Bank Conference. Verizon's cash flow looks solid, but its new outlook adds to concerns about the cost of maintaining the largest and highest priced mobile network, the firm says.\n\nWedbush downgraded Arvinas (ARVN) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $12, down from $57, after the company reported topline VERITAC-2 data in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer previously treated with CKD4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy. Vepdeg demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ESR1 mutant population compared to patients treated with fulvenstrant, but did not meet statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT, Wedbush notes.",

These packaged food makers have requested that President Trump implement targeted exemptions on import of items such as cocoa and fruits that are not available in the U.S. The news was first reported by Reuters, citing reference to a letter made by consumer products trade group, Consumer Brands Association.\n\nExempt Items Not Available in the U.S.\n\nSeveral items such as cocoa, oats, coffee, spices, and some tropical fruits are not produced locally in the U.S. These items are key ingredients in the production of specialty foods and household goods, made by U.S. companies. The trade group is requesting that the Trump administration curate the list by carefully removing such scarce items from the Tariffs list. The letter stated that such a step would best protect American manufacturers and also \u201csupport (Trump\u2019s) efforts to lower consumer inflation.\u201d\n\nCompanies affected by Trump\u2019s sudden policy changes are scouring to find ways to source domestically scare resources from other countries, with minimum tariff impact. Trump\u2019s new round of tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico stand to largely impact the American packaged food manufacturers and consumer goods sector.\n\nAmerican consumers are already reeling from the impact of double-digit inflation in the past couple of years. Companies are complaining that consumers\u2019 buying habits have changed drastically, which is already impacting their sales. Should the new tariffs take effect, it would increase the input costs for these companies to a large extent, which they will have to pass on to consumers. Fearing an even greater impact on demand and sales, the association has decided to make an urgent request to the president to consider special exemptions.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer goods companies, including Colgate Palmolive (CL), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Banana Boat maker Edgewell also face a big exposure to the tariffs. The companies also worry about the increased impact on their production costs that could arise from any potential punitive tariffs from the said countries.\n\nWhat Stocks Are Affected by the Tariffs?\n\nWe used the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to see how the above-mentioned companies perform based on TipRanks\u2019 tools. We can observe that Wall Street is currently cautious about the companies\u2019 stock trajectories, giving them either a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d or a \u201cHold\u201d rating. Analysts are unsure about the full impact tariffs could have on these companies\u2019 performance. Investors can consider investing in any of these stocks after thorough research.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Morgan Private Capital. Coca-Cola has already released a prebiotic soda called Simply Pop, and PepsiCo is planning to enter the market. The prebiotic soda market is growing, particularly among Generation Z, those born between 1997 and 2012.\n\n\u201cMarketplace\u201d host Kai Ryssdal spoke to Laura Cooper of The Wall Street Journal about the growing market for \u201cgut pop.\u201d Below is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nKai Ryssdal: Gut pop. What is this?\n\nLaura Cooper: You\u2019ve probably seen it in the supermarket, maybe walked by it, didn\u2019t know what it was. But they\u2019re prebiotic sodas, so like Olipop and Poppi. A lot of people know Poppi from their two Super Bowl commercials this year and last year, and yeah, Gen Z really enjoys it.\n\nRyssdal: Clearly I must have just spaced out during those Super Bowl commercials, because I have no memory of them. What are they supposed to do, this prebiotic thing, just to get the biology out of the way?\n\nCooper: I\u2019m not a doctor, but I spoke to a lot of dieticians and gastroenterologists about this. And so essentially, prebiotic versus probiotic: Probiotic, you might know \u2014 kombucha, yogurt, things of that nature. This soda is prebiotic because it contains dietary fibers that feed bacteria already living in your system, and probiotic puts more microbes into your system. This is feeding what\u2019s already inside your body. And when you think about prebiotic soda and any perceived health benefits you could get from that digestive health, people are all in on trying it. So, you know, as opposed to maybe having just a regular Coca-Cola or a Pepsi, people are, they\u2019re still having those, just not as often.\n\nRyssdal: These things are going to cost me two and a half bucks a piece \u2014 did I read that right?\n\nCooper: It really depends where you\u2019re buying them. But yeah, soda has similar pricing, depending on what you\u2019re buying. There\u2019s actually something at Walmart called \u201cmodern soda,\u201d and this falls under that, an aisle where all these drinks live together.\n\nRyssdal: Coke and Pepsi clearly see this, and they say, \u201cWe got to get in on this.\u201d\n\nCooper: Oh, 100%. I mean, Coca-Cola already put out their first prebiotic soda called Simply Pop. I tried the strawberry at a conference. Very strawberry. It has a lot of juice in it. It also has just things that are different from Olipop and Poppi. I believe it\u2019s Vitamin C for one, and Zinc. So PepsiCo, I believe plans to enter this space as well. It is definitely, you know, it\u2019s picking up steam with Gen Z. And as you know, Gen Z is a share of the market everyone wants to get a piece of.\n\nRyssdal: Hey, do you drink these things on the regular?\n\nCooper: I drink soda. I have drank these. I just don\u2019t drink a ton of them, but I\u2019ve tried them all, especially in reporting this, I drank a lot of them and have spoken to a lot of people who are just huge fiends of this.\n\nRyssdal: A word about the magnitude here. You point out that the co-founder and CEO of Olipop announced a valuation with a new round of investment, puts that company at like, $1.8 billion, which is, I mean, that\u2019s not peanuts.\n\nCooper: Last month they raised money, I believe it was raised with J.P. Morgan in the lead. So, you know, this is a big business. Is it, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-sized business? Unclear. But Coca-Cola already put out their first prebiotic soda, called Simply Pop, and PepsiCo, I believe, plans to enter this space as well. It\u2019s definitely picking up steam and getting a following. And I think that all the big guys are aware that they want to be involved with this. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Dr Pepper was also interested.",

            "content": "Dividend stocks are attractive due to their ability to reduce volatility during market downturns while still providing meaningful growth potential. Historically, dividend-focused strategies have shown resilience across different regions and time periods. The Franklin Templeton report further highlighted that over the three years ending December 31, 2024, dividend-paying stocks experienced lower volatility and smaller maximum drawdowns compared to the broader market across global, US, and European segments. When inflation and interest rate concerns resurfaced last August, dividend stocks proved to be relatively stable in comparison.\n\nWith ongoing tariff uncertainty in the U.S. contributing to market volatility, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-focused strategies to strengthen portfolio stability. After a period dominated by growth stocks, interest in dividend investing has gained momentum. Over the six months leading up to January 31, 2025, US-listed dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded average monthly net inflows of nearly $3.3 billion, a sharp rise from the $107 million seen during the same period the previous year, according to a report by Franklin Templeton. Amid an uncertain global economic outlook, investors are seeking more stable assets to create balanced portfolios. Dividend stocks, particularly those with strong fundamentals, tend to provide steady and predictable cash flows. Since these cash flows play a key role in equity valuation models, determining the intrinsic or fair value of dividend-paying stocks is generally more straightforward compared to assessing the value of growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks remain a popular choice among investors due to their ability to generate steady income. Experienced investors, including Warren Buffett, have long recognized their value, as evidenced by the significant presence of dividend-paying stocks in his portfolio. While often underestimated, dividends have played a crucial role in overall investment returns. Between 1960 and the end of last year, approximately 85% of the broader market\u2019s total cumulative return stemmed from reinvested dividends and the benefits of compounding. Strategies centered around dividend-paying stocks offer the potential for greater stability, consistent income, and a safeguard against economic uncertainty, making them a strong choice for resilient portfolios.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other magnificent dividend growth stocks to invest in.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong dividend stocks, investors are more inclined to companies that have raised their payouts consistently. A report by Nuveen indicated that companies initiating or increasing dividends have historically performed well in the three years following an initial Federal Reserve interest rate hike. While the Fed began lowering rates in 2024, the report suggested that rate cuts would proceed at a slower pace in 2025 due to persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nGiven the higher interest rate environment, the report emphasized the importance of focusing on dividend-paying companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, healthy free cash flow, and management teams committed to sustainable dividend growth. In contrast, sectors with high yields but elevated debt levels could face challenges due to their sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, also noted that companies with a strong history of increasing dividend payments are typically well-capitalized and financially stable, making them less volatile than the broader market. He suggested that including such companies in an investment portfolio could help reduce fluctuations. Stovall also pointed out that dividend-paying firms generally experience lower volatility compared to those that do not offer dividends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): Among Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Invest In\n\nA close up of a glass of a refreshing carbonated beverage illustrating the company's different beverages.\n\n5-Year Average Dividend Growth Rate: 7.25%\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is frequently seen as a beverage company, which isn\u2019t inaccurate since it offers a wide variety of drinks under its well-known brand. However, the company has a much broader reach, as it also produces and markets snacks and packaged food products. In fact, its snack segment may be even more compelling than its beverage division, considering that while PepsiCo holds the second-largest position in the non-alcoholic beverage market, it leads the salty snack category through its Frito-Lay business.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) delivered stable earnings in fiscal year 2024, posting $91.8 billion in revenue, a slight increase from $91.4 billion in the prior year. Operating profit climbed to $12.8 billion from $11.9 billion in FY23, while net income also rose to $9.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects organic revenue to grow at a low-single-digit rate, with mid-single-digit growth in core constant currency EPS.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a solid cash position. In FY24, the company generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. For FY25, it plans to return approximately $7.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. On February 3, the company announced a 5% increase in its annual dividend to $5.69 per share, marking its 53rd consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. The stock supports a dividend yield of 3.5%, as of March 9.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 10th on our list of magnificent dividend growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Busy lifestyles mean that consumers want convenient food to eat, making snacks a staple for working professionals, students, and families.\n\nWhile traditional Chinese snacks such as mooncakes and dried seafood are popular, younger generations are increasingly turning to Western-style snacks. Health-conscious consumers are increasingly demanding nutritious and low-calorie snacks. Future of snacking, online platforms, and retail innovations boost accessibility, so the snack market will continue to expand across both urban and rural regions.\n\n\n\nSnacks Trends in the China Market\n\nHealth Consciousness\n\n\n\nWith increasing awareness of health and wellness among consumers in China, healthy snack options are being preferred by them. Rising obesity and diabetes concerns among others have driven people to look for low-calorie, organic, high-protein, and nutrient-rich snacks. In response, brands are introducing trending healthier snack choices like baked chips, granola bars, and snacks with superfoods.\n\nFocusing on a balanced diet and the desire for guilt-free treats drive the demand for nutritious snacks, boosting market growth. According to Glanbianutritionals, the rising interest in protein is a key trend for healthy snacks worldwide. In China, for instance, consumers have reported 71% feeling that claims on natural characteristics shaped the way perceptions were portrayed in 2023.

According to the decuple from jan-2024, The pandemic accelerated retail digitalization in China, and snack food sales via e-commerce channels have been proliferating ever since. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show China registered online retail sales of 14 trillion yuan ($1.92 trillion) in the first 11 months, up 7.4 percent over the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\nUrbanization and Changing Lifestyles\n\n\n\nChina's continued process of urbanization has increased the disposable income as well as modified consumer behavior, thus further increasing the urge for portable easy-to-eat snack foods. Cities' residents are looking for packaged snack foods which are easy to consume and allow them to save time in their very hectic schedules of work.\n\nConsequently, packaged read-to-eat foods such as protein bars, chips, biscuits, etc, are gaining popularity due to this fact. Additionally, as more people relocate to urban areas, they are exposed to global snack trends, which propels the variety and innovation of China's snack business. Aug 2024, the rate of urbanization in China reached 66.16 percent in 2023, surpassing the target set in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021 to 2025).\n\n\n\nChallenges in the China Snacks Market\n\nIntense Competition\n\n\n\nThis Chinese snack market is highly competitive because there are a great number of domestic and foreign brands trying to gain consumers' attention. In such intense competition, companies face the difficulties of determining their prices, innovation, and establishing their brands in customers' hearts. As the increasing number of brands floods into this market, the situation for every brand gets harder as consumers begin to order a wide range of options using online platforms. Local brands tend to have an advantage because they understand consumers' wants, regional flavors, and pricing better. Hence, foreign brands may not easily attain a large market share unless they successfully appeal to Chinese tastes and preferences.\n\n\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Issues Food safety and labeling rules are strict in China\n\n\n\nThis can be challenging for snack companies, particularly those that enter the market. Health claims on packaging and imported snack foods' ingredients are strictly regulated. Companies should also comply with local regulations involving Chinese labels, food safety testing, and product certification. Penalties in case of infraction include fines, product recall, and market limitations.

            "content": "\u201cBut to underscore, decision time is imminent,\u201d Melissa Hockstad, who attended the meeting and is the group\u2019s president, wrote in the letter.\n\nLater on Monday, Mr. Kennedy issued a directive that would also affect food companies nationwide. He ordered the Food and Drug Administration to revise a longstanding policy that allowed companies \u2014 independent of any regulatory review \u2014 to decide that a new ingredient in the food supply was safe. Put in place decades ago, the policy was aimed at ingredients like vinegar or salt that are widely considered to be well-understood, and benign. But the designation, known as GRAS, or \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d has since grown to include a far broader array of natural and synthetic additives.\n\nMr. Kennedy had vowed to upend the food system as a way to address growing rates of chronic disease and other health concerns even before his appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. He now oversees the F.D.A., the federal regulator for about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s food supply.\n\nMany food companies rely on artificial dyes to make breakfast cereals and candies dazzling shades of pink and blue, for instance, or beverages neon orange. Some have already tried to adapt natural ingredients, like carrot or blueberry juice, for coloring, particularly for products sold in international markets, like Canada. But the companies have said that consumer demand had weakened in the United States because of dissatisfaction with less appealing or vivid colors in snacks and drinks.\n\nSteven Williams, the chief executive of PepsiCo\u2019s North America division, attended the meeting with Mr. Kennedy, but the company said he would not comment. In an email, a PepsiCo spokesperson said that the company viewed the meeting as a \u201cproductive first step\u201d and added that it was focused on providing consumers \u201cmore options with natural ingredients, no synthetic colors and reductions in sugar, fat and sodium.\u201d",

            "content": "PepsiCo's PEP short percent of float has risen 6.45% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 18.04 million shares sold short, which is 1.32% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.44 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nPepsiCo Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for PepsiCo has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing PepsiCo's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, PepsiCo's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 8.02%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.",

            "content": "It is virtually impossible not to look at Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) if you are considering buying PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) and vice versa. The two companies are iconic and globally dominant beverage giants. The price charts of the two stocks, however, look very different today. If you are a long-term dividend investor, PepsiCo looks like it is the most attractive after Coca-Cola's recent rally. Here's why.\n\nWhat do Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do?\n\nCoca-Cola makes a wide range of beverages. Basically, that's all it does. The company does this very well, with a massive global distribution network, research and development acumen, and marketing skills that place it in the pantheon of the consumer staples sector. It also has the scale to act as an industry consolidator, buying up companies with attractive products and growing them by simply plugging the new products into Coca-Cola's distribution system. It is a one-trick pony, but it is a very good trick.\n\nPepsiCo makes a wide range of beverages. It also makes a wide range of snacks and packaged food products. It has a massive global distribution network, a strong research and development department, and a marketing team every bit as good as Coca-Cola's. As for scale, PepsiCo has a long history of buying smaller brands and expanding them, just like Coca-Cola. PepsiCo's most recent endeavor on this front is Mexican American food maker Siete, which offers both snacks and packaged food items.\n\nPepsiCo may not be as dominant a beverage company as Coca-Cola; Pepsi-Cola has dropped to third in the cola wars. However, it is the No. 1 snack brand and a very solid No. 2 in the broader beverage space. In packaged food, it holds its own against larger peers. In other words, it is a well-run and diversified food company. Investors who like diversified businesses will probably prefer PepsiCo based on this fact alone.\n\nThat said, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are Dividend Kings, which speaks to the strength of their underlying businesses. Coca-Cola's dividend streak is a little longer, but a company simply can't increase its dividend for 50+ years without having a good business plan that gets executed well year in and year out. These two consumer staples companies stand toe-to-toe as businesses, with the exception of diversification.\n\nCoca-Cola is doing better right now\n\nThat said, every company that exists for long enough will go through both good periods and bad periods. Right now, PepsiCo is facing some business weakness while Coca-Cola is executing better. Investors are aware of the dichotomy and buy and sell accordingly. If you look at the chart below, it almost seems like the two companies switched places. But short-term business gyrations aren't what long-term investors should be worried about. The bigger question is whether or not the company, be it Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, is still well run.\n\nThe answer is that both of these consumer staples giants remain well run, but Coca-Cola is just doing a little better right now. The problem with PepsiCo is really a relative one since it was able to push through large price hikes when inflation took hold following the coronavirus pandemic. That boost is now over and it \"only\" grew organic sales 2% and core earnings 9% in 2024. It is calling for similar performance in 2025, with low-single-digit sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth. That's actually not bad in the consumer staples sector, which is known for being a slow and steady performer.\n\nBased on that news, however, investors have punished the stock, which is down around 20% from its peak in 2023. The drop has pushed PepsiCo's yield up toward the highest levels in the company's history. And its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are below their five-year averages. This is a well-run company that looks like it has been placed on the sale rack.\n\nBy comparison, Coca-Cola's stock has rallied in recent months. Its dividend yield is nowhere near the historical highs for the stock. And the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are now both above their five-year averages. Prior to the rally, Coca-Cola was more compellingly priced, but now it looks a little expensive. That makes PepsiCo look all the more attractive, given their direct competition in the beverage sector.\n\nThink long term and buy PepsiCo over Coca-Cola\n\nNone of this is meant to suggest that Coca-Cola is a bad company. In fact, it is a very good company. It just isn't as compellingly valued as PepsiCo, an equally good company, is right now. The reason has more to do with the myopic vision of Wall Street, which focuses too much on the short term. If you think in decades, particularly if you are an income investor, PepsiCo and its historically high 3.5% yield look even more attractive following Coca-Cola's price rally.",

The improvements are in anticipation of commemorating the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.\n\nThe Senate House was the 18th century home of the Van Gaasbeek family and the first meeting place of the New York State Senate in 1777. Adopted as an historic site in 1887, the Senate House quickly became a vital community museum and features exhibits relating to Kingston\u2019s history.\n\nThe $1.8 million preservation work involves both the historic Senate House and the 1927 Museum Building, centering around the preservation of the structures to stop water damage.\n\nThe Senate House will receive a roof replacement, including framing and dormer window repairs, and exterior masonry restoration. The Museum Building will receive roof and window repair along with repair of the front porch. Both buildings will be tied into a new system designed to improved site drainage. All the work will be period-appropriate and adhere to strict historic preservation standards. Work is slated to continue through the remainder of 2025. Due to the project, some programs, tours, and education programs may be unavailable during construction.\n\n\u201cThis is a necessary project that strikes at the heart of our agency,\u201d said OPRHP Commissioner Pro Tempore Randy Simons. \u201cAs we approach America\u2019s 250th anniversary celebration, Senate House reinforces the importance of all our historical sites and what we can learn from them. This historic house in modern-day Kingston offers a story that connects us to our lives today. It\u2019s something we can see and touch as part of New York State\u2019s diverse history. Rehabilitation projects like these are vital and we are proud to see these investments help keep our historic structures alive and thriving in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThe Senate House also serves as the focal point of the annual Burning of Kingston commemoration reenacting the American Revolutionary War events of 1777, and the life and times of Kingston\u2019s people. Programming highlights the human impact of war, the perseverance and resilience of a community, and offers an opportunity to understand the larger historical arc of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nFrito-Lay Shutters PopCorners Plant In Liberty, NY; Lays Off 287 Workers\n\nAll 287 workers at the Frito-Lay manufacturing factory in Sullivan County, New York, will be terminated by June 6, according to a WARN notice filed with the New York State Department of Labor. PepsiCo is closing the factory at 89 Mill Street in Liberty, New York, that manufactures PopCorners snacks.\n\nLayoffs are scheduled to begin May 21. PepsiCo said it will be working with the employees as well as local community officials to support the workers\u2019 transition. Workers will be paid through May 20.\n\nThe closure is part of a series of plant closures for Pepsico which shuttered a Quaker Oats factory in Danville, Illinois, and bottling plants in Cincinnati; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Atlanta.\n\nPepsico acquired the Liberty plant in 2019 as part of its acquisition of BFY Foods, the original maker of PopCorners.\n\n\u201cThis plant has played a vital role in producing our beloved PopCorners brand, but the pace of growth for this product line paired with broader industry pace of growth has made it difficult to sustain the site\u2019s long-term viability,\u201d PepsiCo Foods U.S. said in a statement. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the contributions of our Liberty employees, and this decision does not diminish the value of their hard work and dedication.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, Sullivan County Legislature Chair Nadia Rajsz and Village of Liberty Mayor Joan said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned about PepsiCo\u2019s decision to shutter their Liberty food manufacturing facility, which has been an integral part of our community for decades and employs hundreds of locals. This action will have many impacts, which we intend to sort out with PepsiCo\u2019s assistance in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nHousing Options Considered For Kingston Business Park\n\nThe City of Kingston has contracted with the firms of Buro Happold, MVRDV and Assemblage to provide architectural, design and landscaping concepts for potential housing and/or mixed-used developments in the Kingston Business Park.\n\nThe City of Kingston and the Kingston Local Development Corporation (KLDC) are testing the feasibility of adding housing to the Kingston Business Park, the 107-acre property located at 370-384 Delaware Avenue, currently owned by the KLDC.\n\nThe Business Park, first established in 1998, was originally designed to accommodate four to five light manufacturing facilities totaling 300,000-500,000 square feet, utilizing approximately 40-50 acres for commercial development. Currently, there are two active commercial tenants: Howmet Aerospace and Community Manufacturing Solutions.\n\nAn initial site analysis reviewed the undeveloped parcels in the Business Park, exploring possible types of residential and/or mixed-used development under the City\u2019s new form-based zoning code. Infrastructure to support the development of residential units is already in place.\n\nThe study was funded by an allocation of the City of Kingston\u2019s American Rescue Plan funding from the federal government.\n\nKingston currently has several hundred new housing units planned, including 200 units on Garraghan Drive, 164 units at Golden Hill, 70 units at 615 Broadway, and 100 units at the Barrel Factory site.\n\nThe conceptual plan for the Business Park includes multiple housing and mixed-use options. Challenges include wetlands and core forest protection, limits imposed by steep slopes, and environmental issues stemming from the site\u2019s mining history.",

So, we are not going to be investment shy. We are going to be investing forward to drive that growth because it is there for us to capture the (market),\" he said.While India currently ranks among PepsiCo\u2019s top 15 global markets, Kotecha expects it to move up the list, though he refrained from specifying a timeline. The company re-entered India in the 1990s after a 28-year gap, and today, it is considered one of PepsiCo\u2019s 13 to 15 \"anchor markets\" worldwide, regions identified as key growth engines for the next five to seven years.PepsiCo aligns with the Indian government\u2019s 2030 economic vision, Kotecha noted, describing India as \"one of the most stable economies and a growth engine.\" He added, \"We have been investing for nearly 30 years, but now we need to accelerate that investment.\"The company is operating under three strategic pillars, \"faster, stronger, better,\" and has divided India into nine clusters based on regional taste preferences. Sustainability is also a key focus, with efforts to implement environmentally friendly solutions and build local capabilities.Last month, PepsiCo reported double-digit organic revenue growth in India, with increased market share in both savoury snacks and beverages. While Kotecha did not commit to a specific timeline for reaching $2 billion (around Rs 17,000 crore) in revenue, he called it an \"aspiration\" that could be realised if infrastructure and market conditions align.In 2023, PepsiCo India recorded over Rs 8,200 crore in revenue over nine months due to a fiscal year change, and it has maintained strong double-digit growth since. The company has already invested Rs 3,500-4,000 crore in India over the past three years and is set to continue expanding. A new plant near Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, is operational, while another facility in Assam is expected to start by the end of the year.\"Our investment strategy remains forward-looking. We see a tremendous opportunity and will continue investing to drive growth,\" Kotecha said.PepsiCo\u2019s bottling partner, Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), is also making significant investments.\"I think they have close to 40-odd plants. They have just invested in capacities, increasing by 25 per cent this year. They are continuing that type of investment to grow with us. Our partnership is pretty strong to enable that growth. Both of us feel very good about this,\" Kotecha said, emphasising the strong partnership between the two companies.On the growing competition in the Indian beverage market, particularly from Reliance\u2019s Campa Cola, Kotecha welcomed the rivalry, saying that competition helps expand the category.\u201cEven before Pepsi and Coke were there, there were a lot of local, regional players,\" he said, \"Now Campa has also come with a lot of flair and expense and all. So our belief is the category will then grow and the consumption will grow.\"He pointed out that India\u2019s per capita beverage consumption remains low, even compared to neighbouring countries like Pakistan. \"Our focus is on understanding consumer needs and playing to our strengths,\" he said.PepsiCo\u2019s beverage portfolio in India includes brands like Pepsi, 7UP, Mountain Dew, Sting, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Slice. Its snack segment features Kurkure, Lay\u2019s, Quaker, and Doritos.In 2023, around 80 per cent of its revenue came from the food segment, while beverages contributed the remaining 20 per cent, largely managed by VBL.The Indian beverage market, currently valued at $12 billion, is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10-11 per cent. With ongoing investments and increasing consumer demand, PepsiCo is well-positioned to capitalise on this expanding market.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Companies that Just Raised their Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other companies that just raised their dividends.\n\nDividend stocks have been attracting investor interest for quite some time, consistently delivering strong performances that highlight their long-term appeal. This growing investor preference has led many major technology companies to introduce dividend payments. As a result, dividends are no longer limited to traditional value stocks, with growth-oriented firms also emerging as significant dividend payers.\n\nHistorical trends show that dividend-paying stocks have consistently outperformed other asset classes across various market cycles. A report from T. Rowe Price highlights that dividends have made up nearly one-third of total equity returns for US stocks since 1926. During the period from 1980 to 2019, which saw a decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the broader market\u2019s overall returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nBy the end of September 2024, approximately 80% of companies in the broader market were distributing dividends\u2014a proportion that has remained relatively steady over the past decade. Notably, the technology sector represented nearly 24% of dividend-paying companies, a significant rise from 13% ten years ago. Other industries, such as healthcare and industrials, also experienced an uptick in firms offering dividends. This broader availability of dividend-paying stocks has provided income-focused investors with more opportunities to gain exposure to high-growth and innovative businesses. Given these developments, analysts maintain a positive outlook for dividend stocks as they head into 2025.\n\nDividend growth is closely tied to a strong earnings season. In February, the broader market struggled, declining by over 2% as concerns about inflation, upcoming tariffs under former President Donald Trump, and escalating geopolitical tensions weighed on investor sentiment. On February 28, the major index briefly dipped into negative territory for 2025. However, corporate earnings reports for the fourth quarter have provided a fresh catalyst for the market.\n\nAs of February 28, nearly 97% of companies in the broader market had reported earnings, with over 75% surpassing analyst expectations, according to FactSet. Many of these companies delivered encouraging news for income-focused investors. In the week ending February 25, data from JPMorgan showed that 20 companies announced dividend increases, with no reports of dividend cuts or suspensions during that period. This is positive for income investors, as dividend growth is always a welcomed development for them.",

The two companies are iconic and globally dominant beverage giants. The price charts of the two stocks, however, look very different today. If you are a long-term dividend investor, PepsiCo looks like it is the most attractive after Coca-Cola's recent rally. Here's why.\n\nWhat do Coca-Cola and PepsiCo do?\n\nCoca-Cola makes a wide range of beverages. Basically, that's all it does. The company does this very well, with a massive global distribution network, research and development acumen, and marketing skills that place it in the pantheon of the consumer staples sector. It also has the scale to act as an industry consolidator, buying up companies with attractive products and growing them by simply plugging the new products into Coca-Cola's distribution system. It is a one-trick pony, but it is a very good trick.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.

It also makes a wide range of snacks and packaged food products. It has a massive global distribution network, a strong research and development department, and a marketing team every bit as good as Coca-Cola's. As for scale, PepsiCo has a long history of buying smaller brands and expanding them, just like Coca-Cola. PepsiCo's most recent endeavor on this front is Mexican American food maker Siete, which offers both snacks and packaged food items.\n\nPepsiCo may not be as dominant a beverage company as Coca-Cola; Pepsi-Cola has dropped to third in the cola wars. However, it is the No. 1 snack brand and a very solid No. 2 in the broader beverage space. In packaged food, it holds its own against larger peers. In other words, it is a well-run and diversified food company. Investors who like diversified businesses will probably prefer PepsiCo based on this fact alone.\n\nThat said, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are Dividend Kings, which speaks to the strength of their underlying businesses. Coca-Cola's dividend streak is a little longer, but a company simply can't increase its dividend for 50+ years without having a good business plan that gets executed well year in and year out. These two consumer staples companies stand toe-to-toe as businesses, with the exception of diversification.\n\nCoca-Cola is doing better right now\n\nThat said, every company that exists for long enough will go through both good periods and bad periods. Right now, PepsiCo is facing some business weakness while Coca-Cola is executing better. Investors are aware of the dichotomy and buy and sell accordingly. If you look at the chart below, it almost seems like the two companies switched places. But short-term business gyrations aren't what long-term investors should be worried about. The bigger question is whether or not the company, be it Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, is still well run.\n\nPEP Chart\n\nPEP data by YCharts\n\nThe answer is that both of these consumer staples giants remain well run, but Coca-Cola is just doing a little better right now. The problem with PepsiCo is really a relative one since it was able to push through large price hikes when inflation took hold following the coronavirus pandemic. That boost is now over and it \"only\" grew organic sales 2% and core earnings 9% in 2024. It is calling for similar performance in 2025, with low-single-digit sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth. That's actually not bad in the consumer staples sector, which is known for being a slow and steady performer.\n\nBased on that news, however, investors have punished the stock, which is down around 20% from its peak in 2023. The drop has pushed PepsiCo's yield up toward the highest levels in the company's history. And its price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are below their five-year averages. This is a well-run company that looks like it has been placed on the sale rack.\n\nBy comparison, Coca-Cola's stock has rallied in recent months. Its dividend yield is nowhere near the historical highs for the stock. And the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are now both above their five-year averages. Prior to the rally, Coca-Cola was more compellingly priced, but now it looks a little expensive. That makes PepsiCo look all the more attractive, given their direct competition in the beverage sector.\n\nThink long term and buy PepsiCo over Coca-Cola\n\nNone of this is meant to suggest that Coca-Cola is a bad company. In fact, it is a very good company. It just isn't as compellingly valued as PepsiCo, an equally good company, is right now. The reason has more to do with the myopic vision of Wall Street, which focuses too much on the short term. If you think in decades, particularly if you are an income investor, PepsiCo and its historically high 3.5% yield look even more attractive following Coca-Cola's price rally.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Updated on March 7th, 2025 by Nathan Parsh\n\nWe believe the Dividend Aristocrats are the \u201ccream of the crop\u201d of the U.S. stock market. The Dividend Aristocrats are a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years, among other requirements.\n\nWith this in mind, we created a list of all 69 Dividend Aristocrats, along with important financial metrics such as dividend yields and price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nYou can download your free list of all 69 Dividend Aristocrats by clicking on the link below:\n\nDisclaimer: Sure Dividend is not affiliated with S&P Global in any way. S&P Global owns and maintains The Dividend Aristocrats Index. The information in this article and downloadable spreadsheet is based on Sure Dividend\u2019s own review, summary, and analysis of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) and other sources, and is meant to help individual investors better understand this ETF and the index upon which it is based. None of the information in this article or spreadsheet is official data from S&P Global. Consult S&P Global for official information.\n\nWe review all the Dividend Aristocrats each year. Next up, we will review the food and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nThe stock offers a solid 3.6% dividend yield and has increased its dividend for over 50 years in a row. The company\u2019s dividend is very safe, and the stock is suitable for risk-averse income investors.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s valuation is well below its historical average, and it continues to post solid results.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nPepsi-Cola was created in the late 1890s by Caleb Bradham, a North Carolina pharmacist. Meanwhile, Frito-Lay, Inc. was formed in 1961 from the merger of Frito Company and the H. W. Lay Company. In its current form, PepsiCo came together as a result of the 1965 merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay.\n\nToday, PepsiCo is a global food and beverage giant with a market capitalization above $215 billion and approximately $92 billion in annual revenue.\n\nIts business is split roughly 60-40 in terms of food and beverage revenue. It is also balanced geographically between the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nPepsiCo has a large portfolio and owns many popular brands. Some of the company\u2019s major brands include Pepsi and Mountain Dew sodas and non-sparkling beverages like Pure Leaf, Tropicana, Gatorade, and bottled water.\n\nIn addition to PepsiCo\u2019s core beverage brands, it also has a large snacks business under the Frito-Lay brand. The company has also built a portfolio of healthier foods, including Quaker, Naked, and Sabra.\n\nOn February 4th, 2025, PepsiCo reported fourth-quarter and full-year results for the period ending December 31st, 2024. For the quarter, revenue decreased 0.3% to $27.8 billion, which was $110 million below estimates. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.96 compared favorably to $1.78 in the prior year and was $0.02 better than expected.\n\nFor the year, revenue grew 0.4% to $91.9 billion while adjusted earnings-per-share of $8.16 compared to $7.62 in 2023. Currency exchange reduced revenue by 2.0% and earnings-per-share by 4%.\n\nOrganic sales were up 2.1% for the quarter and 2.0% for the year. For the quarter, volume for both food and beverage were up 1%. PepsiCo Beverages North America\u2019s revenue was unchanged, but volume fell 3%. Frito-Lay North America declined 2% while volume was also down 3%. Quaker Foods North America was down 2%.\n\nPepsiCo provided an outlook for 2025 as well, with the company expecting mid-single-digit growth for adjusted earnings-per-share growth.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nPepsiCo has a long history of steady growth. Even in a challenging environment due to declining soda consumption, PepsiCo has continued its consistent growth.\n\nWe believe PepsiCo will generate 6% adjusted earnings-per-share growth per year over the next five years. Going forward, two of PepsiCo\u2019s most promising catalysts are growth in healthier foods and beverages and emerging markets.\n\nLarge soda companies like PepsiCo have had to adapt to a more health-conscious consumer. To do this, PepsiCo has shifted its portfolio toward healthier foods that are resonating more strongly with changing consumer preferences.\n\nIn addition, PepsiCo has a huge growth opportunity in emerging markets like China, Africa, India, and Latin America.\n\nSource: Investor Presentation\n\nThese are under-developed regions of the world with large consumer populations and high economic growth rates.\n\nInternational markets (particularly emerging ones) have been a growth driver over the past few years.\n\nLast quarter, revenue in Europe was up 7%, aided largely by a 3% increase in beverage volume and a 1% improvement in food volume. Revenue in Latin America increased 4%, Africa/Middle East/South Asia was up 14%, and the Asia Pacific/Australia/New Zealand/China region grew 1%.\n\nCompetitive Advantages & Recession Performance\n\nPepsiCo has numerous competitive advantages, including strong brands and a global scale. In all, PepsiCo has ~20 individual brands that each collect at least $1 billion in annual revenue. Strong brands give PepsiCo optimal shelf space at retailers and pricing power.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s financial strength also allows the company to invest in research and development and advertising to retain its competitive advantages.\n\nFor example, PepsiCo invests billions each year in research and development to innovate new products and packaging designs. In addition, PepsiCo regularly spends more than $2 billion each year on advertising to maintain market share and build brand equity with consumers.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s competitive advantages and strong brands make the company highly profitable, even during recessions. Food and beverages always retain a certain level of demand, which is why the company held up so well during the Great Recession.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s earnings-per-share throughout the Great Recession of 2007-2009 are listed below:\n\n2007 earnings-per-share of $3.34\n\n2008 earnings-per-share of $3.21 (3.9% decline)\n\n2009 earnings-per-share of $3.77 (17% increase)\n\n2010 earnings-per-share of $3.91 (3.7% increase)\n\nAs you can see, PepsiCo\u2019s earnings-per-share declined only modestly in 2008. The company then increased earnings by nearly 20% in 2009, which is very impressive. Earnings continued to grow once the recession ended.\n\nThe company reported strong growth in 2020 and 2021 when the coronavirus pandemic sent the U.S. economy into a recession. Therefore, PepsiCo is a recession-resistant business.\n\nValuation & Expected Returns\n\nWe expect PepsiCo to generate earnings per share of $8.59 for 2025. Based on this, the stock trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3. Our fair value estimate is a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.0. Therefore, PEP stock appears undervalued. Multiple expansion could add 5.6% to yearly annual returns over the next five years.\n\nEarnings-per-share growth and the stock\u2019s dividend yield will also drive total returns. We expect PepsiCo to grow earnings-per-share each year by 6%. In addition, PepsiCo also has a 3.6% current dividend yield.\n\nThe combination of valuation changes, earnings growth, and dividends results in total expected returns of 14.6% per year over the next five years.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s dividend is secure, with a projected payout ratio of about 66% for 2025. This gives PepsiCo enough room to continue increasing the dividend at a rate in line with the growth rate of its adjusted EPS.\n\nGiven the total return potential and the company\u2019s overall quality, we rate shares of PepsiCo as a buy.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPepsiCo is a very strong business with several category-leading brands. Investing heavily in new products and acquisitions will likely continue growing sales and earnings for many years.\n\nShareholders should continue to benefit from PepsiCo\u2019s strong business through annual dividend increases. Few other companies in the consumer staples sector can match its dividend growth history. PepsiCo recently achieved Dividend King status in February 2022.\n\nWe believe that PepsiCo remains a valuable holding for a dividend growth portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, the following Sure Dividend databases contain the most reliable dividend growers in our investment universe:\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for stocks with unique dividend characteristics, consider the following Sure Dividend databases:\n\nThe Complete List of Monthly Dividend Stocks: stocks that pay dividends each month, for 12 payments over the year.\n\nThe Blue Chip Stocks List: this database contains stocks that qualify as either Dividend Achievers, Dividend Aristocrats, or Dividend Kings.\n\nThe major domestic stock market indices are another solid resource for finding investment ideas.

Ltd. shared on Wednesday a Coca-Cola\u2019s LinkedIn job listing for a marketing role with a little sly and tongue-in-cheek remark.\n\nCalling it a \u2018Career Alert\u2019, Rohilla wrote, \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s ad, Coca-Cola is now hiring for Director - Marketing & Creative! Meanwhile, over at PepsiCo India\u2026 they\u2019re just sipping their cola, watching the drama unfold, and proving once again why they\u2019re the real MVPs \u2013 from Half Time to Anytime!\u201d\n\nRohilla also tagged PepsiCo India in his post, which used the campaign hashtag \u2013 #AnytimeIsPepsiTime.\n\nIndustry observers hailed it as a 'marketing coup,' with one noting, \u201cPepsi landed the first blow in this latest round of the cola clash.\u201d\n\nThe ad, which temporarily rebranded the newspaper as \u201cAny Times of India,\u201d positioned Pepsi as the drink for every moment \u2014 a cheeky rebuttal to Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201cHalf Time\u201d campaign, rolled out last month to tie the brand to high-energy sports breaks during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.\n\nRohilla\u2019s jab exploded online, with netizens reveling in the drama.\n\nReacting to the post, a Gurugram-based entrepreneur Mayank Agarwal wrote, \u201cThe Cola Wars keep getting better! Keep them coming\u2026\u201d\n\nAgarwal also posted a short analysis praising the campaign for its smart positioning.\n\nAnother marketing buff Roma Punjabi called it hilarious.\n\nSharing Rohilla\u2019s post, marketing veteran Akash Sahu quipped asking if the job posting was a correlation or causation.\n\nThe episode underscores Pepsi\u2019s decades-long tradition of trolling Coca-Cola, a tactic that traces back to its iconic 1996 \u201cNothing Official About It\u201d campaign.\n\nThat effort, featuring cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, mocked Coke\u2019s official Cricket World Cup sponsorship with irreverent flair, cementing Pepsi\u2019s reputation as the fizzy provocateur.\n\nAs BestMediaInfo.com noted, \u201cFrom witty one-liners to celebrity-fuelled rivalries, the battle between these two cola giants has defined India\u2019s marketing landscape for decades\u2014and the latest round is just another chapter in their fizz-filled feud.\u201d\n\nCrafted by Havas Creative India, Pepsi\u2019s move was lauded by Anupama Ramaswamy, Chief Creative Officer and Joint MD at Havas, who said, \u201cWith the brand\u2019s challenger mindset at the core, we decided to seize the day. Back in the 1950s, Pepsi had said, \u201cAny weather is Pepsi weather.\u201d Carrying that spirit forward, we conceptualised, \u201cAny time is Pepsi time.\u201d Because Pepsi is for every moment that matters.\u201d\n\nPepsi\u2019s latest campaign arrives amid a heating cola war, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 and an early summer onset intensifying the stakes in the Rs 1.37 lakh crore non-alcoholic beverage market.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s \u201cHalf Time\u201d push aimed to own India\u2019s sports-obsessed culture, but Pepsi\u2019s counter has shifted the narrative.\n\nMeanwhile, market dynamics are shifting.\n\nReliance\u2019s Campa Cola, priced aggressively at Rs 10 for 200 ml against Coke and Pepsi\u2019s Rs 20 for 250 ml, has replaced Thums Up as IPL 2025\u2019s Co-Presenting Sponsor, adding pressure on the big two.",

            "content": "PepsiCo recently increased visibility by renewing and expanding its partnership with the MSG Family of Companies, while also appointing Om Jha as Director of Global Media Capabilities. Over the last month, PepsiCo's stock has shown resilience with a 2.4% rise, contrasting with a broader market dip of 1.9%, partly driven by uncertainties over U.S. tariffs impacting tech stocks. This move can be attributed to PepsiCo's robust corporate strategy, including a 7% dividend increase and the execution of share repurchases, which enhance shareholder value. Additionally, PepsiCo's strategic placement of its products at prime venues under the new MSG partnership may have bolstered market confidence. The company's solid Q4 earnings, showing increased net income and EPS despite slight sales dips, further strengthen its position in the market. In conjunction with favorable investor sentiment towards PepsiCo\u2019s growth initiatives, these factors have likely buffered its share performance amid broader market uncertainties.\n\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of PepsiCo.\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the past five years, PepsiCo has delivered a total return of 36.01%, highlighting its capacity to generate shareholder value. This performance can be partially attributed to consistent earnings growth, with profits rising 5.6% annually during this period. Additionally, PepsiCo's commitment to expanding consumer relationships is evident in strategic partnerships, such as the 10-year agreement with Subway initiated in March 2024, aligning with significant brand presence expansions.\n\nThe collaboration with Madison Square Garden in March 2025 further exemplifies PepsiCo's market penetration efforts. Despite setbacks in labor relations and legal challenges in December 2024, PepsiCo maintained investor interest through continued dividend increases and share buybacks. These corporate actions and partnerships have secured its strong standing against broader market challenges, even as PepsiCo underperformed the US market's 14% return over the past year. This stability underscores its resilient business model and strategic adaptability.\n\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Ramon Laguarta, the Chairman & CEO recently netted about US$7.7m selling shares at an average price of US$155. However, it's crucial to note that they remain very much invested in the stock and that sale only reduced their holding by 9.6%.\n\nPepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Ramon Laguarta was the biggest sale of PepsiCo shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$154. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nIn the last year PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of PepsiCo\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$289m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At PepsiCo Tell Us?\n\nInsiders sold PepsiCo shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that PepsiCo is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of PepsiCo.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

But did you know that Pepsi, the second largest market leader in the global soft-drink industry, started out as a homemade concoction made by pharmacist who sold it at his smalltime drugstore in New Bern, a sleepy little town in California, United States?\n\nLet us delve into the humble beginnings of Pepsi and its phenomenal rise to become a global leader in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) market in over 200 countries worldwide.\n\nPepsi: History and origins\n\nPepsi humble beginnings are rooted in New Bern, California, where Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist by profession, first concocted what would later become the refreshing cola loved by billions across the globe, as a medicinal drink to cure indigestion. In 1893, Caleb prepared the concoction by mixing sugar, caramel, nutmeg, lemon and cola nuts in water and started selling it at his drugstore under the name \u2018Brad\u2019s Drink\u2019.\n\nThe pharmacist touted his homemade blend as a \u2018medicinal\u2019 drink which improves digestion, however, the drink soon became immensely popular and with sales going through the roof, Bradham mulled the idea of coming up with a catchy name for his concoction.\n\nIn 1898, Caleb Bradham settled on the name \u2018Pepsi-Cola\u2019, after the digestive enzyme pepsin, and introduced the beverage in the market as a \u201chealthy cola\u201d, that he claimed had digestive benefits. Notably, despite its name being derived from pepsin, the beverage\u2019s initial formula did not include the digestive enzyme, but was made from sugar and vanilla.\n\nBankruptcy and revival\n\nDuring its formative years, Pepsi could not replicate its initial success, and eventually went bankrupt in 1923. However, Charles Guth purchased the company and revived it by reformulating the beverage. During the Great Depression, Guth introduced a 12-ounce Pepsi bottle which made the drink immensely popular. He also employed clever marketing strategies like the \u201cNickel, Nickel\u201d jingle, that doubled Pepsi\u2019s sales in a short period.\n\nThe iconic Pepsi logo\n\nAkin to its formula, Pepsi\u2019s iconic logo, has undergone sweeping changes since its launch, initially featuring the same red color as that of its competitor, Coca Cola. In 1940, the Pepsi Cola logo was designed with a strange font, but the ultimately in 1950, the company came up with the first variation of Pepsi\u2019s modern-day logo by adding the blue and white on the bottle cap.\n\nOver time, this logo evolved into the iconic Pepsi logo even as the beverage\u2019s name was officially shortened to Pepsi in 1961, ditching the cola part, in order to stand out from rival brand Coca Cola.\n\nThe rise of PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo, the company that own Pepsi, is a global leader in the FMCG sector, boasting a market cap of $211.12 billion, and spread globally across over 200 countries.\n\nPrimarily known for its carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, that includes beloved drinks like Mirinda, Ocean Spray, Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Lipton, 7up, Tropicana, AMP energy, PepsiCo has expanded its portfolio with its popular snack brands such as Ruffles, Fritos, Cheetos, Cracker Jack, Sun Chips, Tostitos, and Lays.\n\nToday, PepsiCo is global powerhouse in the FMCG space, with presence in Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, China, Africa, India, Middle East and South East Asia, among other countries.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

            "content": "Investors who have watched PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) for years waiting for a good time to buy the stock have that opportunity right now. That problem is getting past the fact that the stock price has plunged more than 20% from its highs in 2023. But you have to get past the fear that there is something wrong with the business because there really isn't.\n\nHere are three reasons to buy PepsiCo stock today. If you wait until some distant tomorrow, you might miss the opportunity.\n\n1. PepsiCo is an industry giant with a great record\n\nPepsiCo is a Dividend King with 53 annual dividend increases under its belt. The most recent hike came with the announcement of its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings. The increase this year was a reasonable 5%. A company can't build a dividend record like that without having a good business plan that gets executed well in both good markets and bad.\n\nSimply put, PepsiCo's dividend history tells you that it is a well-run company. But what does it actually do? It's a consumer staples giant, which means that its products tend to be bought regularly regardless of the economic situation consumers are facing. What it actually makes is food, which is a basic necessity of life.\n\nIts portfolio of iconic brands, which have many loyal fans, spans across beverages (Pepsi), snacks (Frito-Lay), and packaged food items (Quaker Oats). Moreover, it operates on a global scale. So, all in, PepsiCo operates in a reliable segment of the stock market and it has a diversified business.\n\nThis is the kind of company that even a conservative investor could buy and comfortably hold for decades.\n\n2. PepsiCo's dividend yield is historically high\n\nSticking with the dividend theme, PepsiCo's dividend yield is currently 3.5%. That's above the market's 1.2% average, above the average consumer staples stock's 2.8%, and near the highest levels in PepsiCo's history. Using dividend yield as a rough gauge of valuation, PepsiCo's stock looks cheap right now.\n\nThat's backed up by more traditional valuation metrics. For example, the price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow, and price-to-book value ratios are all below their five-year averages. This isn't one of those times when you have to try to figure out if a stock is cheap or not. PepsiCo is very clearly on sale.\n\n3. PepsiCo's 2025 guidance was light, but still not bad\n\nThe problem that Wall Street seems to have with PepsiCo right now is that it had a few really great years during the worst years of the coronavirus pandemic. Its growth was driven by its ability to pass input cost inflation through to consumers. That Goldilocks period came to an end in 2024.\n\nBut what exactly does that mean? In 2024, PepsiCo's organic sales grew 2% and earnings rose 6%. That's actually a solid performance for a consumer staples maker given that the industry is basically known for being a slow and steady grower. For 2025, the company projects low-single-digit sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth. That's basically a repeat of 2024 -- so another year of reasonable growth. The key for long-term investors is that slow and steady isn't really bad news, particularly if you think in decades and not days.\n\nDon't pass up this opportunity to buy PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo's stock has fallen into its own personal bear market. The business continues to operate well, so there's really nothing major wrong with the company. The problem is that Wall Street is driven by emotion in the short term and PepsiCo isn't doing as well as it was a few years ago. Every company goes through business swings like this and, really, PepsiCo's fundamental story hasn't changed. If you are a dividend growth investor or even an income-focused dividend investor, PepsiCo looks like it's on sale right now. Don't miss the chance to add this iconic Dividend King to your portfolio.",

            "content": "In the latest trading session, PepsiCo (PEP) closed at $153.88, marking a -0.2% move from the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.12%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 1.14%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.46%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 7.46% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 6.52% and the S&P 500's loss of 4.13% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.53, down 4.97% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $17.8 billion, reflecting a 2.45% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.30 per share and revenue of $91.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1.72% and -0.11%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.55% lower. Right now, PepsiCo possesses a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nIn terms of valuation, PepsiCo is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.58. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 19.11 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that PEP currently trades at a PEG ratio of 3.22. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.59 as of yesterday's close.",

This expansion is expected to double the volume of reusables at OCC, reinforcing the commitment to making reusable solutions accessible at high-traffic event spaces.\n\nBuilding on its success as the first convention center to launch an initiative with a reuse service provider in 2023, OCC is taking the next step toward waste diversion by introducing reusable soda cups supported by PepsiCo and rolling out reusable food baskets at primary restaurants and cafes. This will be PepsiCo\u2019s fourth reuse project with Bold Reuse, demonstrating a growing commitment to advancing reuse initiatives at large venues.\n\nIn 2023, Bold Reuse and OCC launched a reuse pilot, offering reusable trays to guests at select restaurants and cafes. The program has been a growing success, with a 93% average return rate since the system launch and over 39,385 single-use trays diverted from landfills. The expanded program aims to continuously reduce waste generated at OCC, which welcomes millions of visitors annually. Beginning in early March, guests purchasing meals at several restaurant and cafe locations will receive their food in reusable trays, and all poured PepsiCo Beverages will be served in reusable cups. This initiative is another way PepsiCo is making an impact through its pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) program, which strives to inspire positive change for the planet and people.\n\n\u201cAt the Oregon Convention Center, sustainability is at the core of everything we do, said OCC Executive Director Cindy Wallace. \u201cBy expanding our partnership with Bold Reuse and PepsiCo, we\u2019re setting a new standard for waste reduction in the events industry and demonstrating how large-scale venues can successfully implement reuse.\u201d\n\nAs a national leader in reusable packaging solutions, Bold Reuse will manage the supply, sanitization, and logistics of the reusable cups and trays, ensuring a smooth transition and high-quality experience for guests and event organizers. The company\u2019s expertise has been instrumental in making reuse scalable and accessible for large venues.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to continue our work with the Oregon Convention Center and continue to prove that reuse does work at scale,\u201d said Jocelyn Quarrell, co-founder of Bold Reuse. \u201cBy collaborating with forward-thinking organizations like the Oregon Convention Center, Levy, and PepsiCo, we\u2019re setting a new precedent for how large venues think about waste.\u201d\n\nThe LEED\u00ae Platinum-certified Oregon Convention Center is a proud leader in sustainable events, allowing guests to be part of sustainability just by being there.

            "content": "SAN JUAN, PR \u2013 Ad fraud hasn\u2019t gone away. Still in 2025, the problem is costing advertisers billions of dollars every year.\n\nSome studies estimate that ad fraud now costs $30 billion in the US. Globally, the figure is a staggering $100 to $120 billion, according to Zach Lain, director of global data partnerships at PepsiCo.\n\nThe problem is prevalent in the rapidly growing connected TV (CTV) space due to technical infrastructure not built with anti-fraud measures at its core, a complex and opaque supply chain with numerous intermediaries, and strong financial incentives that can perpetuate fraud. Lain wants action.\n\nFraudsters exploiting new technologies\n\nFraudsters are using new technologies in creative ways to spoof impressions and generate fake traffic that can be hidden as legitimate. Lain cited a recent case where bad actors were spoofing $40-$50 CTV impressions, but were actually running the ad on a single pixel on a smart refrigerator.\n\n\u201cThis is mind-boggling to me. Crazy stuff,\u201d Lain said in this video interview with Beet.TV\n\n\u201cWhen we find fraud, we as an industry don\u2019t really know what to do. We play Whack-A-Mole here. We don\u2019t really speak in a cohesive voice. We don\u2019t have any way to impose penalties or clawbacks or any sort of punitive measure at scale here. So what we\u2019re seeing is fraud really metastasize into CTV.\u201d\n\nWhile working with independent verification companies like DoubleVerify is critical, Lain emphasized that the entire industry, including the buy-side, sell-side, and agencies, must come together to combat ad fraud effectively on CTV.\n\nMoving beyond best practices to concrete actions\n\nHe suggested the industry needs to move beyond guidelines and best practices to concise and concrete actions to reduce ad fraud on CTV.\n\nLain stressed that self-regulation will only work if it\u2019s universally adopted and enforceable.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here is that self-regulation never works unless it\u2019s universally adopted and enforceable. We as an industry are really good at guidelines and best practices. We have to move beyond that,\u201d Lain said.\n\nHe wants publishers to recognize that ad fraud is not just an advertiser problem, but an industry-wide issue that requires solutions from all players.\n\n\u201cWe should move toward a system of universal penalties, clawbacks and other types of punitive measures,\u201d Lain said.\n\nYou\u2019re watching \u201cBeet Retreat San Juan 2025, presented by Cognitiv, Index Exchange & TransUnion\u201d For more videos from this series, please visit this page.",

The PEP stock\u2019s momentum can be mainly attributed to its robust fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Effective cost controls, driven by incremental investments to improve market competitiveness, mainly aided the bottom-line results. The company\u2019s top line also beat the consensus mark.\n\n\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nThe momentum in the company\u2019s shares caused it to outperform the broader sector and the S&P 500 index while it lagged the Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry. The Consumer Staples sector has grown 6.9% in the past month, but the S&P 500 has declined 2.2%. Meanwhile, the broader industry has rallied 10.4% in the past month.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s One-Month Price Performance\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently priced at $155.99, The PEP stock\u2019s price reflects a 10.2% premium to the company\u2019s recent 52-week low of $141.51. The PepsiCo stock is trading at a 15% discount from its 52-week high of $183.41, reflecting upside potential. The stock trades above its 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish sentiment.\n\nPEP Stock Trades Above 50-Day Moving Average\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet us explore the reasons behind the company\u2019s steady but strong movement on the bourses and potential for growth.\n\nFactors Portraying PEP\u2019s Inherent Strength\n\nPepsiCo is well-poised to benefit from strength and resilience in core categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, and flexible go-to-market distribution systems. Robust consumer demand trends, effective strategies and strong pricing have been the key drivers.\n\n\n\nPEP\u2019s productivity and cost-management efforts contribute to its positive outlook, with profitability supported by cost controls and strategic investments to boost market competitiveness. The company plans to heighten its focus on comprehensive cost management to increase productivity, offset cost inflation, and invest in brand growth, innovation and channel expansion.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo's international business continues to hallmark its overall performance, delivering significant volume and organic revenue growth. In fourth-quarter 2024, the company continued to benefit from gains in its international business, which delivered year-over-year organic revenue growth of 6%. The international business reported an expansion of 260 basis points in the core operating profit margin.\n\n\n\nDeveloping and emerging markets offer significant growth potential due to lower per-capita consumption. The company has been expanding in developing/emerging markets like Russia, Mexico, China, India, Brazil and Africa through tailored distribution models, as well as by offering locally relevant innovation and value-added products.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, PepsiCo expects to continue progressing on the expansion of its international business and executing plans to improve the performance of its North America segment. Additionally, the company\u2019s multi-year productivity initiatives are poised to help fund disciplined commercial investments and aid profitability. Consequently, the company expects year-over-year organic revenue growth in the low-single digits for 2025. It forecasts core constant-currency EPS growth in the mid-single-digits year over year.\n\nDoes PEP\u2019s Valuation Discount Signal Buying Opportunity?\n\nPepsiCo is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 18.6X, below the industry average of 19.22X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 21.95X.\n\n\n\nPEP shares also trade at a discount to its competitors, including The Coca-Cola Company KO, Vita Coco Company COCO and Monster Beverage MNST, with higher P/E multiples of 24.12X, 27.87X and 29.57X, respectively.\n\n\n\nAlthough the PEP stock\u2019s valuation is currently lower than that of its industry peers, this gap might not be as advantageous as it appears. The lower price could signal underlying issues rather than presenting a straightforward investment opportunity. At this moment, its current valuation seems unwarranted. PepsiCo has a Value Score of C.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Estimate Revision Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP's 2025 and 2026 EPS moved down in the last 30 days, indicating negative sentiment among analysts for the company's earnings. Although the company\u2019s outlook looks decent, analysts seem less confident about PepsiCo\u2019s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 EPS have moved down 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively, in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nFor 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP\u2019s sales and EPS implies 0.1% and 1.7% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus mark for 2026 sales and earnings indicates growth of 3.4% and 6.4% year-over-year, respectively.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Keeps Investors Skeptical About PEP?\n\nWhile PepsiCo\u2019s inherent strengths show promise, investors continue to be skeptical about the company\u2019s ongoing headwinds. Its revenue performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 reflected headwinds related to subdued category demand in its convenient food business and the impacts of a product recall in the QFNA segment. Business disruptions caused by escalating geopolitical tensions in some international markets also hurt performance.\n\n\n\nAs a result, revenues declined 0.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. The unit volume was down 1% each for the convenient food business and the beverage business. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 2%.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles in the North America markets are partially attributed to increased pricing in response to rising inflation in the past few years, which has led to reduced volumes as consumers adjust their spending habits amid economic pressures. Additionally, PEP is witnessing headwinds due to product recalls in the QFNA segment related to contamination issues such as Salmonella in various cereal and snack items.\n\nHow to Approach the PEP Stock?\n\nPepsiCo exhibits strong long-term growth potential, supported by its industry position, cost-management initiatives, global presence and strategic execution. However, near-term challenges, including weak category trends in North America and broader market conditions, warrant caution before investing.\n\n\n\nThe PEP stock\u2019s price recovery and a discounted valuation relative to peers present an attractive opportunity, but its negative estimate revision trend suggests a cautious approach for new investors. Potential investors should consider waiting for clearer signs of recovery before investing in this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.\n\n\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 14\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 3.48%\n\nAn American food and beverage company, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. Despite ongoing market uncertainties, the company has a track record of recovering from downturns, offering potential opportunities for investors amid current concerns over tariffs and market sentiment.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) maintained stable earnings in fiscal year 2024, reporting $91.8 billion in revenue, a slight increase from $91.4 billion the previous year. Operating profit climbed to $12.8 billion from $11.9 billion in FY23, while net income also saw an uptick, reaching $9.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, PepsiCo expects organic revenue to grow at a low-single-digit rate, with mid-single-digit growth projected for core constant currency EPS.\n\nIn FY24, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. For FY25, it plans to return approximately $7.6 billion to shareholders through dividend payments. On February 3, the company announced a 5% increase in its annual dividend to $5.69 per share, extending its dividend growth streak to 53 years. This consistency makes it one of the best dividend stocks according to billionaires. The stock\u2019s dividend yield on March 3 comes in at 3.48%.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 23rd on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nCelsius Holdings named PepsiCo veteran Eric Hanson as president and chief operating officer starting March 24. He will report to Celsius CEO John Fieldly in the newly created COO role.\n\nHanson will be responsible for accelerating Celsius\u2019 growth and expansion efforts with his nearly three decades of experience in the food and beverage industry.\n\nHis appointment comes as Celsius recently announced a deal to buy rival Alani Nu for $1.8 billion and a move into hydration to help position itself as a \u2018lifestyle\u2019 brand that goes beyond energy.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile Celsius has seen revenue soar to $1.4 billion in 2024 from $17 million nearly a decade ago, the Florida-based energy drink company is positioning its business for further growth with the appointment of a COO.\n\nIn tapping Hanson for the role, Celsius is going with a familiar face who knows the company and the energy drink space.\n\nHanson most recently served as the senior vice president of strategic partnerships at PepsiCo, where he worked with Keurig Dr Pepper, Tropicana Brands and Celsius.\n\nSince joining PepsiCo in 1997, Hanson has held a variety of leadership roles, including as the senior vice president of energy drinks where he led the integration of Rockstar into PepsiCo following its nearly $4 billion acquisition in 2020.\n\nThree years ago, PepsiCo invested $550 million to take an 8.5% stake in Celsius and signed a long-term distribution agreement. Hanson\u2019s ties to Celsius and insight into energy beverages should make his transition easier, enabling him to quickly pursue growth opportunities at his new employer.\n\nEric Hanson, Celsius Holdings\u2019 incoming COO Permission granted by Celsius Holdings\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Eric to Celsius during an exciting time for the company as we continue to advance our compelling growth strategy to reach more people, in more places, more often,\u201d Fieldly said in a statement. \u201cEric is a proven leader with a wealth of expertise, positioning him well to drive strategic collaboration among our seasoned teams and to lead the integration and optimization of our acquisitions.\u201d\n\nFieldly added that he knew Hanson after working with him through Celsius\u2019 partnership with PepsiCo.\n\nThe creation of the COO position will provide Fieldly with a much-needed operator who has experience in leadership, sales, commercial planning and partnership management. Fieldy has a lot on his plate. While the Celsius name is closely associated with energy drinks, the company is aiming to broaden its functional beverage platform.\n\nLast month, it debuted a hydration offering that is loaded with B vitamins and electrolytes, but that unlike its core energy drink, lacks caffeine. Company executives want Celsius to connect with consumers throughout more parts of their day, from quenching thirst and providing energy to later on potentially helping with mental clarity and providing probiotics.\n\nCelsius also is preparing to digest its acquisition of Alani Nu, the biggest deal for the company since it was founded in 2004. At the same time, Celsius has seen revenue slow amid mounting competition from rivals Red Bull and Monster which have leaned into the sugar-free segment. This comes amid a broader economic slowdown as inflation prompts consumers to cut back on their purchase of energy drinks, especially in convenience stores.",

            "content": "Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods. Valued at $210.5 billion by market cap, the company offers a variety of grain-based snacks, carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, and foods under the brands Lay's, Doritos, Fritos, Tostitos, Cheetos, Life, Pearl Milling Company, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker, and more.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally described as \u201cmega-cap stocks,\u201d and PEP definitely fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the non-alcoholic beverages industry. PepsiCo's strength lies in its diverse brand portfolio, which maintains significant market share across various categories. The company's strong brand image and customer loyalty drive consistent revenue streams, particularly in convenience foods. PepsiCo's integrated business model allows for cost-effective operations and a strong competitive position, enabling the company to drive productivity savings and manage commodity costs effectively.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, PEP slipped 16.3% from its 52-week high of $183.41, achieved on May 16, 2024. Over the past three months, PEP stock declined 5.7%, underperforming the Dow Jones Industrials Average\u2019s ($DOWI) 2% losses during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of PEP rose marginally on a YTD basis but dipped 8.1% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming DOWI\u2019s YTD gains of 3.1% and 12.6% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, PEP has been trading below its 200-day moving average since October 2024. However, the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average since late February.\n\nPepsiCo's underperformance is due to the upcoming closure of a Frito-Lay facility in New York for cost-cutting, concerns about potential cuts to food assistance programs, and falling profit forecasts. The company has been impacted by slowing growth, increased health consciousness among consumers and regulators, and a decrease in snacking habits. Sales have been declining, particularly in the potato chip category, as consumers are more cautious due to higher food prices and interest rates.\n\nOn Feb. 4, PEP shares closed down more than 4% after reporting its Q4 results. Its adjusted EPS of $1.96 exceeded Wall Street expectations of $1.95. The company\u2019s revenue was $27.8 billion, missing Wall Street forecasts of $27.9 billion.\n\nIn the competitive arena of non-alcoholic beverages, The Coca-Cola Company (KO) has taken the lead over PEP, showing resilience with a 14.4% gain on a YTD basis and a 17.9% uptick over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish on PEP\u2019s prospects. The stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 20 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $162.53 suggests a potential upside of 5.9% from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase PepsiCo's shares on or after the 7th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 31st of March.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$1.355 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.69 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current stock price of US$153.47. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 76% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 101% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.\n\nWhile PepsiCo's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PepsiCo to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.",

            "content": "It looks like PepsiCo, Inc. ( ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, PepsiCo investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$1.355 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.69 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of approximately 3.5% on its current stock price of US$153.47. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Its dividend payout ratio is 76% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 101% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.\n\nWhile PepsiCo's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PepsiCo to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see PepsiCo earnings per share are up 6.0% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, PepsiCo has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nHas PepsiCo got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have grown somewhat, although PepsiCo paid out over half its profits and the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.\n\nWith that being said, if you're still considering PepsiCo as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing.

Another is Cadbury chocolates, which taste different in the U.K. compared to in the U.S. Sometimes these changes reflect the food preferences of specific regions, which is why you'll enjoy different McFlurries at McDonald's around the globe.

            "content": "Shares of this beverage giant are down a bit from their all-time high, but that's more of an opportunity than a red flag.\n\nIs your portfolio thirsty for an undervalued dividend payer? There are plenty of solid options to choose from at this time, but arguably none as compelling as PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) in the wake of the stock's 22% pullback from its 2023 high.\n\nShares of the beverage giant are near multiyear lows right now. But there are three very specific reasons a turnaround appears to be in the cards.\n\n1. Complete control of its entire business\n\nYou know the brand name. But you may not know the company quite as well as you think.\n\nPepsiCo is, of course, parent to popular soda Pepsi and all of its offshoots. The organization also owns complementary brands like Mountain Dew, 7-Up, Bubly water, and even Gatorade.\n\nThen there's the side of PepsiCo you may not realize is part of this company. Although they only make up a minority of its sales, snack food brand Frito-Lay's (Frito's, Cheeto's, Lay's and Ruffles potato chips, Rold Gold pretzels) and even Quaker Oats are also part of the PepsiCo family, and account for a slight majority of its operating income.\n\nThat's not the bullish part of the bullish thesis here though. Indeed, while Frito-Lay is clearly a dominant name within the snack food market, PepsiCo is still playing second fiddle to rival Coca-Cola (KO 0.07%) on the beverage front.\n\nRather, the crux of the bullish argument here is the distinct way that PepsiCo's drinks business is different than Coke's. Whereas The Coca-Cola Company has punted the bulk of bottling and distribution work to third-party bottlers so it can focus on what it does best (marketing), PepsiCo is taking a different tack. Instead of getting out of the bottling aspect of the business, it's making a point of owning as many of its own bottling facilities as it can here and abroad. It's even doing some bottling work for competing products like Dr Pepper. The company also owns most of its food manufacturing facilities.\n\nSo what? On the surface it seems like more of a liability than a benefit. Manufacturing facilities are expensive to operate, after all. Coca-Cola has seemingly absolved itself of this risk and headache by offloading this lower-margin work to its partners. And to this end, PepsiCo's operating margin of around 10% is less than half that of its beverage archrival (and that's despite very wide margins for its snack foods business).\n\nThere's a proverbial price to be paid for the use of third-party manufacturing partners, though. That's a loss of control of the process, and in particular, the timing of production. Coke's bottlers are still ultimately in business for themselves, whereas PepsiCo's bottling and food production is entirely controlled by the company to perfectly and immediately suit its needs.\n\nAnd this may matter more than you think for reasons well beyond convenience.\n\n2. Better net gains than you-know-who\n\nPepsiCo may trail The Coca-Cola Company in terms of share of the beverage business, as well as operate at a lower profit margin rate. There is one arguable and measurable upside to PepsiCo's approach, however. That is, it ultimately allows for more net growth, and more net gains to investors.\n\nThat's what the data says anyway. If you made two identically sized investments in both companies 30 years ago and then reinvested any dividends paid by either stock in the meantime, your current position in PepsiCo would be significantly bigger than your Coca-Cola holding.\n\nPepsiCo's faster dividend growth explains at least part of this disparity. But, it's also arguable that Coca-Cola's sheer size, age, and, now, complexity all ultimately contribute to slower and more expensive growth. Also know that PepsiCo's stock-buyback efforts have more often than not been more generous than Coke's, meaning its stock builds value at a faster pace than Coca-Cola's.\n\n3. A strong dividend yield (and dividend pedigree)\n\nFinally, PepsiCo's a top bet right now for the simple reason that its stock's recent weakness has pumped up its forward-looking dividend yield to around 3.6%. That's not just better than Coca-Cola's projected yield of 2.9%. It's better than most consumer goods stocks of companies of a comparable size, age, and caliber.\n\nMoreover, you'd be hard-pressed to find an enterprise with a better track record of dividend growth than PepsiCo. Although Coca-Cola technically tops it with 63 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, with 53 years of yearly payout increases of its own, PepsiCo is certainly no slouch.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that PepsiCo's payout ratio of about three-fourths of its profits not only leaves the company with some fiscal flexibility, but is also in line with the norm for the beverage business.\n\nMore reward than risk\n\nNone of this is to suggest PepsiCo is completely bulletproof. It faces challenges, too. For example, it's going to soon be shuttering a Frito-Lay facility in New York to achieve some much-needed cost-cutting. Its stock also tumbled on Wednesday on concerns that the federal government may soon be cutting funding for food assistance programs, potentially undermining its reliance on such programs. PepsiCo's profit forecast for the entirety of 2025 posted in early February also fell short of analysts' expectations, rekindling this ticker's weakness since mid-2023.\n\nAs is so often the case though, the sellers have arguably overshot their target just because they're not seeing the bigger bullish picture.\n\nThis might help: Despite a handful of recent red flags from the company in addition to the stock's weakness, the analyst community remains optimistic. The current consensus price target of $162.50 is 7% better than the stock's recent price, but that's huge for a stock of this ilk -- particularly given how easy it's been to beat up on it of late. Any turn for the better should prompt these underlying target prices higher again, fanning the bullish flames.",

            "content": "More than 28 years after the fateful first partnership between Pepsi and Michael Jackson, the soda giant and the late singer's estate are teaming up for a new global marketing blitz timed to the 25th anniversary of Jackson's album Bad. The campaign, which will launch this weekend in China before going global, plasters Jackson's image on cans and edits archival footage of his performances into new commercials. Some critics, however, aren't celebrating. Is it in poor taste to use a dead pop star to sell soda?\n\nThis is \"a deal with the devil\": Pepsi is the company behind the 1984 commercial that arguably ruined Michael Jackson's life, says TMZ. The pop star's hair famously caught fire after a pyrotechnic mishap during shooting, leaving his scalp covered with painful burns and leading Jackson down the path to a \"hardcore prescription drug\" addiction. One of the singer's former managers said doctors first introduced Jackson to the heroin-like opioid Demerol after the accident. The prescription drug habit eventually led Jackson to Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of manslaughter in the King of Pop's death. Why is Jackson's estate getting back in bed with Pepsi?\n\n\"Michael Jackson estate joins Pepsi! Deal with the devil?\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nIt's too soon: It doesn't sit right that Jackson's image is being made the face of a campaign, when he isn't around to authorize it, says Donna Kaufman at iVillage. Sure, he's not the first deceased star to become a posthumous spokesperson \u2014 Gap used Audrey Hepburn, while a Dirt Devil commercial starred Fred Astaire. But those celebrities had their heydays over 50 years ago, and died \"after long, fulfilling lives.\" Jackson's death, on the other hand, was fairly recent; Pepsi's ads read like an attempt to capitalize on still-fresh grief.\n\n\"This isn't weird at all: Michael Jackson to star in new Pepsi ads\"\n\nSay what you will, it's a shrewd move: Most people under 35 won't remember the hair-burning incident, says Julia Bricklin at Forbes. And they'll recall Bad, if at all, as an album that came out when Jackson, although already retreating into paranoia, was still in control of his life. This seems like a good move to win over consumers, especially those in Asia and outside the U.S. where PepsiCo is working feverishly to capture a bigger chunk of the market. While some might call the campaign \"creepy,\" the millions of dollars fans still spend on all things Jackson make this a business no-brainer.\n\n\"Pepsi's Michael Jackson resurrection: Strangely appropriate?\"",

            "content": "PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) stock is trading down nearly 23% from highs set in May 2023. That's technically a bear market-type of pullback for this consumer staples giant.\n\nIf you are a dividend growth investor, right now is the time to buy PepsiCo. Here's why.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhat does PepsiCo do?\n\nPepsiCo is a consumer staples company, which means it makes products that people buy in both good markets and bad. The products it sells are also small, so they are relatively easy to afford. And the company's brands tend to engender loyalty from consumers, which increases the likelihood of purchase even during recessionary periods.\n\nAs far as the specific products that PepsiCo makes, it is probably best to lump it into the food space. That, however, isn't exactly a clean fit because PepsiCo's namesake brand is a beverage.\n\nIn fact, the company makes a broad array of beverages. But it also produces snacks under the Frito-Lay brand and packaged food products in its Quaker Oats business. It is a dominant company in both beverages and salty snacks, and holds its own in packaged foods.\n\nAll in, PepsiCo is actually one of the most diversified food stocks you can buy. That includes both its product mix and the fact that it sells its goods in over 200 countries around the world. As you might expect, it has a very strong distribution system and a marketing arm that can stand toe to toe with just about any of its consumer staples peers.\n\nWhy buy PepsiCo right now?\n\nSo PepsiCo has a large and attractive business. It also has a historically high 3.5% dividend yield that is backed by 52 consecutive annual dividend increases. That dividend streak is impressive, especially since you can't build a record like that by accident. It requires a strong business playbook that gets executed well in both good times and bad.\n\nStocks that manage this level of performance join the highly elite group of Dividend Kings (50-plus annual dividend increases). PepsiCo is clearly a reliable dividend growth stock, and its 10-year compound annual dividend growth rate is around 7%. That's about twice the historical growth rate of inflation.\n\nThe historically high yield, meanwhile, suggests that PepsiCo is on sale right now. More traditional valuation metrics, like the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios, back that up. Both are currently below their five-year averages.\n\nSo, PepsiCo looks like a dividend growth stock with a strong business that has been put on the sale rack. If you can handle taking contrarian positions, it could be a great fit for your portfolio.\n\nWhat's wrong with PepsiCo?\n\nFrom a big-picture perspective, there is nothing wrong with PepsiCo. Even well-run companies eventually go through difficult periods performance-wise. However, Wall Street tends to think short term, so PepsiCo's current headwinds have left investors downbeat on the shares. This is an opportunity for dividend-focused investors who think long-term.\n\nPart of the problem today is that PepsiCo's performance coming out of the pandemic was particularly strong. High inflation allowed the consumer staples company to aggressively raise prices. Now that the price hikes are behind it, top-line growth has slowed down. That's not shocking at all, and it is an issue impacting many of the company's peers as well.\n\nPepsiCo has been through periods like this before and is, in fact, already making moves to improve performance. The most notable decision was the growth-enhancing purchase of Siete Foods, a purveyor of Mexican/American foods.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo is more exposed than other consumer staples companies to the potential demand impact of new weight loss drugs. And it is also more exposed to the risk posed by increased health consciousness among consumers and regulators. Both of these facts stem from its focus on beverages and snacking. It might take the company a little while to reposition, but it is difficult to believe that PepsiCo won't adjust as needed on either front.\n\nPepsiCo probably won't rebound in 2025\n\nStill, there's one important thing to keep in mind: PepsiCo is likely to turn its business around, but it probably won't do so overnight. It could take several years, but the historically high yield means you are being paid well to wait.\n\nIn fact, management was pretty clear that 2025 would see just low-single-digit organic sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth. Investors have simply come to expect more of PepsiCo, and that means the shares could be industry laggards for longer.\n\nTaking the glass-half-full point of view, however, could easily lead you to see 2025's outlook as more positive than it appears. After all, if low-single-digit organic sales growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth are what this company can achieve when it isn't hitting on all cylinders, imagine what it could do once it gets its business back on a stronger track.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "The most recent trading session ended with PepsiCo (PEP) standing at $152.02, reflecting a +0.34% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.59%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.45%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.78%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 0.76% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 6.01% and outpacing the S&P 500's loss of 2.23% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of PepsiCo in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.54, showcasing a 4.35% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $17.8 billion, showing a 2.45% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.30 per share and revenue of $91.75 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1.72% and -0.11%, respectively, from last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.55% lower. Right now, PepsiCo possesses a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that PepsiCo has a Forward P/E ratio of 18.26 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.98 of its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that PEP currently boasts a PEG ratio of 3.16. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Beverages - Soft drinks industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.46.",

Brands in 1997.\n\nThe company's net revenue has grown 37 percent to nearly $92 billion over the last five years, according to its latest earnings release.\n\nHowever, its revenue in the fourth quarter dipped to $27.78 billion thanks to stubbornly high prices and shifting consumer tastes that have weakened demand for its snacks and drinks.\n\nOver the past year, PepsiCo stock is down nearly 10 percent.

The facility will remain closed for the rest of last week before reopening on Sunday. Employees said they were still paid for that week.\n\nEmployees are expected to work until April 6 but will continued receiving paychecks through May 19. They will be receiving severance payments after that.\n\nMany of the facility's employees are immigrants who primarily speak Spanish, Sullivan County Legislator Louie Alvarez told the Times-Union.\n\nAlvarez's main fear is not that people won't eventually find jobs, but that the number of people flooding into the job market all at once will prolong their unemployment.\n\nMarc Baez, president and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership for Economic Development, said the move from PepsiCo will have negative downstream effect on the community at large.\n\n'Any entity that loses a major employer like that, there's going to be a certainly a devastating effect,' Baez told the Times-Union.\n\n'Even if you just look at the payroll that's being paid, individually it may not be something significant, but together 287 people that go to local shops and restaurants, grocery stores. \u2026 There's an induced negative impact on the community.

While the bill still has to go through committee meetings and also pass the Senate, analysts believe there's a high probability of cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the horizon. These programs help lower-income families pay for medical care and food. Therefore, cuts to these programs could affect sales for the three companies, which serve that demographic.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nBudget resolution preserves tax cuts, aims to cut spending\n\nLast night, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a budget resolution by a narrow 217-215 vote, with all Democrats and one Republican dissenting. It wasn't clear the resolution would pass, but a late push from President Donald Trump apparently flipped holdouts to \"yes\" votes.\n\nThe resolution preserves the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and makes room for new ones, with outlined tax breaks amounting to $4.5 trillion over a decade. Offsetting that is a loose plan for $2 trillion in spending cuts.\n\nThe spending cuts appear to be the focus of investors in these stocks today. While specific cuts are not outlined in the resolution, the bill instructs the committees that deal with various federal programs to cut their spending by a certain amount. The committee that handles Medicaid and SNAP is the Energy and Commerce committee, which is directed to make the biggest cuts of all, totaling $880 billion.\n\nTrump has promised not to cut funding for Social Security and Medicare for seniors, so most analysts believe there will have to be cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits for the poor in order to meet the spending stipulation in the bill.\n\nCutting Medicaid and SNAP would likely further pressure the finances of lower-income families, and could therefore decrease purchase volumes for these three stocks. Dollar General, of note, gets about 60% of its sales from families making less than $30,000 per year. Earlier this year, CEO Todd Vasos noted Dollar General had seen spending wane toward the end of each month. His conclusion was that even though Dollar General mostly sells \"essentials\" like cereal, milk, eggs, and other household items, families nevertheless bought less as their monthly budgets ran out, due to inflation and other pressures.\n\nAnd of course, pressure on working families could also lead to lower purchases of branded foods from Pepsi or Hershey. While Pepsi is known for its namesake soda brand, it actually sells lots of healthier food as well, including Aquafina water, Quaker Oats oatmeal, and Lay's potato chips, among many others. While Hershey's portfolio consists mostly of candy, it also sells healthier chips, protein bars, and mints. If Medicaid and SNAP benefits are cut, consumers may buy fewer of these items or \"trade down\" to lower-cost private-label items.\n\nInvestors should beware of austerity measures\n\nIt should be noted that this budget resolution is not the final bill, and there are likely changes that will be made. House committees will hold weeks of meetings to iron out the details, the final bill will then need to pass the House, and will then have to go to the Senate, where further changes will be made. Moreover, cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits are not specifically named in this resolution, as some lawmakers have pointed out.\n\nStill, with certain categories of spending declared off-limits, most analysts believe cuts to programs that benefit lower-income Americans are inevitable.\n\nWhile many are in favor of tax cuts and cutting government spending as a general concept, investors should also be aware that austerity measures can be a drag on economic growth. While investors should take a wait-and-see approach to what actually passes through Congress, the past week's consumer sentiment surveys have been very poor, suggesting slowing economic growth could be on the horizon.\n\nRepublicans counter that lower taxes and deregulation will enable the economy to grow at a faster pace, offsetting the drag from lower spending. That is certainly possible, but is also a point of debate among economists.\n\nRegardless, consumer product companies like these three that sell to lower- and middle-income Americans may find an adverse economic environment over the next year, at least.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dollar General right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dollar General, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dollar General wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "PepsiCo\u2019s recent decision to shut down its Sullivan County manufacturing facility has sent shockwaves through Liberty, New York.\n\nThe closure, set for May 2025, will result in 287 employees losing their jobs, a devastating blow to the small town\u2019s economy.\n\nA Sudden Shutdown and Unanswered Questions\n\nThe facility, known for producing PopCorners snacks, has been a key employer in Liberty for nearly three decades. However, PepsiCo\u2019s unexpected announcement has left many employees blindsided. The company filed a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) with the state\u2019s Department of Labor, confirming layoffs would begin on May 21, 2025.\n\nLocal officials were caught off guard by the move. According to Marc Baez, president of the Sullivan County Partnership for Economic Development, PepsiCo never reached out for assistance or incentives to remain in the area. \u201cTypically, when a company is struggling, they ask for help. That didn\u2019t happen here,\u201d Baez stated.\n\nEconomic Fallout for Liberty\n\nFor a town with just 10,000 residents, losing nearly 300 jobs is a financial and social catastrophe. Local legislator Louie Alvarez stressed the impact on families who have built their lives around the plant. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just numbers; these are people who have mortgages, children in school, and roots in this community.\u201d\n\nBeyond direct job losses, local businesses also stand to suffer. Restaurants, grocery stores, and service providers that relied on the steady income of PepsiCo employees will feel the ripple effects of the shutdown.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Corporate Strategy\n\nThis closure isn\u2019t an isolated event. In October 2024, PepsiCo shut down four bottling plants nationwide, impacting nearly 400 workers. The company has cited shifting consumer preferences and high production costs as factors for these closures. Despite reporting a slight dip in Q4 revenue to $27.78 billion, PepsiCo\u2019s overall net revenue has surged 37% over the past five years, reaching nearly $92 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the company recently made headlines for scaling back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, aligning with broader corporate shifts influenced by political pressure.\n\nWorker Assistance and Next Steps\n\nIn response to the mass layoffs, local officials, workforce development agencies, and the Sullivan County Chamber of Commerce are stepping in to help displaced workers find new opportunities. The Center for Workforce Development is offering job placement services, resume workshops, and skill enhancement programs.\n\nA significant portion of the affected workforce comprises Spanish-speaking immigrants, some of whom hold foreign credentials. Officials are working to bridge language barriers and provide retraining resources in fields like healthcare and hospitality.\n\nThe Future of the Facility\n\nWhile PepsiCo has not disclosed its plans for the Liberty plant, local economic leaders are actively seeking new buyers. Interest has reportedly emerged from national and regional firms, though no deals have been finalized. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to attract another employer to take over the space,\u201d Baez confirmed.\n\nA Town in Transition\n\nLiberty is now faced with a daunting challenge: rebuilding its economic landscape after the loss of a major employer. As hundreds of workers brace for uncertainty, the community is rallying to soften the impact of this corporate departure.\n\nFor those affected, assistance is available through the Center for Workforce Development. Impacted workers can visit the center\u2019s website or call 845-794-3340 for support.\n\nThe PepsiCo closure underscores the volatile nature of corporate decision-making and its far-reaching consequences. As Liberty grapples with this upheaval, only time will tell how the town adapts to its new reality.",

PepsiCo Foods U.S. said it would be working with the employees as well as local community officials to support the workers\u2019 transition.\n\nThis is the latest in a rash of closings across the food and beverage industry as suppliers look to increase efficiency and bring supply in line with demand.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLast year, PepsiCo shuttered a Quaker Oats factory in Danville, Illinois, and bottling plants in Cincinnati; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Atlanta. Roughly 300 team members were let go during that process.\n\nThe Liberty plant was acquired by PepsiCo in 2019, as part of a deal to acquire BFY Foods, the original maker of PopCorners.\n\n\u201cThis plant has played a vital role in producing our beloved PopCorners brand, but the pace of growth for this product line paired with broader industry pace of growth has made it difficult to sustain the site\u2019s long-term viability,\u201d PepsiCo Foods U.S. said in a statement. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the contributions of our Liberty employees, and this decision does not diminish the value of their hard work and dedication.\u201d\n\nAlso last year, Campbell Soup closed one facility and reduced the size of another, resulting in more than 400 layoffs, while Del Monte closed two plants and laid off more than 200.\n\nMore central to the convenience store industry, food distributor Rich Products announced plans to lay off 139 employees and shutter its manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, California. Energy and convenience company BP also announced plans in January to cut about 5% of its workforce as part of a previously disclosed plan to cut costs.\n\nThese may just be the tip of the iceberg, with nearly half of U.S. hiring managers surveyed by Resume Templates in January saying layoffs are likely at their companies.",

Patricio Robayo/WJFF Radio Catskill\n\nLIBERTY \u2014 The upcoming closure of PepsiCo\u2019s longtime manufacturing facility in Liberty has sent impacted employees scrambling to find jobs, with the help of local officials who fear that the departure of a major local employer will deal a heavy blow to the town of 10,000 residents.\n\nThe facility, which produces PopCorners brand snacks and has employed hundreds over its almost 30 years of operation in Liberty, will lay off 287 workers starting May 21, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification PepsiCo filed with the state Department of Labor.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe announcement sparked concern among workers and officials, who described the closure and layoffs as \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of these people have lived in Sullivan County for many years. Their families live here, they\u2019ve bought homes here, their kids go to public schools here,\u201d Sullivan County Legislator Louie Alvarez said. \u201cThe impact will be tremendous. \u2026 They are families who have been here a long time and now they have to start over again.\u201d\n\nThe facility has deep roots in the community and has kept hundreds of locals employed since its foundation in 1997 under Ideal Snacks. Under a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT agreement, the company paid $95,000 to the county\u2019s Industrial Development Agency from the time it first expanded the facility in 2003, according to the PILOT document.\n\nThe agreement was transferred to PepsiCo when it purchased the facility in December 2020, but PepsiCo decided to opt out of the PILOT as it was nearing the end of the agreement anyway, said Marc Baez, president and CEO of the Sullivan County Partnership for Economic Development, who stated the announcement was \u201cvery sudden.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cTypically, when a company is in trouble, or whatever the issue is, they would call and say, \u2018We\u2019re running into a problem here.

The food and beverage giant, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay\u2019s, Doritos and Mountain Dew, also made national headlines last week when it joined other major U.S. companies in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as President Donald Trump pushes to dismantle the practice across the federal government and private sector.\n\nOver the past five years, PepsiCo\u2019s net revenue has grown 37% to nearly $92 billion, according to the company\u2019s earning statements. The company recently said its fourth-quarter revenue fell slightly, to $27.78 billion, due to high prices and changing consumer tastes, which have weakened U.S. demand for the company\u2019s snacks and drinks.\n\nThe Times Union spoke with two Liberty PepsiCo employees and a worker\u2019s spouse, who said they received the news with mixed feelings. While some already have jobs lined up, others are worried that they won\u2019t find employment in the area or that they\u2019ll have to relocate.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nStaff were notified of the plant\u2019s closure on Feb. 18, the employees said. The facility remained closed the rest of the week before reopening Sunday, according to workers, who said they were paid that week. Staff are expected to work until April 6 but will continue to be paid through May 19, employees said, adding that they will receive severance payments after that.\n\nMeanwhile, local officials, the Chamber of Commerce and the Sullivan County Partnership for Economic Development have begun meeting with PepsiCo representatives to assist families and individuals who were laid off to find new local jobs through the Center for Workforce Development. The services range from job searching, resume preparation and skill enhancement, a Sullivan County spokesperson said.\n\nMany of the facility\u2019s employees are immigrants and primarily Spanish-speaking and some also received an education in their home countries, Alvarez said. While he doubted the impacted workers would have difficulties finding new jobs in industries like health care and hospitality, he said the challenge would come from coordinating with the large number of employees looking for work at the same time.\n\n\u201cWe have reached out to several officials in government to discuss the site and workforce,\u201d PepsiCo said in a statement to the Times Union. \u201cAt this time, we are most focused on our affected workforce and providing them support.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nPepsiCo did not answer questions regarding what\u2019s next for the facility, but Baez said there has been some interest in the facility from national and local firms.\n\n\u201cAny entity that loses a major employer like that, there\u2019s going to be a certainly a devastating effect,\u201d Baez said. \u201cEven if you just look at the payroll that\u2019s being paid, individually it may not be something significant, but together 287 people that go to local shops and restaurants, grocery stores. \u2026 There\u2019s an induced negative impact on the community. Our job now is to switch gears and see if we can find someone that we can put in that facility.\u201d\n\nFor further assistance, impacted workers can visit the county\u2019s Center for Workforce Development website or call 845-794-3340.",

            "content": "Shares of food and essentials companies Dollar General (DG -1.16%), PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%), and The Hershey Company (HSY -1.00%) all fell on Wednesday, down 5.4%, 2.9%, and 4%, respectively, as of 2:45 p.m. ET.\n\nThe across-the-board declines in these consumer staples names can likely be attributed to the House of Representatives passing its budget reconciliation bill last night. While the bill still has to go through committee meetings and also pass the Senate, analysts believe there's a high probability of cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on the horizon. These programs help lower-income families pay for medical care and food. Therefore, cuts to these programs could affect sales for the three companies, which serve that demographic.\n\nBudget resolution preserves tax cuts, aims to cut spending\n\nLast night, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a budget resolution by a narrow 217-215 vote, with all Democrats and one Republican dissenting. It wasn't clear the resolution would pass, but a late push from President Donald Trump apparently flipped holdouts to \"yes\" votes.\n\nThe resolution preserves the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and makes room for new ones, with outlined tax breaks amounting to $4.5 trillion over a decade. Offsetting that is a loose plan for $2 trillion in spending cuts.\n\nThe spending cuts appear to be the focus of investors in these stocks today. While specific cuts are not outlined in the resolution, the bill instructs the committees that deal with various federal programs to cut their spending by a certain amount. The committee that handles Medicaid and SNAP is the Energy and Commerce committee, which is directed to make the biggest cuts of all, totaling $880 billion.\n\nTrump has promised not to cut funding for Social Security and Medicare for seniors, so most analysts believe there will have to be cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits for the poor in order to meet the spending stipulation in the bill.\n\nCutting Medicaid and SNAP would likely further pressure the finances of lower-income families, and could therefore decrease purchase volumes for these three stocks. Dollar General, of note, gets about 60% of its sales from families making less than $30,000 per year. Earlier this year, CEO Todd Vasos noted Dollar General had seen spending wane toward the end of each month. His conclusion was that even though Dollar General mostly sells \"essentials\" like cereal, milk, eggs, and other household items, families nevertheless bought less as their monthly budgets ran out, due to inflation and other pressures.\n\nAnd of course, pressure on working families could also lead to lower purchases of branded foods from Pepsi or Hershey. While Pepsi is known for its namesake soda brand, it actually sells lots of healthier food as well, including Aquafina water, Quaker Oats oatmeal, and Lay's potato chips, among many others. While Hershey's portfolio consists mostly of candy, it also sells healthier chips, protein bars, and mints. If Medicaid and SNAP benefits are cut, consumers may buy fewer of these items or \"trade down\" to lower-cost private-label items.\n\nInvestors should beware of austerity measures\n\nIt should be noted that this budget resolution is not the final bill, and there are likely changes that will be made. House committees will hold weeks of meetings to iron out the details, the final bill will then need to pass the House, and will then have to go to the Senate, where further changes will be made. Moreover, cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits are not specifically named in this resolution, as some lawmakers have pointed out.\n\nStill, with certain categories of spending declared off-limits, most analysts believe cuts to programs that benefit lower-income Americans are inevitable.\n\nWhile many are in favor of tax cuts and cutting government spending as a general concept, investors should also be aware that austerity measures can be a drag on economic growth. While investors should take a wait-and-see approach to what actually passes through Congress, the past week's consumer sentiment surveys have been very poor, suggesting slowing economic growth could be on the horizon.\n\nRepublicans counter that lower taxes and deregulation will enable the economy to grow at a faster pace, offsetting the drag from lower spending. That is certainly possible, but is also a point of debate among economists.\n\nRegardless, consumer product companies like these three that sell to lower- and middle-income Americans may find an adverse economic environment over the next year, at least.",

            "content": "Carbonated beverage behemoths Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) have been battling for worldwide soda supremacy for over a century. While much smaller than its mega-cap peers, Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP) is also a formidable challenger in its own right. All three are solid businesses that enjoy durable, widespread demand for their products. Moreover, they all currently trade at attractive valuations and are dividend stocks offering steady returns. I\u2019m bullish on all three, but which stock offers the most fizz for investor portfolios?\n\nLet\u2019s find out\u2026\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) | Fizzy Drinks Bellwether Stays Solid\n\nFounded 133 years ago, Coca-Cola is one of America\u2019s most iconic companies. Its brand and product are instantly recognizable in even the most far-flung parts of the world. In addition to its flagship Coca-Cola product and offshoots like Diet Coke and Coke Zero, Coca-Cola boasts many other well-known brands in its portfolio. A few notable examples include Sprite, Fanta, Fairlife, Minute Maid, Topo Chico, Smartwater, and Vitaminwater.\n\nCoca-Cola stock is perhaps most notable for its illustrious dividend history. The company has paid a dividend to its shareholders for an incredible 62 years in a row, and even more impressively, it has grown its dividend payout in each of these 62 years. This type of longevity and consistency makes Coca-Cola a top dividend growth stock. Indeed, Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, an exclusive group of companies that have increased their dividend payouts for at least 50 years. The company recently increased its quarterly dividend payout from $0.49 to $0.51 per share. Based on current quarterly payouts, KO stock currently yields about 2.9%, far higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 1.3%.\n\nCoca-Cola shares are also slightly cheaper than those of the broader market, though not drastically. They currently trade for 24.1x December 2025 earnings estimates, while the S&P 500 trades for 25.8x earnings. Last but not least, Coca-Cola recently reported strong fourth-quarter results in which its organic revenue growth jumped by an impressive 14%. For 2025, Coca-Cola foresees full-year adjusted organic revenue growth of 5-6%, so the stock should keep ticking for current shareholders.\n\nIs Coca-Cola a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOn Wall Street, KO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst KO stock price target of $75.24 per share implies a 5.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) | Leading Rival Hopes to Shake Off Headwinds\n\nLike its archrival, PepsiCo was founded in the 1890s and has evolved into one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. In addition to its nameplate Pepsi brand, Pepsi\u2019s portfolio includes other popular beverages like Gatorade and Mountain Dew. Pepsi also has other diversifiers, including popular snack foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and Lay\u2019s potato chips and breakfast mainstays like Quaker Oats oatmeal and Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal.\n\nWhile few stocks can beat Coca-Cola on consistent dividend growth, Pepsi is no slouch in this department either. In fact, like Coca-Cola, Pepsi is also a Dividend King. The company has paid and grown its dividend for an impressive 52 years in a row and counting. Furthermore, the company announced a 5% dividend increase this year, which will take effect in June and mark its 53rd consecutive year of boosting its dividend. While Coca-Cola\u2019s track record is a bit longer, these are both incredibly impressive track records of consistent dividend growth.\n\nPepsi has an edge in dividend yield, yielding 3.5% on a forward basis, beating out both Coca-Cola and the broader market.\n\nPEP Against the Broader Market\n\nShares of Pepsi are also cheaper than those of the broader market and Coca-Cola, trading at just 18.5x forward earnings estimates. Meanwhile, Pepsi\u2019s stock has been down 4% over the past year, while Coca-Cola\u2019s stock is up 21%, so there is room for Pepsi to narrow the gap with its larger competitor.\n\nDuring the most recent quarter, Pepsi reported organic revenue growth of just 2.1%, so it is growing slower than Coca-Cola right now. For the year ahead, Pepsi forecasts organic revenue growth in the low single digits, slightly behind Coca-Cola\u2019s forecasts. This is partly because Pepsi has dealt with challenges to its Frito-Lay business in North America over the past year, as many customers seek healthier alternatives to chips and use GLP-1 drugs, which inhibit appetite. Pepsi also voluntarily recalled Quaker products like granola bars and cereals based on potential salmonella concerns.\n\nThese headwinds have played a large part in Pepsi\u2019s lackluster revenue growth. However, the Quaker recall is in the rearview mirror, and the company will soon be lapping easy comps from last year when the recall takes effect. Furthermore, I have faith in Pepsi\u2019s ability to overcome the challenges at Frito-Lay; the company already says it is seeking to add healthier snacks and protein drinks to its product mix.\n\nIs PepsiCo a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOn Wall Street, PEP stock has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy based on ten Buy, six Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. PEP\u2019s average price target of $166 per share implies approximately 6% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nKeurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) | An Up-and-Comer Worth Tracking\n\nWith a market cap of $46.2 billion, Keurig Dr. Pepper is smaller than its two mega-cap rivals, but it\u2019s a mainstay in the consumer staples space nonetheless. The drink has been around since 1885, but the current corporate entity started in 2018, replacing its predecessor, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, first founded in 2008.\n\nAs the company\u2019s current name suggests, it is the parent company of K-cup maker Keurig and the popular Dr. Pepper soft drink and all of its varieties. Other well-known brands under Keurig Dr. Pepper\u2019s umbrella include Snapple, Sunkist and 7-Up.\n\nKeurig Dr. Pepper is a dividend stock that currently yields 2.7% on a forward basis. While this is a decent yield, Keurig Dr. Pepper is the lowest-yielding stock in this comparison. Furthermore, Keurig Dr. Pepper\u2019s dividend does not have the same longevity or growth history as its rivals; the stock has paid a dividend for five years and increased its payout for four years in a row.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Keurig Dr. Pepper trades at 16.8x forward earnings estimates, making it significantly cheaper than Coca-Cola and the broader market and slightly more affordable than Pepsi.\n\nKeurig Dr. Pepper recently reported Q4 earnings, posting solid results, including 5.2% year-over-year revenue growth. KNG\u2019s U.S. net sales increased by an impressive 10.3%, while net sales for its coffee brand fell by 2.4%. The company expects net sales growth to grow in the mid-single-digit range for the year ahead.\n\nIs Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP) Stock a Buy?\n\nKDP earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst KDP stock price target of $37.38 implies almost 7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nPepsiCo Takes Center Stage in Resilient Market Sector\n\nIn truth, all the firms in this comparison offer something interesting for investors. They have stood the test of time and grown into well-recognized, blue-chip global brands. Moreover, they\u2019re all strong dividend stocks with decades of consistent dividend growth between them. Also, all three are fairly recession-resistant businesses that enjoy durable, habitual demand for their products. These stocks can be a valuable safe haven during market selloffs and help investors weather recessionary environments.\n\nFor these reasons, I\u2019m bullish on all three stocks and think they are all strong choices for investors. However, if I had to pick one winner, PepsiCo is the best investment opportunity. Pepsi is growing slower than Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr. Pepper \u2013but \u2014 if the company can navigate through its recent issues, there is strong potential for a bullish rally to unwind all the pessimism still lurking among market participants. Year-to-date, Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr. Pepper are up 15% and 10%, respectively, while Pepsi is up just 3%.\n\nBoth Pepsi and Keurig Dr. Pepper are significantly cheaper than Coca-Cola, yet Pepsi yields considerably more than Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr. Pepper as a dividend stock. Meanwhile, Keurig Dr. Pepper is slightly more affordable than Pepsi, but not by a significant margin. Pepsi, with its higher yield and more extended history of dividend growth, is the better pick. I don\u2019t think investors can go wrong with any of these beverage stocks, but Pepsi has the edge based on the confluence of its valuation, yield, and dividend track record.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily C-Store Dive newsletter.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nFrito-Lay, a subsidiary of beverage and snack giant PepsiCo, will close a facility in Liberty, New York this spring and lay off all 287 workers, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filing last week.\n\nLayoffs at the plant, which manufactures Frito-Lay\u2019s PopCorners corn-based snacks, are expected to begin May 21 and run through June 6, according to the WARN notice. PepsiCo Foods U.S. said it would be working with the employees as well as local community officials to support the workers\u2019 transition.\n\nThis is the latest in a rash of closings across the food and beverage industry as suppliers look to increase efficiency and bring supply in line with demand.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLast year, PepsiCo shuttered a Quaker Oats factory in Danville, Illinois, and bottling plants in Cincinnati; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Atlanta. Roughly 300 team members were let go during that process.\n\nThe Liberty plant was acquired by PepsiCo in 2019, as part of a deal to acquire BFY Foods, the original maker of PopCorners.\n\n\u201cThis plant has played a vital role in producing our beloved PopCorners brand, but the pace of growth for this product line paired with broader industry pace of growth has made it difficult to sustain the site\u2019s long-term viability,\u201d PepsiCo Foods U.S. said in a statement. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the contributions of our Liberty employees, and this decision does not diminish the value of their hard work and dedication.\u201d\n\nAlso last year, Campbell Soup closed one facility and reduced the size of another, resulting in more than 400 layoffs, while Del Monte closed two plants and laid off more than 200.\n\nMore central to the convenience store industry, food distributor Rich Products announced plans to lay off 139 employees and shutter its manufacturing facility in Santa Fe Springs, California. Energy and convenience company BP also announced plans in January to cut about 5% of its workforce as part of a previously disclosed plan to cut costs.\n\nThese may just be the tip of the iceberg, with nearly half of U.S. hiring managers surveyed by Resume Templates in January saying layoffs are likely at their companies.\n\nRecommended Reading",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best consumer staples dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nThe consumer staples sector delivered a total return of 12.3% in 2024, a solid performance for a typically stable industry. However, without the substantial gains from two of its largest components, the sector\u2019s overall returns would have been significantly lower. Known for its defensive nature, this sector appeals to risk-averse investors seeking steady income. While consumers might scale back on household essentials during economic downturns, the decline is generally less pronounced compared to discretionary spending on entertainment, travel, and similar categories. That said, many companies in this space are not expected to grow their earnings as rapidly as the broader market, which could result in underperformance during periods of strong market growth.\n\nThe consumer staples sector consists of companies that produce essential goods such as packaged foods, toothpaste, and dish detergent. The sector is home to many well-established companies that consistently pay dividends, further reinforcing its defensive nature. However, this defensive positioning remained a headwind rather than an advantage for most of 2024, following the sector\u2019s decline in popularity in 2023. Investors largely steered away from defensive stocks, instead favoring a select group of mega-cap growth companies, particularly those linked to artificial intelligence. Moreover, persistently high interest rates put further pressure on dividend-paying stocks, as they are often seen as alternatives to bonds. Concerns over the potential impact of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs on food and beverage consumption also added to the sector\u2019s challenges.\n\nAmid a broader increase in short interest across equities, consumer staples stocks saw a rare shift in sentiment among short sellers during the summer months. According to the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, short interest in the sector declined from 4.16% at the end of May to 3.87% by the end of August. Notably, the consumer staples was the only one among the 11 stock sectors to experience a drop in short interest over that three-month period.\n\nEven so, the sector did not go unnoticed in 2024, as investors shifted their focus to it in August amid growing recession concerns and heightened market volatility. A report from Business Insider noted that the sector climbed approximately 4.1% that month, significantly outperforming the broader market, which saw a gain of just over 1% during the same period. Analysts at Bank of America observed that US consumers have been adjusting to a weaker labor market, dwindling pandemic-era savings, and elevated interest rates. This shift is evident in various ways, including the stronger performance of consumer staples stocks compared to their discretionary counterparts.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, analysts expect the consumer staples sector to regain stability amid a generally steady economic environment and a consumer landscape that, while under some pressure, is not facing severe strain. A report from Fidelity notes that overall consumer demand remains firm, household finances are in good shape, employment levels are strong, and real wage growth is holding steady. With the Federal Reserve starting to lower interest rates, the sector\u2019s prospects appear favorable. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the consumer staples sector.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we identified dividend-paying stocks from the broader market\u2019s Consumer Staples Index with strong dividend growth track records. After that, we sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q4 2024, which means that these stocks are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a leading food and beverage company that produces a wide range of popular products. The company maintained steady earnings in FY24, reporting revenue of $91.8 billion, slightly up from $91.4 billion in the previous year. Operating profit rose to $12.8 billion, compared to $11.9 billion in FY23, while net income also increased to $9.6 billion. Looking ahead to 2025, the company anticipates low-single-digit growth in organic revenue and mid-single-digit growth in core constant currency EPS.\n\nDespite being viewed as a defensive stock with slower growth, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has steadily increased its revenue and profit by prioritizing expansion and acquisitions. Its resilience, coupled with effective management of inflationary pressures, makes it a dependable investment during economic downturns. However, in 2024, the stock came under considerable pressure as investors favored higher-growth opportunities. Additional challenges arose from external factors, including deglobalization and concerns surrounding the adoption of GLP-1 drugs.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) declared a 5% hike in its annual dividend to $5.69 per share on February 3. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 53 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.52%, as of February 24. In FY24, the company generated an operating cash flow of $12.5 billion. In FY25, the company expects to return approximately $7.6 billion to shareholders through dividends.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 2nd on our list of best consumer staples dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "\u00d7 Expand Via Twitter\n\nAs a senior at TCU in 1975, Ron Parker was awarded the football program\u2019s Abe Martin Award, presented to the player who gave the most of his talents and himself to the team.\n\nClearly, that recognition was just the beginning of a life devoted to servant leadership in service to the university and his fellow man as \u201ca beacon of kindness and selflessness.\u201d\n\nParker, a member of TCU\u2019s Board of Trustees and a tireless advocate for the school, died suddenly over the weekend, university officials and associates confirmed Tuesday morning.\n\nHe was 70.\n\nIn addition to serving on the board, Parker was a member of the Neeley School of Business Board of Advisors and co-chair of TCU\u2019s successful Lead On capital fundraising campaign, which raised over $1 billion and positioned the university among the top institutions in the U.S. for comprehensive fundraising efforts.\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s passing has shaken up all of his friends at TCU,\" said Dee Kelly Jr., who served with Parker on the board and as co-chair of Lead On. \"I did not know Ron well until we started working on the [Lead On] campaign together, but we grew to be good friends and colleagues. He was tireless, enthusiastic, and a respected leader. I sat next to him at a meeting the day before he died, and we shared stories like we always did. Just unimaginable. He will be dearly missed.\u201d\n\nParker had a long career in human resources, including almost 30 years with the $92 billion-a-year PepsiCo, where he rose to senior vice president. In that role, he directed the company\u2019s global diversity and inclusion, and labor management strategies in the U.S., Latin America, Asia, Africa, and European operations.\n\nBlack Enterprise said Parker \u201ccarved pathways for Black executives, among others, to ascend to the highest levels.\u201d\n\nHe retired from the company in 2010.\n\n\u201cRon dedicated nearly 30 years to PepsiCo,\u201d said Steve Williams, CEO of PepsiCo North America, as cited by Black Enterprise. \u201cThroughout his career, he held multiple leadership roles across the company, shaping our people strategy and fostering a culture of growth and inclusion. A people-first leader, he was deeply committed to mentorship, leadership development, and creating opportunities for others.\u201d\n\nParker later was a founding member of PepsiCo\u2019s partnership with The Executive Leadership Council and later served as its president and CEO, working to elevate Black executives in corporate America.\n\n\u201cOne of the most sincere people I have ever known, Ron was generous, engaging and dedicated to serving others,\u201d said TCU Chancellor Victor Boschini. \u201cHe loved and served TCU with compassion and integrity and leaves a lasting mark on TCU.\n\n\u201cA loving husband, father and friend to so many, Ron will be greatly missed. Our prayers are with his family during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nParker grew up in Brenham, home to the Brenham Creamery Company, better known today as Blue Bell, between Austin and Houston. According to a story in TCU Magazine, his family raised cattle and planted cotton and corn.\n\nParker was the captain of the football team at Brenham High School and a member of the basketball team. As a senior, he was class president, voted most popular, and named an All-Central Texas as a football player, according to TCU Magazine.\n\nHe played football at Blinn College before transferring to TCU where he played in 1974-75 for head coach Jim Shofner.\n\nIn his last game at TCU, the Horned Frogs beat Rice 28-21 to break a 20-game losing streak. Parker had three receptions for 43 yards. Mike Renfro had seven catches for 121 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cHe was a really good tight end,\u201d Renfro said in a text message, \u201cbut a better person. And he loved TCU.\u201d\n\nIn his two seasons, Parker recorded 33 receptions and two touchdowns, including 21 catches for 289 yards as a senior. He was inducted into the TCU Block T Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nThe Chicago Bears drafted Parker in 1976, but a knee injury cut his prospects short. He took the advice of a mentor, Dick Lowe, and retired to enter private business, which he did, taking a position in the audit department of American Quasar. He was promoted to assistant to the vice president in 1977.\n\nHe returned to TCU to serve as assistant athletic director in 1978 under Frank Windegger. In the role, he was charged with national recruiting for the football and basketball programs, as well as overseeing academic and campus life for student-athletes.\n\nWhen he left two years later to take a position with The Western Company, he was credited with facilitating contact with 5,000 recruits for all sports. Under his leadership, TCU\u2019s recruiting was expanded to a national level, concentrating on the metropolitan areas. He was praised as having had a pivotal role in helping football coach F.A. Dry recruit the university\u2019s best class in 12 years.\n\n\u201cRon took a lot of work off the coaches by evaluating the talent on the ground level,\u201d Windegger said in 1980.\n\nOne of those recruited that year was John Denton, today the executive director of the Flying T Club but then a recruit from Dallas Bishop Dunne High School. Denton wrote on X: Forty-five years ago this month Parker \u201cwas the [recruiting coordinator] for TCU Football when I visited. He was impressive and when we got done, I was a Frog.\u201d\n\nParker graduated from TCU with a degree in political science. His wife, Paula, is also a TCU graduate, earning a nursing degree in 1977.\n\nIn 2006, Parker and his wife established the first fully endowed athletic scholarship to underwrite a team position \u2014 tight end, naturally. The Parkers also have supported a number of projects at the university, including the Harris College Scholarship for Nursing, and an endowed professorship in the Harris College of Nursing & Health Sciences.\n\n\u201cThe reason why Paula and I are so passionate about TCU is because that\u2019s where it all started with us,\u201d Parker said to TCU Magazine.\n\nThe Parkers were also supporters of the Amon G. Carter Stadium Project and were members of the Addison & Randolph Clark Society, the Chancellor\u2019s Council, and the TCU Black Alumni Association.\n\nParker was also a member of the board of the Brite Divinity School.\n\n\u201cRon was a true leader and visionary and had an extraordinary ability to make everyone around him better\u201d Boschini said. \u201cHe valued personal connections and intentionally built relationships with every Horned Frog he met.\u201d\n\nSaid TCU President Daniel Pullin: \u201cRon was a leader among leaders whose compassion, servant leadership and ability to inspire those around him have had a profound impact on our university in countless ways. He was a beacon of kindness and selflessness, always putting others first. His legacy of championing success for all students will inspire us forever. We mourn his loss, and we remember and celebrate the remarkable impact he has made on TCU's past, present, and future.\u201d",

Early this year, the Federal Trade Commission sued the CPG for alleged illegal pricing strategies; now, two California convenience store chains are following suit.\n\nThe proposed class action lawsuit, filed by Alqosh Enterprises and NMRM, Inc., on February 17 accused the brand of engaging in illegal price discrimination by violating a U.S. antitrust law, called the Robinson-Patman Act, and two California state laws.\n\n\u201cThe federal Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (the \u201cRPA\u201d), makes it illegal for a manufacturer\u2026 to charge higher prices to \u2018disfavored\u2019 customers, while charging lower prices to \u2018favored\u2019 customers, where those two sets of customers make the purchases for re-sale, and are in competition with each other,\u201d read the lawsuit.\n\nThe document positions the convenience chains as small buyers who possess a smaller quantity purchasing ability than large buyers such as Walmart. As such, they are placed at a competitive disadvantage, along with hundreds of other similarly sized stores across the state.\n\nPepsiCo and Frito-Lay have not publicly addressed the allegations presented in this lawsuit and did not respond to The Food Institute\u2019s request for comment. However, the parent responded to the earlier FTC complaint in January, stating the following:\n\n\u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court.\u201d\n\nThe RPA: A History of Accountability\n\nThe RPA was first enacted in 1936 to protect smaller retailers from chain store competition by fixing a minimum price for retail products. In this way, it prevents \u201cpreferred customers\u201d from being supplied products at a reduced price.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that price discrimination claims under the RPA must be evaluated alongside other antitrust policies, as price discriminations are, by and large lawful, as they often reflect different costs associated with dealing with diverse buyers, as outlined in the FTC\u2019s guide to antitrust laws.\n\nAlthough enforcement of the law has fallen out of vogue, a watershed suit in 1994 outside of F&B leveraged the act to allege large booksellers such as Penguin USA and St. Martin\u2019s Press engaged in nefarious pricing strategies that favored \u201ccertain large national chains and buying clubs,\u201d according to the FTC complaint. These declarations led seven book publishing goliaths to enter consent decrees to stop predatory pricing.\n\nA similar tactic is being mobilized in the F&B industry today, and PepsiCo\u2019s current legal woes are just one example of smaller businesses taking on larger enterprises using the RPA. In late 2024, the FTC also took on Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine & Spirits, the largest domestic alcohol distributor, for similar price discrimination tactics.\n\nMoreover, the lawyers for the California convenience store lawsuit have been separately pursuing a 2018 lawsuit accusing 5-Hour Energy drink maker Living Essentials of employing an illegal pricing strategy, reports Reuters. Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Living Essentials\u2019 challenge to the lawsuit in October, likely verifying its legal precedence.\n\nTensions are Bubbling\n\nThe January FTC lawsuit against PepsiCo signals a larger governmental struggle timed to the changing of the Presidential administration. As such, the CPG is implicated in a larger conversation around the interpretation of the law.\n\nThe lawsuit also leveraged the RPA to assert the chain participated in price discrimination by using advertising and promotional allowances to favor large businesses.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d said former FTC chair Lina M. Khan in a statement. Since then, Trump administration-appointed Andrew N. Ferguson has replaced her as chair.\n\nFerguson, on the other hand, is unlikely to hold PepsiCo accountable. On the same day of the FTC suit, he issued a statement calling the evocation of the RPA \u201ca political matter\u201d that advances a Democratic agenda.\n\n\u201cIn a cynical attempt to tie the hands of the incoming Trump Administration, the Democratic majority launches a major lawsuit on little more than a hunch,\u201d he said, referring to the PepsiCo case.\n\nThe Food Institute Podcast\n\nWhen it comes to data in the food-away-from home sector, what are the major challenges and opportunities companies are facing today? Tibersoft\u2019s Chris Hart joined The Food Institute Podcast to discuss how collaboration and data interoperability will be a key theme for the foodservice sector in the years to come.",

Parker, A Champion Of Diversity And Opportunity In Corporate America, Dies At 70 He is survived by his wife, Paula and three children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate leaders across the globe are mourning the loss of Ronald C. Parker, the fierce diversity advocate who carved pathways for Black executives, among others, to ascend to the highest levels. Due to his leadership prowess, he rose to senior vice president of Human Resources, Labor Relations, and Global Diversity & Inclusion at PepsiCo. Throughout much of that period, he served as an indefatigable, unwavering champion for advancing diverse executives and promoting efforts to ensure opportunities were available for all. After he retired from PepsiCo in 2010, he continued his mission, taking the helm of The Executive Leadership Council (ELC), the pre-eminent organization of Black global executives, and then served as president and CEO of the National Association of Securities Professionals (NASP), the premier organization focused on access and talent development for Blacks, minorities, and women within the financial services sector. His dedication to advocacy and service earned him recognition as a recipient of the 2024 BLACK ENTERPRISE Lifetime Diversity Crusader Award.\n\nBLACK ENTERPRISE\n\nHis sudden death at the age of 70 was announced Feb. 22nd. Maurice Cox, his close friend for more than four decades and the retired vice president for Diversity & Inclusion Development for PepsiCo said Parker\u2019s passing was \u201ca shock to all of us\u2026totally unexpected.\u201d\n\nAccording to TCU Magazine, Parker was raised in Brenham, Texas, a town of 18,000 between Austin and Houston, where his family raised cattle and planted cotton and corn. He started school during an era of segregation but later emerged as a student leader amid integration at Brenham High School, serving as captain of his high school football team, a member of the basketball team, and class president during his senior year. After a stint at Blinn College, based in Brenham, he transferred to Texas Christian University on a football scholarship. After earning a degree in political science, Parker was drafted by the Chicago Bears. A knee injury during his rookie season sidelined his pro football career. Forced to leave the gridiron, he decided to turn his focus to business.\n\nDuring his tenure at PepsiCo, the then-$60 billion soft drink and snack foods manufacturer, he would chair the Global Diversity and Inclusion Council. In that role, he shaped the strategic plans for corporate diversity and inclusion efforts, including companywide goal setting, engagement of employee resource groups, and development of external partnerships. Throughout his professional career, he was known for fairness and putting people first \u2014 even when he led more than 30 labor contract negotiations during his tenure.\n\nCox, who worked closely with Parker for 43 years, said, \u201cI can\u2019t overstate the value of having a true visionary as a colleague and friend,\u201d he maintained. \u201cWe worked together as a team and fought many battles. What we learned from each other is that you are only as good as the credits that you have.\u201d Taking note of that philosophy, Cox asserted that Parker\u2019s approach was driven by two critical factors: capability and accountability. \u201cIt allowed us to have a seat at the table and serve in an outsized role.\u201d\n\nSteve Williams, CEO of PepsiCo North America, stated, \u201cRon dedicated nearly 30 years to PepsiCo\u2026Throughout his career, he held multiple leadership roles across the company, shaping our people strategy and fostering a culture of growth and inclusion. A people-first leader, he was deeply committed to mentorship, leadership development, and creating opportunities for others \u2014 values that continue to influence our organization.\u201d\n\nBeyond PepsiCo, Ron remained a tireless advocate for equity and leadership. He was a founding member of PepsiCo\u2019s partnership with The Executive Leadership Council (ELC) and later served as its President and CEO, working to elevate Black executives in corporate America. He was also a dedicated leader at Texas Christian University (TCU), his alma mater, serving on the Board of Trustees and playing a key role in shaping the university\u2019s future, among other leadership roles.\n\nWhen he retired from PepsiCo, Parker would broaden his impact through ELC, where he drove efforts to build the ranks of Black C-suite executives and corporate board members.\n\nHe also made significant contributions as a member of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, the Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board of Procter & Gamble, and the Howard University School of Business Board of Visitors.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Paula, and three children.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Executive Leadership Council at 30: Push for Global Business Diversity",

            "content": "PepsiCo is a global food and beverage company with the headquarters in New York. It was founded in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. The company operates in over 200 countries and has a diverse portfolio of brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lay\u2019s, Doritos, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker.\n\nDespite the sell-off from May 2023, the PepsiCo stock remains within the all-time bullish cycle. Many times, within the bullish sequence, the price pulls back to give buyers the opportunity to buy lower and sell higher for profit. That appears to be the case for $PEP. The decline from May 2025 marked the wave (IV) of the supercycle degree within the bullish cycle from the all-time low. On 16th February 2025, we shared an article titled \u201dPepsiCo May End The Bearish Cycle From 2023 Soon\u201d. In the article, we used the chart below to identify the extreme area for wave (IV). The blue box on our charts show members where to buy within a bullish sequence and where to sell within a bearish sequence.\n\nPepsiCo weekly chart 16th February, 2025\n\nWe identified 142.13-116.60 as the blue box where we expected wave (IV) to finish after a 7-swing structure. Afterwards, wave (V) should begin. If not a bullish impulse wave reaction, at least a 3-swing bounce should ensue from this extreme area. The chart below shows the price\u2019s response after about a week.\n\nPepsiCo weekly chart 22th February, 2025\n\nThe stock found support at the blue box just as expected. Thus, price bounced off the entrance of the blue box \u2013 barely at the 142.13 proposed entry level. While price holds above 116.60, it should separate further from the blue box. When the rally reaches 162.53, traders should consider closing half of the trade in profit and adjust the rest of the position to breakeven. Until 162.5, buyers from the blue box should continue to hold the long, while keeping the stop at 116. Therefore, the upside appears to be favored in the short and long terms.",

            "content": "Latam 23/02/2025\n\nTalking about potatoes may seem simple, especially in an agricultural country like Brazil, where chains such as soy, corn, coffee and sugarcane dominate agribusiness discussions\n\nHowever, the supposed triviality of the first \u201ccrunch\u201d when opening a bag of snacks like Ruffles or Lay\u2019s has behind it a production chain that involves challenges, high technology and a network of agricultural producers that supply PepsiCo.\n\nAs explained to AgFeed by the agribusiness manager responsible for the seed chain at PepsiCo Brazil, Nat\u00e1lia de Oliveira, each potato that arrives at the chip industry has traveled a three-year journey to the industry, which involves international routes \u2013 and a challenge to eliminate them.\n\nCurrently, the production process begins with the development of new varieties in PepsiCo\u2019s research areas in Wisconsin, in the United States. The best varieties are sent to Brazil, where they undergo quarantine and are stored in the company\u2019s germplasm bank in Minas Gerais.\n\nThe potatoes are then sent to 25 partner producers, who multiply the seed potatoes in their fields. These farmers, who are partners of the company, are responsible for expanding production and cultivating the tubers that will eventually feed the company\u2019s factories. Oliveira estimates that PepsiCo Brazil requires just over 100,000 tons of potatoes per year to supply its domestic chip production.\n\nTo ensure this supply, seed potatoes are at the base of the chain. Today, around 70% of these seeds are produced in Brazil, by the company\u2019s partner producers. But the rest still needs to be imported from countries such as Chile and some European nations.\n\nAnd this stage of the production process has received special attention from Pepsico today. The company\u2019s goal is for 100% of the seed potatoes used in Brazil to be produced locally by 2028.\n\nThe company\u2019s objective is to reduce risks in the supply chain and avoid dependence on imports, which have regulatory and logistical barriers.\n\nThe company intends to achieve this self-sufficiency by investing with producers so that the multiplication of seed potatoes takes place entirely in Brazil.\n\nThe plan is to replace this partial import with in-house production on local farms and seedbeds.\n\nAccording to ABBA (Brazilian Potato Association), there is a worrying scenario for seed potatoes in Brazil. Although the association does not have the exact number of imports of this product here, it assesses that the country is experiencing a scenario of difficulty in importing these seed potatoes.\n\nLess than two years ago, in 2023, Brazilian producers were surprised by the news that traditional European companies would export only 30% of the usual volume of seed potatoes to Brazil, due to the intense drought in producing regions such as the Netherlands, the main local supplier.\n\nNat\u00e1lia de Oliveira points out that producers have still faced difficulties in importing materials from Chile.\n\n\u201cMany companies have increased their production of potato-based products. We cannot lose control of seed management, because otherwise, in the future, we will not have the product available,\u201d he says.\n\nThe PepsiCo executive also adds that most of the seed potatoes used in the national industry are produced here to have \u201csecurity in supply, both of seeds and in the industrial part\u201d.\n\nABBA estimates that Brazil\u2019s annual production averages 4 million tons of potatoes. Of this total, around 350,000 tons are used as seeds, around 500,000 tons are used to produce chips and straw, around 900,000 tons are processed to produce frozen pre-fried potatoes and 2 million tons are consumed fresh.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to consider the imports of more than 300,000 tons of frozen pre-fried potatoes, equivalent to 600,000 tons of fresh potatoes,\u201d adds Natalino Shimoyama, executive director of ABBA, in a recent publication by the association.\n\nProduction takes place in seven states in an area of \u200b\u200bclose to 115 thousand hectares, considering all productions.\n\nIn the field\n\nMarcelo Cazarotto is one of the company\u2019s 25 partner producers. For 15 years, the potatoes planted on his farm in Casa Branca (SP), a city near S\u00e3o Carlos and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, have been supplied to the multinational company.\n\nMarcelo is still one of the producers who make up the less than 30% who import seed potatoes. He told AgFeed that he uses a Chilean variety, approved by PepsiCo, for cultivation. \u201cToday I only work with imported varieties, because I believe they are of better quality. In the future, not too far away, we have a project to produce the tuber on our own farm,\u201d he said.\n\nCazarotto mentions that, for the past two years, many restrictions have been imposed on producers, making it difficult to release imported seed potatoes. \u201cBarred cargo brings us a heavy cost,\u201d he says.\n\nHe explains that he currently imports ready-made seed potatoes from Chile, but that in the future he wants to take control of this stage.\n\n\u201cThe project here is to build a greenhouse and laboratory to produce the seeds on the farm itself. In addition to the risk of exporting, we are also at the mercy of currencies such as the dollar and the euro,\u201d he explains.\n\nThis project illustrates well what PepsiCo intends to do with producers to ensure that the supply of seed potatoes is 100% national: promote current partners and seek new ones, so as not to depend on bureaucracy when importing.\n\nOf the 3,200 hectares of his property, Cazarotto estimates that 750 hectares are dedicated to potatoes, with planting lasting from April to June, with the harvest spread between July and October, and even November, depending on the harvest. He also grows soybeans, sorghum, corn, wheat and even raises cattle.\n\nLast year, the producer suffered from heat waves on his land, which reduced potato production a little. With the forecast of \u201ccooling off\u201d in the coming months, he expects better potato production, which, according to him, depends a lot on the weather.\n\nUnlike Mato Grosso and the Matopiba regions, the agricultural properties in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo are medium-sized, just like Marcelo Cazarotto\u2019s. He explains that it makes a lot of sense, because of this, to plant some type of fruit and vegetables, as they bring a higher profitability than grains.\n\n\u201cWith soybeans, even though they are stuck at high levels, we depend a lot on the market. Potatoes end up being one of the main crops because they yield more per hectare.\u201d Added to this is a guaranteed buyer, which is PepsiCo, and the crop is a shining light for producers.\n\nHe estimates that the cost per hectare of potatoes is close to R$60,000, as unlike soybeans and corn, these are crops that require more employees and more appropriate management.\n\nToday, his potato farm uses only a chemical insecticide. The rest of the products are organic. He believes that the cover crop he plants on his property also helps with the results.",

However, carbonated beverages already contain carbonation, making it difficult for those who do not like carbonation to arrange drinks without it. The undiluted type of \"C.C. Lemon\" and \"DecaVita C,\" which are popular carbonated beverages, do not contain carbonation, so it is possible to make your own original drinks. Suntory Foods International Ltd. The \"Drink Bar at Home\" series was born from the desire for people to experience a freshly made drink bar at home, and now \" Drink Bar at Home Pepsi Cola \" has been added to the lineup! In addition, \"POP Melon Soda,\" \"C.C. Lemon,\" and \"DecaVita C,\" which were already on the market, are now available in new, redesigned packaging, and we will review them in a moment!\n\nSince it is undiluted, it has more calories than the regular type of product.\n\nNow that we have checked the package, we would like to check the nutritional label ingredients. Per 100 ml...\n\nThe side of the package also has a memory label, so it is easy to know how much to pour! And the side also has a recipe on it, with the recommended ratio of 1:4 to divide.\n\nThe cap is labeled \"diluted type,\" so you can avoid drinking the undiluted drink by mistake.\n\nLet's start with a review of the \"Drink Bar at Home\" series. The \"Drink Bar at Home\" series is an undiluted type, and one bottle can make up to 10 drinks !\n\nI actually made it by splitting it!\n\nWe will mix it with soda water, ice cream, or milk! Saiga NAK\n\nAfter checking the package, I would like to try making a drink right away!\n\nwith soda water\n\nKOKOKOKO Saiga NAK\n\nFirst, let's start with the newly released \"Home Drink Bar Pepsi-Cola\"! Pepsi-Cola is a carbonated beverage that cannot be missed, so we are happy to see it in undiluted form. The first step is to mix it with sparkling water.\n\nPepsi-Cola is ready to drink! Saiga NAK\n\nPour the \"Home Drink Bar Pepsi-Cola\" into sparkling water, and Pepsi-Cola is ready to drink! It is not different from the regular Pepsi Cola you usually drink, and it is very complete. You can enjoy Coke at any time, which is useful in various situations such as watching movies and playing games. You can make it to your own personal taste depending on the amount of the drink you want to make, so let's try to arrange it!\n\nC.C.C. Lemon Split\n\nKokko Kokko Saiga NAK\n\nNext, let's try mixing it with C.C. Lemon. Pour and mix, and the color becomes a slightly transparent cola color.\n\nC.C.C. Lemon! Saiga NAK\n\nThe taste is like a lemon cola, with a sour lemon taste. The lemon flavor is stronger than the cola flavor, and the spiciness is less than that of C.C. Lemon, resulting in a mild finish.\n\nWith milk\n\nDobodobodobo Saiga NAK\n\nNext, we would like to try mixing it with milk. The combination of Kohler and milk is not a combination that we are familiar with, but what do you think?\n\nMilk! Saiga NAK\n\nWhen mixed, the color is like caf\u00e9 au lait. The taste is sweet like milky! Combining milk with undiluted Pepsi Cola made the cola taste disappear and brought out a rich sweet taste. You will want to drink it all at once when you are tired or want something sweet!\n\nMake a cola float with vanilla ice cream\n\nCoke Float Saiga NAK\n\nFinally, we tried a cola float style with vanilla ice cream. The rich sweetness of vanilla ice cream and the taste of cola is perfect! You can enjoy the taste of vanilla ice cream and cola at the same time without losing the taste of cola as you can with milk.\n\nI also tried the renewed \"Home Drink Bar\" series!\n\nThe \"Home Drink Bar\" series has a new package, and we tried mixing the three original drinks with soda water!\n\n\"Home Drink Bar C.C. Lemon\n\nUndiluted C.C. Lemon Saiga NAK\n\nFill a cup with ice, add soda water, and pour in \"Home Drink Bar C.C. Lemon\" to create the pale yellow color of C.C. Lemon.\n\nC.C. Lemon is ready to drink! Saiga NAK\n\nFollowing the recipe, the familiar C.C. Lemon was completed by mixing the undiluted solution and soda water at a ratio of 1:4! You can make it thicker or thinner depending on how much undiluted solution you mix, so make it thicker or thinner depending on your mood!\n\n\"POP Melon Soda at Home Drink Bar\" (Japanese only)\n\nUndiluted POP Melon Soda Saiga NAK\n\nNext, we will mix the \"Home Drink Bar POP Melon Soda\".\n\nPOP Melon Soda is ready to drink! Saiga NAK\n\nThe recipe calls for a 1:4 ratio, which gives the drink the flavor of POP Melon Soda. POP Melon Soda is characterized by its old-fashioned coffee shop taste, and we have been able to reproduce it well. If you top it with vanilla ice cream, it becomes a cream soda as well.\n\n\"Home Drink Bar Decavita C\"\n\nUndiluted DecaVita C Saiga NAK\n\nFinally, the \"Home Drink Bar DecaVita C\" is broken into pieces.\n\nDecaVita C is now ready to drink! Saiga NAK\n\nLike regular DecaVita C, \"Home Drink Bar DecaVita C\" also contains royal jelly extract and vitamins! All you have to do is mix it with soda water according to the 1:4 ratio, and your DecaVita C is ready to drink! The taste is like a nutritional drink like DecaVita C. This time, it was mixed with soda water, but it would be good to use it as a syrup for shaved ice!",

Suja Life, the company behind cold-pressed juice brands Suja Organic and Vive Organic, acquired the campy soda brand from PepsiCo and announced a serious relaunch complete with new packaging, gut-healthy ingredients, and much less sugar. To make the exciting news even more exciting, Slice is now available at Costco stores, at a much more affordable price point than your local grocery store.\n\n\"This healthy soda comes in an Orange and Lemon Lime 8-pack.

She claims that she got a variety pack of 8 of the \"grown-up\" version of the classic for just $12.99. \"I have to say this tastes just like I remember it,\" she says in the video. Her followers rushed to add commentary. \"I just picked these up today and they are so refreshing and good!! I have to hide a few so the kids don't drink them all!!\" one wrote. \"This is seriously SO good!! Orange is my absolute favorite!\" added another. \"Love having these ready for a bubbly treat without going down the slippery slope of drinking a 12pack of sugar soda,\" a third chimed in.\n\nWhile the new-and-improved Slice is available in many flavors \u2013 including Grapefruit Spritz, Lemon Lime, Orange, and Strawberry flavors \u2013 Costco sells just the orange and lemon lime. For the other flavors, you will have to head over to select Target, Albertson's, and HEB stores. Later this year, Classic Cola, Ginger Ale, and Grape will join the lineup.\n\nSuja Life maintains that the sodas are made with gut-healthy probiotic and prebiotic ingredients will be all-natural and offer superior nutrition, function, and taste while remaining low in sugar and calories. There is no high-fructose corn syrup involved and each can has 5 grams of sugar.\n\nFans of the OG soda shared their joy on social media upon the initial announcement. \"We need the original Orange Slice forget the healthy alternative.. orange slice is the greatest orange pop that ever existed,\" commented a fan of Instagram. \"Welcome back,\" added another. \"True nostalgia in a can,\" a third chimed in.",

            "content": "From The Bureau\n\nBrookfield Bet Billions on Shanghai Land as China\u2019s Market Peaked and Secured $276 Million Bank of China Refinancing Under Mark Carney as Market Crashed\n\nA review of corporate documents reveals that Brookfield\u2014the influential $900 billion Canadian investment fund from which Liberal Prime Minister-to-be Mark Carney stepped away from in order to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada\u2019s leader\u2014maintains over $3 billion in politically sensitive investments with Chinese state-linked real estate and energy companies, along with a substantial offshore banking presence. One of its major real estate ventures, a $750 million entry into high-end Shanghai commercial property in 2013, involved a Hong Kong tycoon affiliated with the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)\u2014which the CIA labels a central \u201cunited front\u201d entity of Beijing.\n\nThe investment occurred while China\u2019s real estate bubble was peaking. Last year, as China\u2019s market crashed, and vacancies soared in Shanghai, Brookfield under Carney secured hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from the Bank of China to refinance its Shanghai commercial land holdings. According to The Bureau\u2019s research, this emergency loan came a decade after Carney, serving as Governor of the Bank of England, aided Beijing by facilitating the Bank of China\u2019s expansion of its global financial footprint. In his 2013 speech, UK at the Heart of Renewed Globalisation, Carney announced that \u201cThe Bank of England [has] signed an agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2026 Helping the internationalisation of the Renminbi is a global good.\u201d\n\nWhile Brookfield had already amassed well over three billion dollars in estimated investments and managed assets in China before Carney took the helm in 2020, research indicates that he played a role in expanding the firm\u2019s footprint there. This included refinancing its 2019 acquisition of Shanghai commercial real estate\u2014initially valued at approximately CAD $2 billion at the peak of China\u2019s real estate bubble\u2014though its actual worth was likely significantly lower when Brookfield secured nearly $300 million at four percent interest from the Bank of China last year.\n\nGiven that his history of deep investment in China\u2014if not his holdings, reportedly now placed in a blind trust\u2014could potentially color Carney\u2019s plans for Canada, these developments are especially notable as a trade war between the United States and Beijing escalates.\n\nCarney and his cabinet members will be sworn in at 11 a.m. this morning at Rideau Hall, the Governor General\u2019s official residence. The timing of Carney\u2019s appointment as prime minister adds urgency to ongoing questions about potential conflicts of interest, with matters further complicated by reports that his first international meeting will be with European leaders next week\u2014who are themselves grappling with sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration.\n\nBrookfield\u2019s substantial investments in China\u2014directly or indirectly involving state-linked entities\u2014include hundreds of millions in renewable energy assets acquired through TerraForm Global in 2017, a $750 million real estate stake in China Xintiandi since 2013, a 2019 Shanghai land purchase valued at approximately $2 billion, a $100 million joint venture with GLP for solar projects launched in 2018, and reported plans to raise hundreds of millions more in both real estate and China green sector investments.\n\nIn 2013, the year Xi Jinping became president, Brookfield made its first major foray into China\u2019s real estate sector, investing up to $750 million for a 22% stake in China Xintiandi, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed developer Shui On Land. \u201cThe cornerstone investment in China Xintiandi gives Brookfield access to high-quality assets in Shanghai while creating opportunities for future growth through asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships,\u201d Bill Powell, Brookfield\u2019s Australasian chief executive, said in a press release. \u201cChina is a key market in Brookfield\u2019s long-term growth strategy, and partnering with Shui On Land to invest in China Xintiandi is an ideal entry point for us.\u201d\n\nAlthough Shui On Land is not state-owned, it operates within China\u2019s tightly regulated urban redevelopment sector. One of Brookfield\u2019s primary real estate partners in the region is Vincent Lo, Shui On Land\u2019s principal, who previously served as a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)\u2014an advisory body that ostensibly includes diverse political parties and organizations but ultimately operates under Chinese Communist Party leadership.\n\nIts members, especially high-profile business leaders, often support policy objectives aligned with the central government\u2019s agenda. Lo\u2019s decades of membership in the CPPCC highlights his proximity to Beijing and adds important context to any business dealings he undertakes\u2014such as those with Brookfield.\n\nFor example, in a 2024 interview with China Daily, Lo made his position on Chinese Communist rule in Hong Kong clear: \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t really understand what \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is, until after a lot of disruptive demonstrations in Hong Kong that really made us realize we are under one country,\u201d he told the Communist Party\u2013controlled news outlet.\n\nFurther illuminating sensitive questions that geopolitical analysts might consider regarding Brookfield\u2019s partnership with such investors, the China Daily interviewer asked:\n\n\u201cVincent, since you mentioned that our motherland has improved and matured, understanding what the world is all about\u2014does that diminish Hong Kong\u2019s role in any way?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, [Hong Kong is] more so [important] because right now, for example, the US and its close allies are all trying to contain China\u2019s growth,\u201d Lo answered. \u201cAnd so Hong Kong as a special administrative region, we have a special sort of angle to handle this situation. Because I don\u2019t believe multinational corporations can ignore the China market.\u201d\n\nAccording to China Daily, Vincent Lo served as a director of Hang Seng Bank in 2010 alongside Cheng Yu-tung, a prominent Hong Kong tycoon and member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. Documents show Cheng was involved in Macau casino holdings through a consortium of Hong Kong investors, including Stanley Ho\u2014an association that drew scrutiny from U.S. and Canadian law enforcement and intelligence. Authorities were particularly concerned about Cheng\u2019s dealings with individuals suspected by New Jersey gaming regulators of engaging in illicit activities within Macau\u2019s private VIP gaming rooms. [Cheng Yu-tung also had reported dealings with Donald Trump, before Trump ran for office in the United States.]\n\nDuring his tenure as Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, Carney deepened financial ties between the UK and China, most notably with his \u2018money swap deal\u2019 with China\u2019s central bank, letting each country borrow the other\u2019s cash\u2014up to \u00a321 billion. Carney said it could lead to a yuan-trading hub in London. This pact made it easier for businesses to use China\u2019s money worldwide, boosting Beijing\u2019s goal to rival the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn March 2024, as Brookfield\u2019s chair, Mark Carney was among a select group of Western executives who met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing\u2014an event The Telegram described as part of a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d amid Beijing\u2019s efforts to stabilize its economy.\n\nThen, 11 years after strengthening ties between London and Beijing through the Bank of China agreement, Carney returned to Beijing in October 2024\u2014just a month after joining Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s economic task force. During this visit, he held meetings with senior Chinese officials, including a private session with Beijing Mayor Yin Yong.\n\nThe following month, as reported by Bloomberg on November 5, 2024, Brookfield secured a $276 million loan from the Bank of China\u2014underscoring Carney and the firm\u2019s deep financial connections to the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s anonymous sources, the Canadian asset manager faced a looming offshore senior loan of approximately $700 million due by year-end. The loan was originally used to finance Brookfield\u2019s 2019 acquisition of a Shanghai office tower complex from Greenland Hong Kong Holdings Ltd.\u2014a CAD 2-billion transaction that ranked among the largest commercial property purchases by a foreign firm in China. Bloomberg reported that the Bank of China loan carried an annual interest rate of around 4%.\n\n\u201cTalks are unfolding against the backdrop of a severe real estate slump in China, where rising supply and a slowing economy have pushed office vacancy in some prime Shanghai districts to 21.5 percent, the highest level in two decades,\u201d Bloomberg noted.\n\nThat a state-owned bank provided this financing amid China\u2019s plunging real estate market suggests the Bank of China extended a critical financial lifeline to Brookfield during a period of acute economic stress. While not classified as an investment, the loan underscores Brookfield\u2019s politically sensitive ties to Beijing\u2019s main bank\u2014helping to sustain its multibillion-dollar real estate footprint in China under Carney\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn 2017, Brookfield invested $750 million to acquire TerraForm Global, a renewable power company originally spun out of SunEdison, an American solar power company that filed for bankruptcy in 2016. TerraForm\u2019s portfolio included 952 megawatts of solar and wind assets in emerging markets. \u201cThis transaction expands our presence in Brazil and provides a platform for further growth in India and China\u2019s attractive, high-growth renewables markets,\u201d the company said.\n\nNotably, TerraForm\u2019s indirect ties to JIC Capital\u2014a Chinese state-owned entity that invested in SunEdison\u2014suggest that these power purchase agreements may have involved government-backed contracts. This acquisition positioned Brookfield as a direct investor in China\u2019s expanding clean energy market, a sector that the Chinese government has actively encouraged for foreign partnerships. It also aligns with Carney\u2019s urgent vision\u2014promoted through multilateral entities such as the World Economic Forum\u2014to mobilize cross-border investment in pursuit of climate change mitigation.\n\nBrookfield has also transacted directly with a Chinese state-owned enterprise. In 2017, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners sold its 28% stake in Transelec\u2014Chile\u2019s largest electric transmission company\u2014to China Southern Power Grid for approximately $1.3 billion. The Transelec sale is one of the largest Chinese acquisitions in Chile\u2019s energy sector and exemplifies Brookfield\u2019s lucrative conduit role in high-level infrastructure transactions with Chinese state-owned entities.\n\nBrookfield\u2019s presence in China extends beyond asset sales. In 2018, the company formed a 50:50 joint venture with Global Logistic Properties (GLP), a leading Asia-based logistics firm, to install 300 megawatts of distributed solar projects across China, with a pipeline that could eventually expand to 1 gigawatt. Although GLP is not a Chinese state entity, it is partially owned by Vanke Group, whose largest shareholder is Shenzhen Metro\u2014a well-known state-owned enterprise.\n\nIn his capacity at Brookfield, Carney\u2019s interactions with Chinese leadership became even more direct. On October 20, 2024, he traveled to Beijing to attend the Financial Street Forum, an annual conference organized by the Chinese government to advance financial policy coordination with foreign investors. During this visit, Carney held a private meeting with Beijing\u2019s Mayor Yin Yong at the city\u2019s Financial Regulatory Bureau headquarters.\n\nIn language reminiscent of Chinese Communist Party framing, according to a Chinese government website statement, Beijing\u2019s mayor \u201cencouraged Brookfield Asset Management and BlackRock to seize opportunities, tap into their strengths, and increase their investment and business presence in Beijing. He invited both companies to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and share the dividends of Beijing\u2019s high-quality development and high-standard opening-up.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cCarney highlighted Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s keen interest in seizing development opportunities in China, further expanding its business in Beijing, and deepening cooperation with relevant partners in areas such as green finance, fund management, and infrastructure investment,\u201d the Chinese statement said.\n\nBeyond his corporate dealings, Carney has also interacted with Chinese financial institutions at global economic forums, appearing alongside figures such as Jin Liqun, President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB is a China-led institution that promotes large-scale infrastructure investments backed by Chinese capital. These ties suggest that Carney has built close relationships with key figures in China\u2019s financial and political circles\u2014connections that could shape his economic policies as he assumes leadership of Canada\u2019s government today.\n\nCarney resigned from Brookfield in January 2025 to focus on his leadership bid for Canada\u2019s Liberal Party and secured a stunning victory this week in what CBC described as \u201clargely a referendum on who is best to take on the U.S. president.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarney, who does not hold a seat in the House of Commons and has never been elected, secured more than 85 percent of the points \u2026 [and] dominated in all 343 ridings,\u201d CBC reported, noting that while he was widely seen as the front-runner, \u201ceven members of his camp were surprised by the resounding results Sunday evening.\u201d\n\nCarney\u2019s team has stated that he placed all his assets in a blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest. However, questions remain about whether this step fully distances him from Brookfield. His opponent, Pierre Poilievre, has called for greater transparency regarding Brookfield\u2019s financial dealings, while Poilievre\u2019s party argues that Canadian media has not sufficiently scrutinized Carney\u2019s background.\n\nMeanwhile, Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research (CICTAR) has reported that Brookfield\u2019s offshore structuring enabled it to avoid an estimated $6.5 billion in taxes in 2021 alone. \u201cWhile this may be legal, it has large negative impacts on public funding for essential services,\u201d the report stated. Two years ago, with Carney at the helm, Brookfield faced criticism for using offshore tax havens and various loopholes on its properties in London and its Manhattan West holdings in New York. According to CICTAR, in the case of Brookfield\u2019s Canary Wharf properties, the management firm\u2019s \u00a32.6 billion co-ownership deal in 2015\u2014alongside the Qatar Investment Authority\u2014was structured through a labyrinth of holding companies and subsidiaries, including entities in known tax havens like Jersey and Bermuda\n\nThe Paradise Papers (a 2017 leak of offshore records) further revealed numerous Brookfield-linked entities registered through the Appleby law firm. For example, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners Limited and Brookfield Property Partners Limited were incorporated in Bermuda, according to the Paradise Papers data. Records show Brookfield had many Bermuda-based vehicles dating back to the mid-2000s\u2014such as Brookfield Asset Management Holdings Ltd. (Bermuda, incorporated 2006)\u2014and various Brookfield Infrastructure and Property subsidiaries formed between 2007 and 2013. Brookfield Asset Management was also listed as an officer of a Cayman Islands company (Brookfield Brazil Ltd., incorporated in 1995) in the Offshore Leaks database.\n\nAs Carney takes office today, scrutiny of his financial dealings and Brookfield\u2019s deep ties to China and offshore banking is likely to intensify. With Canada\u2019s economic future becoming ever more entangled in global trade conflicts, Carney\u2019s business background offers both a wealth of expertise and a complex network of financial entanglements\u2014factors that could potentially produce lasting consequences for Canadian citizens, whether they are fully aware or not.\n\nEarlier this week, The Global Times, widely regarded as a vocal outlet for the Chinese Communist Party, signaled Beijing\u2019s approval of Carney\u2019s victory\u2014at least for now.\n\n\u201cWhen asked about Mark Carney\u2019s leadership win in Canada\u2019s ruling Liberal Party and his expected rise to prime minister, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that China has taken note of the reports and extends its congratulations to Mr. Carney,\u201d the outlet reported.\n\nMao added, \u201cWe hope Canada maintains an objective and rational understanding of China and adopts a pragmatic approach, working with China to improve and develop bilateral relations.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau is a reader-supported publication.

According to a memo from CEO Ramon Laguarta, the company will eliminate workforce representation targets, discontinue the role of chief DEI officer, and broaden its supplier diversity program to encompass all small businesses, among other adjustments.\n\nTarget in particular is under backlash regarding its previous DEI initiatives, as it is embroiled in the midst of a class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund filed a proposed class action complaint in Fort Myers, Florida, on Jan. 31 alleging that the firm deceived investors about the risks associated with its DEI and ESG activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Target\u2019s stock price skyrocketed between Aug. 26, 2022, and Nov. 19, 2024 (the Class Period) due to misrepresenting the dangers. This also caused investors to pay higher prices for Target shares throughout the Class Period, which finally declined in the following months.\n\nShareholders believe the store misled them by inadvertently urging them to support management\u2019s \u201cmisuse of investor funds to serve political and social goals.\u201d The complaint claims CEO Brian Cornell and other officials failed to sufficiently convey the risks associated with customer boycotts as a result of the company\u2019s DEI policy.",

            "content": "ORLANDO, FLA. \u2014 PepsiCo, Inc. plans to evolve its portfolio to add more value, manufacture healthier options, and create more availability for consumers to purchase its products throughout the day in a strategy outlined by the company at the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a great sales company but we\u2019re trying to also refresh our iconic offerings and working hard at sodium reduction, fat reduction,\u201d said Ramon Laguarta, chief executive officer and chairman of the board, PepsiCo. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard at the removal of artificials so that we give consumers the same great experience, now better. Just an example, I don\u2019t know if you saw our Super Bowl commercial with Lays. We\u2019re trying to anchor Lays in what it is: real potatoes that are grown and consumers can have simple pleasures in a very authentic way. Now those Lays have 20% less sodium than they had two years ago, and consumers are accepting that very well.\u201d\n\nThe company also is incorporating alternative cooking methods like baking and popping for potato products to reduce oil usage. Laguarta also mentioned Frito Lay\u2019s Simply line of snacks is relaunching this year, which takes core brands like Doritos and Cheetos, and adds functional and natural ingredients like whole grains for additional fiber, uses cheese, and eliminates artificial colors and flavors.\n\n\u201cRefreshing our iconics with great taste and better-for-you ingredients is core to our strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to evolve not only our core offerings, but we continue to offer consumers new offerings that keep consumers in the category, increase the frequency of consumption of our categories.\u201d\n\nConvenience and customization\n\nOne way to keep consumers coming back to PepsiCo products is through price pack architecture for cost value and convenience, which is another area the company is focused on in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe multipack business in the US is already a $4.5 billion dollar business,\u201d Laguarta said. \u201cFive years ago it was less than a billion dollars. We see consumers adopting multipacks and small portions as the go-to solution to have our categories throughout the day. At the same time, we\u2019re providing consumers with different alternatives like mini-canisters and mini-beverages that also help consumers with convenience and portion control. This will be a driver for us long term from the price point, from the combination, and from enabling the consumer to create their own multipacks through direct-to-consumer options.\u201d\n\nLaguarta added that direct-to-consumer customization is \u201ca big strategic lever for us, and we now have the capability to automate multipacks to have endless combinations of multipacks, and that will be a solution for the future. The same with small canisters and large canisters.\u201d\n\nAlso on the topic of customization is the company\u2019s Gatorade and Propel brands, which Laguarta said are well positioned for growth in the functional hydration category.\n\n\u201cWe have invested in an infrastructure for powders and mixing that allows us to create much more complex solutions in sachets and tablets, and we\u2019re going to invest massively behind that business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now a billion-dollar business in the US, our Gatorade and Propel powders, and this will be a driver of growth for us. We can provide much more functionality in every sachet.\u201d\n\nAway-from-home concepts\n\nLaguarta said the company also is evolving its culinary and away-from-home options that incorporate PepsiCo products, opening additional occasions for consumers to interact and eat those foods outside of snack occasions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a few times how we\u2019re thinking about our brands participating in meals throughout the day, and we\u2019ve been inspiring consumers around the world to use our products in meal locations,\u201d he said.\n\nSome examples Laguarta mentioned were Lays chips being added to rice bowls in Asia; potato omelettes in southern Europe that incorporate Lays at the company\u2019s La Tortilleria locations; Tostitos Tostianguis carts in Mexico, where consumers can build their own Tostitos-based meals; Doritos Loaded food trucks at US universities; and the new Drips, which is a mobile, walk-up beverage concept where Pepsi products can be mixed with other ingredients for customized drinks.\n\n\u201cYou can see how we\u2019re evolving and participating in meals, but also giving consumers the opportunity to buy more elevated experiences of our products throughout the day,\u201d Laguarta said.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s\n\nin all three North American business units \u2014 FLNA (Frito Lay North America), Quaker Foods North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America \u2014 in the year ended Dec. 28, 2024.

            "content": "Back in the \u2018old time\u2019, pre-pandemic, PepsiCo ramped up its capital expenditure (CapEx) for several very good reasons, not the least of which was a desire to have a much more robust tech stack and data foundation for future growth. That was back in 2019. Flash forward to 2025 and C\u00a3O Ramon Laguarta is able to reflect on the results of that spend, stating:\n\nWhen we started the journey, we said, \u2018Let's take this company from good to great\u2019 and we decided to invest against the business. We've been investing in the business to strengthen our brands, to make sure our brands are preferred in the marketplace, also to remove some of the bottlenecks that we had in the past in manufacturing. We keep modernizing our infrastructure for supply chain, warehousing and manufacturing and creating the system foundations and the digital, the data foundations that will enable us to be a more intelligent, more precise, more agile company in the future.\n\nToday PepsiCo is a global conglomerate with fingers in multiple food and beverage pies. Its annual revenue of $92 billion - as of full year 2024 - is broken down into 60% from convenience foods ($53 billion) withe the remaining 40% ($39 billion) coming from beverages brands. Over the decades, as is inevitable for enterprises on this scale, things became complicated behind the scenes in terms of the tech landscape. This is being addressed, according to to Laguarta:\n\nWe are simplifying and harmonizing our systems, we're connecting our systems. We're on a long journey of changing the systems in the US, some of our older markets. We're almost done with our SAP rollout in the US. This will give us the foundation. Together with the investments we've made in data lakes - our data lakes are connected now - we can have many more use cases to digitalize the company.\n\n(PepsiCo has a lot of skin in the SAP camp. Back in 2004, it shifted from Oracle apps to MySAP Business Suite, covering ERP. CRM and supply chain management (SCM). Back in 2017, the company went live on a single global instance of SuccessFactors Employee Central for core HR for more than 260,000 employees, while in 2020 work began on rolling out SAP S/4 HANA for ERP Financial.)\n\nAll of this effort has been ongoing for many years, explains Laguarta, but has been driving incremental productivity:\n\nWe've created a network of global capability centers that allows us now to avoid duplications, to do things once for the whole company and to make sure that the information is in one place for the whole company, which gives us a lot of intelligence and quick lift and shift. And obviously, as we have better systems and better data, more integrated data, we're now able to have business cases for agility [and] intelligence through digitalization\u2026Simplifying IT systems [gives us] productivity, but it's an enabler to the digital transformation of the company.\n\nTangible\n\nIn 2025, Laguarta can point to tangible results of this investment in future proofing the company, starting with consumer engagement:\n\nObviously, we can create content in a different way. We can personalize content in a much better way than we used to do two or three years ago. In terms of sales execution, we're able to have much more precise planogram execution, enabling our frontline people with tools, so they know they have already a predicted order, but they know for every store what they sell and what is the next action they need to take. So an integrated end-to-end precision execution.\n\nManufacturing is another focus, with much effort going into automating factories:\n\nDigital twins allow us to have a much lower cost in terms of maintenance and some of the planning and automation in robotics. One [thing] that I'm very interested on and we're becoming pretty good is end-to-end planning. If you thought about the past, we used to plan by functions, by market, it was not a very good end-to-end planning. Imagine the fact that we're selling one billion-plus units of products every day around the world, that is a lot of operational complexity. When you do end-to-end planning, you reduce a lot of waste. You reduce a lot of waste from your system. We're becoming a much better forecasting company, and that translates into much more productivity all the way down to procurement. So some examples of how we're becoming a much more intelligent company based on the investments we've made in the last few years, the systems are better, the data infrastructure is better, now we can have better use cases that we deploy across the company through our global capability centers.\n\nLooking to longer term infrastructure plans, Laguarda foresees a much more integrated approach between the two arms of the business:\n\nWe're now testing and learning, mixing centers and delivery operations that will combine our foods and beverage business in a way that will give us a lot of optionality in how we service future demand that we think will be much more digital and delivery to home. Those capabilities can be done together. So as you think about PBNA (Pepsi Beverages North America) and PFNA (Pepsi Food North America), we're building the future together. And the future together will be common technology, common data infrastructure and common physical infrastructure. In the 2025 key markets in the US, you have a lot of assets that will be combined, which gives us tremendous advantage versus having two different infrastructures sitting side-by-side. Now hopefully, we're not starving any businesses from growth opportunities. We have 13 or 14 anchor markets internationally that will drive 90%, 95% of our growth in the future, in the next 10 years, and we're making sure that from the infrastructure, from the talent, from the digital and data infrastructure, those businesses are going to be very well-funded, so we capture that growth opportunity.\n\nHe adds:\n\nI think we have the right processes, the right resource allocation process, to drive both. But if you think about the US, more and more the infrastructure will be combined, which gives us tremendous opportunity to service a Walmart or to service a direct-to-home delivery in ways that right now we cannot. We were not able to do in the past because our systems did not allow us to do it. Now we have the systems, we have the capabilities to do that. Now we're putting the infrastructure in place to be able to capture that opportunity.\n\nMy take\n\nThis has clearly been a journey for us. We're well into the journey. And the results have been pretty good.\n\nA good exemplar of the benefits of long term thinking around tech and digital investment - and, did you notice, no blue-sky pronouncements about how AI is going to change everything! That\u2019s not to say PepsiCo doesn\u2019t have investments underway here - as far back as 2019, Forbes reported on The Fascinating Ways PepsiCo Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning To Deliver Success, while last year AIM Research told us How PepsiCo Utilizes Generative AI to Drive Innovation and Efficiency.\n\nBut I found the grounded presentation from Laguarta to be refreshingly free of hype and heavy on practical benefits.

They are icons in the food and beverage niche of the consumer staples sector. But while they both have very attractive dividend yields right now, income investors will probably be better off focusing on the only company in this duo that is a Dividend King. Here's why.\n\nPepsiCo has an impressive streak\n\nPepsiCo's dividend has been increased annually for 52 consecutive years. That puts it into the highly elite group of companies that are known as Dividend Kings. Achieving this status doesn't happen by accident -- it requires a strong business model that is executed well in both good times and bad times. If you are an income investor, PepsiCo should be of particular interest to you.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA person looking at a box in a grocery store.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo's dividend yield is \"only\" 3.6%. Kraft Heinz's yield is 5.4%. Despite the fact that PepsiCo's yield is near the highest levels in the company's history, yield-focused investors might still be more attracted to Kraft Heinz. But there's a little nuance that can't be ignored. Kraft Heinz's dividend has been stuck at $0.40 per share per quarter since it was cut at the start of 2019.\n\nThis is where the difference between PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz really starts to take shape.\n\nWhat is going wrong at PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz?\n\nEvery company eventually faces a difficult period. If a company is around long enough, it will face many difficult periods. PepsiCo is suffering through a business slowdown today. Add in broader industry concerns about new weight loss drugs and what appears to be a shift toward increased health consciousness (among individuals and regulators), and investors are punishing the soda, snack, and packaged food giant.\n\nStill, 2024 organic sales were up 2%, and core earnings per share advanced 9%, so it isn't like PepsiCo's business has fallen off a cliff.\n\nThat said, the company's outlook for 2025 was a bit subdued, with management guiding toward similar organic sales growth and earnings rates. Investors had come to expect more, given the strong performance PepsiCo exhibited coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. That enthusiasm was probably a bit overheated, since inflation was the primary driver of the price increases PepsiCo was able to push through its system. Slow and steady growth is really the norm for the company, and it's why long-term dividend investors will probably want to consider the stock today, given its historically high yield.\n\nBut why not go with higher-yielding Kraft Heinz? The lack of dividend growth is one big reason, but it's the reason for the stagnant dividend that really matters.\n\nKraft Heinz was created via the merger of food giants Kraft and Heinz, with the original goal of cutting costs to boost profits. That's a fine short-term plan, but not a good long-term plan. It quickly became apparent that this food giant needed to do something more. The new approach is to focus on the company's most important brands, which is a good idea.\n\nHowever, the brands on which it has been most focused have not been performing particularly well. Organic sales fell 4.5% among the \"accelerate\" brands, as they are called, in the third quarter of 2024, and then dropped another 5.2% in the fourth quarter. In other words, there's more work to be done before this company gets back on track.\n\nA fallen angel versus a turnaround play\n\nWhen you step back and look at PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz, you see two companies that are out of favor on Wall Street. Only PepsiCo looks like it is dealing with a short-term issue that it will likely weather in stride, as it has similar situations in the past. In fact, the business still appears to be growing -- just not as fast as it was a couple of years ago.\n\nLong-term dividend investors will probably find this Dividend King's story a lot more attractive than the slow-moving turnaround that Kraft Heinz is still working on. Will Kraft Heinz pull the turnaround off? Probably. But it seems likely that the dividend will be stuck in neutral for longer and that investors will have to suffer through difficult earnings reports for longer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

The corporation\u2019s actions mark the second successful policy change effected by ADF\u2019s Corporate Engagement team and shareholder alliances.\n\n\u2018GARM\u2019s harm\u2019: using advertising dollars to suppress speech\n\nLike many other popular corporations, PepsiCo is a global brand with immense influence and ad-buying power.\n\nAnd for years, PepsiCo and other powerful businesses were members of an organization called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), an offshoot of the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) that sought to suppress \u201chate speech\u201d and \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Although GARM characterized its work as reducing harmful content online, these terms are vague and subjective and often used to punish mainstream conservative and religious views.\n\nGARM encouraged its members to engage in boycotts and coordinated action to stop paid advertising on mainstream conservative and religious news outlets, podcasts, and online content. WFA\u2019s GARM weaponized its members ad revenue to influence what speech appeared online\u2014and to effectively punish those who expressed or published views that GARM didn\u2019t like.\n\nGARM pressured Spotify to boot Joe Rogan from its platform, coordinated to pull ad spending from Twitter (now X) after Elon Musk acquired it, and attacked news sites including The Daily Wire, the New York Post, and other popular right-of-center outlets. And with WFA members representing 90 percent of global advertising spend\u2014almost a trillion dollars annually\u2014GARM\u2019s actions could have significantly harmed companies that didn\u2019t comply with its demands.\n\nThankfully, GARM disbanded in 2024 after X CEO Elon Musk sued the group for conspiring to pull advertising dollars from his platform. But others in the advertising industry are still encouraging companies to weaponize their ad dollars to silence disfavored views in online debates. And without concrete internal changes, companies may be enticed by the next version of GARM and unknowingly commit their ad-buying power to more censorship.\n\nCourse correction: a good business practice\n\nFree speech is a top concern for Americans today. The willingness of major corporations to squelch speech was bound to leave a bad taste in the mouths of customers across the nation. With the encouragement of ADF and ADF-supported shareholders, PepsiCo realized its participation in censorship had all the appeal of flat soda and promptly changed course.\n\nADF-supported shareholders had filed resolutions at 12 major companies that participated in GARM, including PepsiCo, asking for transparency around their ad-buying services and a commitment to respect the diverse views of the people they serve. In response, PepsiCo met with the shareholders and ADF attorneys to discuss the resolution. After the meeting, PepsiCo agreed to include a commitment to viewpoint neutrality in its advertising policy in exchange for the shareholders dropping the resolution\u2014a great win for all Americans.\n\nRebuilding trust requires action, not just promises and platitudes. PepsiCo came out strong by changing its policies. But not all companies were willing to protect free speech and religious freedom.\n\nDisney also met with shareholders and ADF attorneys in response to a shareholder petition about the entertainment giant\u2019s participation in GARM. But unlike PepsiCo, Disney took no meaningful steps to disavow censorship. When ADF attorneys asked point-blank if Disney would commit to viewpoint neutrality, Disney responded that it did not think it was in the company\u2019s best interest to do so.\n\nThrough GARM, Disney had actively undermined the culture of healthy dialogue, free expression, and free exchange of information that\u2019s necessary to a free country. And that\u2019s just one of Disney\u2019s recent controversial decisions, which include pushing sexualized content on kids. The company\u2019s failure to commit to better practices is disappointing, especially because Disney\u2019s audience includes customers with a variety of views.\n\nGood business requires correcting course when necessary. When the beverage \u201cPepsi Blue\u201d quickly fell out of favor, what with its antifreeze appearance and use of controversial food dye Blue 1, PepsiCo abandoned it. Likewise, PepsiCo showed the door to toxic advertising practices by updating its policies to expressly respect everyone\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nPepsiCo is charting a new path for businesses to protect civil liberties and avoid the quagmire of corporate overreach on today\u2019s hot-button issues. Other companies should follow its lead.",

The complaint alleged that the companies' pricing affected \u2018hundreds\u2019 of convenience stores in California and also violated California state competition law,\u201d the outlet reported.\n\nThe lawsuit said PepsiCo\u2019s alleged pricing policies, favoring major retailers over smaller independent convenience stores, are illegal under the federal Robinson-Patman Act. That law can restrict a seller from providing discounts, rebates and other pricing activities to some buyers, but not all, according to Reuters.\n\nThis lawsuit comes after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued PepsiCo in federal court in New York, accusing it of providing Walmart with unfair pricing advantages under the Robinson-Patman Act.\n\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark Poe, in a statement on Tuesday said that Frito-Lay\u2019s \"discriminatory pricing\" resulted in \"millions of consumers\" paying higher prices.\n\nThe convenience stores are reportedly seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court order stopping the alleged price discrimination.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the federal government had largely not enforced the Robinson-Patman Act, but the Biden-era FTC revived it,\u201d wrote Reuters.\n\nIn December, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued the largest U.S. distributor of wine and spirits\u2014Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits LLC (Southern)\u2014alleging the company violated the Robinson-Patman Act, \u201charming small, independent businesses by depriving them of access to discounts and rebates, and impeding their ability to compete against large national and regional chains,\u201d according to a press release from the FTC.",

The group is focused on ambient IoT \u2013 as written about as a conceot in these pages for years \u2013 in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 5G devices, specifically. The other founders are Atmosic, VusionGroup, and Wiliot.\n\nThere is ongoing work to include ambient IoT as a 3GPP work item in development of the 5G standard in releases 19 and 20 (5G Advanced). The IEEE (Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth SIG have their own work items, alongside. Similar work is being done by the LoRaWAN and Sigfox communities. The alliance said it wants an \u201copen, harmonised, and aligned multi-standard ecosystem\u201d. It wants other companies that produce or utilise IoT tags, devices, networking middleware, applications, and cloud services to join.\n\nIt has appealed to \u201cbusinesses, telcos, technology vendors, and standards bodies\u201d to help with \u201cbest practices, interoperability, and other alliance efforts\u201d. A statement said: \u201cMore and more everyday battery-less things will be interconnected and integrated into the world around us.\u201d It suggested \u201clarge-scale deployment(s)\u201d in \u201csupply chains, retail channels, and healthcare delivery services\u201d, with \u201cprofound benefits for society\u201d.\n\nAlliance is focused on ambient IoT standards for \u201cbattery-free, low-cost technologies\u201d to connect products and assets \u2013 \u201cwhich can also improve AI services in the cloud\u201d. The statement leaned into the AI angle, saying: \u201cAmbient IoT and AI are symbiotic technologies\u2026 [Their] simultaneous rise will give businesses and consumers unprecedented understanding of the world around them\u2026 The business benefits are massive. Ambient IoT represents the next great data platform for leveraging AI and realising the tremendous ROI promised by AI solutions.\u201d\n\nThe point, presumably, is that IoT will get properly \u2018massive\u2019 if the battery is removed. \u201cAs ambient IoT becomes accepted and pervades all industries, the insight derived from advanced analytics will continue to change how businesses operate. In the meantime, for ambient IoT to reach its full potential and transform the world, it takes an alliance of companies with products and technologies that work together,\u201d said the statement.\n\nKamesh Medapalli, a senior vice president at Infineon Technologies, said: \u201cAmbient IoT is well aligned with Infineon\u2019s strategic focus on IoT and Energy leadership and our motto of driving digitalization and decarbonization. We are proud to shape new industry standards like ambient IoT to foster innovation to connect billions of cost-optimized IoT devices securely, while helping to save our precious planet.\u201d\n\nAlon Yehezkely, chief technology officer at Wiliot, said: \u201cAs pioneers of ambient IoT solutions, it has been gratifying to work with other companies that share a common vision. Members of the Ambient IoT Alliance believe in the transformative potential of ambient IoT, bringing their unique perspective and technology expertise.\u201d\n\nDavid Su, co-founder at Atmosic, said: \u201cAmbient IoT is the key to sustainable IoT adoption. It allows us to rearchitect wireless tracking solutions to either use very little power or harvested energy, so everything can remain connected continuously and companies can operate at maximum efficiency.\u201d",

To address this, retailers must allocate 30% of the visible and vertical space on Frito-Lay stands to competing brands. This designated section must be marked with a separator and labelled to indicate it is reserved for competitor products.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrito-Lay is prohibited from preventing the sale or visibility of competing brands at points of sale. The company cannot provide financial benefits to retailers beyond standard purchases and only one Frito-Lay-branded stand will be allowed at each sales point.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cases where no competitor products are available, the reserved space must remain empty rather than being filled with Frito-Lay's products.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulators hope this will enhance consumer choice and promote fairer competition in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoodBev has reached out to both PepsiCo and Frito-Lay for a comment.",

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) might not be the first one you would think of as a stellar long-term growth stock. The consumer staples giant stung investors last year, falling 10% even as the S&P 500 gained over 20%. You would have done much better owning a diverse index fund, or one of Pepsi's competitors like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nYet patient investors might earn excellent returns by looking past the short-term challenges that pressured the stock last year. Here are three great reasons to consider Pepsi's mature business as your next purchase for 2025 and beyond.\n\n1. Sturdy growth\n\nPepsiCo is known for being the perennial runner-up in its battle with Coke over supremacy in the soda industry. But its diversification, delivered through its dozens of beverage, snack, and convenience food brands, means it doesn't need to dominate the soda market to generate stable growth.\n\nOrganic sales rose 2% in 2024, mainly thanks to solid growth in overseas markets like Europe and Latin America. Sure, that modest uptick was weak compared to the prior year's 9% spike. But PepsiCo was hurt by a few unusual pressures last year, such as a large safety recall in its Quaker Foods unit.\n\nManagement is calling for another year of subdued growth ahead, with organic sales likely to rise by at least 2% as profits expand around 4%. Coke is projecting organic growth of between 5% and 6%, by comparison.\n\n2. Passive income\n\nIf you're looking for passive income, it doesn't get much better than PepsiCo. The stock's yield is 3.6% today, compared to the 1.2% you would get by owning the wider S&P 500. The company is also a member of the exclusive club of Dividend Kings, meaning it has boosted its payout for at least 50 consecutive years (53, in this case).\n\nThe most recent raise arrived in early February when shareholders received a 5% increase. The growing dividend and its aggressive stock buybacks are funded by the company's ample cash flow. Pepsi produced $13 billion in operating cash flow in each of the last two years. In other words, it pays to own dozens of leading food and beverage brands even through those inevitable slow growth periods.\n\n3. A bargain price\n\nAfter two consecutive years of over 20% growth in the stock market, it can be hard to find bargain-priced stocks to buy right now. There's little risk of overpaying for Pepsi, though. The stock is valued at a reasonable 21 times earnings, which is close to a five-year low.\n\nYou would have to pay 28 times earnings to own Coca-Cola and 27 times earnings for spice and snack specialist McCormick, in contrast. PepsiCo looks similarly cheap on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis, with its ratio of 2.2 representing a multiyear low here in early 2025.\n\nSure, there are some good reasons for investors to feel pessimistic about the company's next few quarters. Inflation is still affecting consumers in the core U.S. market, and there's less room for food and beverage giants to raise prices without risking declining sales volumes. There's nothing exciting about a second consecutive year of sub-5% organic sales growth, either.\n\nPepsi has thrived through many consumer spending slumps in the past, including the 2024 period that saw core earnings rise by 9% even though organic sales inched up by just 2%.\n\nThat track record suggests that shareholders can expect margin expansion again in 2025, with a reasonable chance of accelerating sales growth once the industry recovers from its current malaise. In the meantime, sit back and collect PepsiCo's predictably rising dividend payment.",

The two companies have been ranked as the world's top plastic polluters for five consecutive years, and Coca-Cola has taken the number one spot for six years, according to global environmental group Break Free From Plastic.\n\nPepsiCo produces approximately 2.5 million metric tons of plastic and Coca-Cola produces approximately 3.224 million metric tons of plastic annually, according to Break Free from Plastic.\n\nA European Union consumer protection group and environmental organizations filed a legal complaint against Coca-Cola, Nestle, and Danone last November, accusing them of being misleading when representing packaging as 100% recycled or 100% recyclable.\n\nThe LA lawsuit said Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have employed \u201cdisinformation campaigns\u201d for consumers to purchase single-use plastic, believing them to be recyclable and less harmful to the environment.\n\nIt alleged that both companies promised to create a \u201ccircular economy\u201d for its bottles, in which plastic bottles can be recycled and reused an endless number of times, while in reality plastic bottles can only be recycled once, if at all.\n\nThe American Beverage Association, which PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are a part of, denied the lawsuit\u2019s accusations about their plastic bottle recycling labels.\n\n\u201cThe allegation that our packaging is not and will not be recycled is simply not true,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesperson William Dermody said in a statement.\n\nDermody said California had a 71% bottle recycling rate in 2023, one of the highest in the country, and that their bottles are \u201cdesigned to be recycled and remade and can include up to 100% recycled plastic.\u201d\n\nIn 2022 alone, an estimated 121,324 to 179,656 tons of plastic waste leaked into the land and ocean in California, and plastics make up seven of the top 10 litter products found on beaches, the lawsuit states.\n\nA big part of the problem is microplastics.\n\nPlastics that have leaked into the environment eventually disintegrate into tiny pieces of plastic measuring five millimeters or less. They can affect soil and plant growth, marine and fish life, and are nearly impossible to remove from the environment, the lawsuit states.\n\nSome Australian researchers, on behalf of the World Wildlife Fund, calculated in 2019 that many people each week consume roughly 5 grams of plastic from common food and beverages, and microplastics have been found in body tissues and organs. Though research is still limited overall, there are growing concerns that microplastics in the body could potentially be linked to heart disease, Alzheimer's and dementia, and other problems.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking a court order to stop the companies\u2019 \u201cunfair and deceptive business practices\u201d as well as restitution for consumers and civil penalties of up to $2,500 per violation.\n\nIn February 2020, environmental nonprofit Earth Island Institute filed a lawsuit in California asking for damages and an order for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle USA, Procter & Gamble and six other companies to clean up the plastic waste they should be held responsible for.\n\nNew York state also sued PepsiCo last November for its role in creating the plastic waste that littering the Buffalo River, which empties into Lake Erie and supplies the city of Buffalo\u2019s drinking water. A judge dismissed the case Thursday, stating in a court filing that there was no \u201cfailure to warn\u201d the public on plastic-related dangers and that there was no cause of action to punish the companies for the actions of a third party \u2014 people who litter.",

We did some digging, and we think that investors are missing some encouraging factors in the underlying numbers.\n\nSee our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Earnings and Revenue History February 17th 2025\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\n\nTo properly understand PepsiCo's profit results, we need to consider the US$1.7b expense attributed to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If PepsiCo doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On PepsiCo's Profit Performance\n\nBecause unusual items detracted from PepsiCo's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Because of this, we think PepsiCo's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! And on top of that, its earnings per share have grown at 25% per year over the last three years. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for PepsiCo you should know about.\n\nThis note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of PepsiCo's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Dividend-Paying Beverage Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best dividend-paying beverage stocks to buy.\n\nThe American consumer staples industry is currently dealing with an evolving landscape, with a key shift being the heightened influence of health considerations on consumer behavior. Health and wellness are now common themes of interest among the younger generation of consumers and the prevalence of weight-loss drugs has also led to a change in consumer\u2019s eating habits, including both reducing appetite and altering the kind of foods and drinks they want.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nMany industry players have realized that they\u2019ll need to evolve and keep up with their consumers in order to achieve success. A great example is how an increasing number of beverage companies are now working to deliver more with their products, with one prominent trend being better-for-you (BFY) drinks. These are beverages that go beyond the scope of mere hydration and provide a solid benefit, such as supporting energy, gut health, cognition, immunity etc. However, in order for it to sell, a drink also needs to taste good, which presents a challenge in itself since the modern consumer is also wary of high sugar levels and artificial sweeteners. As a result, many industry players are now experimenting with natural sweeteners like allulose, stevia, and monk fruit alongside advanced sweetness modulation technologies.\n\nAnother major beverage category that is rapidly evolving with shifting consumer trends is that of alcohol. The rising importance of health and wellness has led to an increasing number of younger people drinking less alcohol, with many giving it up altogether. As a result, nearly every major alcohol company has come up with no- and low-alcohol versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don\u2019t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US.\n\nA recent looming threat for the American beverage industry has emerged in the form of tariffs. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum being imported into the US, eliminating previous country exceptions and exemptions. The blanket tariffs, set to go into effect next month, will have serious consequences for the beverage industry since nearly 75% of all new beverage launches in North America now appear in aluminum cans, according to supplier Crown. An increase in input costs will inevitably lead to a rise in prices for end consumers, causing serious problems for some beverage categories that are already struggling, such as craft beer. A short-term solution could be resorting to alternative packaging materials, such as glass or plastic, but that will undoubtedly come with its ecological concerns and ramifications. Or perhaps, this packaging problem could be a blessing in disguise and lead to some much-needed creative destruction and forever change the industry, since the drinks aisle has always been a hot spot in terms of innovation.",

            "content": "If you've ever been to a grocery store or convenience store, you know the brands that PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) and Kraft Heinz (KHC 0.13%) sell. They are icons in the food and beverage niche of the consumer staples sector. But while they both have very attractive dividend yields right now, income investors will probably be better off focusing on the only company in this duo that is a Dividend King. Here's why.\n\nPepsiCo has an impressive streak\n\nPepsiCo's dividend has been increased annually for 52 consecutive years. That puts it into the highly elite group of companies that are known as Dividend Kings. Achieving this status doesn't happen by accident -- it requires a strong business model that is executed well in both good times and bad times. If you are an income investor, PepsiCo should be of particular interest to you.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo's dividend yield is \"only\" 3.6%. Kraft Heinz's yield is 5.4%. Despite the fact that PepsiCo's yield is near the highest levels in the company's history, yield-focused investors might still be more attracted to Kraft Heinz. But there's a little nuance that can't be ignored. Kraft Heinz's dividend has been stuck at $0.40 per share per quarter since it was cut at the start of 2019.\n\nThis is where the difference between PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz really starts to take shape.\n\nWhat is going wrong at PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz?\n\nEvery company eventually faces a difficult period. If a company is around long enough, it will face many difficult periods. PepsiCo is suffering through a business slowdown today. Add in broader industry concerns about new weight loss drugs and what appears to be a shift toward increased health consciousness (among individuals and regulators), and investors are punishing the soda, snack, and packaged food giant.\n\nStill, 2024 organic sales were up 2%, and core earnings per share advanced 9%, so it isn't like PepsiCo's business has fallen off a cliff.\n\nThat said, the company's outlook for 2025 was a bit subdued, with management guiding toward similar organic sales growth and earnings rates. Investors had come to expect more, given the strong performance PepsiCo exhibited coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. That enthusiasm was probably a bit overheated, since inflation was the primary driver of the price increases PepsiCo was able to push through its system. Slow and steady growth is really the norm for the company, and it's why long-term dividend investors will probably want to consider the stock today, given its historically high yield.\n\nBut why not go with higher-yielding Kraft Heinz? The lack of dividend growth is one big reason, but it's the reason for the stagnant dividend that really matters.\n\nKraft Heinz was created via the merger of food giants Kraft and Heinz, with the original goal of cutting costs to boost profits. That's a fine short-term plan, but not a good long-term plan. It quickly became apparent that this food giant needed to do something more. The new approach is to focus on the company's most important brands, which is a good idea.\n\nHowever, the brands on which it has been most focused have not been performing particularly well. Organic sales fell 4.5% among the \"accelerate\" brands, as they are called, in the third quarter of 2024, and then dropped another 5.2% in the fourth quarter. In other words, there's more work to be done before this company gets back on track.\n\nA fallen angel versus a turnaround play\n\nWhen you step back and look at PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz, you see two companies that are out of favor on Wall Street. Only PepsiCo looks like it is dealing with a short-term issue that it will likely weather in stride, as it has similar situations in the past. In fact, the business still appears to be growing -- just not as fast as it was a couple of years ago.\n\nLong-term dividend investors will probably find this Dividend King's story a lot more attractive than the slow-moving turnaround that Kraft Heinz is still working on. Will Kraft Heinz pull the turnaround off? Probably. But it seems likely that the dividend will be stuck in neutral for longer and that investors will have to suffer through difficult earnings reports for longer.",

            "content": "PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) might not be the first one you would think of as a stellar long-term growth stock. The consumer staples giant stung investors last year, falling 10% even as the S&P 500 gained over 20%. You would have done much better owning a diverse index fund, or one of Pepsi's competitors like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nYet patient investors might earn excellent returns by looking past the short-term challenges that pressured the stock last year. Here are three great reasons to consider Pepsi's mature business as your next purchase for 2025 and beyond.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\n1. Sturdy growth\n\nPepsiCo is known for being the perennial runner-up in its battle with Coke over supremacy in the soda industry. But its diversification, delivered through its dozens of beverage, snack, and convenience food brands, means it doesn't need to dominate the soda market to generate stable growth.\n\nOrganic sales rose 2% in 2024, mainly thanks to solid growth in overseas markets like Europe and Latin America. Sure, that modest uptick was weak compared to the prior year's 9% spike. But PepsiCo was hurt by a few unusual pressures last year, such as a large safety recall in its Quaker Foods unit.\n\nManagement is calling for another year of subdued growth ahead, with organic sales likely to rise by at least 2% as profits expand around 4%. Coke is projecting organic growth of between 5% and 6%, by comparison.\n\n2. Passive income\n\nIf you're looking for passive income, it doesn't get much better than PepsiCo. The stock's yield is 3.6% today, compared to the 1.2% you would get by owning the wider S&P 500. The company is also a member of the exclusive club of Dividend Kings, meaning it has boosted its payout for at least 50 consecutive years (53, in this case).\n\nThe most recent raise arrived in early February when shareholders received a 5% increase. The growing dividend and its aggressive stock buybacks are funded by the company's ample cash flow. Pepsi produced $13 billion in operating cash flow in each of the last two years. In other words, it pays to own dozens of leading food and beverage brands even through those inevitable slow growth periods.\n\n3. A bargain price\n\nAfter two consecutive years of over 20% growth in the stock market, it can be hard to find bargain-priced stocks to buy right now. There's little risk of overpaying for Pepsi, though. The stock is valued at a reasonable 21 times earnings, which is close to a five-year low.\n\nYou would have to pay 28 times earnings to own Coca-Cola and 27 times earnings for spice and snack specialist McCormick, in contrast. PepsiCo looks similarly cheap on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis, with its ratio of 2.2 representing a multiyear low here in early 2025.\n\nPEP PS Ratio Chart\n\nPEP PS ratio data by YCharts.\n\nSure, there are some good reasons for investors to feel pessimistic about the company's next few quarters. Inflation is still affecting consumers in the core U.S. market, and there's less room for food and beverage giants to raise prices without risking declining sales volumes. There's nothing exciting about a second consecutive year of sub-5% organic sales growth, either.\n\nPepsi has thrived through many consumer spending slumps in the past, including the 2024 period that saw core earnings rise by 9% even though organic sales inched up by just 2%.\n\nThat track record suggests that shareholders can expect margin expansion again in 2025, with a reasonable chance of accelerating sales growth once the industry recovers from its current malaise. In the meantime, sit back and collect PepsiCo's predictably rising dividend payment.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & Finds Few Reasons To Sell. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \u201cthere\u2019s still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\u201d He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper\u2019s comments about the market were precarious and didn\u2019t reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \u201cI mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation\u2019s precarious on Squawk Box. And it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nInstead, Cramer shared \u201cThese are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let\u2019s make a talk. Let\u2019s do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it\u2019s not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President\u2019s strategy, I think people say, is working.\u201d As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \u201cAnd the answer is why you would sell is because you don\u2019t believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn\u2019t exist. I come back and say, well I don\u2019t know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\u201d\n\nThe CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \u201chow can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they\u2019re getting that in spade,\u201d on the other hand he agreed that \u201cYes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we\u2019re gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cramer was surprised by the President\u2019s China approach. He had \u201cexpected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\u201d\n\nFurther commenting on the White House\u2019s approach towards China, Cramer stated:\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re China you\u2019re saying, hey you know what, this guy really wants a deal with us. And let\u2019s sit down. Now I remember when the President . . .he said look I think that things could be better with China. Now if you go back and read Peter Navarro\u2019s book, about, when he talks about Trump and China. Oh man. There were people. . . Steve Mnuchin, who, he calls out, Navarro, as being China-poligists, and in a really harsh way, the book is. . . well written. And I just think that Navarro lost here, because these were not harsh.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 4th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 58\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the biggest carbonated beverages and snack companies in the world. Its shares have lost 14.7% over the past year as rising inflation coupled with high prices has dented the demand for its products. Cramer believes that the struggles that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is facing are also secular instead of being purely driven by high prices. The secular trend affecting the firm is increasing health awareness among younger consumers. Here are his remarks for PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in detail:\n\n\u201cYeah, Raymon Laguarta is doing a terrific job as CEO of Pepsi but the problem here is again, snacks. And snacks are part of either a healthy cohort, the change in people particularly younger people shifting to things that are better for you. Or it\u2019s GLP-1 which I believe will ultimately have about forty million people on it between 12 and 13 months in persistence. We don\u2019t know but Raymon thinks that it\u2019s just, it\u2019s the healthy, health is here to stay. And remember they have Frito Lays. And Frito Lay is historically salty snacks are not healthy. so they\u2019re making smaller sizes, doing bake, they\u2019re doing what they can, emphasizing Sabra, emphasizing a lot of different stuff that I think is good for you. But they don\u2019t have enough that\u2019s good for you. So, you\u2019ll see the stock down. It\u2019s obviously underperformed. And the question is, is it a real crisis in that they are producing food that may never be loved again. . . and we just think that the younger people don\u2019t wanna snack the way they used.\u201d \u201cNow Raymon I think can do a good job, it does yield 3.7, uh, it is historically a fantastic company as we know. It can reinvent. But it has to pivot so quickly because this is a trend, trend that came out of COVID. So COVID would come out and we\u2019re snacking at home. And then we develop a whole new thesis about our bodies. And this is also in liquor. Liquor\u2019s actually far worse. Diageo pulled its guidance this morning. But if you want to buy a high quality company and bet that they would figure what needs to be figured out, it is Pepsi.\u201d\n\nOverall PEP ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "After a three-year absence, PepsiCo has officially returned to Indonesia with an investment of US$200 million over 10 years to build a snack factory in Cikarang, West Java. This move is not just another business expansion, but a statement that they are ready to reclaim lost market share. With iconic brands such as Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos to be produced in Indonesia, the question is: will PepsiCo be able to win the now much tougher competition?\n\nIn 2021, PepsiCo and FritoLay ended their long-term partnership with PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur Tbk (ICBP), which had manufactured and distributed their products in Indonesia for more than 30 years through a joint venture, Indofood FritoLay. As a result, the production and distribution of FritoLay products in Indonesia was halted. However, Indofood immediately responded by launching essentially identical products but under new brands such as Chitato Lite, Chiki Twist, and Maxicorn.\n\nFor Indonesian consumers, the change was relatively seamless. Indofood's replacement products maintained similar flavors and textures, while their extensive distribution network ensured product availability was maintained throughout Indonesia. In other words, consumer loyalty to the snacks remains, only now under a different brand.\n\nGabrielle Angriani Johny, director of government relations and corporate communications at PepsiCo Indonesia said on LinkedIn, \"We are proud to have opened our first factory in Indonesia and officially started production of Cheetos at our Cikarang factory since January 2025. Now, Cheetos is back, made with pride in Indonesia!\"\n\nBranding and marketing strategies: Winning back consumers\n\nPepsiCo's return to Indonesia presents a major branding and marketing challenge. In the past three years, Indofood has established its brand as the leader in the snack segment that was previously dominated by PepsiCo. As such, PepsiCo will need to have a solid strategy to win back consumers' attention.\n\nCapitalize on global brand appeal\n\nLay's, Cheetos and Doritos are global brands that have very strong recognition. PepsiCo can use this appeal in their marketing campaigns, emphasizing that the original products are back. This strategy can create a sense of nostalgia while emphasizing that they offer more authentic quality and taste.\n\nProduct differentiation and innovation\n\nWhile Indofood has managed to maintain market share with similar products, PepsiCo has an advantage in terms of product innovation. With their global experience, PepsiCo can introduce new flavors that are more suited to the tastes of Indonesian consumers. For example, they could launch Lay's or Cheetos variants with Indonesian flavors such as rendang or sambal matah to attract market attention.\n\nCompetitive distribution strategy\n\nIndofood has the advantage of a wide distribution network, from minimarkets to traditional markets. PepsiCo must ensure that their products can reach consumers in the same way. Partnerships with local distributors and penetration into e-commerce could be key to making their products easily available to consumers. In her LinkedIn post, Gabrielle said that PepsiCo products can be found in the Alfamart retail network throughout Indonesia.\n\nDigital campaigns and influencer marketing\n\nWith the changing marketing landscape, PepsiCo needs to adopt an aggressive digital strategy. Social media campaigns with local influencers, viral challenges on TikTok, and ads that rely on nostalgia can be effective tools to rebuild relationships with consumers.\n\nCompetitive landscape: The big duel with Indofood\n\nToday, Indofood dominates the snack food market in Indonesia. With brands such as Chitato, Qtela, and Jetz, they have created a strong product ecosystem and have loyal fans. However, with the re-emergence of PepsiCo, several competitive scenarios could occur:\n\nPrice wars and promotions\n\nTo regain market share, PepsiCo will probably implement an aggressive pricing strategy, offering discounts or bundling promotions. Indofood, with more stable profit margins and established local production, could respond with similar tactics.\n\nCompetition in the retail space\n\nSecuring display space in retail stores is an important factor. Indofood already has an advantage in this regard, but PepsiCo can use their global resources to pressure retailers to give more exposure to their products.\n\nImpact on consumers\n\nIndonesian consumers will benefit from this increased competition. Not only do they have more choices, but they can also enjoy products with better quality and more competitive prices.\n\nSustainability as a differentiation factor\n\nOne of PepsiCo's interesting strategies is their commitment to sustainability. The new plant in Cikarang will use electricity from renewable energy as well as a water recycling system to reduce industrial waste. They also plan to use local raw materials such as potatoes and corn from Indonesian farmers.\n\nThis differentiation can be a selling point for consumers who are increasingly aware of environmental issues. A marketing campaign that highlights these sustainability aspects could give PepsiCo a competitive advantage, especially in the urban and millennial consumer segments that are more concerned with responsible business practices.\n\nWho will win?\n\nPepsiCo's return to Indonesia is not just about bringing back their products, but also creating a new dynamic in the snack market. Indofood has built a strong foundation with their rebranded products, while PepsiCo comes with global brand power, innovation and massive resources.\n\nFor branding and marketing professionals, this situation is an interesting case study on market re-entry strategies, brand competition, and how product and marketing differentiation can determine the success of a company.\n\nCan PepsiCo win back the hearts of Indonesian consumers, or will Indofood remain the market king? This rivalry will be one of the most interesting to follow in the coming years.",

When AMP was under the Mountain Dew brand, it was sold under the product name \"Overdrive.\"\n\nB!\n\nAMP ENERGY BOOST CHERRY Manufacturer PEPSICO Country of Origin USA Price 2 USD Flavor Red Berry Total rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nAuthor: Energy Drink-kun In 2001, while living in the United States, I encountered energy drinks through the dance scene and was deeply impressed. After returning to Japan, I found that energy drinks were considered novelty beverages, so I established a comprehensive website in 2013 to share the true appeal of energy drinks. As an energy drink enthusiast, I began drinking them seriously again, collecting over 7,000 varieties of energy drinks from various countries. I am also active as a critic and expert, receiving media interviews.\n\nFlavor of AMP ENERGY BOOST CHERRY\n\nThe can is a dull red, but the liquid inside is a bright, vibrant fluorescent red. The cherry scent is quite prominent, and even at the moment I pour it into a glass, my expectations rise.\n\n\n\nThe flavor is a punchy cherry, with a strong sweetness from sugar added to the cherry flavor. The scent and taste are bold, so it has a satisfying impact when drinking ( \u00b4\u2200\uff40)b????!\n\nThe strong flavor is complemented by a fizzy kick, so as you continue drinking, it actually goes down easily. Plus, the aftertaste doesn\u2019t leave a lingering sweetness. Before you know it, you've finished the whole can. Personally, I enjoy cherry and berry flavors, and I really like fruity punches like this one, so with the clean aftertaste, I end up finishing it in one go (\uff55_\uff55*).\n\nEnergy Ingredients of AMP ENERGY BOOST CHERRY\n\n\n\nAMP ENERGY BOOST CHERRY contains the standard energy ingredients. With 160mg of caffeine, it\u2019s a satisfying amount. Other energy ingredients include 295mg of taurine, 264mg of guarana, and 33mg of ginseng. I always feel like AMP could include more of these, though.\n\nThe surprising part is that the carbohydrate content is only 31g, considering the sweetness. I expected more, given how sweet it is. The calorie count is also not too high, so I think it\u2019s fine to drink even if you're not working out.\n\nMaybe \"Overdrive\" would be a better name\n\n\n\nWhen it was previously sold with the Mountain Dew logo, it was under the product name \"AMP ENERGY OVERDRIVE,\" and it had the same cherry flavor.\n\nWhen buying now, the taste is easier to identify, but I feel like a more distinct name, like \"Overdrive,\" would better capture the energy drink vibe and fit the image.\n\nB!\n\nEnergy Drink-kun's Personal Rating Flavor Aroma Weight Freshness Munchiness",

PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%.

PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average.

PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

PEP, two major government contractors, are revising their diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies in light of President Donald Trump's executive order.\n\nThis order requires federal contractors to adhere to the prohibition of DEI programs, becoming a key consideration for businesses working within government-funded environments.\n\nCoca-Cola is expected to adhere to the administration\u2019s mandate, which will affect its beverage services on military bases and other government properties, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThe move comes after Trump ordered federal agencies to dismantle DEI programs and urged private companies to end what he labeled as \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences.\"\n\nRelated Read: Coca-Cola\u2019s Strong Q4 Performance Reinforces Pricing Power, But Analysts Flag Interest Cost Risks\n\nSome of the other prominent corporations that have taken similar decision regarding DEI include, Meta Platforms Inc.

            "content": "At last year\u2019s Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, PepsiCo took over the sidewalk area in front of the New York-New York Hotel & Casino with its Chip Strip, one of the weekend\u2019s most popular pop-up experiences. (After all, who could pass up the chance to get married by Chester Cheetah in the Cheetos Chapel?) For Super Bowl LIX, the brand upgraded the activation with a New Orleans spin and a bigger footprint. The Chips & Sips Quarter, open Feb. 6-9, showcased the Cheetos, Doritos, Lays, Pepsi and Tostitos brands over four days, and it was just as, if not busier, than the Vegas iteration.\n\nTo start, on our way to the Quarter, we happened upon three Frito-Lay vending tricycles that were rolling by the Caesars New Orleans Hotel & Casino. Each was fully themed to a brand, down to the color of the tires: Cheetos, Lays and Doritos. The oversized chip bags on top of the trikes\u2019 canopies made them easy to spot and follow to the Chips & Sips Quarter.\n\nOnce we arrived at 500 Decatur Street, we were amazed that the parking lot was completely transformed. The Snack Yard, influenced by Jackson Square Garden, featured benches, gazebos, string lights, grass, plants, a topiary shaped like Chester Cheetah, a cart with branded postcards, and food stands, like the Lay\u2019s Wavy Fried Green Tomatoes, inspired by a New Orleans culinary staple.\n\nFive NOLA architecture-inspired building fa\u00e7ades, each themed to a brand, lined up to create an f&b district. Starting with the red-and-black Doritos Snack-Too Parlour, brave attendees 18 and older could get inked with a real tattoo, about 2-4 inches in size and mostly in the triangle variety, designed by local artists from Lucky Dagger Tattoo. (Only arms or legs could be tattooed.) Those who wanted a less permanent option could try the Doritos Golden Sriracha vending machine that dispensed a bag of chips and an attached temporary tattoo.\n\nCheetos returned with a new mischievous activation. At the orange House of Mischief, Chester led an immersive group psychic reading. While waiting, fans could \u201ctest their ESP\u201d by guessing custom Cheetos Tarot Cards, enjoy samples of the new Cheetos Cheese Pizza Puffs or watch a magic show on the porch.\n\nAttendees were willing to wait in a long line for Lay\u2019s Craw-Chip Boil. The yellow-and-red building featured a menu of classic New Orleans dishes, infused with Lay\u2019s chips, such as Lay\u2019s Kettle Cooked Cajun Spice Crawfish Boil Toss, Lay\u2019s Chicken Gumbo and Classic Potato Chip Salad, and Lay\u2019s Salt and Vinegar Shrimp Creole.\n\nThe Pepsi Taste Challenge next door brought a refreshing beverage into the mix. Kicking off the national Pepsi Challenge Tour, the experience invited attendees into a blue-washed room decorated with beads and a chandelier to sample two cups\u2014one contained Pepsi Zero Sugar and the other, Coke Zero. A brand ambassador poured the sodas behind a partition to keep them a mystery, and the participants had to say which one they preferred\u2014not which was which. Following the taste test, attendees received a coupon for a free Pepsi and beads with a branded medallion. They could also take a photo in an oversized photo frame, touting the phrase \u201cI took the Pepsi Challenge.\u201d\n\nTostitos Armchair Quarterback put fans\u2019 Super Bowl knowledge to the test. In a head-to-head challenge, two fans sat in large armchairs that operated like a mechanical bull. As the questions were asked, participants threw footballs at a target that functioned as the answer buzzer. Lastly, the Tostitos Touchdown Stage featured a rotating program of dj sets, trivia, bands and panel discussions with NFL players and legends. Our experience in the Quarter really was all that and a bag of chips.

Both have established themselves over decades of successful operations, also rewarding shareholders nicely along the way.\n\nThese defensive-natured stocks are great for balancing a risk profile, as they possess the advantageous ability to generate consistent sales in the face of many economic situations. And they also carry a track record of increasing quarterly dividend payouts, another major perk of targeting these stocks.\n\nStill, there has been a big performance disparity between the duo over the last year, with KO shares widely outperforming.\n\nIt raises a valid question \u2013 what\u2019s the better buy currently? Let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nBreaking Down Results\n\nPepsiCo posted mixed results in its latest quarterly release concerning headline figures, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate but falling short of sales expectations. FY24 organic sales climbed 2% year-over-year (compared to 9.5% in 2023), whereas adjusted EPS of $8.16 moved 9% higher.\n\nNorth America results came in a bit soft, with full-year 2024 Frito-Lay sales falling 0.5% year-over-year. It reflects quite a growth cooldown from the year-ago period when PEP posted 9% year-over-year North America Frito-Lay sales growth.\n\nThe cooldown here in Frito-Lay sales can be attributed to a big slowdown in the salty and savory snack categories, primarily attributed to a consumer that\u2019s shifted preferences towards dining out/experiences. Quaker Foods North America saw its organic sales also decline by 14%, primarily attributed to a recall of its oatmeal.\n\nPepsiCo Beverages North America did see a 1.0% increase in organic sales, reflecting the lone highlight from the region. Despite the softness of the results, PEP expects North America results to gradually improve throughout 2025, which could be a big tailwind given its recent underperformance.\n\nDespite the softness in North America, its international results came in strong, with organic sales climbing 6% in FY24.\n\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the company\u2019s outlook following the release, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The cloudy revisions picture here alludes to further share pressure in the near-term. Keep in mind that North America represents the bulk of the company\u2019s sales.",

These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "Zheng Feng Chee, an analyst from DBS, maintained the Buy rating on PepsiCo (PEP \u2013 Research Report). The associated price target remains the same with $172.00.\n\nZheng Feng Chee has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors including PepsiCo\u2019s strategic efforts and its potential for international growth. He notes that despite a conservative growth outlook, PepsiCo\u2019s international markets provide a significant opportunity for expansion, particularly given the lower per capita consumption of their products compared to the U.S. The company\u2019s investment in international markets to enhance scale and affordability is expected to bolster its position.\n\nFurthermore, Zheng Feng Chee highlights PepsiCo\u2019s efforts to revive growth in North America through product innovation and category expansion. The introduction of new products like Muscle Milk and grain-free tortillas, along with a focus on smaller, lower-priced meal options, are seen as strategies likely to drive growth. While market skepticism remains regarding North America\u2019s recovery, Zheng Feng Chee is optimistic about PepsiCo\u2019s pricing strategies and its capacity to prove the market wrong, supporting his Buy rating with a revised target price of USD172.\n\nIn another report released on February 10, Pickering Energy Partners also initiated coverage with a Buy rating on the stock with a $0.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this food and beverage company have returned -0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share, indicating a change of -1.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.34 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.2%. This estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.89 indicates a change of +6.7% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nLong-time PepsiCo alum David Kennerley will serve as the next CFO for grocery chain Kroger, succeeding interim finance chief Todd Foley, the company said in a Wednesday press release.\n\nKennerley will join the company March 10 as a senior vice president, while Foley, an 18-year veteran of the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company, will continue to serve as interim CFO until the end of the grocery chain\u2019s fiscal 2024 reporting cycle, the company said.\n\nThe CFO swap was announced approximately two months after an Oregon District Court judge blocked a planned $25 billion merger between Kroger and fellow grocery chain Albertsons, with the judge ruling in December that Federal Trade Commission concerns that the merger would harm consumers were valid.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFoley will continue to serve as a member of the grocery chain\u2019s senior leadership team to support an easy transition until the end of the company\u2019s first quarter, Kroger said Wednesday.\n\nKennerley, who joined PepsiCo in 2001, most recently served as CFO, Europe for the beverage company, taking on that role in March 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. During his over two-decade span at the company, he held a variety of executive and financial positions, including serving as its SVP of FP&A and commercial, SVP of commercial finance, and SVP finance, North American beverages.\n\nThe Pepsi alum will assume the top financial seat at the grocer as it looks to change course following its failed merger, which has led to organizational restructurings \u2014 including layoffs \u2014 at both Kroger and Albertsons in the wake of the termination of the deal.\n\nThe deal, which would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history, was challenged by the FTC and nine state attorneys general last February, with the commission arguing it would raise prices for consumers as well as negatively affect the ability of workers in the industry to secure higher wages and benefits.\n\nThe Oregon district ruling granted the FTC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against the deal in what the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu called a \u201cmajor victory for the American people.\u201d Following the ruling, both Albertsons and Kroger announced they had terminated the agreement in company filings.\n\nThe failed merger left both chains scrambling to re-adjust their strategies, with the grocery companies announcing restructurings of their teams and operations, including layoffs, according to a report by CFO Dive sister publication Grocery Dive. Albertsons reduced both its corporate and division staff earlier this year, coming as the grocer looks to cut $1.5 billion in spending, according to Grocery Dive. The company is also combining two of its divisions as part of an operational restructuring, and has made several leadership changes.\n\nKroger, meanwhile, has also cut several jobs as part of a planned restructuring also aimed at bolstering key \u201cpriority areas\u201d at the company. \u201cAs part of this prioritization work, we announced team restructures and a small number of eliminated roles to improve efficiency,\u201d the company said in a statement shared with Grocery Dive and CFO Dive.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 17 Best Stocks for Kids According to Jim Cramer. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best stocks for kids according to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer, host of Mad Money, made a compelling argument on Monday that parents should begin investing for their children as soon as they are born. He emphasized that whether parents choose index funds, individual stocks, or a combination of both, it is important to start early.\n\nCramer pointed out that there are many factors to consider when making investment decisions, especially age suitability. He advised parents to set up accounts for their kids or, at the very least, provide them with shares of stock as soon as possible. The goal is to begin the saving process from day one. He added:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about index funds, which aren\u2019t perfect, but they\u2019re the best way to go if you want to put your money on autopilot and you can\u2019t spend a lot of time looking at individual stocks\u2026 I\u2019m partial to cheap ETFs that mirror the S&P 500 because those 500 stocks represent the bedrock of America\u2019s publicly traded companies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO 13 Stocks Jim Cramer Recently Talked About and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts On These 8 Stocks and the Packaged Goods Playbook\n\nHe explained that, when investing for an infant, there is plenty of time for the money to grow, with compounding offering significant long-term benefits. As Cramer put it:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re buying for an infant who\u2019s got their whole life ahead of them, their whole life. These kinds of things can really compound over time, meaning if you let it run, then money can build up on itself.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing what stocks to pick for a newborn, Cramer suggested two types of investments: those with dividends, which can be reinvested to take advantage of the compounding effect, and growth stocks which have the potential for higher returns over time. He recommended selecting well-known names that offer both dividends and growth potential, as they can provide a balance of stability and upside.\n\nFor parents looking to open an investment account for their children, Cramer recommended setting up a Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account. As children grow older, Cramer stressed the importance of involving them in the investing process.\n\n\u201cI think you should do everything in your power to get your kids involved in investing in stocks, teaching that stocks represent pieces of companies that they might like.\u201d\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that teenagers can be tough to engage when it comes to topics like stocks. \u201cTeenagers are incorrigible,\u201d Cramer quipped, \u201cThe last thing they want to hear about is stocks.\u201d As a result, he advocated for letting teenagers take the lead and choose stocks they are passionate about, rather than dictating what they should buy.",

            "content": "The PRINT Awards have long honored creativity, intention, and innovation in visual design; in 2025 we have opened 28 categories for entries, ranging from typography to social media design.\n\nThis year, three designers from PepsiCo Design & Innovation, our presenting sponsor, have joined our jury. We asked them about their mindset going into the award consideration process.\n\nKelli Albaugh, design director at PepsiCo, weighs in on the In-House Design and Self-Promotion categories.\n\nWhat does a winning submission in the In-House Design and Self-Promotions category look like to you?\n\n\u201cI think the best work comes from having an actual challenge or a solution that you\u2019re trying to figure out or design against,\u201d says Albaugh. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a true problem to solve it makes for much richer work. Otherwise, it can seem like things are designed for design\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n2024 PRINT Awards Winners for In-House, BYMAKBAS Seasonal Stationery and Self-Promotions, The Office of Ordinary Things for D&K Printing\n\nJuan Carlos Martinez, design director, PepsiCo LATAM, brings his expertise to the Packaging Design category.\n\nWhat are you looking for in the Packaging category?\n\n\u201cThere are a few things. First of all, if there are sustainable components, that\u2019s something special. It\u2019s clearly important right now. If the project involves ideas that are better for the environment and for social causes, I think that\u2019s an ultra plus and something that we should consider,\u201d Martinez says.\n\n\u201cI would also think about relevance. Sometimes, as designers, we make amazing, beautiful things, but they should also be relevant for the target audience and market. In Latin America, we are very aware of this because we know that our preferences can be different. For example, we have different visual codes than other regions where oftentimes less is more when it comes to design. Sometimes in LATAM, more is more. That can contradict what we learn in design school, but we need to balance it out with what we know of the culture to make it relevant.\u201d\n\n2024 PRINT Awards Professional Winner for Packaging, Lou Reed Words and Music Special Packaging by Phyx Design and Student Winner for Packaging Vasavi Bubna for Horsepower Cold Brew Coffee\n\nAt PepsiCo, Courtney \u201cCJ\u201d Jimerson is a senior design director for Gatorade. She\u2019ll be judging the Brand Collaborations category.\n\nWhat makes for an award-winning Brand Collaboration?\n\n\u201cThe most successful brand collaborations are built on authenticity, relevance, and innovation. Compelling storytelling is essential\u2014especially when it taps into cultural moments or insights that foster real emotional connections with consumers,\u201d says Jimerson. \u201cThe best partnerships feel natural, with both brands sharing aligned values and enhancing each other rather than seeming forced. Most importantly, the final product should be fresh, distinctive, and something neither brand could have created alone.\u201d\n\n2024 PRINT Awards Winner for Brand Collaborations,2023 Nuit Blanche Taipei -Time to Rise Up by Left Brain\n\n\u201cI love the energy and excitement that limited-edition drops bring to a brand, driving hype and cultural momentum,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut when co-brands push boundaries and create truly unique innovation, the impact extends beyond the moment\u2014it holds lasting value and influence over time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PepsiCo team, what is great design?\n\nKelli Albaugh, Juan Carlos Martinez Burgos, and Courtney Jimerson from PepsiCo Design & Innovation\n\nKelli Albaugh: Empathy. To create design solutions for others, you have to be able to put yourself in their shoes. You need to step away from what you know as a designer or a creative and really try to understand the people that you are designing for. Otherwise, things can become a little bit too esoteric and conceptual.\n\nJuan Carlos Martinez: For me, good design is about making the right connections. Sometimes we focus too much on aesthetics, and we certainly should because it\u2019s part of the way we help communicate. But for me, good connections are more important, meaning how we connect the business\u2019s needs to the user\u2019s needs, wants or desires to the brand\u2019s personality and purpose. When you start marrying all of these, those are the designs that work well or can surprise you.\n\nCourtney Jimerson: I once came across a quote that resonated with me: \u2018Good design is hard to notice because it fits our needs so seamlessly that we don\u2019t even think about it.\u2019 In other words, it doesn\u2019t try too hard. I relate to this idea. Good design is strategically clear and extends beyond just form and function. It communicates effortlessly across any medium. But great design goes even further. It not only follows these principles but also evokes emotion, creating a connection that inspires and motivates on a human level.",

            "content": "Coca-Cola (KO) posted another strong quarter as it gains ground on rival PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nIn its fourth quarter earnings report, which came out before the market opened on Tuesday, the company bested the Street's estimates across the board. Revenue came in at $11.5 billion, compared to expectations of $10.67 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.55, compared to expectations of $0.52. That was largely driven by higher price/mix, which grew 9%, while unit case volume increased 2%.\n\nCEO James Quincey said the company continues \"to lead through dynamic external environments\" with \"global scale\" and \"local-market expertise\" that allows it to \"capture the vast opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\n\"It's only a handful of these consumer staple companies that are actually delivering the kind of growth that you would expect, or growth in line with their targets,\" Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance prior to earnings. The company strikes \"a decent balance between volume growth and price.\"\n\nFor the full year, organic revenue grew 12%, as higher prices helped counter headwinds like more cautious consumers, less favorable commodity costs, and more challenging trends in international markets.\n\n\"We believe [Coca-Cola's] ability to deliver strong positive mid-single digit organic revenue growth in an environment where many global staples peers are likely to deliver positive low-single digit growth (and in some cases are struggling to hit their algorithm) continues to stand out,\" UBS analyst Peter Grom said in a note prior to earnings.\n\nIn 2025, the company expects to deliver organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, as well as adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 3%.\n\nShares of the beverage giant are up 7% in the past year, compared to a 16% drop for PepsiCo. It still trails behind the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 20% gain.\n\nHere's what Coca-Cola reported in the fourth quarter, compared to what Wall Street expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nRevenue: $11.5 billion versus $10.67 billion\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $0.55 versus $0.52\n\nPrice/mix growth: 9% versus 6.71%\n\nUnit case volume growth: +2% versus -0.21%\n\nSpillane said previously if the Latin America market ends the year \"better than the last couple of quarters ... that would be a good sign for 2025.\"\n\nFor Q4, the region's net revenue grew 3%, while price/mix and unit case volume were up 23% and 2%, respectively, led by the growth of Coca-Cola drinks in the region.\n\nIn North America, unit case volume grew 1%, driven by \"growth in sparkling flavors, juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and Trademark Coca-Cola.\" Price/mix for the region also grew 12%, \"driven by pricing actions in the marketplace and favorable mix,\" the company said.",

The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018.

Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.

            "content": "Founded in 1898 and headquartered in Purchase, New York, PepsiCo, Inc. ( PEP ) is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. With a market cap of $198.3 billion , PepsiCo operates across multiple segments, offering a diverse portfolio of iconic brands, including Pepsi, Lay\u2019s, Gatorade, and Quaker. The company delivers innovative and consumer-centric products to markets worldwide, leveraging its strong distribution network and commitment to sustainability.\n\nShares of this food & beverage company have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. PEP has declined 15.7% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 20.6% . In 2025, PEP is down 4.9% compared to SPX\u2019s 2.5% gain on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in further, PEP has underperformed the Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF\u2019s ( FTXG ) 7% decline over the past year and a 4.6% drop on a YTD basis.\n\nPepsiCo's shares declined 4.5% on Feb. 4 after reporting mixed Q4 earnings . Revenue came in at $27.78 billion, flat year-over-year and slightly below analyst expectations of $27.91 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.96 beat estimates marginally.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, the company forecasts low-single-digit organic revenue growth and mid-single-digit constant-FX EPS growth. Operating margin improved to 8.1% from 6% a year ago, while the free cash flow margin increased to 13.7% from 10.4%. Organic revenue rose 2.1% year-over-year, but sales volumes declined 1%, a notable improvement from the 4% decline in the same period last year.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect PEP\u2019s EPS to grow 2.2% year over year to $8.34. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 20 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 10 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, nine \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThe configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with eight analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 6, Barclays ( BCS ) lowered PepsiCo\u2019s price target from $158 to $153 while maintaining an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating. Despite 2025 guidance meeting expectations, analysts remain skeptical about PepsiCo\u2019s strategy to stabilize Frito-Lay North America and the broader salty snacks segment.\n\nThe mean price target of $167.58 represents a premium of 15.9% to PEP\u2019s current levels. The Street-high price target of $189 implies a potential upside of 30.7% from the current price level.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts On These 8 Stocks and the Packaged Goods Playbook. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently took a deep dive into the challenges facing the consumer packaged goods sector, offering his perspective on the factors driving the decline of these stocks.\n\n\u201cThe recent decline in the consumer packaged goods stocks, I find it breathtaking\u2026 Why is this happening? The truth is, there are a host of reasons, and every time you think that things have gotten better, they seem to have gotten worse, much worse than you\u2019ve imagined.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 9 Stocks and Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks Leading the Dow Higher in 2025\n\nCramer noted that many companies within the sector seem to believe that younger consumers will settle for smaller portions of food and that this might mitigate some of the challenges. While Cramer acknowledged that this shift in consumer behavior is part of the equation, he argued that many companies are overlooking the significant impact of GLP-1 weight loss drugs. These medications, which curb cravings for junk food, pose a serious threat, as Cramer sees them as something that could be widely adopted in the United States. He then added:\n\n\u201cOh, and let\u2019s not forget about the problem of tariffs. You\u2019re getting some sudden price increases for many goods. Someone has to pay for the tariffs. These companies hope it will be you because if it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.\u201d\n\nAnother significant challenge for companies in the packaged goods space is the difficulty of raising prices. Cramer explained that while many companies try to increase prices, they often face fierce competition from major retailers and online marketplaces, which offer private-label products that consumers increasingly recognize as being just as good as the branded alternatives.\n\nWhile private labels are not seeing explosive growth at the moment, Cramer pointed out that they are exerting pressure on all prices, including those of established brands. Furthermore, Cramer observed that the price hikes implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to consumer fatigue, with many shoppers now seeking better value.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what turns around the consumer packaged goods stocks, mergers would make sense. This new antitrust department probably blessed the concentration. Maybe the companies that slash prices the deepest ultimately win. No matter, this moment is untenable. The stocks can\u2019t find their footing, just too many forces against them. These used to be safety stocks for heaven\u2019s sake, but they\u2019re safe no more.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nCramer deep-dived into a significant challenge that PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is facing: effects of the weight loss drugs and changes in eating habits.\n\n\u201cThe other day, PepsiCo got crushed on weaker than expected earnings\u2026 So take PepsiCo, I don\u2019t know if people realize how excellent this company really is. The stock always carried a premium price to earnings multiple, meaning we\u2019re willing to pay extra for its profits. They have terrific brands at Pepsi, Mountain Dew\u2026 FritoLay, the latter being one of the most dependable of all staples. But now PepsiCo\u2019s got a problem because FritoLay is not delivering the consistent numbers that it used to. Why? Management says it\u2019s because younger generations fixate on health and there\u2019s nothing particularly healthy about potato chips or Cheetos. They\u2019ll buy smaller portions. That\u2019s what their hope is. Me? Look, I\u2019m sure that a part, that\u2019s a part of it, but I do think that PepsiCo\u2019s in somewhat of denial about the impact of GLP-1 weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk, which reported a terrific quarter this morning, and Eli Lilly, which reports tomorrow.\u201d\n\nCramer then highlighted that taking these weight loss drugs can result in lowered cravings for junk food. Moreover, he noted that they could be used by up to 40 million people in the U.S., a number that might be on the lower side considering that 42% of American adults are obese.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a leading company in the manufacturing, promotion, and distribution of a wide range of beverages and snack products, including popular brands like Lay\u2019s, Gatorade, Pepsi, Doritos, Tropicana, and Aquafina.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) stock fell 4.5% on Tuesday, putting it within just a couple of percentage points of a 52-week low.\n\nThe food and beverage titan reported fairly weak full-year 2024 results. 2025 guidance calls for a prolonged slowdown across its business units, with a low single-digit increase in organic revenue and a mid-single-digit rise in core constant currency earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDespite the poor results and bleak outlook, here are three reasons why PepsiCo is a dividend stock worth buying now.\n\n1. A diversified business model\n\nPepsiCo is a highly diversified business -- both in terms of the products it sells and its geographical reach. Compared to a company like Coca-Cola, which almost exclusively focuses on the non-alcoholic beverage category, PepsiCo owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods, and has dozens of brands spanning coffee, tea, energy drinks, soda, juice, chips, snacks, dips, spreads, and more.\n\nPepsiCo benefits from diversification because the company isn't tied to one product or end market. But diversification can also weigh down the broader business.\n\nAs you can see in the following table, Frito-Lay North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China are all fairly high-margin. But PepsiCo Beverages North America -- the largest segment by revenue -- is also PepsiCo's lowest-margin segment.\n\nSegment 2024 Revenue 2024 Operating Profit 2024 Operating Margin Frito-Lay North America $24.755 billion $6.316 billion 25.5% Quaker Foods North America $2.676 billion $303 million 11.3% PepsiCo Beverages North America $27.769 billion $2.302 billion 8.3% Latin America $11.718 billion $2.245 billion 19.2% Europe $13.874 billion $2.019 billion 14.6% Africa, Middle East, and South Asia $6.217 billion $798 million 12.8% Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region $4.845 billion $811 million 16.7% Total $91.854 billion $12.887 billion 14%\n\nEnergy drinks have the potential to boost PepsiCo's beverage business. PepsiCo has a distribution agreement with Celsius Holdings, as well as a minority stake. But PepsiCo didn't mention energy drinks or Celsius in its prepared remarks. When an analyst asked about energy drinks, management responded by brushing off the question, saying there was nothing to update about, which seemed a little strange given past optimism about energy drinks.\n\nPepsiCo is facing demand challenges and difficult pricing power across its business. However, on the earnings call, management reaffirmed its intentions to deliver high single-digit EPS growth over the long term.\n\nPepsiCo seems optimistic about its long-term growth potential, but didn't shy away from the extent of near-term challenges and the sluggish growth the business is projected to have in the near term.\n\n2. A reasonable valuation\n\nUnderstandably, the stock has sold off, given PepsiCo's slowdown. But PepsiCo has fallen to bargain bin levels, especially for such a high-quality company.\n\nBased on 2024 full-year EPS of $6.95 and a stock price of $143.49 at the time of this writing, PepsiCo has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 20.6. That's a steep discount compared to the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 30.2.\n\nPepsiCo's median P/E ratio over the last three-year, five-year, seven-year, and 10-year periods has ranged from 26.1 to 26.6. So investors are getting the chance to scoop up shares of PepsiCo at a considerable discount to its historical average.\n\nGranted, short-term-minded investors may argue that PepsiCo deserves to trade at a discount, because it isn't growing as fast as it did in past years. But long-term investors know that some of the best decisions are made when a great company sells off for factors that have little to do with the core investment thesis.\n\nPepsiCo has a clear runway for long-term growth, especially internationally. It may take a couple of years for the company to get back to the pace of growth investors had grown accustomed to in recent years. But the valuation already reflects this challenge. Better yet, investors can get paid to wait for the business to recover, with an impeccable dividend.\n\n3. A paradise for passive income investors\n\nPepsiCo's dividend is as good as it gets. The company just announced a 5% dividend raise, marking the 53rd consecutive year it has increased its payout. That means PepsiCo retains its coveted spot on the list of Dividend Kings, which are companies that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nPepsiCo's dividend raise boosts the quarterly payout to $1.4225 per share, starting with the June 2025 payment. Based on a forward dividend of $5.69 per share and a stock price of $143.49, PepsiCo has a yield of 4%. That's a significantly higher yield than other Dividend Kings like Procter & Gamble -- which has a 2.4% yield -- or even Coca-Cola's 3.1% yield.\n\nOver the last 15 years, PepsiCo's yield has mostly hovered around 2.5% to 3%. So the stock's sell-off, plus consistent raises, have pushed its yield to historically high levels -- creating a compelling passive income opportunity for patient investors.\n\nPepsiCo is a high-conviction buy\n\nPepsiCo isn't firing on all cylinders, but neither is the stock price. At times like this, it's best to focus on the big picture to see if the sell-off has gone too far.\n\nThe packaged food industry is in a slowdown, not just PepsiCo. PepsiCo is still growing in key markets and exhibiting good margins, but it's being weighed down by a strong dollar, which is leading to unfavorable foreign exchange. The stock is cheap by historical levels, and the yield is far higher than historical averages. So, the struggles in the underlying business have been more than reflected in the valuation.\n\nNow is the perfect time for patient investors to scoop up shares of PepsiCo and collect passive income while the business navigates these challenges. PepsiCo's high yield provides a worthwhile incentive to simply hold the stock, instead of trying to time the turnaround.\n\nAdd it all up, and PepsiCo stands out as one of the best dividend-paying value stocks to buy now -- especially for risk-averse investors looking for a company they can count on to keep raising its dividend, even when the business isn't at its best.",

            "content": "When searching for new stocks to invest in, dividend investors usually try to find a good compromise between income, income stability, and growth potential. There's no perfect investment that scores high on all three at once, so trade-offs have to be made. Right now, PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) looks like it is offering investors a good combination of positives because it is facing some near-term negatives that seem likely to be temporary headwinds.\n\nHere's why buying PepsiCo today could help to set you up for a lifetime of reliable dividends.\n\nWhat does PepsiCo do?\n\nGiven the company's name, PepsiCo often gets looked at as a beverage company. This isn't wrong, as it does produce a broad range of beverages along with its namesake brand. However, the company is far more diversified, producing and marketing snacks and packaged food products as well. In fact, the consumer staples giant's snack business is probably more exciting than its beverage business, given that PepsiCo is the No. 2 player in non-alcoholic beverages but the No. 1 player in salty snacks with its Frito-Lay business.\n\nAnd while the packaged food operation isn't near the top of the pack, PepsiCo's Quaker Oats division has some serious name recognition. All in, PepsiCo is a huge force within the consumer staples sector with a diversified portfolio of products that are truly differentiated. It is pretty close to a one-stop shop in the food space.\n\nIts industry-leading position, meanwhile, is protected by its size and scale. PepsiCo has a distribution network and marketing team that are hard to compete with. Given its size and financial strength, it can act as an industry consolidator, noting that it just recently bought a Mexican-American food brand called Siete. This type of acquisition can quickly add to PepsiCo's growth because the smaller business gets plugged into PepsiCo's distribution network and benefits from increased advertising.\n\nIt's about more than just the business today with PepsiCo\n\nSo, from a big-picture perspective, PepsiCo is the kind of company that allows investors to benefit from its strong potential for long-term business growth. That, however, is only half the story since buying a good company at too high a price can turn it into a bad investment.\n\nPepsiCo's recent performance, coupled with tough industry dynamics, has pushed the shares into value territory. The 3.6% dividend yield is near all-time highs, and the price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-book value ratios are all below their five-year averages. PepsiCo stock looks like it has been put on the sales rack.\n\nWhy is PepsiCo so cheap today? The company's financial performance has cooled after a strong run following the coronavirus pandemic. There are concerns that new weight loss drugs will hurt demand. And it seems as though regulators are turning in a more health-conscious direction. These are all legitimate issues to consider, but bear in mind that PepsiCo has increased its dividend annually for more than five decades, making it a Dividend King. You don't build a record like that by accident; it requires a strong and resilient business. Or, to put that more succinctly, PepsiCo has muddled through hard times before, and if history is any guide, it will likely do so again this time around, too.\n\nWhat do you get with PepsiCo?\n\nIf you buy PepsiCo stock today, you are getting a stock that has fallen about 20% from its all-time highs. That means it has a historically high yield and a historically cheap valuation. And yet it is backed by a very strong business.\n\nDividend investors looking to be set up with a lifetime of strong dividends should be very interested. So, too, should dividend growth investors, given the track record of annual dividend increases. Growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors should also find the stock appealing, considering the valuation. If you think in decades and not days, PepsiCo appears to be a great long-term investment opportunity today. It is the kind of stock you buy and hold onto for the rest of your life.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nConsumer Staples Outlook For 2025\n\nConsumer staples refer to essential daily-use products such as packaged food, toothpaste, and dish detergent. These products often run out quickly off the supermarket shelves and are considered \u201cdefensive\u201d because consumers continue to purchase these necessities even during economic downturns. Moreover, consumer staple companies are mostly mature dividend payers.\n\nOn December 10, 2024, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager shared his outlook for the sector in a report published on Fidelity Investments. The consumer staples sector had a positive year but lagged behind the broader market due to investors favoring higher-growth stocks. The high interest rates and concerns about GLP-1 weight-loss drugs affecting food consumption also impacted performance negatively. However, despite these challenges, the sector still posted strong absolute gains. Compared to the S&P 500 index the consumer staple sector gained 16.7% on a year-to-date basis as of December 9, whereas the S&P 500 index gained 26.9% during the same time.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks to Buy Right Now and 10 High Growth Financial Stocks To Invest In.\n\nBen Shuleva from Fidelity Investments anticipates a return to normalcy for the consumer staples sector in 2025. He suggests this based on a broadly stable economic environment with healthy employment and steady real wage growth. In addition, the Fed is expected to begin cutting interest rates, which could boost dividend-paying stocks. Lastly, consumer spending has remained strong and is expected to remain resilient in 2025, thereby indicating positive sales growth for the sector. Shuleva anticipates that these factors will lead the sector to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, there could be a few uncertainties that could hamper the growth trajectory. The new presidential administration may introduce changes in tariff policies, which could affect certain consumer staples products. Although most consumer staples are manufactured domestically, so the direct impact of tariffs might be limited. Moreover, a strengthening US dollar can negatively affect consumer staples companies with international operations by reducing their foreign earnings when converted back into dollars. Shuleva emphasizes focusing on core fundamentals when investing in consumer staple companies, such as those operating in favorable market structures and maintaining strong underlying growth profiles.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo complete the list of the 12 best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. We selected pure-play Fast-Moving Consumer Goods-producing companies from the holdings of these two ETFs and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them at the close of the third quarter. The number of hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter 2024 database.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an international producer and seller of renowned snacks and drinks. It is the company behind popular drinks including Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and more. The company also produces popular snacks under the brand names Lay\u2019s, Doritos, and Cheetos.\n\nOn February 6, Zheng Feng Chee, an analyst from DBS, maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $172. Feng Chee kept the Buy rating for various reasons, including the company\u2019s focus on strategic product development and category diversification. For instance, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in January closed its acquisition deal of Siete Foods for $1.2 billion. Siete Foods makes food for people looking for grain-free and dairy-free options. Analyst Fee Chee expects this will further diversify the product portfolio of the company thereby boosting growth by tapping into the underpenetrated away-from-home food segment.\n\nMoreover, Fend Chee also sees substantial growth potential in international markets due to lower per capita consumption of snacks and beverages compared to the US. During fiscal 2024 the company generated $91.8 billion in revenue up slightly from the $91.4 billion generated in 2023. Management during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call indicated their plan to build upon the successful expansion of international business while focusing on the North American segment.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 4th on our list of best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While it\u2019s not necessarily driven by the increasing usage of GLP-1 medications, CPGs are keeping an eye on both of these consumer behaviors and catering to the wellness-aware crowd.\n\nAccording to Innova Market Insights , 52% of North American consumers have become more aware of their mindful snacking habits and 51% believe snacking boosts their emotional well-being. Mondelez\u2019s State of Snacking report from last year reported that consumers rely on snacks for perceived benefits such as boosting energy (75%), improving mood (74%), and aligning with fitness goals (70%).\n\nLow-Sugar, Protein-Rich\n\nPepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a recent call with investors that there\u2019s been a multi-year evolution of the consumer in the U.S. \u2014 an awareness to the food and drinks they consume. He\u2019s cited shifts in behavior as well as in social conversations, likely driven by the discourse around obesity drugs.\n\nWhile he reported very little impact in the business and its categories directly related to GLP-1 usage, there is a subset of consumers looking for more functionality \u2014 more protein and whole grain in their snacks, more plant-based options, he said. Kroger also predicted that 2025 would bring a protein renaissance as consumers look to maintain energy levels throughout the day and support overall health.\n\nOne of the biggest areas of opportunity is portion control, said Laguarta, leaving room for CPGs to stay in their categories with smaller sizes of consumer favorites or by cutting down on sodium, fat, sugar, and artificial ingredients.\n\n\u201cIf you think about SunChips and how SunChips is innovating with whole grain and now legumes, if you think about Stacy's with whole grain, if you think about Quaker with protein snacks, if you think about popping and baking and better frying, lower fat frying options that we're putting on in front of consumers \u2014 those are all tools in our portfolio enabled by very capable R&D that we will continue to expand,\u201d said Laguarta.\n\nThe company is also investing in the mini-meals category as a result, targeting consumers who are looking for a 200-calorie, 300-calorie solution \u201cthat takes them over for the next few hours into their next job or whatever they're trying to accomplish.\u201d",

PepsiCo exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) and revenues in fourth-quarter 2024. However, the top line declined year over year. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Revenues continued to be affected by weak category trends in the North America convenient food business, ongoing recall-related issues at QFNA and business disruptions caused by escalating geopolitical tensions in some international markets. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s bottom line benefited from effective cost controls, driven by incremental investments to improve market competitiveness. The unit volume was down 1% each for the convenient food and beverage businesses. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 2%. While organic revenues grew 2.1% year over year, the company\u2019s consolidated organic volume was down 1% in the fourth quarter. However, effective net pricing improved 3% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Estimate Revision Trend\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP's 2025 and 2026 EPS moved down in the last seven days, indicating negative sentiment among analysts for the company's earnings. Although the company\u2019s outlook looks decent, analysts seem less confident about PepsiCo\u2019s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 EPS have moved down 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nFor 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP\u2019s sales and EPS implies 2.6% and 3.4% year-over-year growth, respectively.

The company continues to face challenges in its QFNA segment due to product recalls and weak category performance. The QFNA segment, which includes brands like Quaker Oats, has been affected by recalls tied to contamination concerns, such as Salmonella, involving various cereals and snacks. These issues have reduced sales and profits in recent quarters.\n\n\n\nThe North America convenient foods business has experienced weak demand, led by higher prices and product recalls in the QFNA segment. Revenues were impacted by business disruptions from escalating geopolitical tensions in certain international markets. PepsiCo's aggressive price hikes in response to rising inflation over recent years have pressured volumes as consumers adjust their spending amid economic challenges.\n\nDoes PepsiCo\u2019s Stock Valuation Discount Signals Trouble?\n\nPEP is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 16.95X, below the industry average of 17.3X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 22.25X.\n\n\n\nAlthough PepsiCo\u2019s stock valuation is currently lower than that of its industry peers, this gap might not be as advantageous as it appears. The lower price could signal underlying issues rather than presenting a straightforward investment opportunity. At this moment, its current valuation seems unwarranted. PepsiCo has a Value Score of D.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPEP\u2019s Investment Strategy\n\nInvesting in the PepsiCo stock requires a thoughtful strategy, especially given the company\u2019s recent challenges in its North America operations and the broader market environment. Recent market data suggests bleak prospects for near-term recovery in its North America business.\n\n\n\nTrading at a discounted P/E, below the industry average, PEP may seem to offer a compelling value. However, its muted estimate revision trend and bearish technical indicators call for a cautious approach for new investors.

Ltd. to build a Quaker oat production facility in Huai\u2019an City, China.\n\nUnder the nearly 500 million yuan ($68.6 million) project, PepsiCo and Jiangsu Rilong Food have begun constructing an approximately 100,000-square-meter (1.08 million-square-foot) plant in Lianshui County, located in Jiangsu Province north of Shanghai. The facility is expected to become operational in 2025.\n\nA spokesperson for PepsiCo said the Huai\u2019an City plant will have an estimated annual manufacturing capacity of up to 160,000 tonnes and produce about 10 types of oat cereal in various packaging formats.\n\n\u201cAs the latest investment by PepsiCo in China, PepsiCo has reached a strategic cooperation with Jiangsu Rilong,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe two sides will jointly invest in the construction of this food factory. Under the new cooperation model, PepsiCo is expected to leverage Jiangsu Rilong\u2019s production experience and technology to enhance the quality and production efficiency of Quaker oat products, quickly respond to consumers\u2019 diversified demands for cereal nutrition foods and further strengthen its market competitiveness.\u201d\n\nShe described Jiangsu Rilong Food as a \u201clong-term partner of PepsiCo in China,\u201d adding, \u201cRilong has over 20 years of experience in oatmeal processing and production. The shared pursuit of quality by both parties has led to a deeper and longer-term strategic cooperation.\u201d\n\nPurchase-based PepsiCo has invested in 11 food plants and 60 beverage plants in China, including via the PepsiCo-Kangshifu (Tingyi Holding Corp.) beverage alliance formed over a decade ago, the spokesperson said. During the last six years, PepsiCo steadily has raised its investment in China to a pace of opening or expanding one food plant each year, she said.\n\nIn September 2024, for example, the PepsiCo Shandong food production plant went into operation in Linshu County, Linyi City, Shandong Province. A few months earlier, in June, PepsiCo broke ground for its Shaanxi food production base \u2014 the company\u2019s 10th food plant in China \u2014 in Xi\u2019an City, Shanxi Province. Also, in September 2023, the second phase of the PepsiCo Guangdong plant began operations in Danzao County, Foshan City, Guangdong Province. The Guangdong facility marked PepsiCo\u2019s first food production base in southern China.",

            "content": "The Super Bowl is evolving into a mainstream consumer celebration.\n\nIn columns I wrote in 2024, I described how Halloween is becoming a spending event on par with Christmas and Thanksgiving and how football season is turning into the latest omnichannel selling season.\n\nNow, the grand finale to the football season, the Super Bowl, is emerging as a single-day event with consumer participation and interest approaching that of calendar mainstays such as Christmas.\n\nAccording to data from Numerator, two-thirds of consumers will watch the \u201cBig Game,\u201d and a combined half of those viewers will host or attend a home gathering or watch in a bar or restaurant. This is a national party, and retailers and brands want to be sure they\u2019re included on the guest list via every selling and marketing channel possible.\n\nIn observance of the upcoming holiday, here\u2019s a look three different ways retailers and brands are reaching out to consumers celebrating the Super Bowl:\n\nShoppable streaming\n\nThe Tubi streaming service is providing shoppable curated digital stores as part of its Super Bowl coverage. The ad-supported streaming service, owned by Fox Corp. (which has broadcast rights to Super Bowl LIX), is offering a shoppable experience called \u201cThe Tubi Red Carpet Shop\u201d in partnership with the Shopsense AI livestream shopping platform.\n\nTubi viewers are able to purchase items within curated digital stores by visiting shop.tubi.tv on their smartphones through Feb. 9. Assortment includes game day party essentials, trends inspired by football player wives and girlfriends, audio products inspired by music from the Super Bowl, and team apparel and fan gear.\n\nDirect-to-consumer drones\n\nPepsiCo and Wing will be delivering free game-day snacks to select customers during Super Bowl weekend. The CPG food and beverage giant and Wing, the on-demand drone delivery provider powered by Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, will let customers in Frisco, Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex) order a free \u201cPepsiCo Party Pack\u201d via the Wing app during Super Bowl weekend.\n\nThe promotional pack features Doritos chips, Tostitos dips, and Pepsi Zero Sugar soda, in time for Super Bowl kick-off in New Orleans on Feb. 9. This marks PepsiCo\u2019s first foray into drone delivery.\n\nWing\u2019s automated, all-electric drones can deliver small items and meals in minutes, cruising at approximately 65 mph at a height of about 150 feet. The drone will lower customer orders to the turf for them to unpack.\n\nDiscount bundles\n\nWalmart and Amazon have both offered special holiday bundles for Christmas and Thanksgiving, featuring portions of products such as turkey, ham, stuffing and pie in a heavily discounted package which can be customized to serve the number of guests the customer is expecting.\n\nTypically, these bundles are available to purchase online for home delivery or in-store pickup, and in some cases can also be purchased by in-store shoppers.\n\nIn another sign the Super Bowl is taking its place among the top U.S. consumer holidays, Walmart and Amazon are both providing sports fans with specially discounted \"Game Day\" meal promotions featuring tailgate menu favorites with delivery and in-store pickup options.\n\n[READ MORE: Walmart, Amazon offer 'Game Day' discount meals]\n\nAnd even those consumers lucky enough to attend the Super Bowl in person will benefit from advanced omnichannel technology. Parish Pizza & Provisions, featuring Little Caesars, located in Section 115 in Caesars Superdome in New Orleans where the game is taking place, will have 12 Samsung kiosks running the Grubbrr self-ordering system available in the area.\n\nCustomers place and pay for orders at the kiosks and then pick up their orders at a nearby food locker. The kiosks also enable consumers to browse and order from several different stadium venue menus simultaneously and then pick up their entire order at a single location.",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nPepsiCo is focusing more on catering to consumers looking for value and boosting its better-for-you options as it aims to stoke growth in its snacks business.\n\nRamon Laguarta, PepsiCo\u2019s CEO, told analysts that \u201cvalue is the number one decision maker\u201d and the reason why the snacking category has slowed during the last year. He said the food and beverage manufacturer will offer additional multi-count packages in smaller counts with lower price points that consumers can purchase depending on their budgets.\n\nPepsiCo highlighted efforts to increase sales of healthier snacks like Simply, which has no artificial colors or flavors, as well as high protein items such as Quaker. The recent acquisitions of Siete and Sabra also increase its presence in better-for-you foods while building its exposure in meals.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nA decline in volumes among Pepsico\u2019s Frito-Lay and Quaker foods businesses come as consumers snack less and cut back on their spending. But executives remain upbeat that conditions are improving.\n\nThe maker of Cheetos, Doritos and Sun Chips started seeing volume growth in snacks during the last three months of the year along with a slight price improvement, Laguarta told analysts.\n\n\u201cWe're very confident that our North America business will accelerate this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're very confident in our plans and our long-term. And we see opportunities, especially away from home.\u201d\n\nLaguarta downplayed the need to lower prices across its portfolio to attract consumers. Instead, PepsiCo plans to use a \u201csurgical price pack strategy and execution strategy\u201d to drive growth in snacks.\n\nThe food and beverage giant\u2019s revenue during the fourth quarter was $27.8 billion, down slightly from $27.9 billion a year earlier. Revenue climbed roughly $400 million to $91.9 billion during PepsiCo\u2019s 2024 fiscal year, with net income rising to $9.6 billion from $9.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nPepsiCo forecast a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue across its food and beverage business for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nA study released in January found GLP-1 drug use cuts grocery spending by 6%. Purchases of calorie-dense, processed items such as chips, baked goods and cookies were the most affected.\n\nWhile the New York-based company hasn\u2019t seen a \u201cdirect impact\u201d from GLP-1 medications, Laguarta said a higher level of awareness in health and wellness is driving consumer shifts in snacking and other categories.\n\nPepsiCo, he noted, can benefit through its portion-controlled offerings, higher protein items and innovation in better-for-you snacks, such as Sun Chips with legumes or Stacy\u2019s pita chips with whole grains. It\u2019s also trying to participate in protein beverages \u201cwith a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nFood and beverage companies have seen product volumes drop as inflation-weary consumers cut back on spending. This has weighed on companies like PepsiCo, forcing them to find ways to juice sales and improve margins. Laguarta said his company plans to devote more attention to growing some of its lower-cost brands such as Chester\u2019s.\n\nBrittany Quatrochi, an analyst with Edward Jones, said PepsiCo is focused on spending more on marketing, innovation and promotions to drive growth in its brands. She also noted that it has strong market shares in snacks and beverages, giving it an advantage in dealing with suppliers and grocers.\n\n\u201cLonger-term, Pepsi is investing into its supply chain, consumer data analytics, and digital marketing with a focus on improving productivity and driving improved sales growth,\u201d Quatrochi said in a research note. \u201cThese investments should drive solid earnings growth over time.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s earnings came out the same day the Senate Finance Committee voted to forward the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the full Senate. Kennedy, who would oversee the FDA as secretary of Health and Human Services, has targeted ultra-processed foods for instigating the obesity epidemic and said they should be removed from school lunches.",

Participants will be asked Super Bowl trivia while throwing footballs at a target that functions as the answer button.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Cheetos House of Mischief, with mascot Chester leading an immersive group psychic reading and custom Cheetos Tarot Cards.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nPotato chips get their moment in the sun with Lay\u2019s Craw-Chip Boil, featuring Lay\u2019s chips infused in classic New Orleans-inspired dishes, including Lay\u2019s Classic Chicken Gumbo and Lay\u2019s Salt and Vinegar Cool Shrimp Creole.\n\nLay's is one of hundreds of brands hoping to capture fan enthusiasm. New Orleans officials estimate 200,000 are heading to the city to celebrate -- about twice as many as in a typical week. Among the biggest draws: A Super Bowl parade, Mardi Gras-style, through the French Quarter, featuring plenty of music and the Budweiser Clydesdales.\n\nSecurity continues to be a big concern, with residents and attendees still on edge about the New Year\u2019s Day attack on Bourbon Street, which killed 14 people.\n\nSeparately, the company revealed the game-day spot for Lay\u2019s, a sweet look at a young potato farmer, hoping her spuds make the potato-chip big time. This marks the brand\u2019s first return to the game since 2022, the same year PepsiCo gave up on sponsoring the game\u2019s halftime shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Lay\u2019s continues to deal with the fallout from a recall, first issued in mid-December. While the number of products included in the allergen-related recall is small -- about 6,000 bags of chips in Washington and Oregon, and the company says the product has been removed from the marketplace -- the Food & Drug Administration last week upgraded the recall to the highest risk level, warning it could \u201ccause serious adverse health consequences or death\" to those with milk allergies.",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nPepsiCo is focusing more on catering to consumers looking for value and boosting its better-for-you options as it aims to stoke growth in its snacks business.\n\nRamon Laguarta, PepsiCo\u2019s CEO, told analysts that \u201cvalue is the number one decision maker\u201d and the reason why the snacking category has slowed during the last year. He said the food and beverage manufacturer will offer additional multi-count packages in smaller counts with lower price points that consumers can purchase depending on their budgets.\n\nPepsiCo highlighted efforts to increase sales of healthier snacks like Simply, which has no artificial colors or flavors, as well as high protein items such as Quaker. The recent acquisitions of Siete and Sabra also increase its presence in better-for-you foods while building its exposure in meals.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nA decline in volumes among Pepsico\u2019s Frito-Lay and Quaker foods businesses come as consumers snack less and cut back on their spending. But executives remain upbeat that conditions are improving.\n\nThe maker of Cheetos, Doritos and Sun Chips started seeing volume growth in snacks during the last three months of the year along with a slight price improvement, Laguarta told analysts.\n\n\u201cWe're very confident that our North America business will accelerate this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're very confident in our plans and our long-term. And we see opportunities, especially away from home.\u201d\n\nLaguarta downplayed the need to lower prices across its portfolio to attract consumers. Instead, PepsiCo plans to use a \u201csurgical price pack strategy and execution strategy\u201d to drive growth in snacks.\n\nThe food and beverage giant\u2019s revenue during the fourth quarter was $27.8 billion, down slightly from $27.9 billion a year earlier. Revenue climbed roughly $400 million to $91.9 billion during PepsiCo\u2019s 2024 fiscal year, with net income rising to $9.6 billion from $9.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nPepsiCo forecast a low-single-digit increase in organic revenue across its food and beverage business for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nA study released in January found GLP-1 drug use cuts grocery spending by 6%. Purchases of calorie-dense, processed items such as chips, baked goods and cookies were the most affected.\n\nWhile the New York-based company hasn\u2019t seen a \u201cdirect impact\u201d from GLP-1 medications, Laguarta said a higher level of awareness in health and wellness is driving consumer shifts in snacking and other categories.\n\nPepsiCo, he noted, can benefit through its portion-controlled offerings, higher protein items and innovation in better-for-you snacks, such as Sun Chips with legumes or Stacy\u2019s pita chips with whole grains. It\u2019s also trying to participate in protein beverages \u201cwith a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nFood and beverage companies have seen product volumes drop as inflation-weary consumers cut back on spending. This has weighed on companies like PepsiCo, forcing them to find ways to juice sales and improve margins. Laguarta said his company plans to devote more attention to growing some of its lower-cost brands such as Chester\u2019s.\n\nBrittany Quatrochi, an analyst with Edward Jones, said PepsiCo is focused on spending more on marketing, innovation and promotions to drive growth in its brands. She also noted that it has strong market shares in snacks and beverages, giving it an advantage in dealing with suppliers and grocers.\n\n\u201cLonger-term, Pepsi is investing into its supply chain, consumer data analytics, and digital marketing with a focus on improving productivity and driving improved sales growth,\u201d Quatrochi said in a research note. \u201cThese investments should drive solid earnings growth over time.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s earnings came out the same day the Senate Finance Committee voted to forward the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the full Senate. Kennedy, who would oversee the FDA as secretary of Health and Human Services, has targeted ultra-processed foods for instigating the obesity epidemic and said they should be removed from school lunches.",

That was short of Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $27.89 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nU.S. demand flagged last year after two years of outsize, double-digit price increases.

This is the company's third damaging miss in revenue predictions in a row.\n\nThis is attributed to decreased consumer spending on salty and savory snack items such as those in the Frito Lay North America segment. These difficulties notwithstanding, the net income for PepsiCo was $1.52 billion, or $1.11 per share, up from $1.3 billion, or 94c per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share was adjusted to $1.96, which was slightly above the expected $1.94.\n\nOther than the 6% organic revenue growth internationally, in Africa and Asia too, the company has done a great job. PepsiCo forecasts low single-digit organic revenue growth for 2025 and has stated that it is set to increase its annual dividend by 5%, which is the 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases.\n\nIn light of changing consumer tastes, the company is set to relaunch its Simply product line and add to its multicultural snack offerings. Moreover, PepsiCo also seeks to increase productivity by automating its plants and warehouses.\n\nThe disappointment in PepsiCo's revenue miss caused its shares to fall by 4.5 following the earnings announcement.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

For the year, revenue climbed slightly to about $91.9 billion from $91.5 billion, while net income rose to about $9.6 billion from $9.1 billion a year earlier.\n\nAs some consumers have felt their wallets pinched by inflation, particularly higher prices for food in recent months, Wall Street analysts and investors have been closely watching sales volumes at leading food companies. For the quarter that ended Dec. 28, volumes for PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay business in North America, which, at $7.3 billion, accounts for about a quarter of PepsiCo\u2019s total revenues and is home to popular munchies like Doritos and Cheetos, fell 3 percent.

The metric strips out pricing and foreign exchange.\n\nBut demand was weaker in the company's home market, North America. Pepsi has previously said that shoppers in the U.S. have grown more cautious, snacking less and making fewer purchases at convenience stores.\n\nStill, executives think Pepsi's domestic business will pick up again.\n\n\"We're very confident that our North American business will accelerate this year. We're confident in our plans ... and we see opportunities, especially away from home,\" Laguarta told analysts on the company's conference call.\n\nFrito-Lay North America's volume fell 3% in the quarter. Consumers have been watching their grocery budgets, thanks to several years of higher food prices and interest rates.\n\n\"In 2024, the salty and savory snack categories underperformed broader packaged food, following multiple years in which these categories had outperformed packaged food,\" CEO Ramon Laguarta and CFO Jamie Caulfield said in prepared remarks.\n\nThe company's North American beverage unit reported a 3% decline in quarterly volume. But there were some bright spots for the division, as Gatorade gained market share and Mountain Dew Baja Blast surpassed $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nPepsi is also planning to push more into protein drinks, executives said on the company's conference call. The segment is growing quickly, fueled in part by the adoption of GLP-1 drugs.\n\nQuaker Foods North America, still reeling from a recall from the prior December, saw its volume fall 6%. The company expects that Quaker's performance will improve in 2025 as it laps the fallout from the recall, executives said in prepared remarks.\n\nFor 2025, Pepsi is projecting a low-single-digit increase in its organic revenue and a mid-single-digit rise in its core constant currency earnings per share.\n\n\"Looking ahead to 2025, we will continue to build upon the successful expansion of our international business, while also taking actions to improve performance in North America,\" Laguarta said in a statement.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nPepsiCo missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $23.32 billion, flat year on year. It was a slower quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates and EBITDA in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nIs PepsiCo a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting PepsiCo\u2019s revenue to be flat year on year at $27.91 billion, in line with its flat revenue from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.94 per share.\n\nPepsiCo Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. PepsiCo has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates four times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at PepsiCo\u2019s peers in the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Altria delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 1.6%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.6%, and Tilray reported revenues up 8.9%, falling short of estimates by 3.6%. Altria\u2019s stock price was unchanged after the results, while Tilray was down 13.5%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Altria\u2019s results here and Tilray\u2019s results here.\n\nStocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, have had a good 2024. An economic soft landing (so far), the start of the Fed's rate cutting campaign, and the election of Donald Trump were positives for the market, and while some of the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underpeformed, with share prices down 3.5% on average over the last month. PepsiCo is up 2.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $172.71 (compared to the current share price of $150.23).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan: 15 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, discussed the upcoming market and corporate activity to look forward to this week, which will be dominated by earnings reports from various companies and an important inflation report from the Labor Department.\n\nCramer noted that Friday marked the heavy market focus on the prospect of the White House imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. As expected, the tariffs were announced, 25% from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, and the market, which had already been struggling, dropped further.\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Looked Closely At These 10 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 7 Stocks\n\nCramer noted that the Dow plunged by 337 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, and the Nasdaq declined by 0.28%. Adding fuel to the fire, President Trump later commented that he was \u201cnot concerned about the market\u2019s reaction.\u201d Cramer, reflecting on this, wished he could share that same sense of ease. He added:\n\n\u201cFinally, on Friday, we get the Labor Department\u2019s non-farm payroll and right now the Fed is concerned that the economy might be running too hot. If we get robust job growth with higher wages, then I doubt we\u2019ll see any rate hikes in the first half of the year.\u201d\n\nHe then posed the question: if investors are hoping for a rising stock market, what would they want to see? Cramer explained that a job report that\u2019s just \u201cso-so\u201d would be ideal, strong enough to keep rate cuts on the table, but not so strong as to hinder quarterly earnings.\n\n\u201cBottom line: When you get a week that\u2019s packed with important earnings reports and the monthly employment report plus the tariff news, you\u2019re usually better off sitting on your hands because there\u2019s just too much data for any individual to process even for an AI-powered individual. By the way, oh, let\u2019s just throw in this DeepSeek stuff, which has made tech too maddening to buy or sell and too, let\u2019s say boring. So if in doubt, do nothing.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 31. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nCramer mentioned that packaged food stocks like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been hit because of GLP-1s but mentioned its attractive yield as well.\n\n\u201cThe packaged food stocks have been dogs, dogs ever since the GLP-1 drugs burst on the scene, especially PepsiCo, one of my faves with its soft drink and snacks businesses. I think the new weight loss drugs make it hard for this great company to play offense. Hasn\u2019t helped that this supermarket has become an inflation battleground, but PepsiCo yields 3.6%. You never know when you can catch a total rotation into this beaten-down group.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a leading company in the production, marketing, and distribution of a wide range of beverages and snack products, featuring popular brands like Lay\u2019s, Gatorade, Pepsi, Doritos, Tropicana, and Aquafina. When Cramer discussed the company in November 2024, he recommended avoiding the stock, citing several factors that could negatively impact its performance.\n\nHe pointed out potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the impact of GLP-1 drugs on consumer behavior, and rising concerns about junk food consumption. Despite PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) offering a 3.5% yield at the time, Cramer believed these elements could cause the stock to decline as he stated, \u201cI think it goes lower.\u201d Since then, the stock has declined more than 10%.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 6th on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer\u2019s Game Plan. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "The Sangamon County Circuit Court\u2019s recent decision in PepsiCo Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue\u2014which held that PepsiCo improperly excluded an affiliate from its water\u2019s-edge combined return\u2014suggests that there are limits to the courts\u2019 willingness to condone tax-motivated corporate restructurings that rely on changes to accounting practices but have little or no economic substance to them.\n\nThe case also highlights the need for states to reconsider their statutes exempting \u201c80/20\u201d companies from combination. These statutes invite underreporting of in-state profits by allowing income to be shifted to genuine foreign operating companies and paper ones alike.\n\nIllinois is one of 14 states to exclude US corporations with at least 80% overseas property and payroll factors from the combined return. The carveout came into being as states moved away from worldwide combined reporting in the 1980s. It was justified as an accounting convenience for multinational enterprises, allowing them to conduct foreign operations through US subsidiaries without state tax complications. That historic justification seems increasingly tenuous in this age of sophisticated accounting software.\n\nPepsiCo affiliate PepsiCo Global Mobility LLC, or PGM, was established to meet the letter of the 80/20 laws even though its only business activity was holding the rights to PepsiCo\u2019s entire domestic snack foods business through a disregarded entity, Frito-Lay North America Inc.\n\nThe key to the plan was to establish PGM as the employer of record for scores of PepsiCo\u2019s overseas employees. The plan\u2019s downfall was that it was all too obvious that those employees had nothing to do with the domestic snack foods business.\n\nThe Sangamon County Circuit Court concluded that PGM \u201cwas created to operate and was, in fact, operating as a \u2018shell\u2019 company for purposes of tax benefits for Frito-Lay.\u201d\n\nBecause it was a shell company, PGM lacked the ability to control the activities of its nominal employees and so couldn\u2019t be considered their employer under common law standards. PepsiCo failed to rebut the state\u2019s prima facie case that the creation of PGM\u2014and the agreements that purported to place PepsiCo\u2019s overseas employees on PGM\u2019s books\u2014lacked economic substance. The circuit court\u2019s decision follows a similar conclusion reached by the Illinois Independent Tax Tribunal in 2021, concerning the 2011\u20132013 tax years.\n\nThe PepsiCo litigation is the latest example of the potential for abuse arising from the 80/20 exclusion. Minnesota eliminated its 80/20 carveout in 2013, following the determination of the state\u2019s highest court that a single employee\u2019s presence in the Cayman Islands was sufficient to allow a bank to avoid tax on its profits derived from loans to Minnesota customers.\n\nSome state tax practitioners took the holding in HMN Financial Inc. v. Commissioner and similar cases to signal that the federal economic substance doctrine had no place in state tax determinations. The PepsiCo decision comes as a welcome reaffirmation of the basic principle that substance controls over form in state as well as federal tax matters.\n\nThe mechanism by which 80/20 companies can be used to shift profits away from the states\u2019 taxing jurisdiction is easily explained. The federal tax code is designed to function on what is essentially a water\u2019s-edge combined reporting basis under its consolidated filing rules. The tax code permits property transfers between members of the consolidated group without recognition of gain, because the entire domestic group is essentially treated as a single taxpayer.\n\nTransfers of property to actual foreign affiliates, meanwhile, trigger a tax liability measured by the transferee\u2019s expected profits from that property. Because the 80/20 companies are regarded as domestic companies for federal tax calculations, no gain is recognized when a related party transfers intangible property to them, defeating the logic of the federal system.\n\nThe dual nature of these entities sets the stage for transferring unlimited amounts of intangible property\u2014and the profits commensurate with that property\u2014to an entity that the states have chosen not to tax. Similarly, 80/20 companies can be used to report global intangible low-taxed income and other federal income amounts that would otherwise be included in the state tax base.\n\nThe PepsiCo case\u2014and a similar case in Wisconsin involving the transfer of Skechers USA Inc.\u2019s intellectual property to a holding company\u2014may signal a refreshing willingness by state tax administrators to contest the economic substance of state-tax-motivated transactions.\n\nThe 2010 federal codification of the economic substance doctrine in Section 7701(o) of the tax code has buoyed the states\u2019 efforts. That provision places the burden of proof on a taxpayer to demonstrate that a transaction changed the taxpayer\u2019s economic position apart from tax savings, and had a substantial non-tax business purpose. It should provide a solid analytical foundation for courts to evaluate whether the tax effects of similar tax-motivated transactions should be disregarded.\n\nMany state tax minimization plans are similarly vulnerable to challenge under the economic substance doctrine. They tend to rely on transactions between members of the same federal consolidated group that occur mostly on paper and so would rarely be capable of changing the group\u2019s economic position in a meaningful way.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the absence of a legitimate policy justification for the state\u2019s 80/20 exclusion may have contributed to PepsiCo\u2019s inability to demonstrate the economic substance of its arrangement. It would be difficult to show how moving PepsiCo\u2019s domestic snack food business to a purported foreign operating company would increase the company\u2019s profitability\u2014or even that it had reduced compliance burdens.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that PepsiCo tried to prove either claim. Had there been a substantial purpose to the 80/20 carveout, the taxpayer may have succeeded in showing how its restructuring would advance that purpose.\n\nNot all transactions between taxpayers and their 80/20 cousins are susceptible to challenge under the economic substance doctrine, nor should they be. Instead, state legislatures must acknowledge that the policy reasons that might have supported the carveout in the 1980s no longer apply\u2014and consider eliminating this relic of what we affectionately call the \u201ctainted eighties.\u201d\n\nThe case is PepsiCo Inc. v.

            "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From PepsiCo Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) will release its fourth-quarter financial results, before the opening bell, on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025.\n\nWith the recent buzz around the soft drink company, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from dividends. As of now, PepsiCo offers an annual dividend yield of 3.60%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.35 cents per share (5.42 a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $166,814 or around 1,107 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $33,302 or around 221 shares.\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($5.42 in this case). So, $6,000 / $5.42 = 1,107 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $5.42 = 221 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nView more earnings on PEP\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nPrice Action: Shares of Pepsi fell 0.8% to close at $150.69 on Friday.\n\nAnalysts expect the Purchase, New York-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.94 per share, up from $1.78 per share in the year-ago period.\n\nPepsiCo projects quarterly revenue of $27.89 billion, compared to $27.85 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn Jan. 29, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi reiterated PepsiCo with a Sector Perform rating and maintained a $172 price target.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More:\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The festival is held at Woldenberg Riverfront Park in New Orleans.\n\nPepsi taps into New Orleans culture for Super Bowl LIX drink lineup\n\nDRIPS blends creative flavors crafted by expert mixologists (Image via Instagram/ @pepsico)\n\nThe three drinks: Dirty Gator, Starry Berry Beads, and the Pepsi Praline for Ya\u2014draw inspiration from New Orleans' culinary traditions. Developed in collaboration with local experts, the beverages aim to reflect regional favorites like pralines and the iconic Hurricane cocktail.\n\nAd\n\nScott Finlow, Pepsi Co's Away From Home chief marketing officer, described the menu as a \"Mardi Gras party in a cup\" in an interview with Food & Wine on February 1, 2025. The Dirty Gator combines Mountain Dew with pineapple, honeydew melon, vanilla creamer, and gator-shaped gummies, nodding to Louisiana's unofficial state reptile.\n\nMeanwhile, the Starry Berry Beads mixes passion fruit, lime, and edible glitter with Starry lemon-lime soda and fruity boba. The Praline for Ya layers brown sugar boba, praline syrup, and caramel-drizzled cold foam over either the regular or the Zero Sugar version of the soda.\n\nAd\n\nFree festival, themed sips: Inside the brand's Super Bowl beverage strategy\n\nThe drinks will be served at the mobile \"DRIPS\" bar, housed in a retrofitted Airstream trailer, during the two-day NOLA Eats Fest by the cola company. The free event at Woldenberg Riverfront Park will also feature 10 local restaurants serving Creole dishes, barbecue, and seafood, alongside a cookoff and craft cocktails. Celebrities like Action Bronson and Mannie Fresh are slated to appear.\n\nAd\n\nThe NOLA Eats Fest by the soda brand is a two-day event (Image via PepsiCo)\n\nThis marks the second activation for DRIPS, following a September 2024 pop-up in New York City. The concept targets Gen Z consumers through customizable drink elements like boba and cold foam. Finlow noted plans to expand to college campuses and festivals later in 2025, in the Food & Wine interview.\n\nAd\n\n\u201cDRIPS... is really the opportunity for people to experience our... brands and products in new and creative way,\u201d Finlow said.\n\nNon-alcoholic and Instagram-worthy drinks\n\nThe giant cold drink company emphasized that the Super Bowl LIX menu avoids alcohol, instead focusing on playful twists using its sodas.\n\nThe beverages will be available from 12 pm to 5 pm on both days, with recipes designed for social media appeal.\n\nAd\n\nThe gummy gators and glitter-topped drinks, for instance, are intended to encourage photo-sharing. Attendees can RSVP in advance via PepsiLocalEats.com, though walk-ins are permitted.\n\nThe Super Bowl LIX activations highlight its strategy to merge regional culture with beverage innovation, capitalizing on major events to test new concepts.\n\nWhile the limited-edition drinks are tied to the New Orleans festival, the DRIPS by the soda company initiative suggests broader ambitions to tap into customization trends. Updates on future DRIPS locations and menus are expected later this year.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

It announced it had created a large-language model capable of matching ChatGPT and other US rivals while using significantly less computing power read more\n\nDeepSeek's claims of having developed an AI for a fraction of the cost it has taken for Western developers had led to chipmaker Nvidia's stock registering losses. Reuters\n\nNvidia\u2019s meteoric rise in recent times came to a sudden halt earlier this week\u2013 on Monday (January 27), as its stock plunged nearly 17 per cent, wiping out $595 billion in market value.\n\nThe loss was roughly the combined worth of Starbucks, PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s, and Target, Times of India reported.\n\nThe steep drop followed a big development from a Chinese startup, DeepSeek. It announced it had created a large-language model capable of matching ChatGPT and other US rivals while using significantly less computing power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news triggered investor concerns over whether demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-performance chips\u2013 until then considered integral to artificial intelligence (AI) development\u2013 would remain as strong as previously expected.\n\nThe AI boom that propelled Nvidia\n\nFor years, Nvidia was known primarily for its role in gaming and cryptocurrency. But its dominance in AI computing turned it into a Wall Street giant, with its stock more than tripling in 2023 and more than doubling again in 2024.\n\nInvestors and analysts hailed CEO Jensen Huang as the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d as Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation surged past $3 trillion, briefly making it the most valuable company on Wall Street, ahead of Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe company\u2019s ascent was driven by surging demand for its specialised graphics processing units (GPUs), which outperform traditional central processing units (CPUs) in AI applications.\n\nTech giants flocked to buy Nvidia chips as they expanded their AI capabilities, using them for self-driving cars, content generation, and enterprise automation.\n\nNvidia\u2019s financial performance reflected this rapid growth. Quarterly revenue soared from $6.05 billion in early 2023 to $13.51 billion just six months later. By the three months ending October 2024, the company reported revenue of $35.08 billion. Nvidia\u2019s stock single-handedly accounted for more than a fifth of the S&P 500\u2019s total return in 2024, outpacing every other company, Time of India reported.\n\nThe shock on Wall Street\n\nMonday\u2019s selloff marked the worst single-day decline for Nvidia in years. DeepSeek\u2019s announcement raised fears that AI computing costs could drop, reducing the need for companies to spend as heavily on Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nThat uncertainty weighed on the broader AI sector, with suppliers and data centre power companies also seeing their stocks decline.\n\nSome investors viewed the plunge as a buying opportunity. While Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI remains strong, analysts say competition is intensifying.\n\nDespite the setback, many on Wall Street believe the AI revolution is far from over. If DeepSeek\u2019s advancements make AI more accessible and affordable, it could drive new innovations across the industry\u2013 potentially creating more opportunities for Nvidia in the long run.\n\nAdvertisement",

That\u2019s about as much as PepsiCo, McDonalds, Starbucks and Target are worth, combined.Mostly known only in gaming and crypto circles a few years ago, Nvidia burst into limelight in the last two years after seeing its sales surge because customers wanted its chips to train their chatbots and other artificial intelligence products.

The Santa Clara, California-based tech company\u2019s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.Huang has dubbed AI \u201cthe next industrial revolution,\u201d and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose chips like CPUs. Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI \u2014 a movement that\u2019s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music.The demand helped Nvidia's revenue grow by eye-popping levels, quarter after quarter. On Feb. 23, 2023, after Nvidia breezed past analysts' expectations for quarterly profit, Huang said that \u201cAI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.\u201d The company's quarterly revenue at the time was $6.05 billion.That ramped up to $7.19 billion just three months later and then nearly doubled to $13.51 billion three months after that. Revenue has since vaulted to $35.08 billion in the three months through October 2024.The company's stock price has similarly soared, and its total market value quickly passed rivals like Intel, Microsoft and others. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index's total return last year. No other stock came close, and it had more than triple Apple's impact.Unlike the dot-com boom, real money was behind Nvidia\u2019s surge, and its stock price rose on expectations of ever more to come. Those expectations came into question on Monday. DeepSeek and its seemingly lower-cost operations raised worries about whether companies would need to spend as many dollars on Nvidia chips as previously thought. The concerns dragged down stocks across the AI industry, including suppliers to the chip industry and the power companies hoping to electrify the vast data centers that were expected to get built to run those chips. But Nvidia was in the spotlight because its stock has become the brightest symbol of the AI bonanza.Some on Wall Street saw Monday's nearly 17% plunge for Nvidia's stock as an opportunity rather than a signal of pending doom, saying the stock became more affordable. If AI does become cheaper to run, it could open the door to new kinds of customers and software innovations that could ultimately help the industry in the long term.However, as John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told AP, \u201cAs for Nvidia itself, this isn\u2019t the first time a major tech stock has faced existential questions.\" \u201cWe\u2019ve seen similar situations with Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix \u2014 companies that were once doubted but ultimately rebounded.\u201d",

This ends their ten-year deal with PepsiCo that began in 2013.\n\nCEO Ron Vachris shared the news during the yearly shareholder meeting. Soon, customers will see Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, and Sprite back at food court fountains.\n\nThe popular $1.50 hot dog and soda combo will keep its price tag. This deal hasn\u2019t changed since the store first opened.\n\nThe switch back to Coca-Cola feels familiar for the retail giant. Coke was their go-to drink partner for years before PepsiCo stepped in back in 2013.\n\nCustomer complaints about drink quality drove the change. For years, people weren\u2019t happy with how their sodas tasted after the switch to Pepsi.\n\nShoppers have been getting frustrated with the current drink machines. Members are hoping new equipment will make getting drinks easier when the change happens.\n\nThe switch will roll out across U.S. stores throughout the summer. Each location\u2019s timing depends on when their current drink contract runs out.\n\nCostco\u2019s regular shoppers are split on the news. While Coke lovers are excited, Pepsi fans aren\u2019t happy about losing their drink options.\n\nThis move puts a familiar drink back in food courts across the country. Coca-Cola served up drinks at Costco for many years before PepsiCo took over.\n\nAnd that famous hot dog combo? Still $1.50. The store isn\u2019t budging on this fan favorite deal, no matter who\u2019s pouring the drinks.",

PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages.

This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018.

PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 numbers on Feb. 4, before the opening bell.\n\n\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $27.9 billion, implying 0.3% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. For quarterly earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at $1.95, suggesting 9.6% growth from the $1.78 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $92 billion, implying 0.6% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. For quarterly earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at $8.15, suggesting 7% growth from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings beat of 0.4%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nPEP's Earnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.43%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWhat to Look for in PEP\u2019s Q3 Earnings Release\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 revenue performance is expected to reflect the impacts of subdued category demand in its North American convenient food business and the effects of a product recall in the Quaker Foods North America (\u201cQFNA\u201d) segment. Additionally, revenues reflected business disruptions caused by escalating geopolitical tensions in some international markets.\n\n\n\nPEP\u2019s troubles in the North America markets are partially attributed to increased pricing in response to rising inflation in the past few years, which has led to reduced volumes as consumers adjust their spending habits amid economic pressures. These trends are expected to have hurt the performances of the Frito-Lay North America (\u201cFLNA\u201d) and PepsiCo Beverages North America (\u201cPBNA\u201d) divisions. We expect organic sales to be flat in FLNA and increase 1% in the PBNA segment in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nThe QFNA segment, which features brands such as Quaker Oats, has been adversely impacted by product recalls linked to contamination concerns like Salmonella, affecting various cereal and snack items. These recalls have weakened the segment's performance, resulting in diminished sales and profits in recent quarters. Continued headwinds from these recalls and certain inflationary pressures are expected to have resulted in a soft top line for the QFNA segment. Our model predicts organic revenues for the QFNA segment to decline 9% year over year in the fourth quarter and 15.7% in 2024.\n\n\n\nOn the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, management predicted year-over-year organic revenue growth in the low-single digits for 2024. It expects core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure. PepsiCo expects a core EPS of at least $8.15 for 2024. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $7.62 reported in 2023.\n\n\n\nOur model predicts year-over-year organic revenue growth of 2% for 2024, with core EPS growth of 7%. For the fourth quarter, we expect year-over-year organic revenue growth of 2.3%, with core EPS growth of 9.8%.",

The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

Revenues are expected to be $27.93 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some PepsiCo metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Net revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' stands at $1.49 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America' of $7.47 billion.

The estimate indicates a change of +2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net revenue- PepsiCo Beverages North America' will reach $7.95 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +0.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net revenue- Europe' should arrive at $4.41 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +4.5% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net revenue- Latin America' should come in at $3.76 billion. The estimate points to a change of -5.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' will reach $119.42 million.

            "content": "Dividends are one of the best sources of passive income you can receive. The good news is that numerous stocks not only pay quarterly dividends but have also steadily increased their payouts over time. By accumulating dividend stocks, you can slowly but steadily build up an increasing flow of passive income that you can rely on to supplement your earned income. These dividends can also help you sustain your lifestyle once you retire.\n\nThe key to finding dependable dividend stocks is to look for companies with sturdy business models, strong brands, and dominant positions that allow them to churn out copious amounts of free cash flow. Their revenue and profit growth may not be impressive and may fluctuate along with the economy, but with their consistent free cash flow generation, they probably will continue increasing their dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) sells a wide range of soft drinks, energy drinks, and snack foods in more than 200 countries around the world under famous brands such as Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Doritos, and Lay's. PepsiCo has demonstrated robust growth in its revenue and net income in recent years.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $79.474 billion $86.293 billion $91.471 billion Net income $7.618 billion $8.910 billion $9.074 billion Free cash flow $6.991 billion $5.604 billion $7.924 billion\n\nMore importantly, PepsiCo's free cash flow rose over this period, going from close to $7 billion to $7.9 billion in 2023. 2022 saw PepsiCo's free cash flow dip mainly because of higher working capital requirements as the company maintained higher receivables and inventory balances. Free cash flow then bounced back strongly again in 2023.\n\nPepsiCo has increased its quarterly dividend payment almost 10-fold from $0.14 per share to $1.355 over 23 years, for a solid compound annual growth rate of 10.4%. PepsiCo's dividend yield currently stands at 3.6%, which is nearly triple that of the 1.3% offered by the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company continued its growth in the first nine months of 2024. Revenue inched up 0.7% year over year to $64.1 billion while operating income rose 3.2% year over year to $10.6 billion. Net income rose 3.6% to $8.1 billion in the nine months and PepsiCo generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the period, giving investors confidence that it can carry on increasing its dividends.\n\nChief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta was quoted in company documents in early October saying that PepsiCo would continue to invest in marketing and brand-building initiatives to stimulate consumer demand. In addition, the company will invest in improving productivity and efficiency to enhance productivity and help to improve overall margins.\n\nFor the full 2024 -- which the company plans to report on on Tuesday -- the business expects a low-single-digit percentage increase in organic revenue and at least an 8% increase in earnings per share.\n\nPepsiCo is also acquiring to grow its business. In mid-January it completed its acquisition of Siete Foods, a company that produces Mexican-American foods, for $1.2 billion. Siete products include grain-free tortillas, enchilada sauces, taco seasonings, Mexican cookies, vegan beans, tortilla chips, potato chips, and salsas. Late last year, PepsiCo bought out its partners' stakes in a pair of joint ventures, Sabra and Obela, which manufacture, distribute, and sell refrigerated dips and spreads. These moves should further bolster PepsiCo's portfolio and enable it to increase sales over time. Meanwhile, investors can look forward to continued dividend increases as PepsiCo's brands pull their weight and help the business to generate continued free cash flow.\n\nKimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB -0.36%) is a consumer goods giant that manufactures and sells a variety of feminine hygiene, personal care, and infant care products under famous brand names such as Cottonelle, Huggies, Kleenex, and Kotex. Its revenues increased steadily from 2021 to 2023.\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 Revenue $19.440 billion $20.175 billion $20.431 billion Net income $1.814 billion $1.934 billion $1.764 billion Free cash flow $1.723 billion $1.857 billion $2.776 billion\n\nNet income fell from 2021 to 2023, but this was because of a $658 million impairment on intangible assets booked in 2023. Excluding this impairment, net income for 2023 would have been $2.422 billion.\n\nOnce again, the crucial metric to look at is free cash flow, which has been steadily increasing. The company's consistent free cash flow generation has allowed it to make 90 consecutive years of dividend payments to shareholders.\n\nThe business boasts an impressive 53-year streak of consecutive dividend increases. The newly announced quarterly dividend of $1.26 works out to an annual dividend of $5.04 per share, which translates to about a 3.8% forward dividend yield at the current stock price, slightly better than PepsiCo and also nearly three times that offered by the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut there's even better news for dividend investors. Kimberly-Clark this week reported 2024 results that saw continued free cash flow generation.\n\nNet sales dipped by 1.8% year over year to $20 billion, but gross profit edged up 2.1% to $7.2 billion. Adjusting for impairment losses in both years as the consumer giant executes its transformation initiatives, operating income would have risen by 10.2% to $3.3 billion while net income would have been 9.1% higher at $2.6 billion.\n\nFree cash flow was once again positive and stood at $2.5 billion for 2024, allowing the company to raise its quarterly dividend for the 53rd consecutive year to $1.26 per share.\n\nKimberly-Clark is using e-commerce to help expand its customer base and determine which products or brands customers are using more often. This move is part of the company's digital transformation strategy that will see it acquiring customers using data-driven targeting and then tailoring its offerings to consumer preferences. Using such insights, the business can then increase the customer's average basket size while maintaining loyalty. This new operating model also helps to improve speed and scale and allows the company to focus on market segments with the best long-term potential. These digital improvements should translate into higher revenue and profit in the coming years, which means the company will have the ability to continue raising its dividends for many more years to come.\n\nHormel Foods\n\nHormel Foods (HRL 0.17%) is a food-processing company that offers a wide range of packaged and refrigerated foods, such as ham, sausage, chicken, beef, and lamb, under brands such as Applegate, Burke, Austin Blues, and Natural Choice. The company saw its revenue and net income decline from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 as inflation led to higher expenses.\n\nHowever, Hormel Foods managed to increase its free cash flow steadily over this period from $856 million to more than $1 billion.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Revenue $12.459 billion $12.110 billion $11.921 billion Net income $999.9 million $793.6 million $805 million Free cash flow $856.1 million $777.6 million $1.01 billion\n\nIts consistent free cash flow generation has enabled the company to achieve a stunning 59 consecutive years of dividend increases along with 96 straight years of paying dividends. In just the last decade, it has more than doubled its annual dividend per share from $0.50 to $1.16, a compound annual growth rate of 9%. Hormel Foods' shares are yielding 3.8% right now, similar to what Kimberly-Clark is offering, and this yield looks set to rise even further as the food processing company is in good shape to increase its dividend year by year.\n\nThere could be more to come from the food processing company. Under its \"Transform and Modernize\" initiative, management plans to improve supply chain efficiency and improve its operating income. There are early signs of success with $75 million in cost savings achieved for fiscal 2024 under its \"Buy, Make & Move\" plan.\n\nThe plan involves sourcing from different vendors to reduce the cost of goods while improving the procurement process. The company also plans to standardize ways of working to improve yields and increase capacity. Finally, logistics and warehousing will be optimized to lower overall costs. These initiatives are expected to result in an additional $100 million to $150 million in cost savings, which will flow directly to operating income.\n\nOver the long term, the benefits derived from \"Transform and Modernize\" will fuel incremental investments to drive further business growth, creating a virtuous cycle that should see Hormel Foods increase its earnings and free cash flow. The company looks set to continue its near six-decade streak of dividend increases if this plan can be executed successfully.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, has been considering the uncertainty surrounding 2025 and the ongoing macroeconomic challenges that are sparking important questions. One of the main points Cramer has been grappling with is the direction Washington will take in the coming months. He highlighted that, despite two months of processing the election results, there\u2019s still a lack of clarity about what the priorities will be and what Congress might actually pass. Cramer also brought up several important questions about President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on various issues.\n\n\u201cIs president-elect Trump serious about large widespread tariffs or is the tough talk just a negotiating tactic? How serious is Trump about mass deportations? Which, if enacted, would likely have an impact on\u2026 the labor market.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Amidst The DeepSeek AI Selloff and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently\n\nAnother major question Cramer raised was about deregulation, how much benefit will companies truly see from it, and how quickly? In terms of corporate taxes, Cramer also noted that the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act seems likely, but he questioned whether Trump might push even further, potentially altering the tax landscape in a more significant way. Perhaps one of the most pressing questions Cramer raised concerned the bond market and its tolerance for large U.S. government budget deficits.\n\n\u201cAnd considering that last question, here's a doozy: Will the bond market continue to tolerate big budget deficits from the US government?\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that some argue the bond market has already begun to take a more stringent stance on national debt, evident in the rising treasury yields over recent months. Still, Cramer left it at that, suggesting the situation remains uncertain.\n\n\u201cDifficult to answer because as we learned last time, I mean, Donald Trump is not a predictable president, great for cable news ratings, but sometimes frustrating when you're in the business of making predictions. Hmm, maybe a higher cash position than normal could beckon.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on January 7 and 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

            "content": "These three stocks pay growing dividends, with yields currently among their highest on record.\n\nIt's difficult for companies to stay at the top of their industries for long. The competition in the global economy is just too fierce. Yet, there are proven winners, such as Nike (NKE -1.35%), Hershey (HSY -1.00%), and PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%), that have stood the test of time due to their beloved brands and the pricing power it gives them.\n\nBut even the best face adversity from time to time. As magnificent as they are, these stocks have fallen between 22% and 58% from their highs. All three currently face doubts from investors as they grapple with issues such as poor business execution, potential political threats, and even climate events.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each stock's problems and why dividend investors would be wise to buy them while they are down.\n\n1. Nike's turnaround may take time, but the future still looks bright.\n\nThe sneaker and apparel giant has spent decades building its brand through iconic partnerships with athletes, including Michael Jordan and Cristiano Ronaldo. Unfortunately, Nike is currently paying for the sins of bad management. The company's former CEO embarked on a misguided path, prioritizing direct-to-consumer sales at the expense of wholesaler relationships and product innovation.\n\nAs a result, Nike's sales momentum has slipped, and the business is contracting. Smaller competitors like Hoka (Deckers Outdoor) and On (On Holding) have made inroads against Nike in the running shoe market. In response, Nike brought back former executive Elliott Hill as CEO to restore the business formula that helped it thrive for years.\n\nFundamentally, Nike is still rock solid. The company has more cash on its balance sheet than debt. Nike pays a dividend that yields over 2% today for only the second time since the 1980s. Management has raised that dividend for 23 consecutive years, and the payout ratio is only 64% of its estimated earnings. Nike also remains a pillar of global sports culture with licensing deals across the world's sports leagues. If Nike can return its sales to growth mode, the stock should be a winner for patient investors.\n\n2. Hot cocoa prices could melt Hershey's profits.\n\nSince early last year, a combination of disease and weather has ravaged the cocoa supply chain in West Africa. The region is responsible for an estimated 80% of the global cocoa supply. Cocoa is the key ingredient for many of the iconic sweets Hershey sells, including Hershey's, Reese's, KitKat (in America), and more. The shortage has sent commodity prices through the roof, forcing Hershey to raise prices to try and compensate. However, management admitted that higher prices have pushed some consumers away in this economy.\n\nIndustry experts anticipate the cocoa shortage persisting through 2025, which puts Hershey in a tough spot. The company has remained tight-lipped about its 2025 plans. Reports recently surfaced that Hershey had asked regulators for permission to buy a massive amount of cocoa through futures contracts that would exceed the exchange's limits.\n\nThe uncertainty has soured analysts, who currently estimate under 5% annualized earnings growth for Hershey over the next three to five years. Fortunately, this should eventually pass. In the meantime, Hershey's dividend is well-funded, with a 60% payout ratio, and its 3.6% yield is near its all-time high. A rebound may not happen in 2025, but this is a simple but proven company with staying power. Dividend investors may eventually relish the buying opportunity created by these uncontrollable obstacles.\n\n3. PepsiCo must work through GLP-1 headwinds and potential political challenges.\n\nThe market has started to wonder about the future of junk food and soda. Consumers have flocked to GLP-1 agonists to curb their eating, and the looming arrival of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the (nominated) Secretary of Health and Human Services has pressured PepsiCo and other food and beverage stocks. Headlines can scare investors, and this could be a classic overreaction.\n\nPepsiCo's CEO recently addressed these fears, highlighting the company's ongoing efforts to reduce the amounts of sugar, fats, and artificial colors in its products. The company has launched new products, like zero-sugar sodas, and has leaned into acquisitions. In late 2024, it acquired full ownership of Sabra (hummus and guacamole) and Siete Foods (specialty chips and other foods) in January 2025 to align itself with trending consumer preferences.\n\nOverall, PepsiCo should be fine over the long term. Analysts still anticipate the business's earnings will grow by an average of 6% annually over the next three to five years. Meanwhile, pessimism has ratcheted the stock's dividend yield up to 3.6%, its highest ever! PepsiCo is a Dividend King with a manageable 66% payout ratio. Investors can confidently buy PepsiCo's historically high yield here and expect the dividend to keep going up.",

Now, new research is focusing on ensuring reliable supplies of the potato all year round with a project that focuses on potato dormancy and extending storage life.\n\nTo achieve year-round supplies in the UK, around 1.5 million tonnes of potatoes are kept in cold stores for up to eight months to prevent sprouting. However, following the withdrawal of a chemical that suppresses sprouting, CIPC, vegetable losses have increased and the storage duration time for potatoes can be halved to four months.\n\nNow researchers from Cranfield University, working with PepsiCo and Solynta, a leader in hybrid potato breeding, are using advanced genetic analysis to tackle the challenges of maintaining crop quality whilst extending storage life. The project aims to solve the problem of keeping potatoes dormant for longer, using fewer chemicals, less energy and generating less food waste.\n\nWith a grant from Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) prosperity partnership fund, the project to enhance potato dormancy brings together expertise in genetics, plant biology, and technology.\n\nThe team aims to develop new potato varieties and storage methods that:\n\nExtend storage life: reducing food waste and ensuring year-round supply.\n\nLower energy consumption: minimising the environmental impact of cold storage.\n\nReduce chemical use: promoting sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nFindings from the study could help inform storage methods around the world with adaptations according to regional variations in harvest periods and facilities.\n\n\u201cBy reducing chemical use and improving energy efficiency in storage, we\u2019re safeguarding the future of potato farming making it safer for the end consumer\u201d said Mari Carmen Alamar Gavidia, Senior Lecturer in Postharvest Biology from Cranfield University.\n\n\u201cThis approach will not only cut waste but also supports the environment. It will ensure a year-round supply of safer and higher quality potatoes for consumers and make sure the nation can enjoy crisps, chips and mash uninterrupted.\u201d\n\nProfessor Leon Terry, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Research and Innovation at Cranfield University, said: \u201cMitigating food waste is a key piece of the puzzle to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) ended the recent trading session at $150.37, demonstrating a +0.08% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.47%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.31%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.51%.\n\nThe the stock of food and beverage company has fallen by 1.19% in the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 0.87% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.67%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of PepsiCo will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 4, 2025. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.95, up 9.55% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $27.93 billion, indicating a 0.29% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.87% lower. Currently, PepsiCo is carrying a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nWith respect to valuation, PepsiCo is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 17.65. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.85.\n\nIt's also important to note that PEP currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.91. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.29 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 137, finds itself in the bottom 46% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc.'s ( ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 22.3x might make it look like a sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 18x and even P/E's below 11x are quite common. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, PepsiCo has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For PepsiCo?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as PepsiCo's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 13% last year. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 14% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that PepsiCo's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From PepsiCo's P/E?\n\nWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\n\nOur examination of PepsiCo's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.\n\nBefore you settle on your opinion, we've discovered that you should be aware of.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than PepsiCo.

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into PepsiCo Inc's (PEP, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-29, PepsiCo Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $93.29. It's currently trading at a price of $150.25. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -61.06%. The company is modestly overvalued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. PepsiCo Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $7.98 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.53%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 5.20%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 60.11 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 33.18 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 93.29\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $51.91. This valuation indicates that the PepsiCo Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -189.44%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\n\nNavigating with GuruFocus:\n\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.",

            "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PepsiCo (PEP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $27.99 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo?\n\nFor PepsiCo, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.43%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of $2.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.31, delivering a surprise of +0.43%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nPepsiCo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSlice is being relaunched and positioned as a functional drink focused on gut health, according to its owner Suja Life. The company said the soft drink has been off the market for roughly two decades after being discontinued by PepsiCo.\n\nSlice reportedly has the same flavors and bubbles as the original version, but its formula has been changed to include real ingredients, only five or fewer grams of sugar, no high fructose corn syrup and a blend of prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics.\n\nThe return of Slice taps into consumer demand for nostalgia and growing interest in healthier, functional beverages that do more than hydrate. A Precedence Research study last year estimated the global functional drinks market is forecast to nearly double to $437 billion by 2034.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSlice was acquired last May by Suja Life, which owns Suja Organic juices and Vive Organic immunity boosters. The purchase of a sugar-laden soda may have initially appeared to be a departure for the healthy drinks manufacturer, but the relaunch of Slice as a functional beverage provides clarity that Suja sees a different future for the 41-year-old brand.\n\n\u201cWe're thrilled to usher in a new era for Slice, bringing this beloved brand back with a modern and exciting twist,\" Maria Stipp, CEO of Suja Life, said in a statement. \u201cWhile we know not everyone is reaching for a wellness shot, soda is a staple in nearly every American's refrigerator. By transforming this everyday beverage into a leveled-up version with benefits, we're making a significant impact on the health and well-being of our consumers.\u201d\n\nSlice was first launched in 1984 by PepsiCo in a bid to compete with Coca-Cola\u2019s dominant offering Sprite, but it was later discontinued in the early 2000s, Suja Life said.\n\nWhile sodas that are pitched as healthier are not new, Suja is bringing a known brand to the game that could help Slice resonate with older adults who grew up drinking it. The challenge for Suja will be to connect with younger consumers not familiar with Slice who are already turning to competing drinks such as Poppi and Olipop.\n\nSlice\u2019s use of better-for-you ingredients should help it resonate with people who have never tried or heard of the brand and are looking for healthier offerings.\n\nSlice\u2019s low amount of sugar connects with consumers wanting to reduce their intake of the sweetener. At the same time, the use of prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics will attract people focusing on their gut.\n\nSlice will be available in Orange, Lemon Lime, Classic Cola and Grapefruit Spritz at Albertsons and select Costco locations across the country. Target also will carry Strawberry while all stores under the Albertsons umbrella will have Grape. Suja Life said expanded distribution for other Slice flavors, including Ginger Ale, is anticipated in the second and third quarter of this year.\n\nSlice is the latest brand to return to the market that has been repositioned to align with a trend that didn\u2019t exist or wasn\u2019t as prevalent as when the product previously existed.\n\nFlorida-based Redcon1 is relaunching Jolt Cola, a mainstay on shelves in the late 1980s and 1990s, as an energy drink.

            "content": "Make no mistake: Reports of purpose\u2019s decline have been greatly exaggerated. But at the outset of a new year, it feels as though purpose-driven marketing is at an inflection point. Campaigns hooked around the idea of socially conscious causes were all the rage only a few years ago, whereas in more recent times the focus has shifted as devices like humour have drifted back into fashion.\n\nYet the idea that brands have somehow become less \u2018purposeful\u2019 in their communications is entirely misleading. Instead, the concept of purpose is evolving - as it always has done - into something that\u2019s persuasive, relevant, and moves the dial in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThat\u2019s the impression that I get from speaking with Kimberly Scott, senior director of marketing at PepsiCo Foods North America. \u201cI think the fact that the word continues to evolve in its definition is really interesting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a living, breathing concept because of what it needs to accomplish.\u201d\n\nIn broad brushstrokes, Kimberly sees \u2018purpose\u2019 as a means to help a brand\u2019s consumers and fans feel something positive about where they\u2019re spending their money. In that sense it\u2019s a marketing tool as old as time - selling a brand by selling an idea. \u201cIt moves people, whether that\u2019s moving them to action, to consider things differently, or to tap into an emotional moment,\u201d she notes.\n\nBut more specifically, modern purpose is in the middle of a shift. \u201cWhat it\u2019s evolving into now is something that goes beyond the traditional \u2018cause marketing\u2019 or activism structures that it\u2019s been commonly associated with in recent years,\u201d continues Kimberly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is that the savviness of consumers is making them crave brands that bring them purposeful work - work that means something to them, that moves them.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, that\u2019s why Kimberly still has such a belief in purposeful work - albeit, perhaps not as it may have come to be commonly understood. At one point in our interview, I point out that, to some marketers, \u2018purpose\u2019 has become a bit of a dirty word. \u201cI can understand why they might think that,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think differently. I still see so many briefs coming through that may not be explicitly asking for purpose, and yet they have purpose deeply embedded into them. For that reason, I still think that purpose is one of the richest territories in marketing.\u201d\n\nMarketing that moves people is never going to be unattractive to a brand. \u201cPurpose is only a dirty word when it\u2019s stale in concept and unoriginal in execution,\u201d adds Kimberly. \u201cBut you can say that about anything - that goes for AI, creativity, or using data. If you\u2019re constantly sharpening your skills and listening to your consumers, you\u2019ll know that human beings want to connect with brands. It\u2019s just up to us to make that connection happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a New Purpose\n\nTo get a sense of how this modern manifestation of purpose is taking shape, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at some of the recent work coming out of PepsiCo Foods. In August last year, for instance, the team pulled off an out-of-this-world stunt by sending a limited-edition packet of Doritos into space. That\u2019s not what one might traditionally expect from purpose-driven marketing but, as Kimberly goes on to explain, the idea was fundamentally purposeful.\n\n\u201cWhat I love about that program is how it tapped into the aspirations, fandom, and excitement around space travel. The literal \u2018out-of-this-world\u2019 nature of it is still mind-blowing to me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat made it so special is how every idea stemmed from thinking about impact. From a PR and earned media perspective, we worked with our partners at Ketchum to prioritise journalists who specialise in space, science, and missions, ensuring we started with voices who truly understood and valued the subject.\u201d\n\nTellingly, the campaign was also underpinned by a collaboration with the children\u2019s hospital St Jude. Donations to the hospital were linked to an opportunity to win space mission-themed Doritos. \u201cEvery view, watch, and engagement with the program directly contributed to more donations for St. Jude and their mission here on Earth,\u201d notes Kimberly.\n\nAnother example of purposeful marketing in practice was Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s collaboration with Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, in which the star helped students from her alma mater Texas Southern University (TSU) overcome student debt. \u201cWe said FU to student debt, transforming the lives of seniors while leaning into homecoming culture,\u201d recalls Kimberly. \u201cWe brought Megan to campus and made the program authentically reflect HBCU culture and swag. It was incredible. The director for the content was a Houston native who knows Megan well and has worked with her before, which made it even more special.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s another example of how purpose can help a brand embody a value that its consumers want to see in the world. \u201cWith Doritos it was about bold change, bold purpose, and bold activity, whereas with Flamin\u2019 Hot it was about bringing some swagger to things, owning individuality and sharing a taste of that \u2018I don\u2019t give a f***\u2019 mentality,\u201d explains Kimberly. \u201cIt always comes back to making the consumer feel like these campaigns matter to them, that they resonate on a personal level. That drives loyalty, and loyalty ultimately drives profitability.\u201d\n\nSo at its core, it\u2019s an approach to marketing that prioritises values - feeding into consumers\u2019 own ideas about the better parts of themselves, and fuelling their aspirations. And at the same time, we\u2019re at a moment in broader culture where people from all backgrounds and demographics feel that their values aren\u2019t quite reflected in the world they see around them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d agree with that,\u201d says Kimberly, \u201cand that\u2019s why purpose-driven marketing is still so impactful. The data supports this, showing that today\u2019s consumers - especially the future majority consumer base, gen z - feel underrepresented. But it\u2019s not just about one generation. It\u2019s about the type of consumer we\u2019ll have in the next 10 to 20 years, across all demographics.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an intrinsic and obvious logic behind all of this. Specifically, that we are all looking for meaning, and for the values we hold to be reflected in the world around us. That could connect to a socially conscious brand campaign which directly instigates some good in the world - or it could simply be feeding off the energy that comes from confidence and swagger. And that\u2019s the space in which purpose-driven marketing has always thrived.",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "Regulatory requirements and consumer demand are pushing more companies to switch from plastic to paper for everything from packing peanuts to beverage bottles. But some groups question whether paper is truly a better alternative and how much it helps companies meet their sustainability commitments.\n\nMounting evidence of plastic\u2019s potentially adverse effects on the environment and public health are gaining attention. For example, about 98% of single-use plastic products are made from fossil fuel feedstock, and greenhouse gas emissions from the production, use and disposal of these plastics are expected to rise to 19% of the global carbon budget by 2040, according to the United Nations Environment Program.\n\nIn response to these growing concerns, regulators at every level of government have adopted new policies.\n\nNegotiations to craft the world's first-ever global plastics treaty ended in December without an agreement, but they will continue this year. The EU also recently adopted a new, stricter packaging waste rule that covers all types of packaging, including certain single-use plastics. The U.S. EPA recently adopted a nonbinding strategy to prevent plastic pollution, and multiple states are implementing extended producer responsibility laws for packaging.\n\nIn light of these policy changes, many brands are requesting plastic alternatives from their packaging suppliers. In turn, this is driving more innovation in fiber materials among packaging manufacturers\n\nAn expanding market\n\nThe interest in fiber as a plastic alternative is expected to grow significantly in the coming years across the packaging industry. For example, Freedonia Group predicts that the molded fiber market will rise to more than $4 billion by 2030, up from around $1 billion in 2015.\n\nMany of the efforts to switch to paper so far have focused on shipping and food packaging. For example, Amazon recently replaced 99.7% of its mixed material padded mailers with recyclable paper ones, JDE Peet\u2019s announced plans to use paper pouches to house its coffees and Nissin Foods USA\u2019s Cup Noodles is now packaged in paper cups made with 40% recycled paper.\n\nOne company that\u2019s made fiber-based packaging the center of its business, rather than an experiment, is DS Smith. The packaging company, which International Paper is in the process of acquiring, shed its plastic business in 2021 and is now an all-fiber company, said Marc Chiron, director of sales, marketing and innovation for DS Smith\u2019s packaging division, in an email.\n\nAs part of its sustainability strategy, the company reached its target early of replacing one billion pieces of plastic by 2025: As of May 2024, the company had replaced 1.2 billion pieces. It reached that goal by working with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to come up with new designs for its fiber-based packaging in various sectors, including food and beverage, automotive parts and retail goods.\n\n\u201c[A]pproaching each project [by] looking carefully at factors such as percentage of recycled content, recyclability, estimated CO2 emissions and levels of excess waste and other factors helped us strengthen our company\u2019s overall mindset and cultural focus on sustainability,\u201d Chiron said.\n\nIts first box made using those metrics was a beer container for Toast Ale in the U.K., introduced in 2021. DS Smith also helped Bosch Home Comfort Group switch to fully recyclable packaging for the company\u2019s gas boilers, which saves 100,000 plastic parts and 310 tons of CO2 emissions annually, he added.\n\nEven small design changes like replacing plastic labels can make a big difference, Chiron said. \u201cIt is our mission to design out waste and to reduce plastic across all kinds of formats.\u201d\n\nAmazon converted its fulfillment center in Euclid, Ohio, to handle only fiber packaging. It includes retrofits for machinery that previously produced plastic mailers but now makes slightly stretchable, heat sealable paper bags. Permission granted by Amazon\n\nThe quest for the perfect paper bottle\n\nSome of the most ambitious efforts to develop paper alternatives are emerging within the beverage industry. Several companies including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Diageo are in the midst of developing paper bottles.\n\nOne challenge with developing a paper alternative, many in the industry say, is figuring out how to keep beverages well contained while also ensuring that the bottle can be fully recycled.\n\n\u201cPaper and liquids \u2014 you know, the two don't seem to go together,\u201d said Ron Khan, vice president of beverage packaging at PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo is working with Pulpex to develop a molded fiber bottle that disproves that assumption. Its prototype is made from a wood pulp mix that is blended, molded and then dried \u2014 a proprietary process that prevents the bottle from leaking and ensures durability and recyclability. The wood pulp comes from forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and accredited by the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in the quest for a 100% recyclable paper bottle is finding the right material to create a sufficient barrier between the liquid and the paper.\n\nThe barrier has to meet a number of different, and sometimes competing, criteria, including effectiveness, food safety, light weight and recyclability. A barrier might meet food safety requirements but be too thick, for example.\n\nMany prototypes contain a plastic liner, which has to be manually separated before the bottle can be tossed into the paper recycling bin. But the latest generation of Pulpex fiber bottles is designed to be recycled like any other paper material, according to the company.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenges have been with the coating, and we\u2019re in the last stages,\u201d Khan said. The water-based, food-grade coating keeps out moisture and oxygen, according to the company.\n\nFinding a viable paper bottle is part of PepsiCo\u2019s broader sustainability objectives, Khan added. The company\u2019s \u201cPep+\u201d initiative, launched in 2021, aims to infuse sustainability across its operations, from production to distribution, according to its latest ESG report, released in 2024.\n\nFew paper bottles advance beyond the prototype stage, but Carlsberg\u2019s wood fiber bottles, developed with the Denmark-based Paper Bottle Co., better known as Paboco, are an exception. Its paper-packaged beer has been tested in stores in the U.K. and Sweden. The bottle\u2019s barrier is made of PEF, or polyethylene furanoate, a plant-based polymer that the company says preserves the beer\u2019s fizziness and taste. While the PEF lining is biodegradable, it has to be separated and recycled as plastic in many areas.\n\nPaboco CEO Tim Silbermann said consumer reaction has been positive so far, with users praising the look and feel of the bottle, though some have complained that it still contains plastic.\n\nThe company, which is also working with Coca-Cola and L\u2019Oreal, has replaced the initial prototype\u2019s plastic neck with a paper one and continues to work on creating a non-plastic barrier.\n\n\u201cWe have always been very transparent about the journey aspect of this. This was the first generation that we wanted to try to see how it works,\u201d said Silbermann.\n\nFinding a composition that meets regulatory requirements for paper recycling across Europe is also a challenge. For example, Germany\u2019s rules specify that packaging has to be 95% paper to be considered recyclable as paper.\n\n\u201cRecyclability is a complicated topic, especially in Europe, because there's so many different markets and so many different regulations,\u201d he said. The EU\u2019s new packaging rules, formally adopted by the European Council last month and expected to be applied next year, aim to help address that variability.\n\nCarlos Diaz Acosta, an engineer at the Rochester Institute of Technology who focuses on packaging, said that the technology has promise, despite the headaches involved in creating a durable, fully recyclable bottle made from sustainably sourced wood fiber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evolving. I don't know if I\u2019d say fast, but they keep making it better and better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don't know if we're going to see something on the shelf next year or in five years.\u201d\n\nPaboco, which uses FSC-certified wood fiber, is expanding. Silbermann said the company plans to relocate elsewhere in Denmark this year and install larger machines to increase its output.\n\nRetrieved from PepsiCo on January 15, 2025\n\nImperfect paper\n\nComplicating the shift from plastic to paper is that fiber comes with its own set of environmental problems. While the material is touted as a renewable resource and is widely perceived as superior to plastic packaging in terms of its circularity, its environmental impact is significant.\n\n\u201cPaper offers this image that the sources are renewable \u2014 that's [yet] to be defined,\u201d Diaz-Acosta said. \u201cWhat does renewable mean?\u201d\n\nAbout 3 billion trees are felled each year to make paper packaging, according to Canopy, a non-profit organization that works with packaging companies to reduce their environmental impact.\n\n\u201cOne of the most pervasive myths is that logging forests for paper packaging is the answer to plastic pollution. But this approach swaps one environmental disaster for another,\u201d wrote Mariah De Los Santos, the group\u2019s communications specialist, in a recent post on its website. \"In the face of climate and biodiversity crises, safeguarding forest ecosystems is imperative.\u201d\n\nThe EU has adopted a new deforestation rule that will require companies that sell commodities often produced on cleared forest lands, such as wood, beef, cocoa, and palm oil, to the EU market \u2014 or exports from it \u2014 to show that their products are not derived from recently deforested areas or have contributed to forest degradation. The rule will be phased in over the next two years.\n\nPulpex and Paboco say they\u2019re addressing deforestation concerns by using only certified wood for their paper bottles. FSC-certified wood, for example, is harvested in a way that largely avoids clearcuts, instead using selective logging, and leaves a wide buffer along salmon-bearing streams, among other practices.\n\nSince paper can be re-pulped, it\u2019s easier to recycle than plastic, which \u2014 because of its durability \u2014 needs to be broken down with more chemicals. But paper can\u2019t be recycled indefinitely; its fibers become shorter with each cycle and only last an average of six times, according to EPA data.\n\nMaking paper also requires a lot of energy. According to a 2011 analysis conducted for the Northern Ireland Assembly, making a paper bag requires four times as much energy as manufacturing a plastic bag. And since paper weighs more than plastic, transporting it can require more fuel, adding to its carbon footprint.\n\nSome critics say instead of switching to paper and other alternative materials, companies should focus on scaling back the production of plastics. In their view, simply replacing plastic with paper does little to address the problem of single-use.\n\nA 2023 report by the European Environmental Bureau, an advocacy group, called the shift to paper a \u201cfalse solution\u201d to the plastic packaging problem. It accused McDonald\u2019s and other major food companies of greenwashing the use of single-use paper containers as a sustainable option. The group encouraged a reduction in the use of both plastic and paper single-use packaging.\n\nBut company representatives point out that by switching to paper and other materials, they are reducing the demand for virgin plastic.\n\nPepsiCo, for example, has a target to reduce its use of virgin plastic from \u201cnon-renewable sources\u201d 20% by 2030 across all packaging categories. It also has a target to design 100% of its packaging to be either recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Its latest ESG report projected reaching 98% by 2025.\n\nFor Khan, PepsiCo and Pulpex\u2019s paper bottle shows what can be accomplished in the beverage packaging space with innovation and modern technology.\n\n\u201cI've been in packaging for 33 years, and everything I've done on packaging has been changes to packaging, be it glass or bottles or PET,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's the first time we're actually developing a brand new packaging format. So it's exciting.\u201d\n\nBut the paper bottle will take time to perfect, he added. \u201cWe were one of the pioneers of PET bottles 40 years ago. It's taken us 40 years to optimize the bottle. We're now starting that journey with paper.\u201d",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

Sure, Mr. Market may be downbeat on a stock, but that doesn't mean it is a bad investment.\n\nIn fact, the contrarian move of buying when other investors are selling can lead you to strong long-term results, particularly if you focus on owning historically well-run companies. Which is why you won't want to wait until some tomorrow to start buying PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) stock. Here are three reasons today is the day to buy.\n\n1. The stock is in the dumps\n\nShares of consumer staples giant PepsiCo have lost nearly a quarter of their value since early 2023. That's a pretty sizable drawdown for this company. But every time it has lost this much value, it has eventually bounced back to reach new highs.\n\nThere's no guarantee that will happen again, of course, but the business hasn't fundamentally changed in any way since 2023. So there's no reason to believe it has suddenly become a bad company.\n\nHowever, there's an interesting aspect to this price drop. It has pushed the dividend yield up to around 3.6%, near the highest levels in the company's history. Dividend yield can be used as a rough gauge of valuation, and right now PepsiCo's yield is screaming that the stock is historically cheap. To back that up, the company's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios, more traditional valuation metrics, are both below their five-year averages.\n\n2. PepsiCo knows how to get back up after getting knocked down\n\nAs noted above, nothing material has changed about PepsiCo as a company since early 2023. In fact, the food maker has basically been running the same successful playbook for decades, which has translated into a very long history of success.\n\nThat shows up, once again, with the dividend. PepsiCo is a Dividend King, one of a rarefied group of companies that have increased their dividends year in and year out for 50 consecutive years or longer. You don't build a record like that by accident; it requires high levels of execution in both good markets and bad ones.\n\nThink about the last 25 years, let alone the last 50. There was the dot-com bubble, the Great Recession, and the coronavirus pandemic, to highlight some of the worst periods. And PepsiCo did just fine in each case, growing its business and rewarding investors with larger dividends each year.\n\nIn fact, despite the current business headwinds, management continues to invest for the future. It just bought Siete Foods, a diversified Mexican-American food company, and has agreed to buy the 50% of the Middle Eastern food specialist Sabra that it didn't already own.\n\nThese aren't life-altering acquisitions, but they show that the company is continuing to push forward, which is exactly what investors should expect from a reliable business.\n\n3. PepsiCo has a lot of levers to pull\n\nThese two acquisitions are relevant in another way: They show the diversity of PepsiCo's business. Siete makes everything from chips to packaged food items. Sabre makes dips, which could fall into the chips or packaged foods category.\n\nAnd the company's namesake product is a beverage, making it a major player in all three segments of the food sector. Many of its peers just operate in a single segment.\n\nWhat this means for investors is that PepsiCo is something of a one-stop shop in the consumer staples space if you are looking for a food company. And management has many different ways to grow its business over time. If one division is lagging, it can move resources to the other divisions. Moreover, it has three different niches within which to act as an industry consolidator.\n\nAct while you can to pick up this great stock\n\nIt's true that PepsiCo's financial results have been a bit underwhelming lately (which is why the stock is currently out of favor), but the company's highly successful history suggests that its performance will eventually turn higher again. In fact, the Siete and Sabra acquisitions show that management is already trying to lay the foundations for a brighter future.\n\nAdd in a historically high dividend yield and PepsiCo's status as a Dividend King, and it is hard to see why a long-term dividend investor wouldn't want to buy the stock right now.",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other stocks to buy and sell highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest calls.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC reminded viewers about the Trump playbook in the story market and said that he never believed the President would start a new trade war with China. Cramer explained that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been \u201chot\u201d but the reality is \u201ccool\u201d and his much-feared tariffs against Canada and Mexico might also not realize as the new administration said it will \u201cstudy\u201d the matter.\n\n\u201cThe president loves the stock market; he always loves to send signals that all hell is going to break loose, and when it doesn\u2019t, well, guess what? The market flies. This rally is built on the back of tariffs, more specifically small-than-expected tariffs that could grow bigger if countries don\u2019t play ball. It\u2019s built on the backs of new projects like Stargate, a new AI infrastructure initiative.\u201d\n\nCramer then explained in detail why he believes Biden and his government were against top companies and how it affected the market and economy. Cramer said Trump is better for stock portfolios.\n\n\u201cHe knows business people in Silicon Valley; he knows how things work. You may like him, you may hate him, but the bottom line is, if you\u2019re a tech titan, Trump will take your call. In fact, he\u2019ll call you. Biden, I don\u2019t know if he knew who they even were, and he certainly didn\u2019t bother to call them. In the end, I think he preferred to sue them. If you own stocks, which is why you watch me, Trump\u2019s method is a heck of a lot better for your portfolio.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his programs on CNBC.

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "After 10 years in business, the Garza family sold their company Siete Foods to PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) for a cool $1.2 billion. The deal for Siete was announced back in October but closed this January. Pepsi is an enormous business, and for it $1.2 billion is relatively small. But any purchase over $1 billion is still noteworthy.\n\nThe surprising thing for some investors may be that Siete Foods doesn't have a single beverage in its product portfolio, let alone any carbonated beverages. Rather, the company makes food products that cater toward people looking for grain-free and dairy-free options in Mexican-American food.\n\nThe acquisition of Siete Foods dovetails nicely with Pepsi's November acquisitions of Sabra and Obela. Pepsi had already owned half of both joint ventures but moved to acquire the rest, bringing more food products into Pepsi's portfolio.\n\nIf it's surprising to you that Pepsi is acquiring food companies, then it's likely that you don't understand Pepsi's business. In fact, food products are one of the best reasons to invest in the company today.\n\nPepsi is more than soda\n\nOver the last 12 months, Pepsi has generated revenue of over $90 billion. But a relatively small percentage of this is attributable to beverage sales in North America. In the company's fiscal third quarter of 2024 (which ended in early September), the North American beverage division only accounted for 31% of the business.\n\nNearly as big as beverages, 28% of Pepsi's Q3 revenue came from snacks and food in North American markets. The company generates the remainder of its sales from food and beverages in international markets.\n\nHowever, snacks and food in North America are the more important parts of Pepsi's business, because they're more profitable by a mile. The company's North American Frito-Lay division alone accounted for 39% of its total Q3 operating profit; in comparison, just 24% of operating profit came from the North American beverage unit.\n\nTo drill down further, Pepsi's Quaker Foods division in North America is small at just 3% of the company's overall revenue in Q3. But again, it commands better profits. Quaker Foods in North America had a Q3 operating margin of 15%, compared with just an 8% margin for beverages in North America.\n\nGiven the size of Pepsi's non-beverage portfolio and looking at the margins, it's not surprising that the company is doubling down with acquisitions such as Sabra and Siete Foods. It's good business.\n\nShould investors buy Pepsi stock?\n\nWhen it comes to investing in Pepsi stock, it's important to have realistic expectations. Over the last 10 years, Pepsi has averaged only a 7% annual gain, according to Macrotrends. Returns were positive, which counts for something -- but they weren't anything to write home about.\n\nThese pedestrian returns for Pepsi stock were due to its similarly pedestrian rate of revenue growth. Being one of the biggest businesses in the world already, and in a low-growth industry, means that it's hard to grow fast. And growth is important for stock returns.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo stock isn't without its merits. For starters, the company's diverse and beloved product portfolio makes it one of the safest businesses in the world, so investors can reasonably expect stable profits. And because its stock price went down in 2023 and 2024, it's now cheaper than usual.\n\nPepsi's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22 is below its 10-year average P/E valuation of 26. And with a dividend yield of over 3.5%, the income potential has never been higher; that's significant because Pepsi is an ultrareliable Dividend King.\n\nFinally, Pepsi has generated 39% of its revenue from international markets through the first three quarters of 2024. As a whole, revenue in international markets is growing while it's declining in North America. Moreover, profits are improving in international markets with scale. Based on these trends, it's possible that profit growth outpaces revenue growth for Pepsi in the coming years, which would provide the stock with an added boost.\n\nWhat this all means\n\nPepsi is acquiring food companies because food is a big part of the business, and provides better-margin revenue than carbonated beverages. The company may not post impressive growth numbers due to its size. But management is focusing on its better opportunities, the stock is cheap, and international growth could provide a boost as profitability improves.\n\nAll that said, PepsiCo shares aren't my best pick for outperforming the S&P 500 over the next three to five years. But investors could do a lot worse than Pepsi. And the stock does have merit from the perspectives of both safety and dividends, which could be important in making a decision.",

This pricing strategy, unchanged since 1985, remains central to Costco\u2019s customer value proposition, despite inflationary pressures affecting other food court items.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s return to Costco\u2019s food courts could further strengthen its market position.

Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nWhat does PepsiCo do?\n\nMost investors probably know PepsiCo is the company behind the beverage with which it shares a name. But its beverage operation is so much larger than just that one brand, including such icons as Gatorade and Tropicana (via a joint venture), among many others. All in, it is the No. 2 beverage company in the U.S. behind Coca-Cola.\n\nThe snack aisle at a grocery store.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf that's all PepsiCo did, it wouldn't be that exciting an investment. Most investors would be better off simply buying Coca-Cola, which is suffering through its own stock malaise. But PepsiCo also happens to be the No. 1 brand in salty snacks via its Frito-Lay business. And on top of that, it also has a portfolio of packaged food brands that fall into its Quaker Oats division.\n\nPepsiCo is a food and beverage giant with leading brands across its portfolio. It has the marketing, research and development, and distribution scale to support the business, differentiating it from smaller peers and allowing it to compete very well against industry giants throughout the consumer staples sector. If you were looking to own just a single food company, PepsiCo would cover an immense amount of ground.\n\nPEP Chart\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nWhy buy PepsiCo right now?\n\nThe big reason why a dividend growth investor would want to buy PepsiCo today is that its yield is near historical highs at roughly 3.6%. This suggests that Wall Street has placed the company on the deep discount rack. This is a view that's backed up by the stock's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios being below their five-year averages.\n\nBut there's another dividend fact that supports the buy decision. PepsiCo has increased its dividend annually for 52 consecutive years. That puts this consumer staples giant into the highly elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings. It requires consistent performance through good markets and bad ones to create a dividend track record like that. Clearly, PepsiCo has a good business model, and there's no reason to believe that it has suddenly, and permanently, stopped working.\n\nThen there's the dividend growth side of the equation. Over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods, PepsiCo's dividend has been increased at roughly 7% a year. That's about twice the level of historical inflation growth, meaning that the buying power of PepsiCo's dividend has increased over time. This is exactly what dividend growth investors want to see.\n\nPepsiCo will likely survive what ails it\n\nTo state the obvious, a stock usually doesn't fall 25% for no reason. PepsiCo isn't hitting on all cylinders right now as a business. And there are wider concerns about the entire packaged food sector, given new weight loss drugs and what appears to be a growing health-conscious ethos in the U.S. market.\n\nHowever, even with the headwinds the company is facing, it was able to grow core earnings, which pulls out one-time items, 5% year over year in the third quarter of 2024, with that figure up 7% through the first nine months of the year.\n\nThis does not look like a company that has fallen off the rails. If you can handle collecting a historically high yield from a company with a strong history of dividend growth, you'll be paid well to wait for the better days that are highly likely to arrive in the not-too-distant future.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "The Federal Trade Commission sued PepsiCo last Friday, alleging that it has engaged in illegal price discrimination by giving unfair price advantages to one large retailer at the expense of other vendors and consumers.\n\nThe benefiting customer wasn\u2019t named in an FTC statement about the lawsuit, but a source familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss it, said the retailer was Walmart.\n\nPepsiCo said the lawsuit \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law\u201d and misunderstands the way consumer product companies help retailers provide lower prices.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC said PepsiCo\u2019s practices included making promotional payments to Walmart but not to large grocery chains or independent convenience stores. The FTC said that allowed Walmart to lower its prices but forces Americans to pay inflated prices for PepsiCo products unless they shop at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in the statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency, and talent.\u201d\n\nWalmart said Friday it had \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d PepsiCo said its practices \u201care in line with industry norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe FTC sued PepsiCo under the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act. The FTC said the act prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.\n\nIt was the second time in a little more than a month that the FTC has cited the Robinson-Patman Act in a lawsuit. In December, the commission sued Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, a large U.S. distributor, saying it illegally discriminated against small and independent businesses by giving discounts and rebates to larger stores.\n\nIn the waning days of the Biden administration, the FTC was busy issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accused of deceptive practices, and finalizing rules it said were needed to make the marketplace fairer.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to authorize staff to file a lawsuit for a permanent injunction against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. Pepsi was first invented in 1893 as \u201cBrad\u2019s Drink\u201d by Caleb Bradham, who sold the drink at his drugstore in New Bern. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, \u201cPepsi\u201d because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (indigestion) and \u201cCola\u201d referring to the cola flavor. PepsiCo now makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, breakfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been subject to some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.\n\nPepsiCo responded by trying to make Lay\u2019s more affordable through a mix of product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs. Similar promotions were planned for Doritos and Tostitos.",

The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "If a stock is near its 52-week low, it may be a great time to buy it on the dip, particularly if you're bullish on its long-term prospects. But what about when it's trading at more of a discount, and is at prices it hasn't been at in multiple years? In that case, it may be an even better deal. But in such a case, the business is likely also facing some significant challenges -- stocks don't just accidentally fall to such levels.\n\nIn those kinds of cases, investors may need to have confidence that the business can get back to profitability or growing its operations, whatever is needed to turn the stock's fortunes around. It can make for a risky play, but it can also lead to strong returns if the company is successful.\n\nThree stocks that are trading near multi-year lows today are Hershey (HSY -1.00%), PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%), and Moderna (MRNA 0.93%). Here's a look at whether these stocks are worth picking up and adding to your portfolio today, or if they're simply too risky to invest in.\n\nHershey\n\nCandy company Hershey is trading near its 52-week low. The last time you could have picked up the stock for a cheaper price was in early 2021. It's near a four-year low, as demand has been slowing down after sales have expanded for multiple years.\n\nOver the course of the first nine months of 2024, sales totaling $8.3 billion declined by more than 2%, and earnings totaling $1.4 billion fell by 6%. The company has been dealing with higher cocoa prices affecting its bottom line, and a challenging macroeconomic environment with consumers scaling back on discretionary purchases. The business is working on controlling costs in order to boost its bottom line in future quarters.\n\nHershey is a cheap stock to own, trading at 18 times its trailing earnings. While it has been struggling, its payout ratio remains at around 60%, suggesting that its high-yielding dividend of 3.6% (which is higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.3%) is safe. For dividend investors who are willing to be patient with the stock, this could be a good time to add Hershey to your portfolio. It has many top brands, including Reese's and Twizzlers, and may still be a solid investment to hang on to over the long haul.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nFood and beverage company PepsiCo has also been feeling the effects of slowing demand in the market. For the 36-week period ending Sept. 7, 2024, the company's net revenue totaled $64.1 billion and was up just 0.7% year over year. While its earnings per share has grown by 4%, business hasn't been all that strong. Volumes have been declining, negating the effect of the company raising its prices.\n\nPepsiCo stock also hasn't been trading at the levels it's at right now since mid-2021. It's a bit more expensive a stock than Hershey, trading at 22 times its trailing earnings, but it also pays a dividend which yields 3.7%. The stock is a Dividend King and has raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. It's another investment that may be attractive to buy and hold due to its reduced valuation and high-yielding payout.\n\nThe short term may continue to be bumpy for PepsiCo, but with a diversified mix of snack and beverage brands, the business should be able to bounce back in the long run.\n\nModerna\n\nHealthcare company and COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna has effectively given back the gains it generated since the start of the pandemic. It's now trading at around the price it was at in April 2020. A few years ago, investors would have easily snapped up a deal like this, being able to go back in time and buy shares of the vaccine maker before its business took off and the stock become a big name in the healthcare industry.\n\nHowever, with COVID-related sales on the decline and Moderna's future a big question mark at this point, investors are struggling to determine what the business is truly worth. At a market cap of $13 billion, this is a stock whose valuation can go much lower in the future. Moderna has recently reduced its guidance and is in cost-cutting mode, as the business isn't in great shape right now. During the first nine months of 2024, the company incurred a $2.7 billion loss from operations, which was actually an improvement from a $4.2 billion loss in the prior-year period.\n\nThis is the one stock on this list I wouldn't buy, simply due to the uncertainty ahead for Moderna. Until the company can show investors it has a way of consistently growing its operations and is able to get out of the red, it's a stock I'd avoid.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In response to successful engagement by shareholders and Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys through the ballot resolution process, PepsiCo has adopted a new stance of viewpoint neutrality in its advertising policies. The move is intended to guard against future instances of viewpoint-discriminatory advertising decisions by the $240 billion corporation, and it\u2019s just one of three early victories for ADF-backed resolutions in the early portion of the 2025 proxy season.\n\nMany household brands joined the now-defunct Global Alliance for Responsible Media, which promised to promote \u201cdigital safety\u201d and protect brand value. But in practice, GARM actually worked to censor mainstream conservative and religious views. PepsiCo had been a participant in GARM, which disbanded in 2024 after X CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit alleging that the group illegally conspired to pull advertising dollars from his platform. Formed in 2019 as an offshoot of the World Federation of Advertisers, which represents around 90% of global advertising, GARM pressured Spotify to boot Joe Rogan from its platform and promoted the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard, which blacklist mainstream conservative media outlets as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nFinancial advisor, author, and television commentator David Bahnsen filed a shareholder resolution calling on the board of directors to account for PepsiCo\u2019s discriminatory ad buying through GARM, and the company met with ADF attorneys and Bahnsen\u2019s representatives at Bowyer Research to discuss the resolution. PepsiCo agreed to change its policy in exchange for Bahnsen withdrawing his resolution from the ballot.\n\n\u201cThis is a big step in restoring corporate America to its proper place in our society, and I applaud PepsiCo for making this crucial change,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel and Senior Vice President for Corporate Engagement Jeremy Tedesco. \u201cNo corporation should be involved in censorship at any level, and the participation of so many companies in silencing the views of everyday Americans through GARM should concern us all. We hope every company follows PepsiCo\u2019s example and recommits to doing its part to protect freedom of speech and thought in our nation and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nAlong with the policy change at PepsiCo, ADF-supported shareholders have also notched a series of notable victories elsewhere in the run-up to this year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting season. In response to a National Center for Public Policy Research resolution, AT&T agreed to provide transparency into its government-mandated supplier diversity requirements. At Apple, all four resolutions that will appear on its proxy ballot for its upcoming annual meeting Feb. 25 were filed by ADF allies.\n\nFor the second year in a row, Apple filed a no-action request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in response to an ADF-backed resolution\u2014this time aimed at providing transparency into why the company has removed an iOS software function designed to identify child sex abuse material. But the SEC did not grant Apple its requested relief, so Apple must now allow shareholders to consider that resolution, along with those touching on diversity, equity, and inclusion, ethical AI, and religious discrimination in charitable giving.\n\nOverall, shareholders have filed over 60 ADF-backed resolutions for the upcoming season\u2014more than twice those filed in the previous year. Those resolutions have resulted in at least 25 meetings with corporate leaders.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s major corporations belong to American shareholders, not ideologically driven activists, so it\u2019s encouraging to see this kind of positive engagement from household brands that we use every day,\u201d said Tedesco. \u201cOur goal is to bring about meaningful and lasting change in corporate America. We\u2019re grateful to see the explosion of fruitful dialogue we\u2019ve had with corporate leadership.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is an alliance-building, non-profit legal organization committed to protecting religious freedom, free speech, parental rights, and the sanctity of life.\n\n# # #",

With a diverse portfolio of globally recognized consumer staple brands, PepsiCo operates in over 200 countries and territories.\n\nThis diversification, along with a consistent performance history, makes PepsiCo a Dividend King. It provides investors with a stake in a thriving business and a dependable income stream, which is a crucial factor in today's volatile market.\n\nThe Reign of a Dividend King: 53 Years of Growth\n\n\"Dividend King\" is a title reserved for companies that have consistently increased their dividend payouts for at least 50 consecutive years. It is a mark of financial stability, prudent management, and an enduring commitment to returning value to shareholders. PepsiCo wears this crown proudly, boasting a 53-year streak of annual dividend increases. This means that for over half a century, through economic ups and downs, market crashes, and global shifts, PepsiCo has not only maintained but also increased the amount of money it returns to its investors each year through dividends.\n\nThis consistent dividend growth is a testament to PepsiCo's financial health and ability to generate sustainable profits. This track record is invaluable for investors, particularly those seeking a reliable income stream. It signifies that PepsiCo is not just a company focused on short-term gains but one built for long-term value creation.\n\nFinancial Performance: Steady Waters\n\nAs of January 21, 2025, PepsiCo\u2019s dividend yield is 3.66%, with a recent quarterly dividend payment of $1.355 per share. This translates to an annualized dividend of $5.42 per share, marking a 7% increase from the previous year. These figures represent a tangible return on investment, a steady flow of income that can be particularly appealing to income-seeking investors in a volatile market.\n\nPepsiCo's financial performance further solidifies its position as a stable investment. While the company has faced some headwinds, including product recalls affecting its Quaker Foods North America division and a generally challenging economic environment, it has continued to demonstrate resilience. The third quarter of 2024 saw revenue of $23.32 billion, contributing to a year-to-date revenue of $64.07 billion through the third quarter.\n\nThe company reported organic revenue growth of 1.3% for the third quarter of 2024. PepsiCo also provided guidance on core constant currency earnings per share (EPS) growth, which is a metric that adjusts for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, providing a clearer picture of the underlying business performance. For the full year 2024, PepsiCo has guided investors to expect at least 8% growth in core constant currency EPS, demonstrating confidence in its ability to navigate the current economic climate. These figures, while reflecting the impact of recent challenges, underscore PepsiCo's ability to generate substantial profits and maintain a strong financial footing. The company's gross profit margin has remained steady in recent years, averaging around 7%, and it maintains a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio compared to industry averages. These are positive indicators of financial health and prudent management.\n\nStrategic Initiatives: Beyond the Usual Suspects\n\nPepsiCo is pursuing growth through strategic acquisitions, investments in innovation, and expansion into new markets to maintain long-term growth and adapt to evolving consumer preferences. In 2025, PepsiCo acquired Siete Foods for $1.2 billion, signaling a push into the healthier snack market. Along with Sabra and Obela, acquired in 2024, these brands cater to the increasing demand for nutritious, simple foods and align with the growing consumer preference for authentic, flavorful options, demonstrating PepsiCo's commitment to diversifying its portfolio and expanding its reach in the international food market.\n\nPepsiCo continues to prioritize innovation, shown by significant investments in new products that align with changing consumer preferences, such as plant-based snacks under the Quaker Oats brand. The company is also expanding its at-home beverage market presence with the acquisition of SodaStream and the launch of Tostitos at-home cocktail mixers. PepsiCo's global expansion strategy includes a $5 billion investment in India to increase manufacturing and distribution capabilities. These efforts are guided by pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), which prioritizes sustainability and human capital.\n\nRisks and Challenges: A Balanced Perspective\n\nWhile PepsiCo's position as a market leader and a Dividend King is well-established, it is not without its challenges. The food and beverage industry is highly competitive, and consumer preferences are constantly evolving. One of the key challenges facing PepsiCo is the increasing consumer shift towards healthier food and beverage options. This trend has impacted demand for traditional soda and snack products, particularly in developed markets like the United States and Europe. In response, PepsiCo has been actively diversifying its portfolio to include healthier options, as demonstrated by its acquisitions and investments in brands like Siete Foods, Sabra, and Naked Juice.\n\nGovernments around the world are imposing stricter regulations to address public health and sustainability concerns. This increased regulatory scrutiny over sugar content, packaging, and environmental impact is a significant challenge. Companies like PepsiCo must adapt their products and packaging to comply with these regulations, which can increase operational costs. Additionally, the company faces intense competition from other major players in the beverage and snack industry, who are constantly innovating and investing in marketing to gain market share. PepsiCo must continue to adapt and innovate to stay ahead in the face of these challenges.\n\nA Stable Choice for Long-Term Investors\n\nPepsiCo is a compelling investment option for those who are interested in stability and reliable income. Its 53 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to its financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns, solidify its status as a Dividend King. The company's diverse portfolio of well-known brands and strategic initiatives, including adapting to changing consumer preferences and expanding into new markets, position it well for continued growth.\n\nPepsiCo's proactive approach to addressing challenges and risks, combined with its strong financial performance and market leadership, make it a solid choice for those seeking a stable investment in a dynamic market. For investors looking for a company that can weather market volatility and consistently deliver returns, PepsiCo is a dependable option worth reviewing.\n\nThe article \"PepsiCo: 53 Years of Dividend Growth and Still Going Strong\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

            "content": "Investors in PepsiCo Inc (Symbol: PEP) saw new options become available today, for the March 2026 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 420 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PEP options chain for the new March 2026 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $140.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $132.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PEP, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $148.67/share today.\n\nBecause the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.61% return on the cash commitment, or 4.87% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for PepsiCo Inc, and highlighting in green where the $140.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of PEP stock at the current price level of $148.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.92% if the stock gets called away at the March 2026 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PEP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PepsiCo Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PEP's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.03% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 22%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 19%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $148.67) to be 17%.

PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average.

            "content": "\u201cIslamic finance as a sector is barely 30 years old, with the past 15 years seeing the most development. It takes time to educate and create awareness and as this has happened, more banks have focused on servicing the demand for halal investing. This in turn helps to create more products, which then creates more demand.\u201d\n\nHalal investing is still a relatively new concept in the US, where Muslims make up around 1% of the population, as of 2020. In the past, older generations of Muslims typically focused on real estate and physical gold as investments or chose stocks recommended by friends and community members. The complexities of Islamic finance have led many to overlook it. However, this is beginning to change as technology advances and demographic trends shift. Financial educators, along with fintech startups, halal stockpickers, and specialized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are helping fill the gap. In addition, the rise of zero-fee brokerages has made investing more accessible to Muslims who follow strict financial guidelines. These low-cost platforms have made it easier to serve clients who were previously overlooked or considered unprofitable. Omar Shaikh, director of Islamic Finance Council UK, made the following comment about this:\n\nWhen investing in halal stocks, it's important for investors to carefully consider a company's balance sheet. Companies with debt exceeding 33% of their market value are disqualified from halal investing, though this ratio can fluctuate for some businesses. According to a World Bank report, the Islamic finance industry has grown quickly in the last decade, with an annual growth rate of 10-12%. Currently, Sharia-compliant financial assets are valued at approximately $2 trillion, encompassing both bank and non-bank institutions, as well as capital markets, money markets, and insurance.\n\nHalal stocks are shares in companies that adhere to Shariah law. These companies operate in accordance with Islamic principles, avoiding industries such as alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. They also maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their revenue sources are consistent with Islamic values. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah index tracks the performance of Shariah-compliant companies from the Composite 1500 that have a history of consistently raising their dividends for at least 20 years. These companies follow a managed dividend strategy, ensuring steady growth in dividend payouts.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Halal Dividend Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other halal dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHalal investing is experiencing growth despite limited awareness. A 2023 report by the General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions revealed that the global Islamic funds market has expanded by over 300% in the past decade, with nearly $200 billion in assets now managed worldwide. A Goldman Sachs report from December 2022 projected that by 2075, five of the world's ten largest economies\u2014India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Egypt\u2014will have Muslim populations exceeding 850 million people.\n\nAs the Muslim population grows, so does the demand for financial products tailored to their needs. According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2023 by DinarStandard, approximately $25.9 billion was invested in Sharia-compliant investments during the 2022-23 financial year, reflecting a 128% increase from the previous year.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we chose the top 10 stocks from the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index. These specific companies are known for consistently providing substantial dividends to their shareholders and demonstrating robust financial stability. We ranked these holdings based on the number of hedge funds that had invested in them by the end of Q3 2024, using data from Insider Monkey's database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(PEP) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA close up of a glass of a refreshing carbonated beverage illustrating the company's different beverages.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational food, beverage, and snack company. It owns an extensive portfolio of popular brands such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay\u2019s, Doritos, and Quaker. In recent years, it has also expanded its product lineup through strategic acquisitions, adding a variety of Mediterranean and Mexican-American offerings. For investors looking for growing income, this leading American corporation is worth serious consideration.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s focus on expansion and acquisitions has driven steady growth in both revenue and profit, even though it is often viewed as a defensive, slower-growth stock. This stability, combined with its capacity to navigate inflationary pressures, makes the company a reliable investment option during economic downturns. That said, the stock experienced notable pressure in 2024 as investors shifted focus to higher-growth opportunities, compounded by external factors like deglobalization and concerns over the adoption of GLP-1 drugs. These challenges have resulted in a 10% drop over the past year, with shares reaching their lowest point since mid-2021, despite a revenue increase of over 15%.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s dividend history makes it a prominent company among income investors. The company has been growing its dividends for 52 consecutive years, achieving the status of a Dividend King. Moreover, it plans to pay $8.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in FY24. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.66%, as of January 22.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 58 hedge funds owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), down from 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $4.44 billion. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 6th on our list of the best halal stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average.

PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline.

For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

Some are intriguing, some sound amazing and some are the kinds of ideas we would never dream of. We can\u2019t write about everything that we get pitched, so here are some leftovers pulled from our inboxes.\n\nPepsi turns to nostalgia for latest cola launch\n\nPepsi is turning to two popular soda flavors and bringing them together for its first permanent flavor in four years.\n\nThe soft drink is combining the nostalgic duo of ripe wild cherry and creamy vanilla for Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream. The beverage and snack giant described the soda as having a \u201csweet, fruity effervescence [that] is followed by a smooth, creamy vanilla swirl.\u201d\n\nPepsi Wild Cherry & Cream debuted nationwide on Jan. 20. The offering, which comes in full and zero-sugar varieties, are available permanently in 12-ounce cans and for a limited time in 20-ounce bottles.\n\nThe new flavor is the first permanent launch for Pepsi since Mango in 2021, which is being discontinued.\n\n\u201cThis permanent addition to our portfolio boasts a unique profile that\u2019s both indulgent and refreshing,\u201d Jenny Danzi, head of marketing for Pepsi, said in a statement. \u201cWith 2025 trends bubbling up on all things cherry, we\u2019re confident Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream will be a serious hit with fans this year!\"\n\nDanzi noted that Pepsi Wild Cherry, which the company launched in 1988, has been popular, especially among millennial and Gen Z cola fans, posting 8% growth year over year.\n\nBy combining the cherry and vanilla flavors, PepsiCo is giving consumers a new offering from the nostalgia wave that is increasingly popular with consumers today. The new flavor also provides the company with another way to draw younger shoppers into the brand who will be responsible for a greater portion of the company\u2019s sales going forward.\n\nThe launch comes less than a year after Coke discontinued its own Cherry Vanilla soda.\n\n\u2014 Christopher Doering\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of T\u00d6ST\n\nT\u00f6st taps into cans\n\nT\u00f6st has debuted a new canned format after previously available only in bottles as it aims to grow its presence within nonalcoholic beverages.\n\nLast year, Corona brewer Constellation Brands acquired a minority stake in the beverage.\n\n\u201cAfter testing can formats at experiential events and in arenas and sporting venues ... we\u2019ve found that the canned format opens up a whole new world of possibilities,\u201d T\u00f6st CEO Brooks Addington said in a statement.\n\nThe sparkling beverage brand comes in two varieties: its original blend, containing white tea, cranberry and ginger; and Ros\u00e9, with white tea, ginger and elderberry.\n\nT\u00f6st pitches itself as a way for adult drinkers to enjoy a premium cocktail-style drink without the booze. The alcohol-free cocktail market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% by 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nOther brands in the segment have grown in popularity from consumers looking to moderate their drinking, or abstain altogether, including Mingle Mocktails and Molson Coors\u2019 Roxie.\n\n\u2014 Chris Casey\n\nOptional Caption Courtesy of Protein 2o\n\nBeverage brand revamps formula to ride protein wave\n\nA water manufacturer is turning to a new formulation to attract protein-hungry consumers.\n\nProtein2o said its drink, which has between 15 and 20 grams of whey protein isolate, now contains a blend of 350 electrolytes along with vitamins B5 and B6.\n\nProtein2o was aimed at athletes when it debuted in 2013. This predated the heightened demand for protein-infused products that have emerged during the last five years.\n\nThe market for protein water alone \u2014 products classified as water that contain protein ingredients \u2014 is projected to increase to $2.6 billion by 2033, a compound annual growth rate of 8.3%, according to Fortune Market Insights.\n\nThe brand described its tenure so far as \u201cunder-the-radar\u201d but says its new formulations and packaging will resonate with a new group of consumers.\n\n\u201cWe know that protein is the core ingredient in muscle building and muscle recovery and with this new product formula, we are giving those pursuing fitness goals, a refreshing and delicious drink,\u201d said Jack Peters, senior brand manager at Protein2o.\n\nWith the added electrolytes, Protein2o also is leaning into the growing desire by consumers for hydration drinks after a workout or to nurse a hangover.\n\nSome CPG companies are debuting new protein drinks for consumers taking GLP-1 medications. In December, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Boost Brand launched a pre-meal drink containing 10 grams of protein and 45 calories per serving.\n\n\u2014 Chris Casey",

I think we've been leading the transformation of the food industry for many years,\" Laguarta said on Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nContinued Laguarta, \"We've been leaders in sodium reduction, we've been leaders in sugar reduction. We've been leaders in eliminating fat from products. We've been leading in artificial colors.\"\n\nSentiment around packaged foods stocks has soured in part due to the new administration. Trump's pick to run Health & Human Services (HHS), Robert Kennedy Jr., is a noted longtime critic of the packaged foods industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the outgoing surgeon general warned this month alcohol should come with cancer risk labels. And the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food, drinks, and ingested drugs. Laguarta said Pepsi doesn't have the dye in its US portfolio.\n\nThe barrage of health news has investors worried packaged food players may have to reformulate products at a significant cost. The bad press isn't exactly great for business, either.\n\nShares of PepsiCo are down about 14% in the past three months, underperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 5% gain. The stock price of rival Coca-Cola (KO) is down 9% over the same stretch, while Spam maker Hormel's (HRL) shares are off by 3%.\n\n\"In the US, I would like for us to be also working with the new administration on how do we move forward eliminating artificial colors from food in the US. And I think it should be science-based. It should be very pragmatic,\" Laguarta said of PepsiCo's aim to be part of the solution.\n\n\"We as an industry should aspire to, in three or four years, no artificial colors in food. It is ambitious. I think it is doable, and it should be a private, private-public cooperation that drives that outcome.\"\n\nFor PepsiCo investors, the pressured stock price also reflects its recent performance in its snacks and beverages businesses. Both have slowed amid more cautious spending by lower-income households. A rising US dollar \u2014 which weighs on international sales \u2014 hasn't helped.\n\nThird quarter sales and earnings fell 0.6% and 5% year over year, respectively.\n\nThe Street is bracing for mixed results and an accompanying 2025 outlook when the company reports on Feb. 4.\n\n\"After a tumultuous year in 2024, which began with PepsiCo guiding towards the top end of their long-term algorithm and eventually finished with organic sales below algorithm after three downward revisions on the top line, we believe PepsiCo management understands the reality of the situation and need for improvement. We would expect a below algorithm guide on the top and bottom lines,\" warned RBC analyst Nik Modi.",

It joins PepsiCo\u2019s large portfolio of brands like Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream.\n\nWith roots in Laredo, Texas, Siete specializes in grain-free, gluten-free and vegan Mexican American products with reduced sugar, salt and saturated fat.\n\nThe company began in 2014 when Siete's co-founder and president Veronica Garza was diagnosed with multiple debilitating autoimmune conditions as a teenager and adopted a diet that inspired her to make her own healthier tortillas. The Garza family of seven (siete) has ran the company for the last 10 years.\n\nThe deal was first announced last year and closed on Friday.\n\nMiguel Garza, CEO and co-founder of Siete Foods, said he and his family will continue honoring and building the Siete brand.\n\n\u201cToday marks a defining moment in Siete's journey and an exciting chapter of growth and expansion for our brand,\u201d Garza said. \u201cWhen our family founded Siete 10 years ago, it was with a heartfelt mission: to share the beauty of our Mexican-American heritage and Latino culture with the world, creating foods that everyone can enjoy, love, and feel connected to. The overwhelming support and passion we've seen \u2014 from the love for our products to the celebration of this milestone for Latino entrepreneurship \u2014 have profoundly inspired us. As we join PepsiCo, my family and I are committed to honoring, amplifying, and continuing to build the Siete brand and welcoming even more people to join us at the table.\u201d\n\nSiete Foods products are currently sold at Costco, Walmart, Target, Kroger, Whole Foods, Natural Grocers, Publix, Erewhon, Sprouts, H-E-B, Hy-vee, Wegmans and more, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nSteven Williams, CEO of PepsiCo North America, said the company will preserve Siete\u2019s \u201cspecial attributes\u201d while making it more accessible to consumers.\n\n\"We're committed to transforming our portfolio to include more positive choices that meet consumer demand for convenient and delicious products,\" Williams said. \"We love the Siete brand for the same reason so many loyal consumers do and are dedicated to preserving its special attributes while making the brand more widely available and accessible on a broader scale.\"",

            "content": "\u00a9 DoraDalton / Getty Images Signature / Canva\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo, Inc., accusing the global food and beverage giant of engaging in illegal price discrimination that unfairly favored a large big-box retailer at the expense of smaller competitors. The complaint asserts that Pepsi\u2019s actions violated the Robinson-Patman Act, a federal law that prohibits certain types of discrimination in pricing and promotional allowances.\n\nThe FTC claims that Pepsi has provided significant advantages, such as promotional payments and advertising tools, to a preferred large retailer while systematically denying similar benefits to competing grocery chains, local convenience stores, and other businesses. Such practices, according to the complaint, have inflated prices for consumers and put smaller retailers at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses\u2014no matter the size\u2014can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency, and talent.\u201d\n\nCentral to the case are allegations that Pepsi violated sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibit price discrimination through advertising and promotional allowances that favor certain customers over others. These practices, according to the FTC, included not only inconsistent financial incentives but also unequal access to promotional tools and services designed to boost sales.\n\nThe complaint highlights that Pepsi\u2019s conduct impacts a broad range of retailers, from large grocery chains to small family-owned stores, preventing them from competing on equal terms with the favored big-box retailer. The redacted portions of the FTC\u2019s complaint reportedly include additional details on how Pepsi\u2019s practices harmed competitors and consumers. The FTC has stated its intent to pursue the release of these redactions to further substantiate its case.\n\nThis lawsuit is the latest example of the FTC\u2019s renewed focus on enforcing the Robinson-Patman Act, following its December 2024 action against Southern Glazer\u2019s, the largest wine and spirits distributor in the country. By pursuing this case, the FTC aims to send a strong message about the consequences of anticompetitive business practices and price discrimination in consumer markets.\n\nThe case now heads to court, where the FTC will argue that Pepsi\u2019s allegedly unlawful practices have undermined competition and raised costs for retailers and their customers.\n\nFor the latest news on everything happening in Chester County and the surrounding area, be sure to follow MyChesCo on Google News and MSN.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won\u2019t rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar\u2019s director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cFrom a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that\u2019s partially because of the relative underperformance that they\u2019ve had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they\u2019re becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\u201d\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\nAlso read: 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nWolfe Research\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management\u2019s confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 13.23%\n\nAn American multinational food, snack, and beverage company, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks eleventh on our list of the best stocks with steady dividends. The stock has faced significant pressure throughout 2024 as investors gravitated toward higher-growth opportunities, further impacted by external challenges such as deglobalization and concerns about the adoption of GLP-1 drugs. These issues have led to a 10% decline in the past 12 months, with shares now at their lowest since mid-2021, despite a more than 15% increase in revenue.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) boasts a broad range of well-known brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay\u2019s, Doritos, and Quaker. With its extensive global presence, robust marketing and innovation strengths, and a strong financial foundation, it stands as a leading force in the industry. By focusing on regular price hikes, global expansion, and strategic acquisitions, the company has achieved consistent growth in both revenue and profit, despite being seen as a defensive, slower-growth stock. This resilience, along with its ability to withstand inflation, positions PepsiCo as a dependable investment during economic downturns.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\u2019s dividend history also makes it a reliable investment option for income investors. The company announced that it aims to distribute $8.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks in FY24. In addition, it is a Dividend King, having raised its payouts for 52 consecutive years. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.63%, as of January 20.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was included in 58 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 65 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stakes held by these funds have a total value of more than $4.44 billion.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 11th on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) is a well-known company and most investors probably have a good understanding of what it does. But there's an important nuance to consider when investors look at the company's dividend.\n\nRight now, the dividend yield on PepsiCo stock is a historically high 3.6%, which suggests the stock is on sale. But this Dividend King has a long history of reliable dividend growth behind it and that fact changes the dividend story in an important way that investors can't afford to overlook.\n\nWhat does PepsiCo do?\n\nPepsiCo most obviously makes Pepsi, the cola. But its beverage business is much larger than just that one brand. It is, all in, the No. 2 beverage company behind Coca-Cola in the United States (as measured by market cap and earnings). But, unlike Coca-Cola, PepsiCo produces more than just beverages. It also happens to be the No. 1 U.S. company when it comes to salty snacks via its Frito-Lay business. And PepsiCo also has a sizable packaged food operation that lives within its Quaker Oats division.\n\nPepsiCo competes fairly well in every business it operates. All in it is a very attractive consumer staples giant with marketing and distribution chops that set it apart from smaller peers. It is a valuable partner to retailers around the world.\n\nThat said, PepsiCo's financial performance is a bit weak today and there are some big-picture concerns around the consumer staples space that are holding the stock down. If history is any guide, this too shall pass. Thus, the historically high yield on offer right now is likely to be very appealing to a long-term income investor.\n\nA Dividend King with a rapid dividend growth rate\n\nBased on its dividend growth rate alone PepsiCo appears attractive. But there's more to understand about the dividend than just the historically high dividend yield. PepsiCo has increased its dividend annually for 52 consecutive years. That puts it into the highly elite class of Dividend Kings. You don't achieve a record like that by accident, a company has to be well run in both good periods and bad ones. That's part of the reason why long-term investors should take the near-term headwinds in stride.\n\nHowever, there's another metric to consider here. Over the past decade, PepsiCo's dividend has grown at an annualized rate of 7%. That's roughly the same rate that has been achieved over the past one-, three-, and five-year periods, too. That's a pretty material figure, noting that inflation's historical growth rate is something close to half that level. Simply put, the buying power of PepsiCo's dividend has grown over time.\n\nOne way to get a read on this growth is to examine the stock's yield on purchase price if you had bought it, say, in 2013. The highest stock price in 2013 was $87.06. At that point, the quarterly dividend was $0.5675 per share. That leads to a yield of about 2.6%. The dividend today is $1.355 per share per quarter, leading to a yield on purchase price (commonly referred to as yield on cost) of about 6.2%. This indicates the yield has improved significantly for the long-term shareholder. Notably, the stock price has risen to more than $140 per share, as well, so investors also benefited from notable capital appreciation.\n\nPepsiCo looks like a buy-and-hold dividend gem\n\nThe upshot of all of this is that PepsiCo looks attractive from a yield perspective right now. But if it can continue to grow its business as it has historically, in good markets and bad, shareholders are likely to benefit from a continuation of robust dividend growth. Given enough time that could change this attractive yield into a large one if you consider the yield on cost. That's not a metric that a lot of investors consider, but if you are a dividend investor who thinks in decades and not days, you should be thinking about the yield on cost. In the case of PepsiCo, this little-known fact is one you can't overlook.",

            "content": "PURCHASE, NY. \u2014 Three-and-half months after unveiling the $1.2 billion deal, PepsiCo, Inc. has wrapped up its acquisition of Mexican-American food and snack brand Siete Foods.\n\nThe trade name of Austin, Texas-based Garza Food Ventures LLC, Siete Foods brings PepsiCo a portfolio with both authentic Mexican and better-for-you offerings, from grain-free tortillas, enchilada sauces, taco seasonings, botana sauces and Mexican cookies to vegan beans, grain-free puffs, tortilla chips, potato chips and salsas. Siete\u2019s products are sold at more than 40,000 retailers, including grocery stores, warehouse clubs and organic food stores, mainly across the United States.\n\nWhen announcing the Siete acquisition on Oct. 1, Purchase-based PepsiCo, the parent of Frito-Lay, said it expected to close the transaction in the first half of 2025.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to transforming our portfolio to include more positive choices that meet consumer demand for convenient and delicious products,\u201d said Steven Williams, chief executive officer of PepsiCo North America.\n\nPepsiCo said the addition of Siete\u2019s lineup of nutritious, simple foods and ingredients aligns with its efforts to offer consumers more better-for-you meal and snack options by reducing salt, sugar and saturated fat in products without compromising taste, while also providing more \u201cpositive nutrition.\u201d The beverage and food giant cited its acquisition of brands such as PopCorners in 2019, Bare Foods in 2018, Stacy\u2019s Pita Chips in 2006, and most recently, Sabra. In late November, PepsiCo unveiled a deal to buy the remaining 50% interest in the manufacturers of Sabra and Obela from joint-venture partner Strauss Group.\n\n\u201cWe love the Siete brand for the same reason so many loyal consumers do and are dedicated to preserving its special attributes while making the brand more widely available and accessible on a broader scale,\u201d Williams said.\n\nFounded in 2014 in Austin, Siete brought together all seven members of the Garza family to provide heritage-inspired foods for a variety of dietary needs and preferences, according to the company.\n\n\u201cToday marks a defining moment in Siete\u2019s journey and an exciting chapter of growth and expansion for our brand,\u201d said Miguel Garza, co-founder and CEO of Siete Foods. \u201cWhen our family founded Siete 10 years ago, it was with a heartfelt mission: to share the beauty of our Mexican-American heritage and Latino culture with the world, creating foods that everyone can enjoy, love and feel connected to. The overwhelming support and passion we\u2019ve seen \u2014 from the love for our products to the celebration of this milestone for Latino entrepreneurship \u2014 have profoundly inspired us. As we join PepsiCo, my family and I are committed to honoring, amplifying and continuing to build the Siete brand and welcoming even more people to join us at the table.\u201d\n\nWhen PepsiCo reported third-quarter results a week after unveiling the acquisition, CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts that Siete would build on the strategic game plan for Frito-Lay North America.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of Siete hopefully will give us another tool to capture both permissible locations and enter into meals in a way that is sustainable in the long term,\u201d Laguarta said, \u201cbut there are many other brands in the portfolio that can play in both of those spaces.\u201d",

            "content": "The CEOs of several Global Fortune 500 companies said artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing their operations, while acknowledging that most companies are still grappling with implementing and scaling it, during a power-packed panel Tuesday (Jan. 21) before the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe panel comprised of Matt Garman, CEO of AWS; Ramon Laguarta, CEO of PepsiCo; Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture; Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi; and Amin Nasser, president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company of Saudi Arabia. They offered insights from across the cloud, consumer goods, consulting, energy and pharmaceutical industries and sectors.\n\nTheir high-level discussion revealed a striking contrast between companies already seeing transformative benefits from AI and the majority still struggling to implement it effectively. A new WEF white paper showed that 74% of companies struggle to scale AI, with only 16% prepared for AI-enabled reinvention, said moderator and CNBC co-anchor Sara Eisen.\n\nThe focus of the panel was how to operationalize AI, going beyond experimentation in proofs of concept to implementation. \u201cWhile most companies are still piloting, dabbling, most CEOs that are a little bit apprehensive \u2026 are running lots of proofs of concepts because it\u2019s safe to just do that a few years before retirement,\u201d said Sanofi\u2019s Hudson.\n\nHudson said most companies stumble in AI implementation today because they relegate it to the company\u2019s chief data officer (CDO) or other tech leader. He said it\u2019s one of the \u201cbiggest mistakes\u201d a company can make with AI due to the \u201cnature of change and the courage needed to change business processes at scale, to better optimize resources and go chase miracles.\u201d At Sanofi, he is the one who takes charge of AI, not the technologists.\n\nHudson said Sanofi\u2019s use of AI is making its \u201cprobability of success\u201d in discovering new drugs \u201cso much higher.\u201d He said AI is also helping discover drugs for diseases that are considered \u201cundruggable\u201d or those currently still without any treatments. Sanofi is using AI to validate targets with over 90% accuracy, helping to shorten the typically long and expensive drug development process. The drugmaker also has integrated AI deeply into its processes, such that its drug development committee now begins sessions with AI recommendations on whether drugs should advance to next phases.\n\nThus far, Hudson said no pharmaceutical company has used AI to go the full route from drug discovery to FDA approval, a process normally taking 12 to 15 years. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for the first medicine that\u2019s done the entire journey,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIn the race of turtles, we are the lead turtle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s About Data and People\n\nGarman of AWS said many companies have not even moved their data to the cloud. He said data that is organized, labeled and set up in the cloud is critical because it feeds into generative AI\u2019s large language models. Without it, it\u2019s \u201cactually hard to get value out of those AI projects.\u201d In his view, the biggest hurdle for companies is \u201cjust being in legacy, on-premise, by far.\u201d\n\nAs for enterprise clients with their data in the cloud, AWS provides free AI training to them. Garman also said it\u2019s important for clients to understand that while it could take 12 to 48 months to deploy AI in their companies, engineers have to already be thinking ahead to future capabilities two to four years out since advancements in AI are moving so quickly.\n\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s Nasser said AI has been a \u201ctransformative force\u201d for the energy industry. He said his organization receives 10 billion data points daily to improve operations. For example, seismic analysis that once took months to run now takes weeks, days or even hours to help Aramco find more oil. Also, they use AI to predict equipment failures based on the data they are getting. It reduces downtime and increases their efficiency.\n\nBut to get to this point, Nasser said Aramco needed to have an infrastructure in place for AI to thrive. One critical factor is having people with the right skills to identify and develop the appropriate use cases. Nasser said Aramco itself has 450 use cases at present. \u201cEach use case is a project of its own, and it ends up with huge benefits,\u201d he said. Nasser noted that it is important to pair an AI expert with a subject matter expert to work on use cases.\n\nUpskilling the workforce is one way to have an AI-skilled staff. PepsiCo\u2019s Laguarta said the company is training its 330,000 employees on AI. The company\u2019s divisions range from agriculture and manufacturing to logistics and consumer engagement. PepsiCo is using AI to enhance crop yields, optimize transportation routes and develop personalized nutrition solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge transformation,\u201d he said. However, companies must be careful not to create a divide between digital and analog workers.\n\nAWS\u2019 Garman added that employees must be convinced that AI will not take their jobs for them to embrace it. One of the things AWS did was to showcase how AI can make employees\u2019 lives better. It took a boring, tedious internal task \u2014 Java upgrades of the company\u2019s software \u2014 and automated it with an AI tool it built internally. Normally, it would have taken a team of five AWS people around more than 4,000 years to do it, he said. The AI tool let them do it in \u201ca couple of months,\u201d Garman said. It was \u201ctaking away work that no one wanted to do in the first place.\u201d\n\nIn addition to upskilling employees, they should seek external expertise. Accenture\u2019s Sweet said collaborations and partnerships are also important to innovating with AI. \u201cInnovation happens only with partnerships,\u201d she said. \u201cAny company that says they can innovate only internally is almost by definition not innovating.\u201d Collaborating can help unlock and accelerate advances in AI.\n\nThree Trends in Implementing AI\n\nFor companies that are already deploying AI, Sweet identified three major trends where she sees traction. The first is hyper-personalization for growth. She pointed to the example of Radisson Hotels, which can show a traveler different photos of the same hotel depending on their interests. If they want to go skiing, Radisson can show them a hotel in the Swiss Alps. If they want to go to a spa, different hotel photos show up in real time.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing [this trend] in banking, we\u2019re seeing it in retail, we\u2019re seeing it increasingly in health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second trend is physical AI for efficiency, such as reducing manufacturing defect investigation time from weeks to hours. Sweet said a global tire manufacturer usually had to wait weeks to investigate an equipment failure on the production line. With AI, it merely took hours. \u201cIt makes a huge difference [to business] if that line is stopped for a week or two weeks versus a few hours,\u201d she said.\n\nThe third trend is using AI to accelerate legacy system modernization. \u201cGenAI is helping us be able to get off the mainframe faster,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nShe also encouraged companies to adopt AI responsibly, given all the potential harm it could create. She said only 2% of companies globally have robust responsible AI programs in place, a percentage that has not changed in the past year. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to move that number,\u201d she added. This builds trust in AI systems and is the \u201ckey to scaling.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, AWS\u2019 Garman dismissed concerns about AI hitting an innovation wall. \u201cIf you look at how these technologies evolve over time, oftentimes you\u2019ll make a lot of progress on one path, and then that path will run out of steam. Then you\u2019ll just find a different path and you continue to go on from there.\u201d\n\nThe GenAI path that is probably out of steam is the technique of giving an AI model increasingly large amounts of data to make it more intelligent. That method has stopped working. \u201cFor the most part, that path is gone,\u201d Garman said.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you look at all the latest models, they\u2019re doing things like reasoning loops \u2026 [where] you ask the models to just actually think about the answer. \u2026 They can actually get much better.\u201d\n\nHe predicted AI will work more like human employees, maybe even taking a day or a week to iterate and collaborate before delivering results, instead of the instant responses AI chatbots produce today.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

The company will \u201cvigorously\u201d present its case in court.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo\u2019s practices are in line with industry norms, and we do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nA substantial portion of the FTC\u2019s allegations were redacted in the complaint due to the legal protections afforded to both PepsiCo and the retailer, according to the FTC.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d said Lina M. Khan, chair of the FTC. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency and talent.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s practices led to inflated prices for American families and denied other retailers the ability to compete, according to the FTC. PepsiCo\u2019s conduct violated the Robinson-Patman Act, which says sellers are prohibited from engaging in price discrimination by using advertising and other allowances that are financial incentives given to retailers by manufacturers to promote a product or brand, to favor large customers over small businesses, according to the FTC.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit filed by the FTC is wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d PepsiCo said. \u201cThis unprecedented expansion of the RPA reflects the FTC\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of the omnichannel retail marketplace and the important role that consumer product suppliers play in providing lower prices and value to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe FTC, by a vote of three to two, authorized FTC staff to file for a permanent injunction and other equitable relief in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nKhan and Alvaro M. Bedoya, an FTC commissioner, said the allegations were enough reason to believe PepsiCo\u2019s conduct was harming competition and driving up prices.\n\n\u201cAt this highly advanced stage of the investigation, with the survival of competing businesses hanging in the balance, and with the relentless price increases American consumers have had to endure year over year due in part to Pepsi and (the retailer\u2019s) conduct, directing staff to continue to spin their wheels in terabytes of Pepsi data looking for further confirmation of the patently illegal scheme alleged in the complaint would be an abdication of our duty,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nAndrew N. Ferguson, an FTC commissioner, dissented, pointing out the ruling was made three days before the administration of President Joseph Biden ended and the administration of President Donald Trump began.\n\n\u201cOn the eve of its eviction from power at the hands of the American voters, the commission\u2019s Democratic majority offers one final insult to the commission, its staff and the rule of law,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIn a cynical attempt to tie the hands of the incoming Trump administration, the Democratic majority launches a major lawsuit on little more than a hunch. The gaping holes in the evidence that commission staff collected in its limited investigation make it impossible to determine whether the defendant, PepsiCo, Inc. (\u2018Pepsi\u2019), has broken the law.\u201d",

            "content": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against PepsiCo, alleging that the global beverage and snack company engaged in unlawful price discrimination by offering preferential pricing to a major retailer\u2014believed to be Walmart, according to an anonymous source cited by the Associated Press. The legal action, filed on Friday, claims that PepsiCo\u2019s pricing practices have harmed smaller retailers, distorted market competition, and ultimately forced consumers to pay higher prices unless they shop at Walmart.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s lawsuit is based on the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, a seldom-used antitrust law designed to prevent large corporations from offering exclusive pricing benefits to big retailers at the expense of smaller competitors. This legal development marks a significant escalation in the Biden administration\u2019s antitrust enforcement efforts, which have sought to curtail anti-competitive practices in various industries.\n\nFTC\u2019s Allegations: Preferential Pricing for Walmart\n\nAccording to the FTC's complaint, PepsiCo engaged in preferential promotional agreements with Walmart by offering exclusive discounts and incentives, which were not extended to other retailers, including independent convenience stores and regional grocery chains. The commission argues that this created an unfair advantage, effectively making it difficult for smaller businesses to compete, resulting in higher consumer prices and less choice in the marketplace.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan, known for her aggressive stance on corporate regulation, emphasised that the lawsuit is part of a broader effort to ensure fair competition and consumer protection in the retail industry.\n\n\"No company should be allowed to manipulate pricing in a way that undermines competition and disadvantages consumers,\" said Khan in a statement.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Response and Potential Repercussions\n\nPepsiCo, the maker of globally recognised brands such as Pepsi, Lay\u2019s, and Gatorade, has yet to issue an official statement in response to the allegations. However, industry analysts suggest that the company may argue that volume-based pricing and promotional incentives are common industry practices aimed at achieving economies of scale.\n\nIf found guilty, PepsiCo could face significant financial penalties, including potential fines and the requirement to restructure its pricing policies to comply with federal regulations. Additionally, the company could be forced to provide similar pricing arrangements to all retailers, which may impact its profitability and relationships with key retail partners.\n\nBroader Implications for the Retail and Beverage Industry\n\nThe lawsuit against PepsiCo comes amid growing scrutiny of retail pricing tactics used by multinational corporations. The FTC\u2019s renewed enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act signals a shift in regulatory focus, potentially opening the door for further investigations into other major brands across the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods sectors.\n\nThis lawsuit follows the FTC's December legal action against Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, one of the largest alcohol distributors in the U.S., which was accused of offering unfair pricing advantages to large retailers at the expense of smaller liquor stores. These back-to-back lawsuits suggest a growing trend in the agency\u2019s effort to combat price discrimination and level the playing field for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nExperts believe that the outcome of the case could lead to industry-wide reforms, forcing companies to revisit their pricing strategies to avoid potential legal challenges. Large retailers that have traditionally benefited from preferential pricing arrangements, such as Walmart, may also need to reassess their relationships with suppliers.\n\nThe Robinson-Patman Act: A Long-Dormant Law Revived\n\nEnacted in 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act was originally designed to protect small businesses from predatory pricing practices by larger competitors. Over the years, its enforcement dwindled, as regulators focused more on consumer welfare and lower prices, rather than market fairness.\n\nHowever, the FTC's decision to revive the act signals a policy shift, focusing on protecting competition rather than simply reducing consumer prices. While some argue that the law is outdated in the modern retail landscape, advocates suggest that it remains relevant in preventing market concentration and fostering a more competitive environment.\n\nRelated: Walmart\u2019s DEI Rollback: A Strategic Shift Amid Growing Political Pressures\n\nConsumer Impact and Market Reaction\n\nThe potential consequences of this lawsuit extend beyond retailers and suppliers, ultimately impacting consumers. If PepsiCo is found to have engaged in price discrimination, smaller retailers may be able to offer more competitive pricing, leading to greater affordability and accessibility of popular products. However, critics argue that enforcing price uniformity could lead to higher costs for businesses, which might eventually be passed on to consumers.\n\nRetail analysts predict that if the lawsuit proceeds, PepsiCo\u2019s competitors, such as Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9, may face similar scrutiny, prompting a widespread review of pricing practices across the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, PepsiCo\u2019s shareholders are closely watching developments, as the legal battle could affect the company's stock performance, financial outlook, and long-term strategy.\n\nA Precedent-Setting Case\n\nThe FTC\u2019s lawsuit against PepsiCo has the potential to set a major legal precedent in the retail and beverage industry. If successful, the case could lead to stricter regulations, forcing companies to adopt more transparent and fair pricing models.\n\nAs the case unfolds, businesses across the supply chain will be closely monitoring the outcome, as it could reshape industry dynamics and influence future government interventions in the retail sector. Whether PepsiCo will settle the case or fight it in court remains to be seen, but the lawsuit underscores the heightened regulatory scrutiny facing multinational corporations in today\u2019s evolving business landscape.",

Commissioner Andrew Ferguson argues that the lawsuit was initiated based on \u201clittle more than a hunch\u201d.\n\nThe dissenting statement of Commissioner Melissa Holyoak read: \u201cToday\u2019s complaint against Pepsi is wholly deficient, not only because the pleadings fail to state a claim, but because the majority rushed the case out the door before it had evidence to support the allegations. I am astounded that the majority has such little regard for our staff that it is willing to send them to court like a lamb to the slaughter. And if by some chance the complaint survives a motion to dismiss, the gaping holes in the supporting evidence will quickly become manifest.\u201d\n\nThe commission also took action against Southern Glazer\u2019s, a distributor of wine and spirits in December 2024.",

According to the FTC, this practice harmed competition and violated antitrust laws.\n\nFTC's Allegations Against PepsiCo\n\nThe FTC claims that PepsiCo provided significant price advantages to one big-box retailer, which enabled that retailer to sell PepsiCo products at prices lower than its competitors. While the FTC's statement did not name the retailer, a source familiar with the case\u2014who requested anonymity\u2014revealed that the retailer in question was Walmart.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan commented on the case:\n\n\"The FTC is committed to ensuring that all businesses compete fairly and that consumers benefit from open, competitive markets. Price discrimination, especially when it disadvantages smaller competitors, harms the competitive process and ultimately harms consumers. Our action against PepsiCo is an important step in maintaining market integrity.\"\n\nPepsiCo's Response to the Allegations\n\nPepsiCo has denied the allegations, asserting that its pricing strategies are legal and in full compliance with antitrust laws. The company expressed confidence that it would prevail in the lawsuit, standing by its commitment to fair competition and competitive pricing for all retailers.\n\nIn a statement, PepsiCo said:\n\n\"We strongly disagree with the FTC\u2019s allegations and believe our practices are consistent with the law. PepsiCo has always been committed to fair competition and providing value to consumers through our pricing strategies. We are confident that we will prevail in this matter.\"\n\nThe FTC's Efforts to Protect Fair Competition\n\nThe FTC\u2019s lawsuit highlights the Commission's ongoing commitment to ensuring fair competition in the marketplace. The lawsuit claims that PepsiCo\u2019s actions unfairly benefitted Walmart over other competitors, undermining competition and potentially harming smaller retailers who couldn't access the same pricing advantages.\n\nPepsiCo has faced price discrimination lawsuits in the past, though the circumstances and outcomes varied. One notable instance occurred in the 1990s when PepsiCo was involved in a price discrimination case related to its distribution practices.\n\nIn that case, PepsiCo was accused of offering discounts and preferential treatment to certain distributors, which allegedly harmed competition by allowing those distributors to sell products at lower prices than competitors. This case was settled, with PepsiCo agreeing to make changes to its distribution practices.\n\nAdditionally, the company has been involved in other legal disputes over pricing practices, particularly related to unfair market advantages and anti-competitive behaviour, although not always specifically on the grounds of price discrimination. Over the years, such legal actions have been part of broader antitrust investigations into PepsiCo's pricing strategies.\n\nThe current lawsuit filed by the FTC is particularly significant as it focuses on the price advantages given to one major retailer, Walmart, which is alleged to have created an unfair market advantage.",

            "content": "The Federal Trade Commission sued PepsiCo on Friday, alleging that it has engaged in illegal price discrimination by giving unfair price advantages to one large retailer at the expense of other vendors and consumers.\n\nThe benefiting customer wasn\u2019t named in an FTC statement about the lawsuit. But a source familiar with the case, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss it, said the retailer was Walmart.\n\nPepsiCo said the lawsuit \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law\u201d and misunderstands the way consumer product companies help retailers provide lower prices.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC\u2019s allegations and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC said PepsiCo\u2019s practices included making promotional payments to Walmart but not to large grocery chains or independent convenience stores. The FTC said that lets Walmart lower its prices, but forces Americans to pay inflated prices for PepsiCo products unless they shop at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWhen firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in the statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s action will help ensure all grocers and other businesses \u2014 no matter the size \u2014 can get a fair shake and compete on the merits of their skill, efficiency, and talent.\u201d\n\nWalmart said Friday it had \u201cnothing to add at this time.\u201d PepsiCo said its practices \u201care in line with industry norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe FTC sued PepsiCo under the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act. The FTC said the act prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.\n\nIt was the second time in a little more than a month that the FTC has cited the Robinson-Patman Act in a lawsuit. In December, the commission sued Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits, a large U.S. distributor, saying it illegally discriminated against small and independent businesses by giving discounts and rebates to larger stores.\n\nIn the waning days of the Biden administration, the FTC has been busy issuing consumer refunds, taking enforcement actions against companies the agency accuses of deceptive practices and finalizing rules it says are needed to make the marketplace more fair.\n\nThe FTC voted 3-2 to authorize staff to file a lawsuit for a permanent injunction against PepsiCo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. It makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, brekfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been the subject of some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.\n\nPepsiCo responded by trying to make Lay\u2019s more affordable through a mix of product promotions, more chips per bag and value packs. Similar promotions were planned for Doritos and Tostitos, the company said.",

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nWhen a given stock enters a bear market, some risk-tolerant investors often feel they have the opportunity to buy on sale. This is especially true for dividend stocks, since a lower buy price translates into a higher-percentage dividend yield on one's investment.\n\nThe only question for investors is about which stocks may serve as an opportunity for yield under current conditions. While it may be difficult to accurately forecast the future with any precision, adding shares or initiating new positions should pay off in terms of dividend income and eventual stock growth.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nRealty Income\n\nRealty Income (NYSE: O) offers both hope and frustration to dividend investors.\n\nThis stock, which specializes in single-tenant commercial properties, achieved its all-time high nearly five years ago. As of this writing, its current price is 37% below its peak in February 2020. The pandemic and the massive increase in interest rates in the early 2020s likely soured investors on this real estate investment trust (REIT).\n\nHowever, investors who bought more recently have derived a key benefit from this stock -- a high dividend yield. That dividend return of 6.1% is nearly five times the S&P 500 average of around 1.25%. Additionally, it bills itself as the \"monthly dividend company\" and has lived up to that name. It pays shareholders every month and has increased payouts at least once annually since it began trading as a REIT in 1994.\n\nInvestors do not seem to appreciate the growth it generated amid higher interest rates. Thanks to acquisition and in-house property development, it now owns about 15,500 properties at the end of the third quarter of 2024. At the stock's peak in first-quarter 2020, it owned approximately 6,500 properties.\n\nNot surprisingly, that growth boosted its financial performance. Quarterly revenue has risen from $414 million to over $1.3 billion, and the company's funds from operations (FFO) income, a measure of a REIT's free cash flow, surged to $864 million from $277 million. Hence, in addition to the massive dividend, investors are buying its enormous property portfolio that generates more than triple the revenue and more than double the FFO income.\n\nAdmittedly, FFO income would likely improve with lower interest rates, and the failure of rate cuts to lower market interest rates is a point of frustration. Nonetheless, with the growth of property assets, dividends, and FFO income that Realty Income has achieved in a higher-rate environment, it's probably time to stop punishing Realty Income stock over interest rates.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is another example of temporary challenges boosting the dividend yield.\n\nDespite the focus on its flagship beverage, Pepsi, it also owns beverages such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade. It also manages a massive food business with its ownership of Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods.\n\nWhile it has served as a source of steady growth, its challenges have begun to catch up to the company. Price increases started to reduce demand for its products. The incoming Trump Administration could also force PepsiCo to change the ingredients in many of its products, or possibly discontinue some offerings. Consequently, the stock has fallen about 27% from its peak.\n\nHowever, PepsiCo is working to win back customers. Rather than cutting prices, it increased the size of its offerings, adding 20% more product to bags of Tostitos and Ruffles. It also reduced its variety packs to 10-count (from 18- and 24-count) to drive more sales.\n\nTemporary slowdowns are unlikely to derail the 52-year history of payout hikes for this Dividend King. With its lower stock price, the yield is up to 3.8%, around triple the S&P 500 average.\n\nIndeed, its financials reflect its recent struggles. In the third quarter of 2024, its revenue of $23 billion fell less than 1% yearly. That is well under the 7% annual growth in Q3 2023. In Q3 2024, its net income of $2.9 billion also dropped 5% yearly, reversing the 14% increase in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNonetheless, the stock may have overreacted to the sluggish financial performance. While its revenue and net income dropped slightly, the level of decline points to a minor slowdown rather than a collapse. Thanks to the drop in the stock price, its price-to-earnings ratio has fallen to 21, the lowest level since the market crash in early 2020.\n\nUltimately, such conditions could make PepsiCo a more appealing choice for those seeking higher dividend returns. With its high-yielding, rising payout and low valuation, the beverage and food giant looks increasingly like a buy for income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "content": "My long-term financial goal is to eventually collect enough passive income each year to cover my basic living expenses. One aspect of my strategy is to invest in companies that pay an above-average dividend that steadily rises. That should enable me to achieve my passive income goal sooner.\n\nI'm always looking for new dividend stocks to help me reach my goal. That pursuit recently led me to buy shares of PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%). Here's why I think the beverage and snacking giant can help me quench my thirst for more passive income.\n\nAmong the dividend elite\n\nPepsiCo currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.8%. That's well above its historical average range of 2.5% to 3% over the past decade. Its yield is currently more than three times higher than the S&P 500 index's dividend yield (1.2%). That high-yielding payout will enable me to generate more income from every dollar I invest in the stock, which will certainly help satisfy my thirst for passive income.\n\nThe beverage and snacking giant has a phenomenal record of paying dividends. It has paid consecutive quarterly dividends since 1965, while last year marked its 52nd straight year of annual dividend growth, keeping it in the elite group of Dividend Kings. Since 2010, PepsiCo has grown its dividend at a 7.7% compound annual rate, including by 7% last year.\n\nThe company can easily afford its high-yielding dividend. It generates strong cash flow and has an excellent balance sheet. It expected to pay $7.2 billion in dividends last year and repurchase $1 billion of its shares. Meanwhile, it ended the third quarter with about $8 billion of cash on its balance sheet and a low leverage ratio, which supports its A+/A1 bond rating.\n\nMore growth ahead\n\nPepsiCo expects to continue growing its revenue and earnings at solid rates in the coming years, which should support future dividend increases. The company was on track to deliver low-single-digit organic revenue growth last year and at least an 8% rise in its earnings per share. That tracks with the company's long-term targets of producing 4% to 6% organic revenue growth and high-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.\n\nThe company has a massive opportunity to continue expanding. It estimates that the global beverage and convenient food opportunity is over $1.2 trillion. With less than $100 billion in revenue, PepsiCo has a long growth runway ahead.\n\nPepsiCo is investing heavily in growing its business. It's expanded its energy drinks and water offerings. It has also reduced sugar and sodium to make its drinks and snacks healthier while adding whole grain and baked offerings. In addition, it added more packaging choices for portion control and launched bold new flavors. The company has also continued to work on expanding its international sales.\n\nThe food and beverage company will also use its strong balance sheet to make acquisitions that enhance its ability to grow. For example, it bought Garza Food Ventures (Siete Foods) for $1.2 billion last October, adding the maker of tortillas, salsas, seasonings, sauces, cookies, and snacks to its portfolio. The company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Sabra and Obela products last year, accelerating its innovation in refrigerated fresh dips and spreads. These acquisitions have enabled PepsiCo to evolve its food portfolio to give consumers more choices.\n\nToo tempting to pass up\n\nPepsiCo's stock price has been under a bit of pressure over the past year (down 20% from its 52-week high) due to lower-than-expected sales growth and concerns that weight loss drugs will reduce consumers' appetite for sweet drinks and savory snacks. While it's facing some near-term headwinds, its long-term growth outlook remains strong, especially as it continues expanding its healthier options. That's why I think the sell-off has made PepsiCo's higher-yielding dividend too tempting to pass up. I believe it can supply me with a satisfying stream of steadily rising dividend income in the coming years.",

            "content": "A new federal lawsuit accuses Pepsi of rigging competition by offering unfair deals to a large big-box store at the expense of rival retailers, resulting in higher prices for shoppers.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is suing Pepsi for its special deals with a company whose name is redacted. Industry experts point to Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, as the likely company, which is not accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe FTC alleges that because Pepsi did not offer the same deals to others that sell its products, it put other retailers \"ranging from large grocery chains to independent, local convenience stores\" at a disadvantage. Pepsi described the lawsuit as \"wrong on the facts and the law.\"\n\nThe case is part of the FTC's recent revival of a long-dormant law to try to crack down on high grocery prices, which have been topping Americans' economic concerns. The 1936 law prohibits suppliers from giving preferential treatment to big companies over smaller ones, though with caveats.\n\n\"When firms like Pepsi give massive retailers a leg up, it tilts the playing field against small firms and ultimately inflates prices for American consumers,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in statement.\n\nPepsi, in a statement, said its \"practices are in line with industry norms and we do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others.\" Walmart declined comment. The redactions in Friday's lawsuit might get lifted over time as part of the legal process.\n\nIt's unclear how the case will continue under the Trump administration. Some Republican legal thinkers have favored the revival of the old law, called the Robinson-Patman Act.\n\nBut the FTC's vote to sue Pepsi split along party lines, with the two Republican commissioners dissenting. Trump's pick to lead the FTC, Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, had taken issue with the Pepsi proceeding. Republican Commissioner Melissa Holyoak called Friday's lawsuit \"the worst case\" she'd seen at the agency, saying that she thought Democrats had \"rushed the case out the door.\"\n\nThe Pepsi lawsuit brings new scrutiny to Walmart's power to use its scale to extract cheaper prices. It also shines a spotlight on PepsiCo's own power as the owner of numerous soft-drink brands, including Gatorade, Mountain Dew, Lipton and Bubly.\n\nThe National Grocers Association, which represents independent retailers and wholesalers, praised the FTC's lawsuit on Friday.\n\n\"Suppliers pay dearly for the privilege of doing business with these massive corporations, and the cost gets passed on to everyone else,\" said Chris Jones, the trade group's chief government relations officer. \"The FTC's lawsuit focuses on the core of the problem, one dominant retailer abusing its market power to coerce suppliers into making unreasonable and costly concessions,\"\n\nIndependent grocers in a coalition with pharmacy, farming and other groups have urged stepped-up enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act. Prominent anti-monopoly advocate Stacy Mitchell has argued that the government pulling back on this law in the 1980s helped decimate America's grocery competition.\n\n\"By favoring a single large chain, Walmart, with discriminatory pricing, PepsiCo's actions have fueled the decline of local retailers, the proliferation of food deserts, and rising grocery prices,\" said Mitchell, co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"By filing suit against PepsiCo, the FTC is sending a clear message: it is illegal for a large supplier to collaborate with a big retail chain to drive smaller retailers out of business and dominate the market.\"\n\nThe FTC last month similarly sued the largest U.S. alcohol distributor, Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, alleging it illegally denied smaller businesses the discounts and rebates that it offered to big chains.",

Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was one of the two dissenting votes.\n\nThe other commissioner voting against the lawsuit, Melissa Holyoak, wrote in her dissent that the case against PepsiCo was \u201cthe worst case I have seen in my time at the commission.\u201d Holyoak said the majority of commissioners rushed the case out the door before they had enough evidence to support the allegations.\n\n\u201cPepsi\u2019s promotions to the retailer are not disguised discriminatory discounts but rather ordinary price concessions,\u201d Holyoak wrote.\n\nPepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies. It makes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade as well as snack foods like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos and Fritos. It also makes Quaker Oats, breakfast cereals and granola bars.\n\nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing above or go here for more info\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s prices have been the subject of some scrutiny since the pandemic. In 2022, for example, the company acknowledged shrinking its Gatorade bottles from 32 ounces to 28 ounces, but it didn\u2019t respond when asked why it charged more for the 28-ounce bottles.\n\nIn October, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania sent letters to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and General Mills accusing them of price gouging through shrinking package sizes.\n\nPepsiCo has said its price increases were necessary because of the rising cost of ingredients, shipping, packaging and labor. But over the summer, the company said consumers were pulling back on snack and drink purchases or shifting to cheaper store brands.",

The agency argues Pepsi gave Walmart promotional payments and allowances, as well as advertising and promotional tools, that it didn't offer to the retail giant's rivals.\n\nPepsi denied the allegations and said the FTC's lawsuit is wrong, both factually and legally.\n\n\"PepsiCo strongly disputes the FTC's allegations, and the partisan manner in which the suit was filed. We will vigorously present our case in court,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC. \"PepsiCo's practices are in line with industry norms and we do not favor certain customers by offering discounts or promotional support to some customers and not others.\"\n\nWalmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of New York, is currently sealed.\n\nThe FTC also said that a \"substantial portion\" of the alleged violations are redacted in the lawsuit, citing legal protections given to Pepsi and the large, big box retailer. The commission is seeking to lift the redactions to show how Pepsi broke the law and how those alleged actions led to higher prices for competing retailers.\n\nThe Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936, but the federal government stopped enforcing it during the deregulation of the 1980s. The FTC resumed its enforcement in December when it sued Southern Glazer's, the largest U.S. distributor of wine and spirits.\n\nThe lawsuit comes on the final business day before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, which will spell the end of Lina Khan's time as chair of the FTC. Her Republican successor, Andrew Ferguson, currently serves on the commission and released a statement dissenting against the decision to sue Pepsi.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken a flurry of legal action against companies and corporate executives in its final days, targeting Capital One, Southwest Airlines and Elon Musk, among others.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed reporting for this story.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Cheap Stock Picks\n\nTech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as a problem. I view it as they\u2019ve won. They\u2019ve won the technology side. They\u2019ve won on the business-model side, and they\u2019re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.\u201d\n\nOverall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage company. Over the past 12 months, the stock has declined by almost 13%. Despite this, the company remains a favorite among investors due to its dominant market position. It owns Frito-Lay, the largest producer of salty snacks globally, Pepsi, the second-largest nonalcoholic beverage brand, and Quaker Oats, a major player in the packaged food sector. With a vast global brand presence, strong marketing and innovation capabilities, and a solid financial base, the company is well-established as an industry leader and consolidator. For instance, its recent acquisition of Siete Foods strengthens its presence in the Mexican-American food market, particularly in salty snacks and packaged foods. Overall, PepsiCo is a resilient and well-established name in the consumer staples sector, known for its stability even during economic downturns.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) reported robust earnings, with revenues exceeding $23.3 billion. Despite encountering obstacles like weaker performance in North America, product recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and geopolitical challenges in certain international markets, the company demonstrated resilience. Through effective cost management, it maintained profitability while making strategic investments to reinforce its market position.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\u2019s dividend history also makes it a reliable option for income investors. The company announced that it plans to distribute $8.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks in 2024. Moreover, the company is a Dividend King, with 52 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. It offers a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.74%, as of January 15.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024 showed that 58 hedge funds held stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $4.44 billion.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 13th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

Increasing consumer demand for healthy refreshing snack products such as melons, especially during summer, is driving the growth. Pre-packaged melon products and the increased awareness of healthy eating are promoting the demand for the product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing Health Consciousness\n\n\n\nIncreasing trends toward healthier eating are also a growth driver for the U.S. melon market. Melons, especially watermelon and cantaloupe, have low calories, high in vitamins A and C, and are very watery, thus a good choice for healthy-conscious consumers. With more people focusing on balanced diets and hydration, demand for nutritious and refreshing fruits like melons increases. The increased awareness of the health benefits associated with fruit consumption has led to increased melon consumption across the country. May 2022-May, a focus on accelerating innovation for new product development led greenhouse company Pure Flavor has unveiled fresh produce's first greenhouse grown melons to be known by the brand name SolaraT.\n\n\n\nConvenient and Ready-to-Eat Products\n\n\n\nConvenience contributes significantly to the U.S. market's growth of melons. Customers continue looking for fruit pieces, fruits prepared and ready-to-eat but convenient products and with no trade-offs to the quality. Retailers have come up with convenient packaging of melons, like pre-cut portions, salads, and fruit bowls ready to serve. This has made melons easier to consume and more appealing for busy individuals, families, and even those in need of healthy snacks quickly.\n\nThe market for pre-packaged melons is expected to grow even more as demand for convenience food rises. December 2023: Prepared & Ready. Fresh. Ready. To-Order Meals From Blue Apron. Pre-packaged, not frozen, but individually made nutritionist-approved dishes ready to eat in mere minutes with quality ingredients provided for meals without preparation needed.\n\n\n\nSummer Popularity for Melons\n\n\n\nSummer's always melon season in America. Hydration helps consumers survive that American summertime hot heat while also having a refreshing appeal by its high water content of making them super popular in seasons like these. Consumers tend to gravitate towards light, calm, and hydrating fruits as temperatures rise. Watermelon, in particular, is a seasonal favorite for outdoor events, picnics, and barbecues. This seasonal spike in demand for melons during warmer weather boosts their overall market consumption.\n\nAs climate patterns shift, even increased demand in off-season periods can drive overall market growth, mainly through improved distribution and storage technologies. According to the National Watermelon Promotion Board (NWPB), per capita consumption of watermelon in the United States has reached nearly 16.9 pounds in 2023, up from 15.5 pounds in 2022.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the United States Melon Market\n\nSeasonality and Supply Fluctuations\n\n\n\nOne of the major challenges in the U.S. melon market is that melon cultivation is seasonal. Melons, especially watermelon and cantaloupe, are mainly grown in specific regions and have a short growing season. This results in supply fluctuations, with peak harvest periods concentrated in summer. Outside of these seasons, there is a reliance on imports, which can lead to higher prices and lower availability. These supply inconsistencies can affect market prices and consumer access to fresh melons, limiting year-round consumption and impacting overall market stability.\n\n\n\nWeather and Climate Dependency\n\n\n\nThe US melon market is highly weather sensitive, since melons grow only under a very specific climatic condition. Any extreme climatic conditions such as drought, floods, or temperature could be bad news for crops. Melon yields may drop because of this kind of weather condition. The unseasonable cold temperatures or heat wave would cause the quantity and quality of melons to decrease. These environmental factors make the production of melons vulnerable to climate change, which may lead to price volatility and unreliable supply chains, thereby impeding the market's steady growth.\n\n\n\nUnited States Melon Production Market\n\n\n\nUnited States melon production market is a significant segment of the agricultural industry, with key crops being watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew. The main melon-producing states are California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona, with the right climate for growing melons. Watermelon is the most widely cultivated melon, followed by cantaloupe. Because of their refreshing nature and health benefits, the high domestic demand for fresh melons, especially in summer, fuels the market.\n\n\n\nWatermelons are mainly grown by eight states on more than 100,000 acres annually (USDA-NASS 2022). Most of the fruits are grown in California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas, where Florida has the highest domestic production. However, the production depends on seasonal factors and weather conditions that make supply susceptible to changes. The industry also heavily depends on farming techniques, efficient irrigation, and transportation systems that deliver fresh melons to markets year-round as consumer demand grows. Despite challenges such as climate change, the U.S. melon production market continues to thrive.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, watermelon accounted for more than half of U.S. melon availability, double the share of every other melon variety combined. Estimated pounds available in 2022: Melons, a slice of which belonged to other varieties, had been about 21.1 for every person of the American people; of this quantity watermelon comprised 14.1 pounds, cantaloupe 5.3 pounds, and honeydew 1.6 pounds.\n\n\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 95 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $1.25 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $2.02 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 5.4% Regions Covered United States\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

Reliance Industries with this strategic move is planning to give stiff competition to Coke and Pepsi in Middle Eastern markets.\n\nCampa Cola makers have adopted the strategy of cheap prices and high trade margins. This strategy has destroyed the monopoly of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in India. Campa Cola has disrupted soft drink market. According to several reports, the strategy of Reliance Industries to enter the Middle Eastern markets will be the same.\n\n---Advertisement---\n\nIsha Ambani is the person responsible for Reliance\u2019s FMCG and retail divisions. She presented the company\u2019s global ambitions amidst the 2023 annual general meeting. The plans were announced to expand Campa Cola\u2019s reach to international markets beginning with Middle East and Africa.\n\nReliance Industries Strategy\n\nReliance Industries is seriously considering partnerships that will help them establish local bottling facilities. These partnerships will assist the company in key markets such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, the company is counting on imports from India for supply presently.\n\n---Advertisement---\n\nAnother advantage of the local bottling base is that it will boost the company\u2019s plans to venture into adjacent African markets. Campa Cola\u2019s entry into Africa is a given keeping in mind the Middle East\u2019s geographic proximity to the continent.\n\nExpansion Reason\n\nReliance Consumer Products (RCPL). The FMCG arm of the company is aiming to build on the wave of anti-American sentiment in West Asia. According to reports the calls to boycott American products stems out of US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict. This has decreased the sales of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in several Gulf nations. Local consumers are now in great numbers switching over to alternative brands creating demand.\n\nInitial drink consignments exported from India have reached retail stores in Bahrain. The company is planning to expand to countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia in a phased manner. The company aims to progressively scale up its availability across the region before the summer season.\n\nALSO READ: Electronics Exports of India Hits 24-month High: Outpaces Engineering & Petroleum Sectors \u2013 Details Inside",

Critics are already saying they will be switching to Pepsi...\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are many things Donald Trump is known for, but a healthy lifestyle when it comes to food is not one of them.\n\nThe soon-to-be 47th president has a documented love of McDonalds and reportedly had a button in the Oval Office of the White House during his first term, a small knob which signaled he wanted Diet Coke. He apparently consumed around 12 per day.\n\nNow, ahead of his second inauguration on Monday, it has been revealed that the Coca-Cola Company has issued a commemorative bottle of Diet Coke to mark the event.\n\nTrump\u2019s deputy director of communications, Margo Martin, shared a picture on X, captioned with: \u201cTonight, President Trump received the first ever Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle from the Chairman and CEO of Coca Cola Company, James Quincey.\u201d\n\nThe bottle of Diet Coke has a label with a drawing of the White House and the phrase \u201cThe Inauguration of the President of the United States\u201d and Trump\u2019s name and the date of Monday\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe bottle came in a box with a letter stating: \u201cFounded 126 years ago in Atlanta, Georgia, The Coca-Cola Company takes great pride in producing hundreds of brands that people enjoy. Along with our 60+ independent bottling partners, the Coca-Cola system generates $58+ billion in U.S. economic activity annually and supports more than 860,000 jobs in the United States.\u201d\n\nA Coca-Cola representative told Newsweek that the meeting between Quincey and Trump \u201creinforces our commitment to strengthening America\u2019s economic future.\u201d\n\nThe letter from the company also stated that Coca Cola is \u201cproud to continue our decades-long tradition of celebrating the US presidential inauguration with a commemorative bottle\u201d.\n\nIndeed, the company has made these commemorative bottles for each incoming president since 2005. Trump\u2019s bottle, however, is the first one that is Diet.\n\nThe commemorative bottle of Diet Coke X\n\nCritics have already reacted to the gift, with many bemoaning that Coca-Cola is now hypocritically falling in line with the new Trump era, despite the company condemning Trump and his supporters following the January 6 Capitol riot in 2021.\n\nThe company said at the time that the assault on the Capitol was \u201can offense to the ideals of American democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump as often blasted Coca-Cola and in 2021, called for a boycott of Coca-Cola and other companies opposing reforms in Georgia\u2019s voting laws that were signed by the state\u2019s Republican governor.\n\nFaced with this reversal in relations between Trump and Coca-Cola, Trump critics took the opportunity to declare they\u2019d be switching to Pepsi going forward.\n\nSo, has the age-old Coke vs Pepsi rivalry been reignited?\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that social media users have compared Coca-Cola to other companies like Amazon, Walmart and Meta, the parent company to Facebook and Instagram, who have also taken steps to align themselves with the upcoming Trump administration. In Meta\u2019s case, it has rolled back its fact-checking initiatives, content moderation policies, and has removed DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programmes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMark Zuckerberg, like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.\n\nSo, Coke or Pepsi?\n\nThe latter currently seems to have the upper hand \u2013 making their current slogan \u201cThat\u2019s what I like\u201d even more appropriate. But at the end of the day, does it matter? The alarming decision to ditch fact-checking initiatives - that matters.",

Recently the artisanal food company reached a significant milestone that will help them do just that.\n\nIn December, \u00a1Ya Oaxaca! won PepsiCo\u2019s Greenhouse Accelerator Program: Juntos Crecemos Edition. The achievement comes with a $100,000 grant and marks a pivotal moment in the brand\u2019s journey to influence how Americans experience authentic mole sauces, adobos, and salsas.\n\n\u00a1Ya Oaxaca! co-founder and CEO Azul Couzens, left, and Operations Director Jesse Ulrich accept the Greenhouse Accelerator award at PepsiCo headquarters.\n\n\u00a1Ya Oaxaca! co-founder and CEO Azul Couzens, left, and Operations Director Jesse Ulrich accept the Greenhouse Accelerator award at PepsiCo headquarters.\n\n\u201cWhen you're in start-up mode, every day is a blur of activity to maintain momentum. The expertise and mentorship from the Greenhouse Accelerator Program: Juntos Crecemos Edition allowed us to rise out of the day-to-day of running the business to think critically about where we are, where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re headed, and most importantly, how to get there,\u201d says Azul Couzens, CEO and co-founder of \u00a1Ya Oaxaca! \u201cNow we have the structure to stay focused on what is most important to continue growing.\u201d\n\nThe Greenhouse Accelerator aims to foster the growth of high-potential consumer packaged food and beverage companies inspired by Hispanic flavors and cultures that are better for people and the planet. Over five months, eight finalists received $20,000 grants and one-on-one coaching from PepsiCo experts in areas like R&D, supply chain, design and brand strategy. \u00a1Ya Oaxaca! applied these learnings to grow its revenue an impressive 350%, expand retail distribution by 200%, improve operational efficiencies and increase gross margins.\n\nRelated:Expo East Pitch Slam profile: \u00a1Ya Oaxaca! creates authentic mole sauces for Americans\n\n\u201cPepsiCo\u2019s experts guided us in refining our product mix and channel assortment by focusing on the consumer\u2019s perspective,\u201d explains Couzens. \u201cThey challenged us to think beyond just creating great-tasting products to consider how we can build around specific consumer use occasions.\u201d\n\nAzul Couzens, co-founder and CEO of \u00a1Ya Oaxaca!, celebrates the brand\u2019s NEXTY Award for Best New Pantry Food at Natural Products Expo West 2024.\n\n\u00a1Ya Oaxaca! evolved from Trilling\u2019s beloved Seasons of My Heart Cooking School, located northwest of Oaxaca City, Mexico, where she\u2019s taught visitors how to make traditional Mexican dishes since 1993. In 2021, she co-founded \u00a1Ya Oaxaca! with her son Azul Couzens.\n\nSupported by her other two sons\u2014Jesse Ulrich, who manages operations, and Kaelin Ulrich, who manages research and recipe development\u2014Trilling created a line of mole sauces inspired by traditional Mexican cooking, family recipes and Oaxaca\u2019s local artist community. Since then, the product line has expanded to include adobo, salsa and escabeche made with ingredients like organic criollo corn, wild garlic, smoked chiles and house-made chocolate. All of \u00a1Ya Oaxaca!\u2019s products are gluten-free, vegan, contain no artificial colors or preservatives, and are made from Mexico-sourced ingredients. This approach ensures the flavors remain authentic while supporting local farmers, producers, and communities.\n\nRelated:NEXTY Awards Prom Night: See the winners!\n\nThe PepsiCo grant will fuel \u00a1Ya Oaxaca!\u2019s plans to scale operations in 2025 through an expanded in-store demo program and broader retail distribution.

PepsiCo has recently joined the race to acquire a stake in Haldiram Snacks Food, following Temasek and Alpha Wave Global, who have already submitted formal proposals last month. These bidders are currently engaged in detailed discussions with the Aggarwal family, seeking to purchase a 10-15% stake in India's premier ethnic snacks and convenience foods manufacturer.Senior executives from PepsiCo's New York headquarters have recently initiated preliminary discussions with the Aggarwal family members regarding a potential minority stake acquisition.According to an ET report, these discussions remain in early stages and may not necessarily result in a deal. The US parent company will spearhead any potential investment, with the Indian division playing a relatively minor role in the process.The Aggarwal family is seeking their first external investor, with expectations of a company valuation between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.PepsiCo, which produces Lay's chips, Kurkure salty snacks and Doritos nacho chips, currently faces strong competition in India's snacks sector.The market has witnessed significant growth in regional and direct-to-consumer snack manufacturers. The ethnic snacks segment, while dominated by major players like Haldiram, Bikanerwala, Balaji, and listed entities such as Bikaji Foods, Gopal Snacks and Prataap Snacks, remains highly fragmented with numerous regional competitors. These local manufacturers typically offer products at lower prices, maintain direct distribution networks, and provide higher profit margins to retailers.RJ Corp-owned Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL) manages the majority of PepsiCo's beverages operations, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7Up, Slice and Tropicana. \"With beverages bottling outsourced to VBL, PepsiCo India 's core focus is snacks, a market where it is no longer as dominant as it used to be,\" said an executive.In western snacks like chips and nachos, PepsiCo maintains a 24% market share leadership. However, it has limited presence in traditional Indian snacks such as namkeen, bhujiya, and chana chur. The organisation sees potential growth through collaboration with Haldiram, with both snacks and beverage divisions being comparable in size.The company's current India leader, Jagrut Kotecha, was selected specifically for his extensive experience in PepsiCo's snacks division, aiming to strengthen the snacks business nationally.According to Registrar of Companies (RoC) data accessed via Tofler, PepsiCo India Holdings recorded consolidated revenue of Rs 5,954.16 crore from April to December 2023. During this period, its snacks division, comprising Kurkure, Lays, Doritos and Quaker, generated Rs 4,763.29 crore.Haldiram Snack Foods achieved revenue of Rs 12,800 crore in FY24, substantially exceeding PepsiCo's figures. The company produces and sells 500 varieties of snacks, namkeen, sweets, ready to eat and pre-mixed food items.PepsiCo's acquisition history includes Uncle Chipps from Amrit Agro Ltd in 2000, when its snacks division operated as Frito Lay. Uncle Chipps now serves primarily tier 2 and 3 markets as a value brand. The company launched Doritos nachos, its multi-billion brand, in 2016-17 within the western snacks category.Industry analysts suggest Haldiram would likely prefer selling completely rather than accepting a minority investment from PepsiCo. Previous discussions with Mondelez, Kellogg's and Tata Consumer ended without agreement. Earlier negotiations with former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi also proved unsuccessful.",

Key contenders Temasek and Alpha Wave Global, the latter also a late-stage bidder, are said to be in advanced talks with the Aggarwal family, the founders of India\u2019s largest ethnic snacks and convenience foods maker, having made firm offers last month for a 10-15% stake.Executives from PepsiCo headquarters in New York have initiated talks directly with members of the Aggarwal family for buying a minority stake in recent weeks. However, these are still exploratory and may not lead to a formal transaction, said the people cited. The funding will also be led by the US parent. The Indian unit\u2019s leadership is said to be playing a smaller role.The Aggarwals are expecting a valuation of Rs 85,000-90,000 crore as they seek to rope in an external investor for the first time.PepsiCo, the maker of Lay\u2019s chips, Kurkure salty snacks and Doritos nacho chips, has been facing intense competition in the domestic snacks market.There has been a rapid increase of regional players and direct-to-consumer snacks makers. Apart from Haldiram, Bikanerwala and Balaji, and listed companies Bikaji Foods, Gopal Snacks and Prataap Snacks, the ethnic snacks market is fragmented and teeming with regional players. Most of them charge less than national brands, have direct distribution and give higher retailer margins.PepsiCo\u2019s beverages business, which includes Pepsi, Mountain Dew and 7Up carbonated drinks, and Slice and Tropicana juice drinks, is managed almost entirely by RJ Corp-owned listed company Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL). \u201cWith beverages bottling outsourced to VBL, PepsiCo India\u2019s core focus is snacks, a market where it is no longer as dominant as it used to be,\u201d said an executive.PepsiCo leads in western snacks\u2014chips and nachos\u2014with about 24% market share.

Its snacks and beverage business are of similar size.PepsiCo\u2019s current head in India, Jagrut Kotecha, was handpicked for his decades-old experience in PepsiCo\u2019s snacks business, with the focus on bolstering the snacking business in the country.PepsiCo didn\u2019t respond to queries. Haldiram Snacks Food chief executive KK Chutani said he had no comment to offer.PepsiCo India Holdings reported consolidated revenue of Rs 5,954.16 crore for the nine-month period of April to December 2023, according to Registrar of Companies (RoC) data accessed by financial intelligence platform Tofler. For the same period, PepsiCo\u2019s snacks business, which includes Kurkure, Lays, Doritos and Quaker, reported revenue of Rs 4,763.29 crore.Haldiram Snack Foods reported revenue of Rs 12,800 crore in FY24, well over twice the size of PepsiCo. It manufactures and distributes 500 types of snacks, namkeen, sweets, ready to eat and pre-mixed food.\u201cWith the merger of its north and west operations, Haldiram has market dominance in ethnic snacks,\u201d said one of the executives cited above. \u201cFor PepsiCo, even a minority stake with Haldiram will give it huge access to distribution strength pan-India and a foothold in massive bandwidth in ethnic snacks.\u201dPepsiCo\u2019s past acquisitions in snacks include Uncle Chipps, a brand of potato chips it acquired from Amrit Agro Ltd in 2000. At that time, PepsiCo India\u2019s snacks division was called Frito Lay. However, Uncle Chipps is predominantly distributed in tier 2 and 3 markets as a price warrior brand. In 2016-17, PepsiCo India introduced Doritos nachos, its multi-billion brand, which operates in the western snacks space.In its last reported earnings for the July-September 2024 quarter, PepsiCo said its India business witnessed high single-digit growth by unit volume both in beverages and snacks. PepsiCo does not provide country-specific numbers in its quarter earnings.\u201cThere are pockets of strength in international (business),\u201d PepsiCo chairman Ramon Laguarta had said during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call in October. \u201cThere are markets like Southeast Asia and India that are growing nicely.\u201dIn the June quarter, sales volume for PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay North America business dropped 4%, the company said. The snacks-and-soda giant reported a small bump in revenues and a 2% drop in sales volume in the June quarter globally.Market research company IMARC Group said in a report that the Indian snacks market was estimated at Rs 42,694.9 crore in 2023, and is expected to more than double to Rs 95,521.8 crore by 2032.Some analysts said Haldiram is unlikely to sell a minority stake to PepsiCo and instead seek a premium for selling out. In the past, it\u2019s been in talks with Mondelez, Kellogg\u2019s and Tata Consumer for a sale, but eventually walked away. Even PepsiCo\u2019s former CEO Indra Nooyi held talks with the family for an investment, but that too did not yield any result.\u201cIf the family at this stage decide to open the doors to strategics, then they will run a full process and seek competitive bids,\u201d said the CEO of a homegrown snacks company. \u201cEven at $10-12 billion valuation, for a business and brand like Haldiram, there will be enough takers. But knowing them, they will then seek an even higher valuation. We have seen how the cookie crumbled in the past.\u201dAs reported by ET on January 8, Temasek is leading in the discussions to buy a minority stake for upwards of $1 billion. On December 7, ET was the first to report that three rival groups had submitted binding offers for a 10-15% stake in the company.

            "content": "PepsiCo has joined the fray to buy a minority stake in Haldiram Snacks, India's largest ethnic snacks manufacturer, after Temasek and Alpha Wave Global. While the latter two are said to be in advanced talks with the Aggarwal family, who founded Haldiram, PepsiCo's approach is still at the exploratory stage. According to sources, senior executives from the New York headquarters of PepsiCo have started talking directly with the Aggarwal family in recent weeks. The proposed investment would mark PepsiCo's first major foray into India's ethnic snacks market, which is growing rapidly and is a competitive space.\n\nThe Aggarwal family has pegged a valuation of Rs 85,000-90,000 crore for Haldiram Snacks and is looking to attract external investors for the first time. While Temasek and Alpha Wave Global submitted binding offers last month for a 10-15% stake, PepsiCo\u2019s late entry signals its strategic intent to bolster its position in the Indian market. Industry insiders noted that PepsiCo\u2019s global headquarters would lead the funding for the potential deal, with its Indian subsidiary playing a smaller role.\n\nPepsiCo, whose brands include Lay's chips, Kurkure, and Doritos, has felt the heat from increasing competition in India's burgeoning snacks market. Regional players like Bikanerwala, Balaji, and Bikaji Foods have found a strong ground with ethnic snack offerings at significantly lower prices while fetching higher retailer margins. Although PepsiCo holds a 24% market share in the western snacking segment, it has failed to penetrate the ethnic snacking category comprising namkeen, bhujiya, and chana chur, thereby depriving the company of leveraging this large opportunity. This makes the right synergies with Haldiram interesting, where the vendor's ethnic snacking dominance could help PepsiCo gain an extensive distribution network and, more importantly, first mover advantage in a rapidly growing segment.\n\nAccording to the reports, Haldiram Snacks, in FY24, had earned a revenue of Rs 12,800 crore; this is double the snacks business of PepsiCo India, with Rs 4,763.29 crore for nine months up to December 2023. 500 varieties of snacks, namkeen, sweets, and ready-to-eat meals compose its vast product portfolio. The firm has also strengthened its presence across northern and western India by consolidating its operations in the ethnic snack market.\n\nThe Indian snacks market, valued at Rs 42,694.9 crore in 2023, is projected to more than double to Rs 95,521.8 crore by 2032, according to market research firm IMARC Group. Growth factors include increasing disposable incomes, evolving consumer preferences, and the popularity of regional flavors. Analysts say that market leadership and wide distribution networks are making Haldiram's an attractive target for international giants such as PepsiCo that want to grow in India.\n\nPepsiCo's current India head, Jagrut Kotecha, has been working in the snacks business and has been working to strengthen the company's presence in the country. PepsiCo's snacks and beverage divisions are comparable in size, and the company sees significant growth opportunities in aligning with a market leader like Haldiram. That way, a collaboration might also facilitate the offset of difficulties PepsiCo faces in its snacks business outside of North America. The international snack business showed a 4% decline in volume sales within North America for the June quarter of 2024.\n\nHowever, industry experts remain skeptical. In the past, Haldiram has approached multiple international players-such as Mondelez and Kellogg's besides Tata Consumer- but still has not delivered one yet. Even the former CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, had meetings with the Aggarwal family, but those discussions did not culminate in a deal. Analysts feel that if the Aggarwals decide to take on a strategic investor, they would likely look for competitive bids to maximize the valuation.\n\nCurrently, Temasek is the frontrunner in the race. It has reportedly submitted a winning bid of more than $1 billion for a minority stake. In December 2023, three other groups consisting of Blackstone-led Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, along with GIC of Singapore and Temasek-Bain and Alpha Wave - had submitted binding offers. After that, Bain Capital dropped out of the bidding process.\n\nThe Aggarwal family may find it difficult to get investors to pay a high valuation, as proposed by Haldiram. Some analysts feel that the Aggarwals might finally agree to sell the business in its entirety rather than settling for a minority stake. \"Even at a valuation of $10-12 billion, there will be enough takers for Haldiram\", said the CEO of a domestic snacks company. However, the Aggarwals are known to demand a premium, which has derailed similar talks in the past.\n\nFor PepsiCo, a minority stake in Haldiram represents a strategic opportunity to strengthen its presence in India, a market identified as a key growth driver by the company\u2019s global leadership. During its third-quarter earnings call in October, PepsiCo Chairman Ramon Laguarta highlighted the robust growth in markets like Southeast Asia and India. Snacks and beverages witnessed high single-digit growth in the India business for the July-September 2024 quarter, indicating its significant position in PepsiCo's global portfolio.\n\nThe company has a history of strategic acquisitions in India, with the most notable being the purchase of Uncle Chipps, a popular potato chips brand, back in 2000. Despite dominating the western snacks segment, it hasn't been able to do so in the ethnic snacks category, where Haldiram remains the undisputed leader. As the company grapples with mounting competition in the snacks market, especially from regional players who offer products that better cater to local tastes, this deal may seem particularly appealing.",

The company is in talks with the Aggarwal family which owns Haldiram.\n\nAs per a report in the Economic Times, with PepsiCo bidding for a stake in Haldiram, the Indian snacks market is buzzing with competition as global investment firms Temasek and Alpha Wave Global are also looking for a bigger share in this segment.\n\nThe discussion with the Aggarwal family is still in the early stage and is not quite necessary that it would eventually result in a successful deal, the report said citing the executives.\n\nUnlike its Indian counterpart, the funding for this stake acquisition will reportedly be driven by PepsiCo\u2019s US-based parent company.\n\nTemasek and Alpha Wave Global have submitted binding offers for a 10-15% stake in Haldiram, entering an advanced stage of negotiations last month. Temasek is reportedly leading the discussions, with a potential investment exceeding $1 billion, according to reports.\n\nHaldiram, a market leader in ethnic snacks, boasts a portfolio of over 500 products, including namkeen, sweets, ready-to-eat meals, and pre-mixed food items. The company reported revenue of Rs 12,800 crore in FY24, more than double PepsiCo India's snacks revenue of Rs 4,763.29 crore during April-December 2023.\n\nPepsiCo, which dominates the western snacks segment with brands like Lays, Kurkure, and Doritos, holds a 24% market share in that category. However, its presence in traditional Indian snacks, such as namkeen and bhujiya, remains minimal. Acquiring a stake in Haldiram could provide PepsiCo with a strategic entry into the fast-growing ethnic snacks segment.\n\nThe Indian snacks market, valued at Rs 42,694.9 crore in 2023 (IMARC Group), is projected to reach Rs 95,521.8 crore by 2032. Despite its growth, the market remains fragmented, with regional players like Balaji, Bikanerwala, and Bikaji Foods posing stiff competition to larger players. These local brands often compete with lower prices, direct distribution networks, and better retailer margins, posing challenges for giants like PepsiCo.",

            "content": "CEOs don't handle the day-to-day grind of a company, they think about the big picture. That's what PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) CEO Ramon Laguarta was focused on in the second half of 2024. Two big recent announcements highlight the potential for the future at this giant consumer staples company and show why Dividend King PepsiCo has been such a strong competitor for so long.\n\nWhat news did PepsiCo serve up?\n\nPepsiCo's namesake is a soda. While beverages are a very important part of the company's business, it is not the only one that investors need to watch. In fact, it might not even be the most important. PepsiCo is, after all, number two in beverages but a solid number one in salty snacks with its Frito Lay business. It was Frito Lay that offered the biggest news in the back half of 2024.\n\nThe most recent announcement was PepsiCo's acquisition of the 50% of Sabra that it didn't already own. Sabra makes dips and spreads, which you could classify as packaged foods (where PepsiCo competes via its Quaker Oats business), but which probably fits more closely with salty snacks. Sabra is best known for its namesake hummus, however PepsiCo is likely to invest heavily in innovation and try to expand to new areas with the well-recognized brand.\n\nAt $400 million, the Sabra deal isn't a huge one for a consumer staples giant like PepsiCo, but it does offer solid growth opportunities.\n\nA bigger transaction was announced a few months before the Sabra deal, when PepsiCo agreed to buy Siete Foods for $1.2 billion. Siete is a Mexican-American brand that makes products that range from chips to packaged foods, hitting multiple areas of the PepsiCo portfolio. The growth opportunity here is probably larger than the one provided by Sabra given that PepsiCo can expand Siete's reach by simply plugging the brand into its vast distribution network. Innovative new products and brand extensions will add to that opportunity over the longer term.\n\nPepsiCo is building for the future\n\nTo be fair, PepsiCo isn't hitting on all cylinders today. And investors are reacting as you might expect, by selling the stock. Now off by around 25% or so from its all-time high in 2023, PepsiCo stock is in its own personal bear market. The dividend yield, notably, is near the highest levels in recent history at around 3.8%. In many ways the stock looks like it has been placed on the deep discount rack.\n\nHere's the thing, PepsiCo is a historically well run company. That fact is highlighted by its status as a Dividend King, with 52 consecutive annual dividend increases. You don't build a record like that by accident, it requires consistently strong performance in good periods and bad ones. That last bit is the important part when you think about the Sabra and Siete acquisitions. Despite the headwinds PepsiCo is facing right now the company is still investing for the future.\n\nIf history is any guide, PepsiCo will shift as needed to get its existing business back on track. That's what good companies do. Exceptional companies, meanwhile, take the additional step of always (no matter what is happening) looking for ways to grow over the long term. That's what PepsiCo's CEO was doing when he green lighted the Sabra and Siete deals.\n\nThese transactions also highlight another important fact about PepsiCo. It has the financial strength and size to act as an industry consolidator. That means it doesn't have to create everything from the ground up, it can snatch up \"good ideas\" via acquisitions like the ones that were just announced.\n\nPepsiCo is a long-term investment\n\nThere are good reasons why PepsiCo's stock is in a funk right now, highlighted by relatively weak financial results. That happens to even the best run companies from time to time. The big story here is that, despite the tough stretch, PepsiCo is still working to position itself for long-term growth. If you are a long-term investor, given the historically high yield on offer, you might want to consider adding PepsiCo to your portfolio today. While the earnings news isn't fantastic, the acquisition news is pretty darn exciting.",

Otherwise, prompts return incorrect information because the model doesn\u2019t understand the context around the inquiries submitted.\n\nRamakrishan has been exploring several types of agentic AI architecture, finally having a recent breakthrough with Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, which didn't have the reasoning limitations other models had. Finding the right solution was a balance between speed, accuracy, and cost, he said.\n\n\"If you choose a model that's not smart enough, you'll encounter a lot of issues. We've experimented with so many models, and while the success was increasing, it was not there yet,\" said Ramakrishan.\n\nBuilding in Governance Strategies\n\nAs with any AI discussion, panelists emphasized the importance of building out a strong foundation before moving on to implementation.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking how many people are going out there using ChatGPT, potentially giving away secure information,\u201d said Thylstrup, also speaking on the necessity to get a foundation of clean data settled first.\n\n\u201cGarbage in, garbage out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really, really have to take a step back before we get right in there and say, \u2018Okay, we're going to train this model, we're going to do all this stuff.\u2019 Because we need to be able to have clean, good data to be able to feed the model, to be able to train, or be able to produce good automation.\u201d",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other best dividend king stocks to invest in now.\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks has been a focal point for investors for several years. The attractive income generated from these stocks motivates many to invest. Among these, dividend growth stocks stand out, as they offer the potential for increasing income over time, which is highly appealing. In the US, numerous companies have consistently raised their dividends for over five decades, earning them the prestigious title of Dividend Kings.\n\nAnalysts have long supported dividend stocks due to their historically robust performance. Kirsten Cabacungan, an investment strategist at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, has highlighted several reasons to consider investing in these stocks. She pointed out that the income generated by dividend stocks can assist investors in meeting their liquidity needs. In addition, dividend-focused investments have shown a tendency to reduce volatility and mitigate losses during market downturns. Cabacungan particularly emphasizes the value of dividend growth stocks in this context. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cCompanies that have consistently increased their dividends tend to be more stable, higher-quality businesses, which historically have weathered downturns and are more likely to have the ability to pay dividends consistently.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, dividend stocks lagged behind the broader market, but their future remains promising. Analysts are optimistic about a rebound, as cash flow remains a key priority for investors. Capital Group has advised looking for opportunities in overlooked dividend-paying companies, such as pharmaceutical firms overshadowed by the focus on weight loss treatments, as well as utilities and select banks. In addition, dividend growth stocks with substantial yields continue to attract interest. Companies offering dividends alongside strong balance sheets and appealing yields can deliver steady income, cushion against market downturns, and foster solid investment growth. A report from ProShares noted that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has historically outperformed the broader market with less volatility. For example, a $10,000 investment in May 2005 could have grown to more than $61,000 by March 2023.\n\nAlso read: 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nInvestor preferences have led many US companies to increase and sustain their dividends in 2024. Financial experts anticipate continued dividend growth in 2025. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, predicts an average dividend increase of around 8% for the current year. He expects another record payout in 2025, estimated at approximately $685 billion, compared to the projected $630 billion for 2024. Silverblatt attributes this growth to record earnings, anticipated future earnings, declining interest rates, strong employment, and overall economic growth.\n\nIn addition, the broader market\u2019s dividend yield has recently hit a 20-year low, dipping below 1.19%, well below the long-term average of 4.3%. As interest rates rise on risk-free options like Treasuries, companies are increasingly aware of the competition for yield. In response, many are boosting their dividends or starting to offer them for the first time. Notably, several major tech firms began paying dividends in 2024, indicating their intention to position themselves as value investments within the traditionally high-growth tech sector. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend kings to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed the Dividend Kings companies and selected the ten stocks that were most favored by hedge funds in the third quarter of 2024, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge fund investments, starting with the lowest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nAn American food, snack, and beverages company, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend kings. The company posted strong earnings in the third quarter of 2024, with revenues amounting to over $23.3 billion. Despite facing challenges such as weaker performance in North America, product recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and geopolitical issues in some international markets, the company showed resilience. By effectively managing costs, it maintained profitability while continuing to make strategic investments to strengthen its market position.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has fallen by nearly 13% in the past 12 months. However, the company remained the investors\u2019 favorite due to its strong market position. It owns Frito-Lay, the world\u2019s largest salty snack producer, Pepsi, the second-largest nonalcoholic beverage brand, and Quaker Oats, a key player in the packaged food industry. With its extensive global brand presence, strong marketing and innovation capabilities, and solid financial foundation, the company is well-established as an industry leader and consolidator. For example, its recent acquisition of Siete Foods strengthens its foothold in the Mexican-American food market, covering salty snacks and packaged foods. Essentially, PepsiCo is a robust player in the consumer staples sector, known for its resilience during economic downturns.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has adjusted its forecast for organic revenue growth, now anticipating a modest increase in the low single digits, compared to its previous estimate of around 4%. Despite this revision, the company remains committed to returning value to shareholders, with plans to distribute $8.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks in 2024. In addition, the company has a strong track record of increasing its payouts for 52 consecutive years. It offers a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.75%, as of January 13.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 58 hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database owned stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.44 billion. With over 7.8 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall, PEP ranks 8th on our list of best dividend king stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential for PEP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PEP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

The winning ad will be announced on Feb. 3, with its creators receiving $1 million.\n\n\u201cCrash the Super Bowl\u2019s legacy has always been about Doritos being fans of its fans,\u201d said Tina Mahal, svp of marketing at PepsiCo Foods North America. \u201cThese three final commercials remind us that when a brand puts the fate of its biggest advertising moment of the year in the fans\u2019 hands, incredible moments can happen.\u201d\n\nAt the Big Game on Feb. 9, Crash the Super Bowl will be about Doritos and the brand\u2019s \u201cFor the Bold\u201d tagline. But at this point in the campaign, it\u2019s about the brand\u2019s creator fanbase, and ADWEEK got exclusive access to the creators behind the three final ads to learn what led to their time in the Big Game spotlight:\n\nCharades\n\nAs Mahal said, \u201cIncredible moments can happen\u201d during Crash the Super Bowl.\u201d They just didn\u2019t happen for Mark Blitch a decade ago when he entered his first two ads in the contest. A producer for a non-profit video production company for nearly two decades, Blitch has enjoyed making short films with his friends and tried finding a bigger stage for them.\n\n\u201cWhile neither of them advanced, it was a wonderful experience, so when a friend told me that Doritos was bringing back the contest this year, I thought it could be fun to do it again,\u201d Blitch told ADWEEK.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Blitch hopes the third Crash the Super Bowl ad is the charm. PepsiCo/Frito-Lay\n\nThis time, he made it a bit more personal. Living in Wylie, Texas, married for 19 years, and the father of two children, Blitch put one of his sons in his contest entry, which features a father who can identify all the charades clues but finds the answer elusive.\n\n\u201cGame nights with family and friends have always been a cherished tradition for me, so I figured charades was the perfect, relatable game that everyone enjoys playing,\u201d Blitch said. \u201cEveryone has that one friend that just can\u2019t quite nail the answer.\u201d\n\nBarbershop\n\nZach Shenouda and Ryan Robinson met as high school sophomores in Orange County, California, and wanted to enter Crash the Super Bowl years ago. Both longtime filmmakers, they entered the University of Southern California\u2019s film program with the intent of making feature films and commercials\u2014drawing inspiration from Crash the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cWhen we found out that they were bringing it back this year, being in our senior year of college, we knew instantly that we were going to submit something,\u201d the two said in a statement to ADWEEK. \u201cWe got a late jump when starting the process, so we quickly came up with a concept and put together a dream team of our friends and fellow USC students.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Robinson, left, and Zach Shenouda have wanted this since high school. PepsiCo/Frito-Lay\n\nWith friends willing to produce the spot, Shenouda and Robinson wrapped it up within two weeks. They view their story of a young man getting a haircut\u2014only to be distracted and ultimately undone by the Dorito cheese on his barber\u2019s fingers\u2014as a chance to create opportunities within the industries they love.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both 22, and for millions of people to watch something we made would be unreal,\u201d they told ADWEEK. \u201cAs young artists, we believe we are just as capable of creating content that entertains, sells, and moves people. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get a step closer to chasing down our dreams.\u201d\n\nAbduction\n\nSlightly farther down the same career path, director Dylan Bradshaw and content creator Nate Norell are no less hopeful. Bradshaw moved from Columbus, Ohio, to Los Angeles in 2020 and has been working on a feature film while creating spots for CeraVe, Credit Karma, and others. Born in the Dominican Republic, Norell earned a cinema and media arts degree from Biola University, where he\u2019s turned his filmmaking skills into 6.2 million TikTok followers.\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Norell, left, and Dylan Bradshaw see opportunity in those chips. PepsiCo/Frito-Lay\n\nAs their ad, which features an unsuspecting snacker trying to wrest his Doritos from an alien tractor beam, makes its way in front of more than 100 million viewers, Bradshaw and Norell know the opportunity presented by the world\u2019s largest focus group.\n\n\u201cAfter countless sleepless nights and relentless effort, we\u2019re incredibly proud of the story we created to entertain both America and our loved ones,\u201d they told ADWEEK in a statement. \u201cBeing chosen as a top three finalist is an incredible honor that could open life-changing doors for our careers and make our younger selves proud.\u201d",

            "content": "Influencer agencies have embraced generative AI applications over the last year, as they seek to cut the time taken to arrange creator involvement in brand campaigns.\n\nThe client reaction to those solutions has been mixed. But in recent months, agencies operating in this space have found one area with clear application for AI tools \u2014 brand safety.\n\nCreator vetting can consume up to \u201ca few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the depth of analysis,\u201d said James Clarke, senior director, digital and social at PepsiCo Foods U.S. AI solutions aim to cut that time down to a matter of minutes.\n\nSetups differ between agencies, but most pushing ahead have combined AI-assisted search tools with generative AI applications that analyze the content of social posts. The systems are used to find creators that are a good fit for a brand and disqualify ones whose output crosses a client\u2019s guidelines.\n\nMarketers have grown more sensitive and cautious when it comes to choosing influencer partnerships in recent years. According to agency executives, guardrails might range from depictions of alcohol consumption, swearing or political speech. According to Aynsley Moffitt, director of product and growth at Open Influence, the \u201cmajority\u201d of clients limit vetting to the last six months of a creators\u2019 social activity, though some requested the company\u2019s help to preview up to five years\u2019 worth of content.\n\n\u201cThis comprehensive approach helps protect brand reputation while identifying creators who will be authentic advocates for our clients,\u201d Moffitt said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first line of defence,\u201d added Ben Jeffries, CEO and co-founder of creator agency Influencer.\n\nThe time saved might enable an agency to take on more briefs, or manage a higher number of creator relationships \u2014 allowing them to service larger campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an efficiency and scale play,\u201d Mae Karwowski, the founder of WPP creator agency Obviously, told Digiday. \u201cThe more time we can save on the \u2018first pass\u2019 of content or review of creators\u2019 profiles, the more time we can spend on strategy and optimization.\u201d\n\nDemand among advertisers for a time-saving AI solution to creator vetting \u2014 and the number of companies offering such a solution \u2014 is on the rise. Viral Nation has offered such a solution since 2023, but agencies aren\u2019t the only ones responding.\n\nLightricks, a software company that publishes software such as Facetune, is currently developing an AI-based creator vetting tool called SafeCollab. The company embarked on an open beta stage of development in November after working with six brand advertisers, including PepsiCo, through 2024.\n\nThe software uses both public social posts and access granted by creators that use Lightricks\u2019 Popular Pays influencer platform to scan and analyze an influencer\u2019s activity, said Corbett Drummey, vp of brand partnerships at Lightricks. Instagram and TikTok; X and YouTube were next to be tested.\n\n\u201cIt basically does a cursory Google internet search for them, summarizes it, and then it will summarize the [social] content that it indexed,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to PepsiCo\u2019s Clarke, the beta test using SafeCollab was one of several ongoing trials using AI for creator marketing.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging emerging technologies\u2026 we are confident that our teams will be able to move faster, operate more efficiently, and increase the effectiveness of creator vetting,\u201d he said in an email. Clarke declined to share the \u201cred lines\u201d PepsiCo used to disqualify creators.\n\nEach background report generated using the software costs several hundred dollars, Drummey said, though he declined to provide precise financials. Lightricks\u2019 product is intended as a self-service application for in-house teams, but agencies such as Influencer, Obviously and Open Influence each offer similar solutions for creator selection.\n\nCreator marketing agency Props offers a solution built with API access to Google\u2019s Gemini model, while Influencer has used a proprietary software built upon API access to ChatGPT to service its entire client roster since October.\n\nPrior to that point, Influencer\u2019s staffers would have to OK a creator by manually trawling back through their feeds. Influencer\u2019s Jeffries said the AI solution had helped speed up the work of clearing influencers for partnerships, monitoring campaign outputs, and informed the agency\u2019s post-campaign aftermath reports.\n\nAutomating creator vetting carries larger implications than just time savings, though. Large language models\u2019 habit of hallucinating responses, or of reproducing the biases of their original inputs, provide shaky foundations for decision-making.\n\nCreator marketing agency Props\u2019 solution, called Ollie, occasionally misinterprets the images it\u2019s asked to analyze, said Megan Matera, director of client success. In one example she gave, a creator had posted an image showing them drinking beer at a spa. \u201cOllie had flagged that as \u2018they were bathing in beer\u2019.\u201d Matera said.\n\nIn the case of SafeCollab, Corbett said his team was in the process of adding custom filters to its software, because its default settings flagged too many posts as risky. He said that clients had told the company that the result was \u201dtoo alarmist,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to change the way we present this stuff.\u201d\n\nTo guard against such issues, none of the applications built by Lightricks or its agency peers are able to make decisions over which creators get the green or red light. Instead, the systems flag problematic posts a human staffer to make a call over.\n\n\u201cWe always have our human team review all work done via AI,\u201d said Obviously\u2019s Karwowski. \u201cHaving experienced team members review any generated insights means we can provide real-time feedback when something seems off,\u201d added Open Influence\u2019s Moffitt.\n\nStill, there\u2019s an uncomfortable parallel between the rise of AI-assisted influencer selection \u2014 and brand marketers\u2019 over-use of programmatic brand safety filters, which have been credited with effectively defunding news organizations.\n\nWith influencer marketing becoming more and more \u201cprogrammatic\u201d \u2014 both in idea and execution \u2014 automating the task of creator vetting might risk repeating that harm, defunding creators whose activity is deemed to fall outside the realm of the acceptable without their knowing.\n\nJeffries suggested that human intervention in AI-powered selection systems would always be necessary.\n\n\u201cInfluence marketing is not just a media buy, it\u2019s also a creative buy,\u201d he concluded.",

The company has initiated discussions with the Aggarwal family, who own Haldiram, for a minority stake. This makes PepsiCo a late entrant in a competition that already includes global investment firms Temasek and Alpha Wave Global.\n\nExecutives quoted in the report said PepsiCo\u2019s leadership from its New York headquarters has started direct talks with the Aggarwal family in recent weeks. These discussions are still at an early stage and may not necessarily result in a deal. Unlike its Indian unit, the funding for this stake purchase will reportedly be led by PepsiCo\u2019s US-based parent company.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Aggarwal family is seeking a valuation of Rs 85,000-90,000 crore for Haldiram as they look to bring in an external investor for the first time.\n\nTemasek and Alpha Wave Global have already submitted binding offers for a 10-15% stake in Haldiram. These offers were made last month, putting the firms in an advanced stage of negotiations. Temasek is said to be leading the discussions, with reports suggesting a potential investment of over $1 billion as per the report.\n\nHaldiram is a market leader in ethnic snacks, offering over 500 types of products, including namkeen, sweets, ready-to-eat meals, and pre-mixed food items. The company reported revenue of Rs 12,800 crore in FY24, more than double that of PepsiCo\u2019s snacks business in India, which earned Rs 4,763.29 crore during the nine-month period from April to December 2023.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFor PepsiCo, which dominates the western snacks market with brands like Lay\u2019s, Kurkure, and Doritos, this move could provide a foothold in the fast-growing ethnic snacks segment. PepsiCo holds a 24% market share in western snacks but has limited presence in traditional Indian snacks like namkeen and bhujiya.\n\nThe Indian snacks market, worth Rs 42,694.9 crore in 2023 according to IMARC Group, is expected to grow to Rs 95,521.8 crore by 2032. However, it is highly fragmented, with numerous regional players such as Balaji, Bikanerwala, and Bikaji Foods competing alongside Haldiram. These regional brands often offer lower prices, direct distribution, and better retailer margins, challenging larger players like PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo India has been under pressure to expand its snacks division, especially as its beverages business is managed almost entirely by Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), a listed company under RJ Corp.\n\nPublished By: Sonu Vivek Published On: Jan 15, 2025",

(NASDAQ:PEP) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round.\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential.\n\n\u201cStocks don\u2019t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that\u2019s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it\u2019s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.\u201d\n\nIf every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it\u2019s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea \u201cbogus\u201d and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they\u2019re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that\u2019s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,\u201d Cramer added.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about these days.

            "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, PepsiCo's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 42% ownership\n\nUsing data from alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of PepsiCo, Inc. ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nAnd so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$198b last week after a 4.7% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 12% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called \u201cmarket movers\", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell PepsiCo, which might have negative implications on individual investors.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of PepsiCo, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that PepsiCo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PepsiCo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PepsiCo. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.9% and 4.1% of the stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of PepsiCo\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PepsiCo, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$265m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

This latest release combines Wild Cherry Pepsi's tart, fruity taste with a smooth, creamy finish, creating a drink that promises to stand out. The Wild Cherry & Cream flavor will be available in original and zero-sugar versions, catering to a broad range of preferences.\n\nAd\n\nThis announcement comes at an interesting time for soda fans, as it closely follows Coca-Cola\u2019s decision to discontinue its Cherry Vanilla soda in 2024. Pepsi\u2019s move has sparked curiosity, with many eager to see how the new flavor will measure up in a market familiar with cherry and cream blends.\n\nPepsi unveils new Wild Cherry & Cream flavor soda in full and zero-sugar options\n\nAd\n\nThe Wild Cherry & Cream flavor builds on Pepsi\u2019s popular Wild Cherry soda, introducing a creamy twist to its well-loved taste. Pepsi describes the new drink as a harmonious blend of sweet cherry and vanilla undertones, offering a rich and indulgent soda experience.\n\nPepsi fans can expect a beverage that\u2019s both familiar and refreshing. It\u2019s a flavor profile that might resonate with those who previously enjoyed Coca-Cola\u2019s Cherry Vanilla soda or similar drinks like Dr. Pepper\u2019s Strawberries & Cream. The creamy finish, in particular, is set to differentiate it from standard cherry-flavored sodas.\n\nAd\n\nAvailability and packaging\n\nThe new flavor will be available in different package sizes (Image via PepsiCo)\n\nStarting January 20, the Wild Cherry & Cream flavor will be widely available at retailers across the United States. Pepsi has confirmed that the drink will come in two formats:\n\nAd\n\n12-ounce cans : Available permanently in both regular and zero-sugar options.\n\n: Available permanently in both regular and zero-sugar options. 20-ounce bottles: Offered for a limited time, providing a convenient, on-the-go option for fans eager to try the new flavor.\n\nWhy this launch is significant\n\nExpand Tweet\n\nAd\n\nPepsi\u2019s introduction of the Wild Cherry & Cream flavor marks more than just a new product\u2014it highlights the brand\u2019s strategy to innovate within the competitive soda market. With Coca-Cola\u2019s Cherry Vanilla soda no longer available, Pepsi\u2019s latest release could fill a gap for fans of creamy, cherry-flavored beverages.\n\nThis move seemingly demonstrates Pepsi\u2019s continued focus on catering to evolving consumer tastes.\n\nHow it compares to other flavors\n\nAd\n\nThe Wild Cherry & Cream flavor isn\u2019t just a standalone product\u2014it\u2019s part of a broader trend in the soda industry of experimenting with nostalgic yet innovative flavors. While it may remind some of classic combinations like Cherry Vanilla, the creamy mouthfeel gives it a unique edge.\n\nFor those who enjoy Pepsi Wild Cherry, this new addition offers an elevated experience with its smoother finish. Meanwhile, cream soda fans might appreciate how the flavor blends sweetness and richness without being overly heavy.\n\nAd\n\nWith its blend of tart cherry and creamy vanilla, the drink aims to offer a fresh yet familiar taste to soda enthusiasts. Available in both full and zero-sugar options, it\u2019s clear that Pepsi is focusing on inclusivity and variety. As the Wild Cherry & Cream flavor joins Pepsi\u2019s permanent lineup, how consumers will respond remains to be seen.\n\n\u00d7 Feedback Why did you not like this content?

            "content": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 19% in three years, versus a market return of about 25%. Furthermore, it's down 18% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.\n\nAfter losing 4.7% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nAlthough the share price is down over three years, PepsiCo actually managed to grow EPS by 4.6% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\n\nAfter considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. But it's possible a look at other metrics will be enlightening.\n\nWe note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 6.3% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching PepsiCo more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:PEP Earnings and Revenue Growth January 11th 2025\n\nPepsiCo is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling PepsiCo stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, PepsiCo's TSR for the last 3 years was -11%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shares of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the energy drink maker already reeling from a 58 percent year-to-date decline, faced renewed pressure this month after a key analyst lowered its price target, citing concerns about sales and the impact of its distribution agreement with PepsiCo. This diminished valuation adds to the company\u2019s woes, which include slowing sales, revised financial forecasts, and a shareholder lawsuit alleging misleading disclosures.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Roth MKM, the investment bank, reduced its price target on Celsius shares to $38 from $40, according to Nasdaq.com. Nasdaq.com reported that analysts at Roth MKM pointed to anticipated higher promotional allowances in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year. Critically, Roth MKM also suggested that the revised distribution agreement with PepsiCo would have a greater-than-expected negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue, according to Nasdaq.com.\n\nThe analyst price target cut comes on the heels of a securities class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors about its operations and prospects.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating the allegations and urges investors in Celsius who purchased shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 29, 2024 \u2013 Sept. 4, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/celh\n\nContact the Firm Now: CELH@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint claims that Celsius failed to disclose several critical issues. These omissions include: excessive inventory shipped to PepsiCo beyond actual consumer demand; a projected decline in sales as PepsiCo worked through that overstock; unsustainable sales rates to PepsiCo that created a distorted picture of the company\u2019s performance; and, consequently, overstated business metrics and financial forecasts.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began to surface on May 28, 2024, when Celsius shares fell nearly 13 percent following Nielsen data indicating a slowdown in sales growth. Analysts at the time raised the possibility of a significant sales contraction as PepsiCo reduced its inventory levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019s stock suffered another sharp decline on September 4, 2024, dropping more than 11 percent after a company presentation revealed a shortfall of $100 million to $120 million in PepsiCo orders compared with the previous year. The presentation also disclosed that PepsiCo had carried several million excess cases of Celsius products over the past 18 months.\n\nThese disclosures have prompted an investigation by Hagens Berman, a shareholder rights law firm. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether Celsius deliberately concealed the extent of its inventory buildup at PepsiCo,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Celsius and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Celsius case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Celsius Holdings should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "\u201cThe more they get away from the actual food and into the convenience of the packaging, the better they do,\u201d Robert Moskow, a food-industry analyst who works at the investment bank TD Cowen, told me. But many chemicals used in industrial processing can taste unpleasant, metallic or bitter. Flavor companies like the U.S.-based International Flavors and Fragrances create masking compounds to cover up those off notes \u2014 but those chemicals, it turns out, can taste weird, too. The industry\u2019s solution is masking compounds that cover up the tastes of the original masking compounds.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m constantly defending Big Food,\u201d Stuckey told me when I brought up the industry\u2019s history. And perhaps she is right to be. Eating is more convenient now, and it can be cheap; poor harvests don\u2019t have nearly the same impact that they might have in the past. Breakthroughs in processing that made possible products like dehydrated chicken soups, frozen French fries and Jell-O instant puddings helped reduce domestic burdens on, for the most part, women \u2014 many of whom then entered the work force. In 1947, at a time when food processing was in its early days, Americans were spending nearly a quarter of their disposable incomes on food. Last year, that figure was only 11 percent. (And inflation was running high.)\n\nThe trade-off is obesity. Caloric consumption per capita in the United States has plateaued since 2000, while Americans have slightly intensified their physical activity. At the same time, the obesity rate has swelled by more than a third. Probably, the culprit is the food. Ultraprocessed products, the consumption of which has increased over the last 25 years, are often highly refined and rich in starch and sugar \u2014 we digest them, quickly, in the stomach and small intestine before they get to the colon, which is home to the gut microbiome. As emerging research shows, when we eat unprocessed or minimally processed foods, our gut bacteria consume as much as 22 percent of the energy. With ultraprocessed products, our bodies soak up all 100 percent of the calories.\n\nRight now, the industry\u2019s adaptation to Ozempic is in its infancy. A few companies have tested the waters: Nestl\u00e9, for example, has started a line of frozen meals targeted at people taking GLP-1s called Vital Pursuit \u2014 frozen pizzas, sandwich melts and chicken bowls with \u201ca sharper focus on smaller portions.\u201d But reliable data about how GLP-1s reshape people\u2019s likes and dislikes is yet to come. While Ozempic is threatening to turn off the industrial palate, Mattson believes that industrial foods may just need to be tweaked. Though many ultraprocessed foods and drinks turn off a lot of GLP-1 users, some are breaking through: On GLP-1 forums, people celebrate Fairlife, a line of sweet protein shakes owned by Coca-Cola. And Mattson has already dreamed up an arsenal of other potential winners.\n\nIn a glass-walled conference room, Mattson scientists prepared for me some of its foods tailored to GLP-1 users that are currently being conceptualized. Amanda Sinrod, a senior food scientist in a white lab coat, placed a plate of soft brown cubes on the table. She explained that she had enriched each NourishFit brownie bite with two grams of whey protein, for maintaining lean muscle mass during rapid weight loss. A peanut-butter swirl would push that protein level even higher. Whey protein can have a grainy texture and chalky off notes, but the NourishFits were defectless, smooth and sweet with remote echoes of cocoa. Approximately one-third sugar and about 15 percent fat, the bite-size portions were \u201cself-limiting,\u201d Sinrod said. Servings could be packaged individually.",

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shares of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the energy drink maker already reeling from a 58 percent year-to-date decline, faced renewed pressure this month after a key analyst lowered its price target, citing concerns about sales and the impact of its distribution agreement with PepsiCo. This diminished valuation adds to the company\u2019s woes, which include slowing sales, revised financial forecasts, and a shareholder lawsuit alleging misleading disclosures.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Roth MKM, the investment bank, reduced its price target on Celsius shares to $38 from $40, according to Nasdaq.com. Nasdaq.com reported that analysts at Roth MKM pointed to anticipated higher promotional allowances in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year. Critically, Roth MKM also suggested that the revised distribution agreement with PepsiCo would have a greater-than-expected negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue, according to Nasdaq.com.\n\nThe analyst price target cut comes on the heels of a securities class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors about its operations and prospects.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating the allegations and urges investors in Celsius who purchased shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 29, 2024 \u2013 Sept. 4, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/celh\n\nContact the Firm Now: CELH@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint claims that Celsius failed to disclose several critical issues. These omissions include: excessive inventory shipped to PepsiCo beyond actual consumer demand; a projected decline in sales as PepsiCo worked through that overstock; unsustainable sales rates to PepsiCo that created a distorted picture of the company\u2019s performance; and, consequently, overstated business metrics and financial forecasts.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began to surface on May 28, 2024, when Celsius shares fell nearly 13 percent following Nielsen data indicating a slowdown in sales growth. Analysts at the time raised the possibility of a significant sales contraction as PepsiCo reduced its inventory levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019s stock suffered another sharp decline on September 4, 2024, dropping more than 11 percent after a company presentation revealed a shortfall of $100 million to $120 million in PepsiCo orders compared with the previous year. The presentation also disclosed that PepsiCo had carried several million excess cases of Celsius products over the past 18 months.\n\nThese disclosures have prompted an investigation by Hagens Berman, a shareholder rights law firm. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether Celsius deliberately concealed the extent of its inventory buildup at PepsiCo,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Celsius and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Celsius case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Celsius Holdings should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC. For more information, call Reed Kathrein at 844-916-0895 or email CELH@hbsslaw.com.\n\nAbout Hagens Berman\n\nHagens Berman is a global plaintiffs\u2019 rights complex litigation firm focusing on corporate accountability. The firm is home to a robust practice and represents investors as well as whistleblowers, workers, consumers and others in cases achieving real results for those harmed by corporate negligence and other wrongdoings.

The GHAC is a pilot-oriented, mentorship-based program in the region dedicated to fostering sustainable innovation in agriculture, circular economy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, supporting startups by providing expert business advisory and collaboration opportunities with PepsiCo.\n\nAs a leading sustainability incubator in APAC, GHAC reinforces PepsiCo\u2019s commitment to finding solutions that contribute to progress in circular economy, sustainable agriculture, and climate action.\n\nWith 15 pilots initiated in seven markets through the 2023 and 2024 cohorts, the program focuses on supporting early-stage startups developing innovations aimed at reducing environmental impact, advancing renewable energy, and promoting sustainable farming practices. GHAC continues to explore new ideas and test solutions that can drive meaningful change over time.\n\nStatistically, 39 percent of SMEs in APAC are unable to align environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) efforts with internal business growth goals. In response, PepsiCo is providing targeted guidance to help these SMEs achieve sustainable growth through GHAC.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo\u2019s Greenhouse Accelerator Program is dedicated to empowering startups with the tools, resources and mentorship required to drive meaningful change and scale innovations across our food systems. Over the past two years, the program has successfully launched 15 startup pilots across APAC with PepsiCo and partners, and engaged with 95 venture capital firms and institutions, reinforcing our focus on fostering a robust sustainability ecosystem,\u201d said Ashley Brown, VP Supply Chain ANZ & Chief Sustainability Officer, PepsiCo APAC.\n\nGHAC will award $20,000 grants to each of the 10 finalists, with an additional $100,000 USD granted to the winning startup. Finalists will also receive wrap-around mentorship from PepsiCo executives and business accelerator experts to help overcome challenges and catalyze growth.\n\nThis year, GHAC has teamed up with GC Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC) and long-term collaborator Circulate Capital to provide tailored feedback and guidance to participants throughout the program. PepsiCo\u2019s bottling partners, Suntory PepsiCo Beverage (Thailand) and Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage (SPVB) will continue their partnership in 2025 across Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nSince its launch, the program has established a track record of successful first-of-a-kind pilots leading to further collaboration with PepsiCo and partners, with 2024 winner Alterno being among the standouts.\n\nAs the winner of last year\u2019s program, Alterno is pioneering Asia\u2019s first low-cost thermal energy storage solution for renewable energy. Alterno\u2019s sand battery technology offers a promising, lower-emission alternative to traditional snack drying methods, with the potential to help PepsiCo reduce energy costs and emissions while demonstrating real-world applications.\n\n\u201cAs sustainability rightly grows in importance for investors, consumers, and employees, accelerator programs like GHAC play a crucial role in helping entrepreneurs meet these expectations and remain competitive. Applicants benefit not only from mentorship with seasoned professionals but also from direct collaboration with PepsiCo, a global industry leader that drives the program and acts as the end user of their innovations. This provides access to decades of industry expertise, a strong partner network, and valuable insights to refine solutions and shape pilot opportunities,\u201d Ashley added.\n\nTo apply for the PepsiCo Greenhouse Accelerator 2025 APAC Sustainability Edition, visit the website at greenhouseaccelerator.com/apac/ or PepsiCo\u2019s LinkedIn linkedin.com/company/pepsico",

Driving brand relevance throughout January, the campaign is set to announce the line-up as the official snacks of the 2025 Dry January\u00ae Challenge.\n\nThe tongue in cheek campaign highlights that the snacks are 0.0% alcohol, making them the perfect choice for consumers looking for a wider variety of snacking choices that don\u2019t compromise on taste. Danny Dyer, famous for his role as The Queen Vic landlord in Eastenders, can be seen to be serving pints of 0.0% crisps to unsuspecting patrons who are going dry within a clip which will be shared across digital and social.\n\nThe campaign is timed to capture shopper attention during a month of New Year resolutions. Highlighting the broad range of snacks available for consumers to enjoy as part of a balanced diet this January and beyond, the new campaign will keep Walkers\u2019 \u2018Better for you\u2019 range top of mind, driving footfall for retailers at a key time of year.\n\nCynthia Finke, Marketing Director Portfolio Brands PepsiCo UK said, \u201cMany shoppers will start the new year off by cutting back on the things they enjoy, such as some of their favourite snacks. Showcasing much-loved brands such as Walkers Baked, which is now worth over \u00a380 million and Snack A Jacks, the number one rice cake brand, the new campaign taps into a culturally relevant moment that is the 2025 Dry January\u00ae Challenge. Through this, we can remind consumers of our broad range of great tasting non-HFSS snacks, making sticking to good intentions a little easier with brands they already know and love.\u201d\n\nThe creative will hero brands such as Walkers Baked, which contain 50% less salt than regular potato crisps and Snack A Jacks which are under 100 calories or less per pack. The nationwide campaign will be activated across OOH, digital, print, PR and shopper channels, featuring 0.0% alcohol messaging in a not quite coincidental, but typical, double 0 style reminiscent of beer ads.",

            "content": "Headquartered in New York, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP boasts a global presence with its wide-ranging portfolio of beverages and convenient foods. With a substantial market cap of $199.5 billion, the company is set to release its fiscal Q4 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, Feb. 4.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect PepsiCo to report a profit of $1.95 per share, a 9.6% jump from $1.78 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates in each of the last four quarters.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect PepsiCo to report an EPS of $8.15, up 7% from $7.62 in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2025 EPS is expected to grow 5.4% annually to $8.59.\n\nPEP stock has plunged 13.4% over the past year, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 24.2% gain. However, the stock has outpaced the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Sector SPDR\u2019s (XLP) 6.7 return over the same time frame.\n\nPepsiCo's lackluster price performance this year can be attributed to fierce competition, a growing consumer shift toward healthier options, rising costs, and reduced consumer spending in crucial markets. These challenges have strained its core snack and beverage segments, even as the company invests in and pivots toward healthier product offerings.\n\nNevertheless, PepsiCo's shares rose 1.9% on Oct. 8, driven by its Q3 earnings beat, with core EPS of $2.31 surpassing analyst expectations and increasing 2.7% year-over-year. Although the company reported lower-than-expected revenue of $23.3 billion, it delivered robust international results, achieving 4% organic revenue growth and notable volume increases.\n\nAnalysts remain cautiously optimistic about PepsiCo\u2019s stock, with an overall \u201cModerate Buy\u201d consensus rating. Out of 20 analysts covering the stock, 10 remain upbeat, advising a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, nine suggest a \u201cHold,\u201d while the remaining analyst gives it a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThe average analyst price target for PepsiCo is $181.78, indicating a potential upside of 24% from the current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Kritika Sarmah did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

That is the question the creatives at Cheetos parent PepsiCo asked in a recent campaign.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn November, the banana artwork, called \u201cComedian,\u201dwas purchased at a Sotheby\u2019s auction by a crypto entrepreneur. Afterwards, Ketchum pitched PepsiCo an idea to hold an auction for a Cheeto puff duct-taped to a canvas.\n\n\u201cWhen this banana phenomenon started hitting the mainstream news cycle and started reaching into the minds of consumers, Ketchum brought us a really interesting, quick idea\u2026that allowed us to hack culture,\u201d said Dan Cohen, senior director of brand communications at PepsiCo Foods North America. \u201cWe like to mischievously insert our brand in really fun ways in the cultural moments that our consumers and Cheetos fans expect from us.\u201d\n\nTactics\n\nOnce they had the idea, the creatives wanted to work quickly to \u201cmove at the speed of culture,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nThey determined that eBay would be a good platform for the auction, Cohen said.\n\nThe team used social media to promote the artwork.\n\nOn Instagram, Cheetos shared an image of a puff duct-taped to a canvas made to look like a wall, which also had a handprint with the classic orange remnants of the snack.\n\n\u201cA banana taped to a wall with a piece of duct tape just sold for over 6 million dollars at auction,\u201d the caption stated, \u201cNo shade to the prince of potassium, but we think we can do better, so we\u2019re holding an auction of our own.\u201d\n\nThe creatives wanted to keep it simple, Cohen said.\n\n\u201cAt that point in the day and in culture, that was very recognizable. Everyone was seeing this banana and this artwork, Cohen said.\n\nAs to the artwork itself, the brand sprayed the puff with a polyurethane coating, according to the campaign. The piece also included a placard warning viewers not to eat the artwork.\n\nResults\n\nThe winning bid came on Thanksgiving from a Houston resident, who offered $20,000, according to the campaign. There were more than 90 bids.\n\nMore than 2,100 people liked the Instagram post.\n\nThe campaign received coverage from outlets such as USA Today, the Washington Times, CNBC, CNBC and FoodSided.",

The PepsiCo root beer purveyor has become the object of several memes in recent years, including Mug Moment and TikTok videos where fans express, perhaps semi-ironically, a near-religious devotion to drinking Mug.\n\nWhile some of the attention on Mug is the product of inscrutable content creator humor, the trend appears to be boosting business. The beverage brand closed 2024 with a 34% increase in dollar sales and a rate of growth above that of the general root beer vertical, according to information shared with Marketing Dive.\n\nNow, Mug is seeking out its true devotees by selling a DNA testing kit that rates how much dawg the subject really has in her, with results ranging from 30% (presumably a low amount of dawg) to the rare and not especially scientific 110% dawg status. Recipients are recommended to take a sip of the included Mug can, provide a saliva sample and apply it to a testing card. In addition, the box has a real dog DNA kit with an estimated $90 retail value.\n\nMug is promoting the drop with a mock program that parodies shows where people dive deeper into their ancestry. In \u201cGenes with Gene,\u201d a buttoned-up host tells his interview subject that he\u2019s got that dog in him, a revelation that\u2019s followed by Mug\u2019s mascot storming the room and throwing a dance party. Agency VaynerMedia is behind the social content.\n\nThe first 200 consumers to purchase two 10-packs of Mug Root Beer Mini Cans, a recent product launch, through Mug\u2019s TikTok Shop will receive a test kit for free. More brands are experimenting with TikTok\u2019s e-commerce marketplace as the video app remains a driver of shopping trends and a key destination for elusive Gen Z consumers. TikTok is facing a potential ban in the U.S. that could go into effect later this month but marketers and creators alike continue to conduct business as usual on the social media platform.",

            "content": "When we think of Dividend Aristocrats, companies in the S&P 500 Index SPX that have increased their dividends for at least 25 years, food and beverage companies might come to mind first. This is not without reason, as these companies tend to have stable businesses with predictable and linear earnings. In turn, this allows them to pay fat dividends. Moreover, these companies are typically cash-flow powerhouses. Given their mature business, they don\u2019t have many avenues for investment, so they use the free cash flows for dividends or share repurchases.\n\nFood and Beverage Companies Have Been Feeling the Heat\n\nHowever, the going has been tough for food giants over the last few years. Consumer habits are changing, and shoppers are opting for newer and healthier alternatives. Many celebrities have launched popular snack and drink brands, giving established firms a run for their money.\n\nAlong with these two structural factors, food brands are also struggling from the near-term cyclical impact of high inflation and reduced spending power among low-and middle-income consumers.\n\nBeverage companies like Coca-Cola KO and PepsiCo PEP have been feeling the heat, and PEP stock fell to a new 52-week low of $146.10 on Jan. 6. The stock has underperformed both rival KO and the S&P 500 over the last year and is almost flat over the last five years. However, I find it a good buy at these levels given its healthy dividend yield and tepid valuations.\n\nWhy Has PepsiCo Stock Underperformed?\n\nPepsiCo has battled several headwinds over the last year, on the macroeconomic level as well as company-level. A stronger U.S. dollar, weak consumer spending, and higher inflation have harmed the sector and PEP is no exception. To make things worse, PepsiCo had some recalls that impacted its growth. Plus, the company saw what it called \u201coutsized\u201d growth in the previous three years, particularly for its Frito-Lay brand, and 2024 was always expected to be a year of \u201cnormalization.\u201d\n\nPepsiCo also faced a backlash from consumers as many believed it committed \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d lowering the quantity of food and drink its packages. PepsiCo also lowered its 2024 guidance during its third-quarter earnings call in October, blaming weak recovery in the U.S. consumer market and geopolitical issues. What\u2019s encouraging, however, is that the company still expects its core constant currency earnings per share to rise by at least 8% in the year. This comes in close to the upper end of its long-term guidance.\n\nPEP Stock Forecast\n\nOf the 19 analysts covering PEP stock, 9 rate it a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one rates it a \u201cHold,\u201d and one rates it a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d The stock\u2019s mean target price of $181.78 is 24% higher than the Jan. 6 closing prices while the Street-high target price of $200 is almost 37% higher. PepsiCo even trades below its Street-low target price of $148, which highlights how pessimistic markets have been toward the beverage giant.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for PepsiCo in 2025?\n\nWhile PepsiCo will formally spell out its 2025 forecast when it releases its Q4 earnings next month, during the Q3 earnings call the company alluded that it expects growth to pick up in 2025 after slashing its 2024 organic sales growth forecast from 4% to \u201clow single digits.\u201d Brokerages are modelling a 3.2% rise in PEP\u2019s 2025 revenue which is significantly higher than the 0.8% growth the company is expected to deliver in 2024.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Valuations Look Quite Tepid\n\nPepsiCo has usually traded at a discount to Coca-Cola even as there have been periods when it has traded at a premium. Over the last 10 years, PEP has traded at a forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.3x while the corresponding multiple for KO is 22.06x. However, currently, PepsiCo trades at an NTM P/E multiple of 17.3x compared to Coca-Cola\u2019s 20.88x. PepsiCo\u2019s current valuations look quite tepid as not only is its valuation discount with Coca-Cola materially higher than historically, but it also trades at a discount to the average S&P 500 Index constituent.\n\nPepsiCo Is a Dividend Aristocrat\n\nPEP has increased its dividend for 53 years and the current yield of 3.7% is significantly higher than its historical averages. PepsiCo\u2019s dividend yield usually goes that high only during periods of turmoil like the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis. While the company is currently facing multiple challenges, I don\u2019t find them severe enough to trigger such massive underperformance of its share price, and by extension, such dividend figures.\n\nOverall, for a conservative value investor looking to buy a dividend stock, PEP looks like a perfect fit as the company brings the prospects of both high dividends and reasonable capital appreciation to the table without undue risk. There is a lot of valuation comfort in PEP stock at these prices and a high possibility of making double-digit annualized returns over the next two years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shares of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the energy drink maker already reeling from a 58 percent year-to-date decline, faced renewed pressure this month after a key analyst lowered its price target, citing concerns about sales and the impact of its distribution agreement with PepsiCo. This diminished valuation adds to the company\u2019s woes, which include slowing sales, revised financial forecasts, and a shareholder lawsuit alleging misleading disclosures.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Roth MKM, the investment bank, reduced its price target on Celsius shares to $38 from $40, according to Nasdaq.com. Nasdaq.com reported that analysts at Roth MKM pointed to anticipated higher promotional allowances in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year. Critically, Roth MKM also suggested that the revised distribution agreement with PepsiCo would have a greater-than-expected negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue, according to Nasdaq.com.\n\nThe analyst price target cut comes on the heels of a securities class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors about its operations and prospects.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating the allegations and urges investors in Celsius who purchased shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 29, 2024 \u2013 Sept. 4, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/celh\n\nContact the Firm Now: CELH@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint claims that Celsius failed to disclose several critical issues. These omissions include: excessive inventory shipped to PepsiCo beyond actual consumer demand; a projected decline in sales as PepsiCo worked through that overstock; unsustainable sales rates to PepsiCo that created a distorted picture of the company\u2019s performance; and, consequently, overstated business metrics and financial forecasts.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began to surface on May 28, 2024, when Celsius shares fell nearly 13 percent following Nielsen data indicating a slowdown in sales growth. Analysts at the time raised the possibility of a significant sales contraction as PepsiCo reduced its inventory levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019s stock suffered another sharp decline on September 4, 2024, dropping more than 11 percent after a company presentation revealed a shortfall of $100 million to $120 million in PepsiCo orders compared with the previous year. The presentation also disclosed that PepsiCo had carried several million excess cases of Celsius products over the past 18 months.\n\nThese disclosures have prompted an investigation by Hagens Berman, a shareholder rights law firm. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether Celsius deliberately concealed the extent of its inventory buildup at PepsiCo,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Celsius and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Celsius case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Celsius Holdings should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

            "content": "Why do we need a global plastics treaty?\n\nStephen Jamieson: A global plastics treaty is essential to address the escalating plastic pollution crisis. Without intervention, the flow of plastic into the environment is set to double by 2040.\n\nAmbitious global rules have the power to harmonise regulations and foster transparency. A global treaty can drive the systemic change we need by defining polymers, products and chemicals of concern, mandating disclosure and reporting and setting global standards for design and policy tools such as Extended Producer Responsibility.\n\nFor businesses in particular, a global plastics treaty offers a unified framework to reduce risks, allocate capital effectively and build sustainable supply chains. Technology and software solutions play a critical role in helping businesses operationalise a treaty.\n\nThere is a lot at stake here if we don\u2019t get this right. Without a treaty, we can anticipate a significant increase of plastic pollution and associated human health risks.\n\nHaley Lowry: Progress is happening, but today less than 10% of plastic is recycled globally and 32% of plastic packaging escapes collection systems \u2014 suggesting that existing funding and policy frameworks for the waste management ecosystem are insufficient. We need coordinated global action to change that.\n\nDow fully supports an agreement that will eliminate plastic pollution by creating a socially inclusive, circular economy for plastics that recognises the vital role these materials play in ensuring a low-carbon future.\n\nWith demand for plastic on the rise globally and inadequate waste management systems in many countries, driving more sustainable production and addressing the growing problem of plastic waste are clear priorities.\n\nTruly sustainable production includes leveraging alternative and waste plastic feedstocks, creating products for both sustainability and performance, and embracing lower-emissions production.\n\nAnke Boykin: The challenges of plastic pollution extend beyond any one nation or industry.\n\nSystem-wide global change across infrastructure, policy and business is required to enable a more circular economy for plastic packaging and drive more sustainable packaging innovation.\n\nThis is why PepsiCo has been supportive of an ambitious and effective global agreement to end plastic pollution \u2014 to help level the playing field and drive the systemic change needed to tackle this challenge.\n\nHow will the UN Plastics Treaty create a better environment for business, alongside helping the world's plastic crisis?\n\nAnke Boykin: We believe a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution has the potential to spur significant progress towards a circular economy for plastic packaging. A treaty that establishes clear global rules, aligned definitions and metrics and agreement on measures to improve packaging design, collection and recycling is good for both governments and business.\n\nAs a business operating globally, harmonised policy across nations will create a level playing field and provide greater regulatory clarity and certainty so we can invest in and scale solutions we know can be applied in different parts of the world.\n\nWe believe the treaty will be most successful if it prioritises collaboration across sectors and the business community is given the opportunity to share our expertise, particularly around improved waste management systems such as well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) based on industry aligned principles.\n\nStephen Jamieson: A UN Plastics Treaty will create a better environment for business by lowering barriers to trade, reducing operational costs, simplifying reporting and boosting economies of scale. In many cases, businesses have already put supporting practices into play to comply with regulations at state, regional and federal levels \u2014 and these differing regulations can be complicated and expensive to manage. Having a consistent global policy unifies the playing field and drives the type of efficiencies outlined above.\n\nFurther, developing metrics, standards and targets within the treaty creates a clear, shared mission for governments and businesses. The availability of data to feed into these targets will be critical, coming from corporate data models that aggregate information on materiality and data providers that determine plastic leakage on a granular scale.\n\nThis two pronged-approach of setting reporting standards and then feeding in appropriate data using open-data models would foster market confidence in circular systems, allowing businesses to scale sustainable practices and foster innovation in product design and circular systems.\n\nHaley Lowry: US$32bn is already invested by the private sector every year to help develop a circular economy. A supportive, clear and consistent global policy framework would stimulate additional funding. To make a real difference, any agreement must create and nurture an environment that promotes innovation and investments at scale, including circularity drivers like sustainable design standards, recycled content mandates, national recycling targets and EPR in national action plans.\n\nSmart policies can trigger an increased volume of plastic waste returning to the production process and de-risk investments in circularity by creating a stable market for those materials. Likewise, a global agreement can increase the available supply of recycled raw materials by encouraging nations to adopt recycling targets.\n\nReturning plastic waste to the circular economy as feedstock is critical to advancing all forms of sustainable production. To achieve our shared ambitions, we must come together to create a circular economy that changes the way the world makes, uses, recycles and re-uses plastics.",

            "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) investors went through a rough ride in 2024, with the beverage company\u2019s shares sliding 12% over the year \u2013 a stark underperformance compared to the S&P 500\u2019s (SPX) tremendous 25% rally. While somewhat justified by a mixture of industry-wide headwinds, a cautious consumer base, and operational challenges, I believe this decline has led to PEP stock trading at a discount. In the meantime, the company\u2019s status as a Dividend King \u2013 a group of stocks that have raised dividends for over 50 consecutive years \u2013 makes it particularly intriguing for dividend growth investors. For these reasons, I remain bullish on PepsiCo stock.\n\nWhy Did PepsiCo Stock Have a Rough 2024?\n\nBefore jumping into buying a stock that\u2019s taken a big hit or lagged behind, it\u2019s always a good idea to dig into why it dropped in the first place. Understanding the full story can help you figure out if it\u2019s a short-term blip or something more serious. In this case, several challenges caused PepsiCo\u2019s underwhelming 2024 performance. One such issue was sluggish demand in key markets, especially among lower-income U.S. consumers, which proved a significant headwind. Therefore, despite strong international growth (for example, sales in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia were up 8% year-to-date), domestic demand struggled. A product recall particularly impacted the Quaker Foods N.A. division, which led to an 18% decline in organic sales.\n\nQ3 Earnings Report\n\nWeather impacts also played a role. For instance, Gatorade volumes underperformed due to adverse seasonal conditions, although PepsiCo\u2019s management did emphasize their efforts to achieve a rebound through targeted marketing. Inflationary pressures added complexity, particularly given the commodity costs, which, while stabilizing compared to previous years, still pressured margins. It\u2019s quite likely that we will see the company raise prices once again to address these issues, which may end up having mixed effects on sales volumes.\n\nLastly, geopolitical tensions and cautious Chinese consumers weighed on international performance, even with PepsiCo posting revenue growth in the international divisions overall. While areas like Southeast Asia and Brazil posted strong growth, geopolitical and economic instability in regions like the Middle East and Western Europe dampened results. Chinese consumers remained alert about their spending year-to-date too. Together, these factors drove bearish investor sentiment around PepsiCo stock, contributing to its significant decline in 2024.\n\nA Dividend King at an Appealing Yield\n\nDespite the challenges mentioned earlier, I believe the recent drop in PepsiCo\u2019s stock price has created an appealing opportunity for dividend growth investors, backing my bullish outlook on the name. Boasting 52 consecutive years of dividend increases, PepsiCo is a member of the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings. Historically, these stocks rarely experience prolonged selloffs, as income investors tend to capitalize on elevated dividend yields from quality names to secure rising income over the long term.\n\nToday, PepsiCo\u2019s dividend yield sits at 3.6%, which is among the highest in its history. This yield level was topped only during the Great Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic sell-offs. Accordingly, I believe this is one of those rare occasions where the stock once again presents an exceptional value proposition. Furthermore, given the predictable nature of the business, its robust cash flows and consistent earnings growth should support PepsiCo\u2019s ability to continue to grow its dividend. For dividend-focused investors, combining a reliable income stream while securing an attractive entry yield makes a noteworthy case.\n\nA Discounted Valuation for a Resilient Giant\n\nNow, besides the argument that PepsiCo stock makes for an attractive dividend growth pick following its recent decline, it\u2019s also worth noting that the company remains poised for record earnings in FY 2024. PepsiCo is expected to achieve an earnings per share (EPS) of $8.15, representing a 7% year-over-year increase. This estimate also implies that the stock is trading at just 18.8 times FY 2024\u2019s EPS following its recent drop. This multiple then drops to 17.9 times on a next-12-month basis, with analysts seeing continued growth. These are some of the lowest valuation levels PepsiCo stock has traded at over the last decade.\n\nOne could argue that elevated interest rates explain this valuation compression, reflecting broader market trends for slow-growth consumer staples. That said, I see these multiples as undervaluing PepsiCo, given its strong moat, recession-proof product portfolio, and earnings growth prospects. This is especially true given that Wall Street forecasts single-digit annual EPS growth for the company beyond FY 2025, affirming PEP\u2019s ability to sustain continued dividend increases for years to come.\n\nIs PEP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts seem relatively optimistic about PepsiCo\u2019s prospects following the stock\u2019s underperformance. Specifically, PEP stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys and eight Hold recommendations over the past three months. At $184.80, the average PEP stock price target implies an upside potential of about 23.5% from the current levels.\n\nFor the best guidance on buying and selling PEP stock, look to Bank of America Securities\u2019 (BAC) Bryan Spillane. He is the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe), boasting an average return of 1.42% per rating and a success rate of 57%.\n\nConclusion\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s tough 2024, illustrated in its lagging stock price against a booming equities market, appears to have created a unique opportunity for dividend growth investors. Despite the sluggish domestic demand, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical challenges, the company\u2019s strong international growth and robust fundamentals as a consumer staples giant remain intact.\n\nAs a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of increases and a 3.6% yield near historical highs, I believe PepsiCo is a reliable pick for those seeking gradually growing income while securing a compelling initial yield. Coupled with its discounted valuation and promising earnings outlook, it makes sense to be bullish on the stock in 2025.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

It finishes among the top five in all four Index categories.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s desire to establish itself as a major global trade hub and innovation center are rapidly becoming a reality.\n\n\u201cThe ambitious aims laid out in the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 strategy have been matched by focused, effective policies and actions that are yielding change and progress across the economy, business and society,\u201d says Agility vice chairman Tarek Sultan.\n\nThe 2025 index singles out Saudi Arabia for efforts to strengthen supply chain networks, improve port connectivity, manage inflation, reduce corruption, improve digital skills, and develop a high-value manufacturing sector.\n\nIn addition to the rankings, the index features a survey of 567 logistics industry professionals.\n\nMore than 62 percent of those surveyed say they\u2019ve overhauled their supply chains to safeguard against inflation, looming trade tariffs, the possibility of a global economic downturn and other major risks.\n\nThe survey shows the logistics industry entering 2025 looking to protect itself from rising costs and a potential trade war ignited by expected US tariff hikes and a flood of exports from China.\n\n\u201cThere is wariness and uncertainty among shippers, carriers, forwarders and others when it comes to the geopolitical factors that drive up costs, affect trade volumes, and alter supply chains,\u201d Sultan said.\n\n\u201cCompanies doing business internationally continue to shift production as they re-evaluate investment plans and search for durable paths to growth. Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Mexico and a handful of others are emerging as super-connectors for global trade.\u201d\n\nThe 2025 Index features an in-depth analysis of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors. Individually and as a group, the six GCC countries are positioning themselves as global trade centers, investing heavily in infrastructure, AI, energy transition, and workforce development.\n\nDespite increasing risk to global supply chains, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have become \u201cbeacons of stability\u201d and resilience, the Index concludes.\n\nStability at the top of the 50-country rankings was accompanied by volatility and movement further down in the Index. China, India, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Qatar, Thailand and Vietnam rank 1 through 10. Colombia (No. 21) leaped up the rankings; as Nigeria (43), Bangladesh (39) and Ukraine (40) tumbled.\n\nThe six Gulf countries all are among the top 11 for business conditions: UAE again tops the rankings for best business climate; Saudi Arabia is third and Qatar fifth. The countries most digitally ready are China, UAE, Malaysia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn international logistics opportunities, China, India, Mexico, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia rank highest. In domestic logistics, the leaders are China, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and UAE.\n\n2025 Index Highlights\n\nSURVEY\n\nRecession -- Nearly 55 percent of respondents see a global recession as likely or certain.\n\nProtectionism -- Almost 82 percent say tariffs and other trade protectionism are having a significant impact on their supply chains.\n\nEmerging markets \u2013 72 percent say risks in emerging markets have increased over the past year.\n\nChina \u2013 54 percent intend to move production or sourcing out of China in the next five years with US-China trade friction, labor costs and increasing domestic regulation being the biggest factors.\n\nAfrica \u2013 Despite seeing heightened risks in emerging markets, 35 percent plan to boost investment in Africa in 2025 vs only 8 percent planning to cut back there.\n\nNet-Zero \u2013 Nearly 65 percent say their companies are on track to meet net-zero goals.\n\nCOUNTRY RANKINGS\n\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, overall rankings are: UAE (3); Saudi Arabia (4); Qatar (8); Turkey (11); Oman (14); Bahrain (16); Jordan (17); Kuwait (18); Egypt (24); Morocco (26); Iran (32); Tunisia (36); Algeria (38); Lebanon (42); Libya (46).\n\nRankings in Sub-Saharan Africa: South Africa (20); Kenya (22); Ghana (31); Tanzania (37); Uganda (41); Nigeria (43); Ethiopia (45); Angola (47); Mozambique (48).\n\nRankings in Asia: China (1); India (2); Malaysia (5); Indonesia (6); Thailand (9); Vietnam (10); Philippines (23); Kazakhstan (25); Sri Lanka (27); Cambodia (30); Pakistan (33); Bangladesh (39); Myanmar (49).\n\nRankings for Latin America: Mexico (7); Chile (11); Brazil (13); Uruguay (19); Colombia (21); Peru (28); Argentina (29); Ecuador (34); Paraguay (35); Bolivia (44); Venezuela (50).\n\nIn Europe: Ukraine (40).\n\nTransport Intelligence, a leading analysis and research firm for the logistics industry, has compiled the Index since it was launched in 2009.\n\nJohn Manners-Bell, chief executive of Ti, said: \u201cDespite global economic headwinds and disruption to shipping lanes over the last year, the Gulf economies have proved exceptionally resilient.

            "content": "Some prominent healthcare and consumer stocks have fallen out of favor with the market, so now is the time to pounce on some great deals.\n\nWant to make a lot of money in the stock market without lots of stress? Buy and hold well-established companies that pay and increase dividends year after year. No, this strategy probably won't make you rich overnight. However, these sorts of stocks, called blue chip dividend stocks, are highly likely to still be around years from now, and they can generate significant returns when given enough time.\n\nThe thing is, everyone knows these companies and how awesome they are. So, if you want a deal on one, you sometimes need to wait for some adversity to spook the market.\n\nBelow are three great companies currently dealing with issues that have dragged their stocks down to attractive prices. You can currently buy a share of each for just $500. Hold them for the long term. They could be the smartest dividend stocks you can buy right now.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nShares of drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV 0.10%) have slid over the past several months, partly due to fears about the incoming government administration and its potential effect on the industry. While you can't dismiss this short-term risk, AbbVie has been a staple in the healthcare industry for decades. Formerly part of Abbott Labs, the Dividend King has continued raising its dividend annually since being spun off over a decade ago.\n\nThe company has a strong product portfolio, including fast-growing immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, Botox (a popular cosmetic injection), and a strong pipeline with five expected regulatory approvals coming this year. The dividend's payout ratio is well-padded at 56% of 2024 earnings estimates. Analysts expect the company to grow its earnings by an average of 8% annually over the next three to five years, so management can easily raise the dividend well into the future.\n\nToday, AbbVie stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 15. That's a solid deal for a company with 8% expected growth and a dividend yielding 3.5% at its current share price. Investors could realistically expect double-digit total returns over time, which is enough to make patient investors wealthier over the coming years.\n\n2. PepsiCo\n\nFood and beverage companies are dealing with similar political concerns, plus speculation over the effects of GLP-1 agonist weight loss drugs. This has put PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) on a steady slide in recent months. The market can get fearful and greedy at times, and in PepsiCo's case, it seems the pendulum has swung a little too far toward pessimism. The company has felt softer sales in recent quarters, but that's arguably as much about pricing and struggling consumers as anything else.\n\nPeople still need to eat and drink, and PepsiCo owns many of the most popular names in your local grocery store. Think Pepsi, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, Lays, Doritos, and more. Plus, the company is pivoting to new healthy and specialty foods for growth; it recently acquired Siete Foods for $1.2 billion. The company will probably be fine in time. Analysts still estimate that PepsiCo will grow earnings by an average of 6.5% annually moving forward.\n\nPepsiCo is a Dividend King with 52 consecutive annual increases, averaging 6.8% per increase for the past five years. The dividend payout ratio is manageable at 66%, so investors should see future increases on par with earnings growth. The stock has slid to a forward P/E under 18, and its 3.55% dividend yield is a decade-high outside of the COVID-19 market crash in 2020.\n\n3. Hershey\n\nConfectionery and snack conglomerate Hershey (HSY -1.00%) has been a longtime market-beating stock. However, it has fallen into a multi-year rut, due primarily to surging cocoa prices as a result of a global supply shortage. Hershey is feeling the pressure on its business, and its efforts to offset that with price increases have also eaten into its sales volume a bit. Some speculate that GLP-1 agonists will cause people to drop their sugar cravings, and new competition has sprung up from upstart brands.\n\nLike PepsiCo, Hershey's stock is seldom cheap under normal circumstances, so this adversity can seem scary. However, it may eventually be the best buying opportunity in years. Chocolate and candy have been cultural staples for centuries, and Hershey owns several of the most popular brands in America, including Hershey's, Reese's, Almond Joy, Twizzlers, and more.\n\nThe stock trades slightly below 21 times its 2024 earnings estimates, notably below its 10-year average of 27.5. The business earns an impressive 21.6% return on invested capital, generating profits to fund dividends. Hershey has raised the dividend for 15 consecutive years, backed by a rock-solid 60% payout ratio (using 2024 earnings estimates). Hershey can feel like a contrarian buy today, but this proven winner could bounce back in a big way once cocoa prices normalize.",

            "content": "It's hard to think of a business with more iconic brands than PepsiCo. Not only does it own its namesake Pepsi brand, which was launched under the Pepsi-Cola name in 1898, but it also owns big-name brands such as Mountain Dew, Lay's potato chips, Gatorade, Doritos, Tostitos, Quaker Oats, and more.\n\nPepsi has been in business for more than a century and has a market capitalization surpassing $200 billion. For its part, coffee giant Starbucks hasn't been in business quite as long -- it opened its doors in 1971. Therefore, it's not surprising that Starbucks is only worth about half of what Pepsi is worth. But that market valuation of just over $100 billion is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nPEP Market Cap Chart\n\nPEP Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nIn short, Pepsi and Starbucks are huge global businesses with long histories. For this reason, it might be surprising to suggest that companies that were only founded in 2011 and 2012 could be worth more than Pepsi and Starbucks within five years. But cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and cryptocurrency platform Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) could do it if things go right.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike isn't just one cybersecurity product. Rather, it's a software platform with nearly 30 products -- called modules -- to choose from. The company's customers can select the modules that meet their needs. But they tend to start small before consolidating their cybersecurity spend by increasing the amount of CrowdStrike modules they're using.\n\nCrowdStrike grows in two primary ways. First, it can attract new customers, which it's doing. The company doesn't report how many end users it has anymore. But it confirms that it's still adding net new customers. Second, its customers can adopt more of its software modules, which is also happening.\n\nBetween net new customers and the adoption of more modules, CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) is soaring. In its fiscal third quarter of 2025, the company surpassed ARR of $4 billion, which was up 27% year over year. But it's not stopping there. Roughly six years from now, management hopes to be at $10 billion in ARR.\n\nCrowdStrike also hopes to have a free-cash-flow margin between 34% to 38% long term. Assuming it hits its goals, the company could be generating somewhere around $3.5 billion in annual free cash flow. In this scenario, its free-cash-flow valuation could get a little cheaper between now and 2030, and its market valuation could still surpass Pepsi's current market cap.\n\nWith the cybersecurity space as big and as important as it is, I wouldn't bet against industry leader CrowdStrike.\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nTo be clear, I think that CrowdStrike's path to a $200 billion valuation is much smoother than Coinbase's path. But the cryptocurrency platform still has a shot.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the long-term outlook for cryptocurrency has always been somewhat murky. But the next four years could be the most favorable ever considering President-elect Donald Trump ran with a pro-crypto message. Moreover, cryptocurrency is growing in popularity, motivating other politicians to take it seriously on behalf of their constituents.\n\nIn short, if there was ever a time in which crypto was poised for substantial adoption, the time is now. And that's particularly good for Coinbase. Not only is the platform used by millions of people, it's also seen as a trustworthy platform for institutional investors and enterprises.\n\nGranted, the cryptocurrency space is noteworthy for its ups and downs, so investors should brace themselves for some volatility. That said, when times are good, Coinbase can be a quite profitable business -- it had more than $3 billion in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) a few years ago.\n\nCOIN EBITDA (TTM) Chart\n\nCOIN EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nCould Coinbase hit $7 billion in EBITDA over the next five years under a favorable regulatory environment for crypto? Things get interesting for shareholders if it can.\n\nConsider that Coinbase's enterprise value is roughly 30 times its EBITDA right now, which is a reasonable valuation. At this valuation, Coinbase would be worth more than Pepsi if it can boost its EBITDA to $7 billion. Granted, broad adoption for the cryptocurrency ecosystem would need to take place for profits to grow this much, and that's not guaranteed. But even just modest growth will likely push its valuation higher than Starbucks', which is still an impressive feat.\n\nIn closing, I believe that both CrowdStrike and Coinbase will be worth more than Starbucks before long.

            "content": "It's hard to think of a business with more iconic brands than PepsiCo. Not only does it own its namesake Pepsi brand, which was launched under the Pepsi-Cola name in 1898, but it also owns big-name brands such as Mountain Dew, Lay's potato chips, Gatorade, Doritos, Tostitos, Quaker Oats, and more.\n\nPepsi has been in business for more than a century and has a market capitalization surpassing $200 billion. For its part, coffee giant Starbucks hasn't been in business quite as long -- it opened its doors in 1971. Therefore, it's not surprising that Starbucks is only worth about half of what Pepsi is worth. But that market valuation of just over $100 billion is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nIn short, Pepsi and Starbucks are huge global businesses with long histories. For this reason, it might be surprising to suggest that companies that were only founded in 2011 and 2012 could be worth more than Pepsi and Starbucks within five years. But cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike (CRWD 6.38%) and cryptocurrency platform Coinbase (COIN 3.17%) could do it if things go right.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike isn't just one cybersecurity product. Rather, it's a software platform with nearly 30 products -- called modules -- to choose from. The company's customers can select the modules that meet their needs. But they tend to start small before consolidating their cybersecurity spend by increasing the amount of CrowdStrike modules they're using.\n\nCrowdStrike grows in two primary ways. First, it can attract new customers, which it's doing. The company doesn't report how many end users it has anymore. But it confirms that it's still adding net new customers. Second, its customers can adopt more of its software modules, which is also happening.\n\nBetween net new customers and the adoption of more modules, CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (ARR) is soaring. In its fiscal third quarter of 2025, the company surpassed ARR of $4 billion, which was up 27% year over year. But it's not stopping there. Roughly six years from now, management hopes to be at $10 billion in ARR.\n\nCrowdStrike also hopes to have a free-cash-flow margin between 34% to 38% long term. Assuming it hits its goals, the company could be generating somewhere around $3.5 billion in annual free cash flow. In this scenario, its free-cash-flow valuation could get a little cheaper between now and 2030, and its market valuation could still surpass Pepsi's current market cap.\n\nWith the cybersecurity space as big and as important as it is, I wouldn't bet against industry leader CrowdStrike.\n\n2. Coinbase\n\nTo be clear, I think that CrowdStrike's path to a $200 billion valuation is much smoother than Coinbase's path. But the cryptocurrency platform still has a shot.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the long-term outlook for cryptocurrency has always been somewhat murky. But the next four years could be the most favorable ever considering President-elect Donald Trump ran with a pro-crypto message. Moreover, cryptocurrency is growing in popularity, motivating other politicians to take it seriously on behalf of their constituents.\n\nIn short, if there was ever a time in which crypto was poised for substantial adoption, the time is now. And that's particularly good for Coinbase. Not only is the platform used by millions of people, it's also seen as a trustworthy platform for institutional investors and enterprises.\n\nGranted, the cryptocurrency space is noteworthy for its ups and downs, so investors should brace themselves for some volatility. That said, when times are good, Coinbase can be a quite profitable business -- it had more than $3 billion in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) a few years ago.\n\nCould Coinbase hit $7 billion in EBITDA over the next five years under a favorable regulatory environment for crypto? Things get interesting for shareholders if it can.\n\nConsider that Coinbase's enterprise value is roughly 30 times its EBITDA right now, which is a reasonable valuation. At this valuation, Coinbase would be worth more than Pepsi if it can boost its EBITDA to $7 billion. Granted, broad adoption for the cryptocurrency ecosystem would need to take place for profits to grow this much, and that's not guaranteed. But even just modest growth will likely push its valuation higher than Starbucks', which is still an impressive feat.\n\nIn closing, I believe that both CrowdStrike and Coinbase will be worth more than Starbucks before long. And I believe they could both be worth more than Pepsi in the next five years if things go right.\n\nThat said, I'd consider Coinbase the more speculative prediction of the two. By contrast, even if it doesn't reach the milestone within the next five years, I believe it's only a matter of time before CrowdStrike is more valuable than Pepsi.",

            "content": "The S&P 500 up over 55% in the last two years. Naturally, investors are likely wondering how much longer the bull market rally can go.\n\nAlthough no one knows what will definitively happen this year, it's clear the broader market has gotten more expensive. So it's even more important to ensure you are investing in top companies that you are willing to hold through periods of volatility.\n\nHere's why these five Fool.com contributors have high conviction in Alphabet (GOOG 1.75%) (GOOGL 1.68%), Micron Technology (MU 6.23%), Brookfield Renewable (BEP -0.26%) (BEPC -0.35%), PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%), and United Parcel Service (UPS 1.33%) as top stocks to buy this month.\n\nAn obvious winner in the year of AI agents\n\nKeith Speights (Alphabet): Many analysts believe 2025 will be the year of artificial intelligence (AI) agents. I agree. And I think Google parent Alphabet will be an obvious winner if that prediction is right -- and therefore a great stock to buy to start the year.\n\nAI agents can perform self-directed tasks to achieve goals set by humans. Instead of only answering questions as chatbots do, they can also go to work on your behalf.\n\nWhy is Alphabet such an exceptional pick to profit from the rise of AI agents? For one thing, the company already offers robust AI agent functionality. Its Gemini large language model (LLM) supports application programming interfaces (APIs) for running AI agents. Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Builder makes creating AI agents quick and easy. Google Agentspace supports enterprise-level AI agents.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem presents a massive opportunity for deploying AI agents, too. The potential applications of AI agents across Google's product range, including Android, Google Pixel phones, and Google Workspace productivity suite, are extensive and readily apparent.\n\nI also like that Alphabet is the biggest bargain among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on one key valuation metric. The tech giant's shares trade at only 21.3 times forward earnings, lower than the forward earnings multiples of the other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nCould regulatory threats derail Alphabet's momentum? Maybe, but I suspect not. Alphabet is appealing an adverse court decision handed down in 2024. I think the company's arguments look pretty solid. Alphabet ranks among the best AI stocks to buy right now, in my opinion.\n\nMicron's $50 billion investment is building America's tech future\n\nAnders Bylund (Micron Technology): I love companies with a long-term vision. Micron Technology is a great example.\n\nThe memory chip maker isn't planning ahead for the next quarter or even the next year. Micron is building an America-centered manufacturing network for the long haul, expecting to invest $50 billion in new and upgraded facilities by 2030.\n\nThe company is building an American tech titan for the ages, and having this crucial hardware provider available should grow more important in the coming years. Micron's world-class memory chips are often seen in the latest AI accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, for example. Apple sources the iPhone's memory chips from various leading suppliers, but Micron is among them and is reportedly in talks to secure a larger iPhone contract in 2026.\n\nMicron's long-term business prospects are downright incredible. At the same time, the company is returning from a multiyear downturn, which started with coronavirus-based materials and engineering talent shortages in 2020. Trailing-12-month revenue has nearly doubled since the summer of 2023, and Micron's free cash flows are back above the breakeven line again -- despite the company's expensive factory-building efforts:\n\nBut Wall Street isn't paying attention to Micron's shareholder-friendly business trends. The stock soared and then plunged in 2024, adding up to a full-year price drop of 1.4%. That includes a 14% plunge in December. Micron's shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.3 times sales or 7.6 times forward earnings as of Jan. 2.\n\nIt's a deal, it's a steal, it's a deep-discount sale you don't want to miss in January 2025.\n\nAn attractive, beaten-down stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Shares of Brookfield Renewable hugely underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024 -- while the corporate shares gained barely 4% in the year, units of the partnership fell 13% versus the S&P 500 index's 23% gains. However, there seems to be a disconnect between investor sentiment and Brookfield Renewable's operational performance and growth goals. I believe the stock has a solid chance to recover and rally in 2025.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy companies, with an operating capacity of nearly 37 gigawatts (GW). The company, however, is developing nearly 200 GW of capacity, reflecting its massive growth potential. More importantly, Brookfield Renewable is steadily growing its cash flows and dividends.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is, in fact, all set to deliver record numbers for 2024, with its funds from operations (FFO) per unit growing by 11% in the third quarter. That puts the company on track to deliver 10%-plus annual FFO per unit growth in line with its long-term goal.\n\nThe real highlight, though, is that 2024 should also be the biggest year for investments into growth for Brookfield Renewable, with the company raising billions of dollars from asset recycling and investing that money, alongside cash flows, into global acquisitions spanning wind, solar, and hydroelectric power assets.\n\nGiven the backdrop, Brookfield Renewable looks like a solid stock to buy in January and hold for 2025 and beyond. The company plans to grow dividends at a rate of 5% to 9% per year, and its shares currently yield a solid 5% yield. As an investor in the U.S., you could avoid filing a K-1 tax form and foreign tax withholding if you buy corporate shares of Brookfield Renewable versus its partnership units.\n\nSnack on this stock\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (PepsiCo): It's a new year, making it an ideal time to take a fresh look at your portfolio. That's especially true following two fantastic years for broader stock market returns. If you do, you might find that PepsiCo fits as one of your first purchases of 2025.\n\nThe beverage and snack foods giant underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2024. That's partly because Wall Street was more interested in tech giants and companies engaged in the AI space. But Pepsi also reported some sluggish sales figures as its core consumer pulled back their spending to save cash. Organic sales growth was just 2% through the first three quarters of the year, management revealed in early October. Compare that to the 10% spike investors saw in 2023 and the 14% surge in the prior year, and it's easy to see why some investors have been disappointed.\n\nBut Pepsi is still a cash- and profit-generating machine, which means there's a good chance at a rebound for this business -- and for its stock returns -- over the next several years. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team are projecting a bit less than 4% organic sales growth for the 2024 year and 8% higher earnings per share in that period. Investors will learn the exact figures, plus Pepsi's initial outlook for 2025, when the company announces Q4 results on Feb. 4.\n\nIn the meantime, there's every reason for shareholders to expect ample direct cash returns from this business as Pepsi sells more snack foods and beverages. For 2024, expected returns of cash to shareholders were billed at $8.2 billion, mainly through dividend payments.\n\nSpeaking of dividends, Pepsi's yield is back above 3.5%, a rate investors haven't seen since the early days of the pandemic. That unusually high payout, along with Pepsi's solid earnings generation, should help cushion returns while investors wait for a growth rebound. The timing of any sales recovery is a big question mark. But Pepsi's dividend payment is not. The Dividend King has hiked its payout in each of the last 51 consecutive years, and it's almost certain that shareholders will benefit from another increase in 2025.\n\nUPS has what it takes to recover in 2025\n\nDaniel Foelber (UPS): UPS is now at its lowest level since July 2020, and I think it's an incredible opportunity for patient investors. But there's no denying the package delivery giant has fallen for many good reasons.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially led to surging volumes and margins for UPS. However, as industrywide growth slowed, UPS struggled to offset declining margins with price increases, further hurting volumes. The company was also dealing with expensive negotiations with the Teamsters Union, which resulted in a new contract. Even as UPS laps initial costs of the new contract, analysts expect its earnings per share to rise by 17% in 2025. UPS made several blunders in recent years and disappointed investors. But the stock has fallen far enough, and UPS is well positioned to return to growth in 2025.\n\nThe company has already made significant investments in expanding routes, so it doesn't have to spend a lot on capital expenditures (capex). In fact, capex is expected to be just $4 billion in 2024, which is less than the $5.4 billion in projected dividends. After 18 months, UPS finally returned to profit and revenue growth, so it is already showing signs of turning things around.\n\nLonger-term, UPS has opportunities to expand its healthcare and small and medium-sized delivery volumes. In March 2024, UPS unveiled a three-year plan that forecast healthcare segment revenue to double by 2026, making time- and temperature-sensitive shipments an integral part of the company's offering.\n\nUPS and its peer FedEx have dirt cheap valuations, but UPS has a far higher yield at 5.3%, making it a more intriguing transportation stock for passive-income investors.\n\nInvestors looking for high-yield dividend stocks at compelling valuations should look closer at UPS now.",

Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or someone just exploring the stock market, understanding the full picture behind PepsiCo\u2019s potential can be a game-changer.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into why this global giant\u2019s financial health and strategic growth initiatives make it a compelling choice for your portfolio.\n\nFinancial Strength: The Backbone of PepsiCo\u2019s Resilience\n\nWhen it comes to investing, numbers often speak louder than words. At a glance, PepsiCo\u2019s valuation metrics paint an encouraging picture. With a trailing twelve-month (TTM) price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.5 and a forward P/E of 18, the stock combines affordability with growth potential. But what lies beneath these figures?\n\nConsistent Revenue Growth Amid Economic Uncertainty\n\nEven during challenging economic times, PepsiCo\u2019s financial foundation remains solid as a rock. In the first 36 weeks of 2024, the company\u2019s net revenue reached $64.07 billion, an increase from $63.62 billion during the same period in 2023. This steady performance underscores the strength of PepsiCo\u2019s diversified revenue streams.\n\nDid you know? PepsiCo doesn\u2019t just sell beverages like Pepsi and Mountain Dew; it generates 56% of its revenue from convenient foods, including Lay\u2019s, Doritos, and Quaker Oats. This balanced portfolio ensures PepsiCo\u2019s performance isn\u2019t overly reliant on any single product line.\n\nEfficient Cost Management and Gross Profit Growth\n\nPepsiCo has also shown remarkable resilience against inflationary pressures. In 2024, the company\u2019s gross profit grew by 2%, reaching $35.5 billion, even as raw material costs soared. How does PepsiCo manage this? By optimizing its cost of sales, which stood at $28.6 billion, and leveraging its global scale for operational efficiencies.\n\nOf course, no company is immune to challenges. In 2024, PepsiCo faced a $184 million product recall in its Quaker Foods division and incurred $415 million in restructuring costs under its 2019 Productivity Plan. Yet, these setbacks are part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance productivity long-term.\n\nPrudent Debt Management: Balancing Growth and Stability\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s approach to debt is a masterclass in financial prudence. The company holds $7.3 billion in cash and equivalents, ensuring liquidity even as it carries a long-term debt of $38.5 billion. Impressively, its EBIT-to-interest ratio of 15 indicates that PepsiCo generates ample earnings to comfortably service its debt.\n\nIn 2024, PepsiCo also issued $4 billion in long-term bonds with maturities extending to 2054, securing favorable financing terms for future growth. This mix of liquidity and strategic borrowing reflects a well-balanced financial strategy.\n\nShareholder Rewards: A Reliable Dividend Yield\n\nIf you\u2019re an investor who values regular income, PepsiCo has you covered. In 2024, the company distributed $5.37 billion in dividends, offering a dividend yield exceeding 3%, up from $4.94 billion in 2023. Complemented by $760 million in share buybacks, PepsiCo consistently enhances shareholder value, making it a favorite among income-focused investors.\n\nStrategic Growth: Fueling Long-Term Potential\n\nWhat separates a good investment from a great one? A forward-looking strategy. PepsiCo\u2019s long-term growth initiatives make it not just a safe choice but an exciting one.\n\nInnovation That Captures Consumer Trends\n\nOne of PepsiCo\u2019s strengths lies in its ability to anticipate and adapt to changing consumer preferences. Health-conscious consumers? PepsiCo has them covered with brands like Simply and SmartFood. The growing demand for energy drinks? Enter partnerships with Celsius.\n\nBy increasing spending on marketing and product development, PepsiCo keeps its portfolio fresh and competitive. This focus on innovation ensures that PepsiCo doesn\u2019t just keep up with the market\u2014it leads it.\n\nExpanding Horizons: Geographic Growth Opportunities\n\nWhile North America and Europe remain PepsiCo\u2019s largest revenue generators, contributing a combined $29.3 billion in 2024, emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia are becoming key growth drivers.\n\nIn regions like AMESA (Africa, Middle East, and South Asia) and APAC (Asia Pacific), PepsiCo\u2019s localized strategies\u2014such as tailoring products to cultural preferences\u2014are paying off. Think of brands like Sabritas and Gamesa, which resonate deeply with Hispanic markets.\n\nThe takeaway? PepsiCo\u2019s ability to navigate diverse markets is a testament to its global strategy and adaptability.\n\nSustainability: Aligning Growth with Responsibility\n\nSustainability isn\u2019t just a buzzword for PepsiCo\u2014it\u2019s a cornerstone of its strategy. From investing in renewable energy and sustainable packaging to reducing waste, PepsiCo\u2019s environmental initiatives enhance its brand reputation and customer loyalty.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Productivity improvements, driven by digital transformation and shared service centers, allow PepsiCo to reinvest savings into high-growth areas like innovation and market expansion.\n\nOperational Efficiency: A Competitive Edge\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system is another example of how the company optimizes its operations. By managing distribution directly, PepsiCo ensures product freshness and customer satisfaction while maintaining a strong supply chain in volatile markets.\n\nWhat About the Risks?\n\nNo investment is without risks. For PepsiCo, inflation, currency fluctuations, and shifting consumer habits pose challenges. Yet, the company\u2019s proactive approach\u2014like hedging against raw material costs and leveraging its global scale\u2014mitigates these risks effectively.\n\nIn volatile markets like China, PepsiCo\u2019s strategies demonstrate a clear understanding of local dynamics, ensuring resilience even in uncertain environments.\n\nConclusion: Why PepsiCo Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio\n\nPepsiCo is more than just a stock; it\u2019s a story of resilience, innovation, and long-term growth. From its strong financials and consistent dividends to its forward-thinking strategies in innovation and sustainability, PepsiCo checks all the boxes for a solid investment.\n\nAt $150 per share, the valuation metrics\u2014TTM P/E of 22.5, forward P/E of 18, and an NTM P/FCF ratio under 20\u2014indicate a blend of affordability and potential. Add to this a reliable dividend yield exceeding 3% and a proven track record of navigating challenges, and it\u2019s clear why PepsiCo stands out.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re looking for stability, income, or long-term growth, PepsiCo offers it all.

The system will convert residues into renewable natural gas for on-site use, thereby displacing fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 3,700 tons of CO2 per year.\n\nThis project is a significant step forward for PepsiCo in achieving its carbon reduction goals. \"By utilizing Anaergia's solutions at our Funza facility, PepsiCo will be generating renewable natural gas from our residue streams and reducing our carbon footprint,\" said Jim Andrews, Chief Sustainability Officer at PepsiCo. \"This project is another transformative initiative by PepsiCo, as we progress towards our carbon reduction commitment,\" added Andrews.\n\nIit's also a win for Anaergia, which is now supplying its technology to PepsiCo facilities on three continents. \"South America is now the third continent where Anaergia is providing systems to PepsiCo facilities,\" said Assaf Onn, CEO of Anaergia. \"By providing our proven solutions to create renewable fuel and energy from organic waste, we are helping our customers achieve their environmental and economic objectives globally,\" added Mr. Onn.\n\nThis is not the first time Anaergia has been involved in a large-scale organic waste-to-energy project. In November, the company won a contract to operate and maintain the biggest such facility in North America, located in California. The Rialto Bioenergy Solutions LLC (RBS) facility is designed to convert up to 1,000 tons a day of municipal wastewater biosolids and landfill-diverted organic waste into up to 985,000 million British thermal units per year of RNG and fertilizer.\n\nThe RBS facility is a critical part of California's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. \"The Facility supports California's landfill diversion regulation Senate Bill 1383 aimed at reducing greenhouse gas methane emissions from landfills,\" the companies said in a joint press release.\n\nAnaergia is also working on a project to upgrade an anaerobic digester at Michigan State University's South Campus Anaerobic Digester and Compost Facility. The facility generates 380 kilowatts of electricity from food waste and manure, powering multiple campus buildings.\n\nThese projects are all part of Anaergia's mission to accelerate the world's clean energy transition by transforming organic waste streams into valued resources.",

            "content": "Evolving Trends: The U.S. soft drinks industry is witnessing a growing demand for healthier beverage options as consumers prioritize wellness. This shift includes preferences for drinks made with natural ingredients, reduced sugar and functional benefits, alongside diverse flavors and improved taste experiences. Plant-based beverages, such as those featuring botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are gaining popularity among health-conscious consumers seeking environmentally friendly choices. Functional beverages offering targeted health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosts and mood support, are carving out a niche in the market. Additionally, companies are capitalizing on these trends by expanding into new and adjacent categories, including the rapidly growing ready-to-drink (RTD) alcoholic beverage segment, often through collaborations. Digital Growth & Innovation: The U.S. soft drinks industry is leveraging digital transformation to fuel growth and enhance consumer engagement. As preferences increasingly shift toward online shopping, brands are heavily investing in direct-to-consumer platforms and third-party marketplaces to meet rising demand. Companies are prioritizing robust digital capabilities, exploring innovative fulfillment options and expanding their digital offerings to stay ahead. Subscription-based models are also being introduced to boost customer loyalty and secure recurring revenues. In addition to digital initiatives, the industry continues to benefit from product innovation. Companies are optimizing portfolios by focusing on core brands, launching products and expanding into untapped markets to capture greater market share. These strategies, combined with technology-driven advancements, are transforming the sector and enabling brands to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and dynamic marketplace. Raw Material Cost Inflation & Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is grappling with rising production costs due to raw material shortages, higher commodity prices and logistical challenges. Increased costs for key inputs like steel and aluminum have raised packaging expenses, while ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum-can industry add strain. Freight inefficiencies and surging domestic and international transportation costs have compounded these challenges, leading to higher operating expenses that impact gross and operating margins. To offset these pressures, many companies have implemented price increases, which contributed to recent sales growth. However, with commodity inflation and elevated transportation costs expected to persist in the near term, the industry continues to face headwinds. Additionally, a growing emphasis on eco-friendly packaging and sustainable sourcing is driving operational changes, influencing cost structures.\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners, and partner brand owners.\n\nThe Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry presents a mixed investment landscape characterized by growth opportunities, driven by innovation, digital transformation and significant cost-related challenges. On the growth side, shifting consumer preferences toward healthier, functional and sustainable beverages creates opportunities for companies to capture market share. Digital initiatives such as direct-to-consumer platforms, subscription models and data-driven personalization are enhancing consumer engagement and driving incremental revenue streams. However, potential investors should also weigh the industry's headwinds, including persistent raw material inflation, supply-chain disruptions and rising operational costs linked to eco-friendly practices. Elevated packaging costs, freight inefficiencies and commodity price volatility pose risks to profitability. Leading companies like Coca-Cola KO, PepsiCo PEP, Monster Beverage MNST, Keurig Dr Pepper KDP and Vita Coco COCO are poised to successfully navigate these challenges through innovation, digital optimization and operational efficiency, standing out as compelling investment options in this evolving and competitive industry.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #141, which places it in the bottom 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\n\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry vs. Broader Market\n\nThe Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry has underperformed the Consumer Staples sector and the S&P 500 Index in a year.\n\n\n\nThe stocks in the industry have collectively lost 3.4% compared with the sector\u2019s decline of 0.8% in the past year.

            "content": "Doritos comes in flavors that run the gamut from Cool Ranch to Flamin\u2019 Hot Limon. At Super Bowl LIX, however, executives behind the popular chip will focus on a classic recipe.\n\nFrito-Lay, the snack-food giant that is part of PepsiCo, is relaunching Doritos\u2019 famous \u201cCrash the Super Bowl\u201d contest this year and has narrowed down thousands of entries into 25 semi-finalists whose efforts to create a big-screen Super Bowl ad could pay off big time. Any winners will have a chance for their ad to be aired during the Big Game and win $1 million.\n\nFor PepsiCo and Frito-Lay, that will only add to the costs of playing in the Super Bowl. Fox, which plans to televise the grand event on February 9, has sought more than $7 million from some 30-second ad berths,\n\nEven though modern aspirants have all kinds of new technology at their beck and call, ranging from high-tech smartphone cameras to a suite of digital video-editing tools, \u201cI still think you have to have a great idea,\u201d says Chris Bellinger, chief creative officer at PepsiCo\u2019s food operations. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta have a certain amount of polish. It\u2019s got to have a certain amount of humor.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDoritos is about to open a second chapter in its bid to cultivate winning Super Bowl ad concepts not from the nation\u2019s big ad agencies, but rather from the consumers they hope to attract. Many of the bids that have prevailed so far in the contest look as sophisticated as anything that might come out of a Madison Avenue firm like BBDO, McCann Worldwide or Ogilvy.\n\nOne candidate has devised a commercial in which three guys shrink themselves down to ant-size so they can enjoy the Doritos crumbs in the bottom of a bag., Another features a senior couple using a single pair of dentures to enjoy the snack they love so much. A third uses science fiction as a backdrop and treats Doritos bold flavor as a living entity\u2026that has escaped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool, because there are ideas that come out left field, and they are just so unique,\u201d says Bellinger. \u201cThere are some areas that you never thought [Doritos] could play in this space, but they are really funny. I\u2019ve seen a sci-fi spot, and drama.\u201d\n\nThe company will use an internal process to narrow down the candidates. \u201cYou can imagine the stakeholders who are involved,\u201d the executive says.\n\nFrito-Lay will find out whether the do-it-yourself concept still has appeal. The original \u201cCrash\u201d debuted in 2007, just as YouTube and what was once known as \u201cuser-generated content\u201d were gaining traction with U.S. consumers. Facebook was in its relative infancy. Media outlets worried about whether they could air commercials and other content create without expert production and that looked \u201clo-fi.\u201d\n\nStill, by 2015, it was clear the idea had run its course, even if the idea of letting individuals create popular content continued to thrive. Doritos pivoted to other ideas after one last bootstrapping salvo, when director Zack Synder agreed to help top entrants. \u201cAt that point, it was clear there was a shift,\u201d says Bellinger. More Super Bowl advertisers were relying on celebrities, and \u201clong form was becoming more prolific\u201d among Big Game sponsors. \u201cWe were seeing more 60s, more two-minutes.\u201d Doritos wanted to spotlight new flavors and snacking occasions. In 2018, PepsiCo ran a single ad that touted a new spicy iteration of Doritos and a new lemon-lime variant of Mountain Dew.\n\nA return in 2025 comes as individual\u2019s ability to create anything from a newsletter or podcast to an entire media empire has never been easier to develop. In 2007, an aspiring Doritos ad-maker like Jared Cicon, then a wedding photographer, was seen as an outlier. Today, a smart creator might become a massive influencer on the order of Alex Cooper.",

For Indra Nooyi, former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, it was someone very familiar.\n\n\u201cI would go look at myself in a mirror. I would talk to myself,\u201d Nooyi says. \u201cAnd that was my go-to because all people need an outlet. And you have to be very careful who your outlet is because you never want them to use it against you at any point.\u201d\n\nIn this episode of The Insightful Leader, Nooyi speaks with Kellogg\u2019s Ellen Taaffe about how she achieved and managed success.\n\nPodcast Transcript\n\nLaura PAVIN: You\u2019re listening to The Insightful Leader. I\u2019m Laura Pavin.\n\nAre great leaders born, or are they made?\n\nOne of my hobbies is reading the Wikipedia pages of notable people to figure that out. Like, what confluence of things made them who they are? Was it their upbringing in rural Indiana? Their college major? How do you get to be someone like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook. Or PepsiCo\u2019s Indra Nooyi?\n\nI actually didn\u2019t have to read Nooyi\u2019s Wikipedia page to hear that story.\n\nEllen TAAFFE: Hi Indra, it\u2019s Ellen Taaffe. Nice to see you.\n\nIndra NOOYI: Hi Ellen, how are you?\n\nPAVIN: That\u2019s Kellogg professor Ellen Taaffe with the Indra Nooyi, the former Chair and CEO of PepsiCo. Nooyi recently spoke at the Kellogg School\u2019s Global Women\u2019s Summit, but Taaffe and Kellogg Insight caught up with her before that to talk about the pieces of her that make up the whole and to find the inspiration in that.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot to be inspired by. Nooyi was one of the first Fortune 100 CEOs to make sustainability part of a broader business strategy. She pushed PepsiCo into healthier food categories\u2014way before the entire industry started doing the same. And she did it all as the first female chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. The company grew its net revenue more than 80 percent under her.\n\nBut for Taaffe, Nooyi was something else. A mentor. Which is what makes this conversation really special. They talk about Nooyi\u2019s upbringing in India, her journey to the top of the org chart, how to ensure more women have the opportunities she had, and of course, what good mentorship looks like.\n\nTaaffe led the interview with Nooyi. She starts by talking about her time at PepsiCo. You\u2019ll hear Taaffe speakafter this.\n\nTAAFFE: I wanted to start out by telling you how you changed my life.\n\n\n\nI had been running Convenience Foods. I wanted to join Brock Leach in the innovation group working on the health and wellness strategy. And I was facing a lot of personal things. I was burnt out from leading the post-acquisition group in Chicago.\n\nI had two small daughters who were under three, and my mom had just passed away, and my husband was running a startup, and I was really at a pivotal point in my career. Do I stay? Do I go? And I found that opportunity, talked to Brock, and said, I would love to do this new job. But I need to do it with more flexibility and on a reduced basis.\n\nAnd he was open to that but said, I need to get Indra\u2019s approval. And I thought, Indra Nooyi, the heir apparent, you know, she works a million hours, has little sleep. Would she ever approve this? And you did. The next 18 months helped me to reset myself. I went back to full time, and I look back and I think, I don\u2019t know if I would have become a CMO, a board director, an author, a professor here at Kellogg had I not had that opportunity.\n\nAnd I just think it\u2019s so emblematic of you leading in your way but also respecting and allowing others. And the flexibility that you gave me and the career opportunity made a world of difference in my work, but also in my life too.\n\nNOOYI: To me, what we did at PepsiCo for you is because we said, hey, Ellen\u2019s a talent.\n\nWe have to hold on to her. If that means working flexibly for a couple of years, hell, let\u2019s do it. Because she\u2019s going to come back even more energized, and that\u2019s great for the company. And you know, it\u2019s good for her family because she now has time to also focus on that. So, you know, it goes to this, the core of what we need to talk about.\n\nThis whole thing is a talent issue. Women is a talent issue. It\u2019s not a gender issue. Family is a talent issue. Family is a next-generation consumer issue. We lose sight of that.\n\nTAAFFE: You really modeled the way. But I\u2019d love to learn a little bit more, go back to you growing up. What do you think shaped you?\n\nNOOYI: I grew up in a world where there was no internet, there was no computer, there was no television when I was growing up because television didn\u2019t exist in India.\n\nSo you focused on human-to-human interactions, reading, education, you know, uh, very childlike, extracurricular activities. And the men in our family said, the girls are going to have the same opportunity as the boys. And they enforced it with a discipline that was unbelievable. They said, look, if you don\u2019t want to study, if you don\u2019t want to move ahead, we\u2019re happy to find somebody for you to marry.\n\nBecause those days it was all arranged marriages. But they said, if you want to study, if you want to move ahead, we are not going to stop you. In fact, we\u2019re going to encourage you to do that. Even when we didn\u2019t have money, the first dollars would go, the first rupees would go towards our education.\n\nIt was a gift my parents gave us. And so, in many ways, I am a product of that phenomenal upbringing.\n\nTAAFFE: You had many mentors, and certainly sometimes that\u2019s being in the right place at the right time, but you were coachable. You created these trusted relationships. Could you talk a little bit more about how mentoring played a role in your career?\n\nNOOYI: I\u2019d say that they picked me. I never went to somebody and said, \u201cWill you be my mentor?\u201d I just worked hard and I put my head down and for me, delivering a great product was better and more important than running for the next job. And I always worried about how to make the life of my boss easier by not upwardly delegating stuff. Now I was very conscious of not upwardly delegating.\n\nMany people do that. They do a half-assed job and hope their boss will fix it. I decided that I\u2019d like time. My boss says, \u201cI don\u2019t even need to review your stuff because you\u2019ve checked it.\u201d And by doing all that, people came out of the woodwork and said, \u201cI want to mentor this person because when she gets to some place of great importance, I want to say I had a role to play in her life.\u201d\n\nAnd when I did become CEO, I wrote to some of those mentors and I said, \u201clook, um, you know, you had a part to play in my life.\u201d Some of them wrote back saying, \u201cyou\u2019re damn sure I did because, uh, I did this A, B, and C for you.\u201d And I say, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s why I wrote to you.\u201d So mentorship is a two-way street. You\u2019ve got to respect your mentor and then they in turn mentor you.\n\nTAAFFE: Where do mentors and mentees go wrong?\n\nNOOYI: You know, sometimes what happens is somebody takes all this job of mentorship very seriously. You give advice to your mentee, and then they go do something quite the opposite. It doesn\u2019t work out or it works out, but they never go back to the mentor and say, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I take your advice?\u201d\n\nAnd mentors feel like, what am I, a chopped liver? This person always comes to me for advice. I give them advice. They sometimes take it, sometimes they don\u2019t take it, but they never tell me why they took it or didn\u2019t take it and how I could help them the next time. And when you have mentors who picked you, show your gratitude to them. And it means dropping an email to them once in four or five months saying this is what I\u2019m up to. And nothing confidential.\n\nThis is what I\u2019m up to. Just do it. It\u2019ll make them feel so good. And they will say wonderful things about you to the rest of the world. Mentorship requires gratitude.\n\nTAAFFE: As you moved across industries and were navigating, building your career, I\u2019m sure you also faced challenging times. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about that. Did you ever hit a breaking point or want to throw in the towel? Can you talk about the challenges\u2014how you got through it and what you learned from it?\n\nNOOYI: There were many times where I wanted to throw in the towel for several reasons. One, either because I did something that didn\u2019t meet the mark and I was harder on myself. And I\u2019d say to myself, I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore. Or I faced biases in the workplace, which made me feel very, very bad. Or the pressures of home and family and work just come crashing on you going, do I want to continue?\n\nBut I tell you, one of the things that kept me going was that we had nothing besides the jobs and our families. And we had to keep going because we needed those paychecks. And the thing that people don\u2019t understand is as you climb up the corporate ladder, the higher up you go, it\u2019s up or out. So you can\u2019t just stay in place and sort of retire on the job.\n\nYou better figure out a way to keep working to keep the job, or you have to leave.\n\nBut at every point in time, first of all, I said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not going to let anybody down. I\u2019m not going to let women down. I\u2019m not going to let people of color down. I\u2019m not going to let immigrants down. I\u2019ve got to keep powering through.\u201d Then when I became CEO, president, and then CEO of PepsiCo, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let PepsiCo down.\u201d\n\nAnd so I dug in and said, this company is very important to me, put the company before me. And I just kept powering through to say, I\u2019ve got to handle it. Now here comes the challenge. What do you do when you have these challenges? Who do you talk to?\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to find people to talk. You know, I have a wonderful husband, and very often I come and talk to him. But at times your husband goes, \u201cdo I have to listen to this negative stuff all the time?\u201d And he\u2019s right, because you\u2019re at home for such a short time. If you keep talking about negative stuff, they too get fed up, Ellen.\n\nSo you can\u2019t really talk to your spouse all the time. You can\u2019t talk to your friends because it\u2019s confidential stuff about the company. You can\u2019t talk to your board because they are your bosses. You can\u2019t talk to people who work for you because they work for you. And so it puts you in a fairly lonely position.\n\nAnd I would talk to myself. I would go look at myself in a mirror. I would talk to myself. I would rage at myself. I would shed a few tears, then put on some lipstick and come out. And that was my go-to because all people need an outlet. And you have to be very careful who your outlet is because you never want them to use it against you at any point.\n\nSo the best thing is talk to yourself in the mirror.\n\nTAAFFE: I love that advice for, we can control our mindset. We can\u2019t control a lot of things around us.\n\nNOOYI: In today\u2019s world with social media and all that stuff, it\u2019s very hard to trust somebody because you never know downstream, if you had a falling out, what happens.\n\nYou just don\u2019t know. Be very, very careful.\n\nTAAFFE: You mentioned moving into the CEO role at PepsiCo. You created, led with the performance-with-purpose mission, which was so valuable to the company.\n\nPAVIN: Hey! This is Laura just popping in here to say that this \u201cperformance-with-purpose mission\u201d Taaffe just mentioned, that was Nooyi\u2019s push for the company to offer choices like baked chips, waters, and teas\u2014stuff you wouldn\u2019t typically associate with Pepsi at the time. And she wanted the company to be a little more focused on sustainability, the environment, and social issues. This was in the early aughts, before that became the industry-wide rallying cry. Okay, back to Taaffe.\n\nTAAFFE: And I\u2019m curious. I can remember some of the days where it was harder to drive that change. How did you handle that driving change and any advice on how others who are trying to change something about their strategy or their workplace, what they could do?\n\nNOOYI: Ellen, you know, transformations are difficult. Transformations when you have a burning platform and it\u2019s an inside-out transformation is easy because everybody\u2019s looking at the burning platform.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve got hemorrhaging profits, or costs have gone too much, or your revenue growth has fallen, you know, everybody knows you have a burning platform, and they rally around to what changes need to be made. In my case, the company was doing very well, but I had a future backed burning platform. As I looked at what the market trends were and the mega trends, I\u2019m looking at this going, \u201cGod, we have to change, otherwise the company will be in trouble.\u201d\n\nNot that the company is in trouble now\u2014it\u2019s going to be in trouble. Change before the change forces you to make the change. Right? Which means you\u2019ve got to anticipate what\u2019s going to happen based on all the trends. You\u2019ve got to look at the trends constantly, you know, read lots of signals.\n\nAnd so because I was basing the transformation on the future back perspective, I had to lay out the trends that I thought were going to impact us. Surprisingly, everybody bought into the trends, but some of them struggled to make the changes to accommodate those trends or to, you know, compete in that world with all those trends.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the, you know, the rub came. They fought me on those. So for a long time, I worked with them. In fact, one of the biggest mistakes I made, I worked with some of them too long. I hoped to change their mind because they\u2019d been around PepsiCo for a while, and I loved working with them.\n\nBut then when they become too much of a hurdle, then you\u2019ve got to get them out. And many of them have retired as a consequence. You know, for example, if I look at the shift to health and wellness, Brock Leach, who worked with me, you know, both of us love Brock. He was way ahead of the curve with us. He said, \u201cwe have to do this, Indra.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just, you know, figure out a way to do this because that\u2019s where the consumers keep going. That\u2019s the right thing to do. And, um, I still, the thing I feel the best about PepsiCo is the push towards more nutrition, lower calories. You know, because every child in the world should be our child. How we feed our children, that\u2019s how we should feed the world.\n\nSo I felt very strongly about that. And so I think people felt everything deep down their heart. And unless you touch their heart, the head is never going to change. And then I had to get the hands to start doing different things. So it was a missionary type of a job going and talking to people.\n\nAppearing in large meetings, repeating the message again and again in different ways to touch people\u2019s heart, to make it relatable to them. It was long hours and relentless, but it had to be done.\n\nTAAFFE: So you talked about, as you rise up, the expectations rise, and often what worked before doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work going forward. Can you share any ways that you might have evolved, whether you got feedback or saw that something about your style or approach wasn\u2019t working as you rose through the ranks?\n\nNOOYI: Oh, so many ways. And there were, I\u2019m glad I was surrounded by people who told truths to power, because sometimes people would just say to me, \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t so abrupt.\u201d\n\nOr could you give this feedback in a more gentle way? So it\u2019s palatable, as opposed to getting people mad about you. And many people gave me feedback, people who are my bosses, people who worked for me, people who worked as my peers. When they give you the feedback, you feel a bit defensive. But if you step back from it and listen to them carefully, listen to them carefully, as opposed to just, sort of, in one ear and out the other ear.\n\nYou listen to it carefully, and if you trust the person who\u2019s giving you the feedback, right? And say, hey, this person\u2019s not out to get me. They really care for me and the company and the work group. Then you will pause and say, okay, \u201chow do I change what I\u2019m doing?\u201d And I\u2019ve had to do that many times.\n\nBelieve me, I was a lifelong student. Not only of content and theories. I had to study behavior, too, because as you move up and you\u2019re commanding more people, leading more people, and you\u2019re making change and transformation, you have to evolve and adapt yourself. And I had to learn a lot, and I made mistakes along the way.\n\nTAAFFE: It\u2019s very clear that you are a lifelong learner. I\u2019m curious, what are you learning now at this stage of career in life?\n\nNOOYI: Lots of things, because the world is being completely upended by technologies. And you know, I\u2019m learning everything there is to know about all these new technologies coming on the horizon. Not just AI, but whatever\u2019s coming in molecular biology, whatever\u2019s coming in electrification, quantum computing\u2014enough to be able to understand how it\u2019s going to impact the companies that I\u2019m associated with, like Amazon or Philips or Memorial Sloan Kettering.\n\nAnd so I\u2019m like a kid in a candy store. I\u2019m reading everything I can. I\u2019m reading everything on foreign policy, geopolitics. I\u2019m reading about how many, many verticals are going to change because of the progression and technologies. And so I\u2019m actually enjoying myself because now I have the freedom to read whatever I want.\n\nI have the freedom to go deep in whatever I want and the freedom to actually call on experts, and [say,] \u201chey, can you just tell me a little bit about this?\u201d And people are willing to do that. Even though I\u2019m not a CEO anymore, they\u2019re still willing to give me some time. So I\u2019m calling on some banked goodwill with all these people and saying, \u201chey, can you give me some time to teach me this?\u201d\n\nSo, you know, if you have this mindset of lifelong learning, you will never walk away from it. But you\u2019ve got to have that mindset and you\u2019re never too old to be a lifelong learner. The day you stop lifelong-learning, Ellen, you will atrophy. And you should remember that.\n\nTAAFFE: So one of the, I guess, lessons learned from the pandemic was a window into households, into what parents were facing, in particular women.\n\nWe saw in many ways, uh, a number of women drop out of the workforce. As we came back to work, we started to see more flexibility and increase ... in some ways, it\u2019s two steps forward, one step back. Now, as we see more mandates to come back to the workforce and we face a lot of issues with caregiving and all that, I wondered if you could talk about what you see the workplace needing to be, what leaders need to do to enable a more equal playing ground for all people to have the careers they want.\n\nNOOYI: I think we have a human problem, a sociology problem, a political problem, an economics problem, a legal problem. Every discipline around, every university, has to talk about this. And let me tell you what I\u2019m talking about. Today, if I look at universities, high schools, whatever, 70 percent of valedictorians are women.\n\nMore than 50 percent of the college degrees are being gotten by women. And they\u2019re getting all the top grades. Even technical schools are, you know, largely women. Thirty, forty percent women. They\u2019re hungry. They want the power of the purse. They want to be economically independent. And if you look at the Magna and Summa Cum Laude, women are getting as many, if not more, than the men.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got an extraordinarily bright group of women who want to contribute, who want to work, right? And the economy needs the best and the brightest. If we want to feed our economy with our own people, we need the best and the brightest.\n\nI feel like one should write up this problem and say, \u201cguys, let\u2019s do this. Solve it. How would you approach this problem?\u201d And don\u2019t just focus on managerial women. Think of the factory worker who\u2019s a woman who\u2019s working the 8 to 8, 8 p.m. to 8 a. m., shift. Who needs that job because without that she can\u2019t feed her kids. What is she supposed to do? And remember, right now, everybody\u2019s saying we need more kids. All right. How are we going to solve this problem? Let\u2019s figure out how to thread this needle. And if we can somehow make all of these conflicting demands work through some intervention, more power to us.\n\nBut it cannot be families, female, let us make the women just collapse with, uh, you know, the stress of doing too many things. And then let\u2019s make sure we pay them less. We don\u2019t promote them. We have all kinds of unconscious biases in the workplace. And then say, you know, women, they\u2019re hysterical. They always complain.\n\nLet\u2019s not say that. Without women, the economy doesn\u2019t work. Of all the frontline jobs, nurses, school teachers, medical assistants, dental hygienists, beauty-care salons, restaurants, retail, real estate, they\u2019re all women. Seventy to ninety-seven percent are women. If all of these women now decided they\u2019re going to stay home and take care of kids, how is this economy going to run again?\n\nDo we even talk about that? I don\u2019t know. Do we even talk about how their kids are going to be taken care of? And how about the parents of these women and men? You know, when men ask for gyms in offices, we put gyms in all the offices. Now, let\u2019s say women ask for child care. Are we willing to do it?\n\nTAAFFE: Really, like how you position it is a human and societal issue. It truly is, and we see it in the trends of holding off on having kids, and how do you afford this and keep your job. So, I\u2019m sure as, uh, the CEO that you have been, and I know we both have two daughters. I\u2019m curious, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten the question a million times, how have you done it?\n\nNOOYI: In many ways, my husband made a huge difference because he was a big support.\n\nHe had his own career, he was traveling a lot, but we coordinated calendars constantly. In the early days of our kids, we had support from our parents. My mother and his mother, my father had passed away, and my mother was there to help his parents, and then various aunts and uncles came in from India to help us.\n\nThree months at a time, four months at a time, they helped us. We had the financial ability to pay for a babysitter or a nanny at home. We somehow worked our schedules so that one of us will always be home at night with the kids. It was not easy. But I will tell you, Ellen, um, I think 30 percent of the time my kids will say, \u201cMom was a great mom.\u201d\n\nSeventy percent of the time they would say, \u201cGod, what mom? We never had a mom when we were growing up. Mom was always busy. She was always stressed out. She was always working, reading, carrying bags of mail and going through it all the time,\u201d which is true. And, um, they would say they missed out, but they were never latchkey kids.\n\nThey never not had a roof over their head or food on the table or clothes on their back. They never missed a birthday party or a vacation, so they had everything. But they didn\u2019t have a dedicated mom at home, or a dedicated dad at home, because dad was also working. Uh, and that\u2019s the story of immigrant families who don\u2019t have anything to fall back on.\n\nRight? We were building wealth as we went along. And so, sometimes when you talk to my kids, they\u2019ll say how proud they are of mom. Other times they\u2019ll say, \u201cmom, forget mom, she was never a mom.\u201d It depends on the time of day. Um, I would say that if I had to do it again, would I do the same thing? Probably. Probably. Um, I don\u2019t know how it is not to work so hard. I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if a different model, if I knew of a different model, I might say, I wish I didn\u2019t work so hard. I just don\u2019t know what another model is. I kept working hard, and one thing led to another. It was just my DNA, but it\u2019s not easy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a support structure with your family, your community, and if you don\u2019t have the wherewithal for supporting a babysitter or a nanny full time with you, you can\u2019t do it. And all bets are off if you have an ill parent or a child with special needs that needs you to give them a lot of attention.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not just saying for women. For families, it\u2019s very hard to climb a career when you have so many competing problems you have to deal with at home. It\u2019s not possible. And if you don\u2019t have a very supportive spouse, forget it. That\u2019s the reality, and the sooner we recognize all this ... and that\u2019s why a lot of women are not having kids now.\n\nIt feels like we have to choose between career and kids. And second, once I become a stay-at-home mom, my pension savings goes down massively because I don\u2019t have a pension savings. I could be a single mom any day if my husband walked out on me, which many, many men do. Okay. And third, If I have a big crisis at home and we don\u2019t have the financial ability to take care of the sickness at home, how is it going to work?\n\nHow are we going to make ends meet? And how are we going to create wealth as a fact? And for a single mom, the problem is compounded.\n\nSo again, this is a very serious human issue, which we\u2019re kind of sweeping under the rug. But the more we ignore this issue, we will have more stressed-out caregivers, more stressed-out women who are disproportionately high percentage of caregivers, and we\u2019re going to lose out on an incredible talent in our workplace.\n\nTAAFFE: So, so last question, how do you think leadership has changed, you know, what\u2019s needed in leaders today that is different than the past?\n\nNOOYI: I think leadership is getting more complicated and more exciting or, you know, just worrisome. I don\u2019t know. Especially if you\u2019re leading a big multinational. We\u2019re now in a time when we\u2019re questioning, what is the role of a multinational?\n\nWe went from the world is flat to the world is getting all kinds of national bar, you know, walls built around it. How should you compete? You\u2019ve got a more diverse workforce, and it\u2019s getting increasingly more diverse. How do you deal with the diverse workforce? How do you treat every person as a valuable contributor to the company as opposed to a tool of the trade?\n\nHow do you say to yourself, this is an asset of the company and deal with them with respect. So learning to deal with a diverse workforce, giving everybody honest feedback, putting the company before yourself, and dealing with a world that\u2019s going to be more complicated than ever is all table stakes for leaders today.\n\nSo having clarity of direction, clarity of purpose, and looking at your people as assets, not tools for the trade, are going to be the only successful elements of the formula for the future, because people are going to make you successful. You can\u2019t do it all yourself. And you can\u2019t influence geopolitics.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to play within the geopolitics. So understand it, you know, craft an intelligent path through the conflicts, but don\u2019t try to be too vocal about it. And you know, tiptoe your way through it. Those are all skills you have to develop and evolve as you go along.\n\nPAVIN: That\u2019s our show for today. We hope you liked it.

            "content": "For Gen Z, meal and snack occasions continue to blur. Thus, that consumer behavior has become a primary focus for PepsiCo.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead to 2025, several macro trends are emerging, particularly tied to the consumption habits of Gen Z \u2013 a generation that has remained a key focus for us,\u201d said Mustafa Shamseldin, Category Growth Officer and CMO of international foods at PepsiCo.\n\n\u201cFaced with increasing time pressures in their busy lives, Gen Z consumers are gravitating toward meals that fit their on-the-go lifestyles; Our global brands are responding,\u201d Shamseldin told The Food Institute.\n\nOn that note, PepsiCo partnered with restaurant chain Komagene in Turkey to introduce new Doritos-inspired items, including the Doritos Cig Kofte Wrap, a modern twist on a traditional Turkish meatball dish.\n\nHere\u2019s a few other trends PepsiCo will closely monitor in 2025 \u2026 along with multiple predictions from Shamseldin:\n\nConsumers Seek Experiences\n\nShamseldin, who has worked with PepsiCo for nearly two decades, noted research that shows 73% of Gen Z and Millennials view \u201cexperiences\u201d as more valuable than tangible products. As a result, PepsiCo hopes to offer consumers the chance to engage with its brands in more meaningful ways, via away-from-home occasions.\n\nThe corporation is working to present Lay\u2019s potato chips, for example, as a brand that\u2019s synonymous with celebrations.\n\n\u201cThis summer in European markets, we launched pop-up food trucks that used Lay\u2019s potato chips in locally inspired recipes, such as a traditional Spanish potato omelet made with Lay\u2019s chips,\u201d Shamseldin recalled.\n\nSocial Media Marketing Takes on Added Importance\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s chief marketing officer noted that food-related content has become the top trending topic on social media, with platforms like TikTok largely providing the impetus. PepsiCo research shows that 54% of consumers now rely on TikTok to discover new food and cooking ideas.\n\n\u201cConsumers are eager to experiment with their meals, driven by a hunger for creativity and virality,\u201d Shamseldin said.\n\n\u201cThis shift highlights the growing influence of digital platforms in shaping culinary exploration and trends, and our brands are capitalizing on it.\u201d\n\nIn that spirit, Doritos recently teamed with 13 global influencers to create \u201cDoritos Loaded\u201d recipes.\n\nGlobal Flavors Get Hotter Than Ever\n\nConsumers of all ages continue to be drawn to spicy, international flavors.\n\n\u201cWe see this trend particularly reflected in our Lay\u2019s brand, which showcases how we leverage in-depth analysis and collaborate with our local culinary teams to create flavors that stay true to the dishes that inspired them,\u201d Shamseldin said. \u201cEarlier this year, our U.S. team introduced three exciting international flavors \u2013 honey butter (in Korea), Tzatziki (Greece), and Masala (India) \u2013 highlighting flavors that have widespread popularity around the world.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PepsiCo continues to witness demand for intense flavor experiences, especially via its Flamin\u2019 Hot products.\n\n\u201cThis trend saw tremendous growth in 2024 and shows no signs of slowing down\u201d Shamseldin said. \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot grew so quickly that it is now its own brand, expanding to markets across the globe. This past April, the U.K. introduced \u2018Extra Flamin\u2019 Hot,\u2019 while Brazil also launched Doritos Dinamita Flamin\u2019 Hot.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate the Flamin\u2019 Hot trend will continue to dominate well into 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Food Institute Podcast\n\nIs it possible to balance a legacy brand and innovative ideas for a food company?

This diminished valuation adds to the company\u2019s woes, which include slowing sales, revised financial forecasts, and a shareholder lawsuit alleging misleading disclosures.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Roth MKM, the investment bank, reduced its price target on Celsius shares to $38 from $40, according to Nasdaq.com. Nasdaq.com reported that analysts at Roth MKM pointed to anticipated higher promotional allowances in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year. Critically, Roth MKM also suggested that the revised distribution agreement with PepsiCo would have a greater-than-expected negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue, according to Nasdaq.com.\n\nThe analyst price target cut comes on the heels of a securities class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors about its operations and prospects.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating the allegations and urges investors in Celsius who purchased shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 29, 2024 \u2013 Sept. 4, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/celh\n\nContact the Firm Now: CELH@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint claims that Celsius failed to disclose several critical issues. These omissions include: excessive inventory shipped to PepsiCo beyond actual consumer demand; a projected decline in sales as PepsiCo worked through that overstock; unsustainable sales rates to PepsiCo that created a distorted picture of the company\u2019s performance; and, consequently, overstated business metrics and financial forecasts.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began to surface on May 28, 2024, when Celsius shares fell nearly 13 percent following Nielsen data indicating a slowdown in sales growth. Analysts at the time raised the possibility of a significant sales contraction as PepsiCo reduced its inventory levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019s stock suffered another sharp decline on September 4, 2024, dropping more than 11 percent after a company presentation revealed a shortfall of $100 million to $120 million in PepsiCo orders compared with the previous year. The presentation also disclosed that PepsiCo had carried several million excess cases of Celsius products over the past 18 months.\n\nThese disclosures have prompted an investigation by Hagens Berman, a shareholder rights law firm. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether Celsius deliberately concealed the extent of its inventory buildup at PepsiCo,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Celsius and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Celsius case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Celsius Holdings should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

The brokerage cited its strong geographic expansion and robust supply chain as drivers of growth.\n\nThe brokerage initiated coverage on the company with a 'buy' rating and a target price of Rs 725, indicating a 11% potential upside. This valuation is based on a premium multiple of 55x the earnings per share value of Dec. 2026, reflecting Varun Beverage's growth prospects.\n\nWhile territory acquisitions may have plateaued, here is what makes JM Financial believe the company's growth prospects in India remain strong:\n\nNon-Carbonated Beverages and Energy Drinks: Leveraging PepsiCo's innovation pipeline, brands like Sting and Tropicana are gaining traction.\n\nDistribution Expansion: With only 4 million retail outlets and 1.1 million visi-coolers currently, the company is targeting 300,000-400,000 more outlets and 100,000 visi-coolers annually.\n\nManufacturing Optimisation: Enhanced backward integration and low-sugar formulations ensure sustainable margins while meeting market demands.\n\nWith recent territory expansions in South Africa and Tanzania, alongside capacity upgrades in Congo, JM Financial considers Africa a key growth driver for the beverage company.\n\nAdditionally, the foods business, with three manufacturing plants under development in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Morocco, is expected to generate $100 million in revenues, tapping into an $800 million total addressable market. This segment offers optionality for further territory rights, said the brokerage, adding another layer of long-term potential.\n\nThe report anticipates consolidated sales growth at a CAGR of 18.7% until fiscal 2026, driven by 16.6% volume growth. While margins may stabilise at current healthy levels, interest cost savings from debt repayment are expected to boost earnings CAGR to 29%.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "As 2025 gets underway, investors looking to refresh their portfolios with some attractively valued companies might be eyeing stocks that lagged the market in 2024. Beverage giants Coca-Cola (KO 0.07%) and PepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) have been under pressure over the past year, and both have fallen by around 14% from their 52-week highs.\n\nGiven the overlapping businesses, it probably doesn't make sense for most investors to have both stocks in their portfolios. So which one is the better buy now?\n\nHow far have PepsiCo and Coca-Cola really fallen?\n\nPepsiCo's 2024 has been a little worse than Coca-Cola's. Not only was its dip from its peak slightly steeper, it's actually down more than 10% year to date, while Coca-Cola is up by about 5%.\n\nHowever, if you pull the lens further back, PepsiCo's drop from its three-year high is around 22%, while Coca-Cola's is around 14%. But Coke enjoyed a rally from late 2023 that lasted into 2024, while PepsiCo didn't. All in, investors appear to have been a little more negative about PepsiCo overall.\n\nThat negativity gap extends to their relative valuations. PepsiCo's price-to-sales ratio is nearly 18% below its five-year average. Coca-Cola's P/S ratio is only about 7% lower than its five-year average. Similarly, PepsiCo's price-to-earnings ratio is about 14% below its five-year average while Coca-Cola's P/E is roughly 2% below its average.\n\nAnd then there are their dividend yields. At their current share prices, PepsiCo yields 3.5% while Coca-Cola yields 3.1%. On an absolute level, PepsiCo's yield is more attractive, but there's more to the story. While Coca-Cola's current yield is roughly middle of the road for the stock over recent years, PepsiCo's is near its all-time high. All in all, PepsiCo looks like the better value if you have a value bias when you invest.\n\nSimilarities and differences\n\nTo be fair, these companies are not exactly interchangeable even though their beverage businesses have material overlap. That said, they are similar in many ways. For example, both have increased their dividends annually for over 50 years, earning them both spots among the Dividend Kings. Members of that elite group have proven they can weather the inevitable ups and downs in the business world and keep rewarding their shareholders along the way.\n\nBut consider the difference between them. Coca-Cola has grown its revenue at a slightly faster clip over the past few years, and its earnings have increased at a dramatically faster pace. PepsiCo's full-year earnings growth rates have been stuck in the low single digits while Coca-Cola has been growing earnings at paces in the low double digits. In that light, it makes sense why investors appear to like Coca-Cola more than PepsiCo right now.\n\nBut there's another, more fundamental difference between the two companies. Coca-Cola sells beverages and only beverages. It's good at what it does, but it doesn't have much diversification. PepsiCo, by contrast, sells beverages, snacks, and packaged food products, and it's a major player in each of those businesses. For an investor who wants to gain broad portfolio exposure to the consumer staples sector, PepsiCo could provide that with a single investment. Coca-Cola can't. If diversification is important to you, you'll likely prefer PepsiCo.\n\nNeither is a bad choice\n\nThe truth is that Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are both well-run companies that investors could comfortably buy and hold for decades. But if you are trying to maximize the income your portfolio generates, have a preference for value stocks, or like to own diversified businesses, PepsiCo is likely to be the better choice for your portfolio in 2025.",

It's making me hungry thinking about it right now. On the other hand, even as a 10-year-old, I knew there was something weird about the brand's name and spokeswoman. Without knowing anything about the corporate history, the image clearly seemed slightly racist. Fast forward to the present, and after 100+ years of serving as the brand's image and namesake, in 2021, Quaker Oats announced it was rebranding away from Aunt Jemima. Today, the brand is called the Pearl Milling Company.\n\nThat news probably brought mixed feelings to the relatives of the real-life Aunt Jemima. On the one hand, they might miss seeing their distant great-great relative on grocery shelves around the world. On the other hand, they long contended that the family had never been properly compensated for that usage. I mean, if you're gonna turn my great-great-grandmother into an arguably racist brand icon, the least a company could do is pay me a ton of royalties\u2026\n\nTensions over the image usage boiled over in 2014 when a group of distant Aunt Jemima family members sued Quaker Oats and parent company PepsiCo, seeking $3 BILLION in damages over unpaid royalties and image licensing fees. Damages they arguably deserved\u2026\n\nAunt Jemima History\n\nThe concept of \"Aunt Jemima\" dates back nearly 150 years, decades before the syrup or pancake mix existed. Back in the late 19th century, Aunt Jemima was a popular minstrel show character. For those of you who do not know, a minstrel show was a form of entertainment popular after the Civil War where white actors would dress up in blackface to act out skits that today we would consider horrendously racist.\n\nIn 1875, a song from one such minstrel show titled \"Old Aunt Jemima\" was recorded by an African American songwriter named Billy Kersands. When the song was performed during shows, Aunt Jemima would be portrayed by a white man in blackface who acts out stereotypes of a female former slave who is now a cook.\n\nIn 1889, two actors convinced the Peal Milling Company to use their version of Aunt Jemima as a pancake mix spokeswoman. This first iteration was a failure, and soon, the Pearl Milling Company was sold to the Randolph Truett Davis Milling Company in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nThe R.T. Davis Milling Company hired a real-life former slave named Nancy Green to act as the spokeswoman for the newly launched \"Aunt Jemima\" pancake mix. In 1913, the R.T. Davis Milling Company changed its name officially to \"Aunt Jemima Mills.\" Here's an artist's rendering of Nancy Green's version of Aunt Jemima:\n\nOver the next 33 years, from 1890 until her death in 1923, the real-life Nancy Green worked as \"Aunt Jemima\". Nancy would conduct pancake seminars at fairs and travel to towns across America to spread the word about the pancake mix.\n\nIn 1926, Quaker Oats acquired the Aunt Jemima Mills company. No real-life person was used as an Aunt Jemima for the next decade. A woman named Anna Robinson played the character for Quaker Oats from 1933 to 1935 until she was replaced by a woman named Anna Short Harrington.\n\nAnna Short Harrington\n\nAnna Short Harrington was discovered by Quaker Oats executives at a cooking fair where she had won praise for her own homemade pancake mix. She was exactly what they were looking for in a spokeswoman. Anna was hired on the spot as the company's new full-time real-life Aunt Jemima, and within months, an ad featuring Anna appeared in the magazine Woman's Home Companion. The company also started using her recipe for mass production of their mix. She was paid a modest salary for her role, which allowed her to purchase a small home in Syracuse, New York, where she lived until she died in 1955.\n\nIn 1937, Quaker Oats filed for a trademark for the brand. This is important: In their trademark application, they included a photo of Anna Short Harrington dressed up as Aunt Jemima.\n\nHere is Anna Short Harrington's version of Aunt Jemima:\n\nThe image of Anna Harrington's Aunt Jemima went largely unchanged for more than 50 years. In 1989, Quaker Oats decided it was time to update Jemima's image. The face of Aunt Jemima which most of us are familiar with today, is actually Harrington's youngest daughter, Olivia Hunter.\n\nThis likeness is what you saw on all Aunt Jemima-related products from 1989 until June 2021, when the brand was overhauled as the \"Pearl Milling Company\" in reaction to people who considered the former name racist:\n\nThe Lawsuit\n\nEnter a man named Dannez W. Hunter, Anna Short Harrington's great-grandson. In a class action lawsuit that was filed in August 2014, Hunter alleged that Quaker Oats illegally used his great-grandmother's image and recipes for decades without ever paying a dime in royalties that should have been standard. Furthermore, the suit claimed \"theft in procuring 64 original formulas and 22 menus from Harrington.\" And worst of all, the lawsuit claimed the company dissuaded their great-grandmother from seeking legal help to protect her rights in the trademark registration, taking advantage of her lack of education and age so they would not have to pay her a percentage of sales from her recipes.\n\nThe suit actually accused Quaker Oats and PepsiCo of \"industrial espionage\" in trying to pave over history.\n\nThe suit claimed the companies went out of their way to deny that his great-grandmother ever even worked at the company. Quaker Oats reportedly told Hunter that there were no employment records for Harrington or any proof that she was used as the basis for Aunt Jemima.\n\nThere's just one problem with that argument. Actually two problems. The first problem is the fact that when Quaker Oats filed for the trademark back in 1937, they reportedly included a photo of Anna Short Harrington dressed as Aunt Jemima. Whoops. The second problem is the fact that the company just happened to hire Harrington's daughter Olivia to be the model for the current Jemima. That would be a pretty crazy coincidence, considering the fact that Harrington supposedly never worked for the company.\n\nDamages\n\nIn his lawsuit, Dannez W. Hunter's legal teams cited the standard royalty and residual policies that have been used in Screen Actors Guild (SAG) agreements for decades. Based on these industry standards, plus penalties and late fees, he sought $3 billion in damages from Quaker Oats and parent company PepsiCo. The damages were calculated as $2 billion in cash and $1 billion in Pepsi stock.\n\nLawyers on the other side denied the lawsuit had any merit.\n\nDecision\n\nUnfortunately for Dannez W. Hunter and Harrington's other distant family members, in February 2015, their lawsuit against Quaker Oats and PepsiCo was tossed by a Chicago judge. But the lawsuit was tossed not on merit, but because the judge determined that Dannez could not definitely prove he was related to Harrington or that he represented her estate. In his rule, U.S. District Judge Edmond E. Chang said:\n\n\"Plaintiffs do not allege that they are authorized to act as executors or administrators of Harrington's estate, or even that such an estate exists (or ever existed). The only information about Plaintiffs' connection to Harrington provided by the amended complaint is an account of how Hunter received a photograph (now lost) of Harrington from his grandmother and of Plaintiffs' attempt to locate Harrington's grave in Syracuse, New York.\"\n\nBut note how the above opinion said nothing of the lawsuit's base merits. Just that if there is merit, it needs to be brought by someone who definitively represents Harrington's estate.\n\nIf you enjoy learning the history of massive fortunes, please subscribe to our newsletter Deep Pockets!

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PepsiCo\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Eugene Willemsen, sold US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$170 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$152. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.\n\nInsiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year.

(Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$284m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The PepsiCo Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nThe fact that there have been no PepsiCo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of PepsiCo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

            "content": "Pepsi is hovering around a three-year low with a 3.5% yield.\n\nOne of the most important lessons you can learn as a long-term investor is to know what's driving the market. In 2023 and 2024, megacap growth stocks have been primarily responsible for taking the broader indexes to new heights.\n\nFolks who don't want to ride the growth stock wave have benefited from attractive interest rates from Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, or high-yield savings accounts. In this environment, high-yield dividend stocks are simply not as appealing.\n\nBut during a stock market sell-off, high-yield dividend stocks can be an investor's best friend. Dividends offer a way to earn passive income without selling stocks, which can come in clutch when equity prices fall.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP 0.17%) is a high-yield dividend stock hovering around a three-year low. Here's why patient investors are getting an incredible opportunity to buy Pepsi and why the company can do well even if there is a stock market sell-off.\n\nA manageable slowdown\n\nIn addition to dozens of beverage brands -- from Pepsi to Gatorade to Mountain Dew -- the snack food giant owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, making it a well-rounded company. But Pepsi's growth has slowed as sales volumes are declining across its segments and geographies. Consumers are resisting years of Pepsi price increases.\n\nTo spur demand, Pepsi is offering higher quantities per package to make its products a better value relative to other brands. The company isn't at the top of its game, so it's understandable that the stock price is languishing.\n\nBut this is a fairly minor slowdown for Pepsi, as it's still growing organic sales and earnings at low-single-digit rates. So even in a challenging environment, it's doing fine and should be able to get back on track and resume solid earnings growth next fiscal year.\n\nA recession-resistant business model\n\nPepsi is able to steadily grow earnings no matter what the economy is doing because it is diversified across non-alcoholic beverage and snack categories, and it has a highly sophisticated global distribution network. When consumers tighten their budgets, that usually means pulling back on large discretionary purchases, not low-cost snacks.\n\nPepsi can do well when there's a stock market sell-off. When investors are optimistic, they may pay a higher price for a company's projected earnings. However, when investors are pessimistic, they may gravitate toward companies that are already doing well and should continue to do well no matter the economic cycle. Pepsi is valued for the marketing and distribution of its existing portfolio of snack and beverage brands, making it a reliable choice even for pessimistic investors.\n\nThe stock market saw a massive sell-off in 2022, with the S&P 500 falling 19.4% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbling 33.1%. That year, Pepsi stock went up 4%. That's not to say Pepsi will be that resilient during the next sell-off. But 2022 was a good stress test that showed why value stocks like Pepsi can do well during a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nA stable and growing dividend\n\nPepsi is a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of raising its annual payout to investors. The sell-off in the stock, paired with steady dividend increases, has pushed Pepsi's yield up to 3.5%. That's the most Pepsi has yielded in the last 15 years if you exclude the brief COVID-19-induced stock market plunge in March 2020. However, a company's ability to afford future dividend increases is more important than its track record for past raises or its current yield.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Pepsi raised its dividend by 7%. The company should easily be able to afford a similar raise in 2025. Analyst consensus estimates have Pepsi generating $8.15 in fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and $8.61 in fiscal 2025 EPS. With $5.42 per share in dividends and assuming another 7% increase, Pepsi would be paying out about two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, which is reasonable for a consumer staples company.\n\nA high-conviction buy for the new year\n\nPepsi is the perfect stock for risk-averse investors looking for value in 2025. It has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.6 and a forward P/E of just 18.8. For context, its median P/E over the last decade is 26.1.\n\nThe company can perform well even during economic slowdowns, as evidenced by 52 years of dividend increases -- which occurred under different conditions. Pepsi's yield of 3.5% is much higher than the S&P 500's yield of just 1.2% and higher than the broader consumer staples sector's yield of 2.5%. Pepsi yields more than other consumer staples Dividend Kings like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart -- making it a compelling source of passive income.\n\nAdd it all up, and Pepsi stands out as one of the best dividend stocks to buy in 2025.",

If you are interested in republishing or reposting this article, please contact [email protected].\n\nTwo of the largest palm oil plantations in Peru are located on the west side of the Ucayali River, which flows from the Andes to the Amazon. From above, the surrounding landscape looks like stirred paint: a swirl of green amid inky lakes and brown rivers. Tibecocha, the larger of the two plantations, appears to have been etched into the jungle with a ruler and a straight razor. Its rectangular grid of roads extends over almost 8 miles and contains a million palm trees. The smaller property, Zanja Seca, is nearly the size of Manhattan.\n\nEach year, these plantations generate about $50 million in revenue for the Ocho Sur group, whose palm oil has ended up in products ranging from Cheetos to Colgate toothpaste. The $160 million that the company\u2019s backers, primarily US venture capitalists and private equity funds, have spent on its operations represents the largest foreign investment in agriculture in the history of the Peruvian Amazon.\n\nThe palm industry got off the ground here thanks to US development programs designed to give farmers a money-making alternative to growing coca plants, the precursor to cocaine, and the US ambassador to Peru even paid a visit to Ocho Sur\u2019s properties last year. Ocho Sur\u2019s operations are now so vast, and it is such a dominant force in the region\u2019s economy, that locals refer to it simply as la empresa \u2014 \u201cthe company.\u201d\n\nBut the creation of the plantations came at a steep price. To make way for those industrial fields of palm trees, some 30,000 acres of rainforest were cut down, a swath of destruction that one Indigenous leader called an act of \u201ceco-genocide.\u201d Biologists from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum have ranked the rugged mountains that rise west of the plantations \u201camong the most diverse of all conservation areas in Peru.\u201d When the museum\u2019s team surveyed the region for three weeks in 2000, it tallied 1,600 species of plants, 71 species of mammals, and more than 500 species of birds. At least 28 species were new to science.\n\nOcho Sur\u2019s Tibecocha oil palm plantation, Ucayali, Peru.\n\nSince the 1960s, more than 13% of the original Amazonian rainforest has been cleared. Most of the destruction has been concentrated in Brazil, but Peru is second on the list. If the destruction continues, Thomas Lovejoy, a former biodiversity advisor to the World Bank, has argued that the Amazon could reach a tipping point and become too hot, dry, and fire-prone to remain a rainforest. Without the carbon-absorbing capacity of the Amazon, the world would face increasing temperatures and melting the ice caps, making cities as far away as Mumbai virtually unlivable.\n\nSeeking to be a model of sustainable development, Ocho Sur has signed pacts with local communities to conserve the native ecosystem, and its polished English-language website features a slideshow of anteaters, sloths, and monkeys. The company has replaced its trucks and tractors with mules and water buffalo and has vowed not to expand its operations into standing forest. Over the past two years, Ocho Sur says, it has spent $3 million maintaining roads and building schools and medical clinics.\n\nWhen the company\u2019s CEO, Michael Spoor, who joined Ocho Sur in 2019, talks about the company\u2019s accomplishments, he draws a sharp line between the Ocho Sur Group and whoever it was who first staked a claim in the virgin territory. \u201cWe came to Peru in 2016 and bought two farms in Ucayali at a public auction,\u201d he has said. \u201cAll that we have done, we have done without deforesting anything.\u201d\n\nDocuments I obtained from a criminal investigation into Ocho Sur \u2014 along with an exclusive trove of internal company emails, bank records, and spreadsheets covering eight years of plantation operations \u2014 tell a more complex story about the role of the company\u2019s founders in the original destruction of the rainforest. At its heart is an American businessman named Dennis Melka, who a Peruvian prosecutor has claimed is the ringleader of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that passed mature plantations from one company his investors had bankrolled, United Oils, onto a second, Ocho Sur. After the transfer, I found, key personnel from United Oils remained in place \u2014 including Melka. Most importantly, prosecutors say that United Oils illegally cleared much of the plantation land, and that Ocho Sur, for all of its sustainable initiatives, is in many respects the same entity as its clear-cutting predecessor. Melka has not responded publicly to the prosecutors\u2019 allegations and did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOcho Sur\u2019s links to deforestation have profound implications for businesses, consumers, and the environment \u2014 and what exactly counts as \u201csustainability\u201d in the palm oil industry. The global market for palm oil, valued at more than $70 billion last year, is experiencing steady growth, driven by its use in products as varied as food, beverages, biofuels, and cosmetics. Last year, the European Union passed new regulations on deforestation that promised to be the strictest in the world. Companies like Ocho Sur are now racing to demonstrate that their plantations were not illegally deforested \u2014 or risk losing their share of the lucrative market. But it may not be that easy.\n\n\u201cNearly everything they export has been illegally produced,\u201d Julia Urrunaga, who leads research in Peru for a Washington, DC-based environmental organization, argues. \u201cWhat needs to happen here is they need to be sanctioned, and they need to be ordered to reforest and leave.\u201d\n\nMichael Spoor at the Tibecocha plantation. He\u2019s been Ocho Sur\u2019s CEO since 2019.\n\nIn April, Michael Spoor invited me to spend a few days visiting Ocho Sur\u2019s plantations and the surrounding communities. The company was losing buyers left and right. That month, PepsiCo, which had used Ocho Sur palm oil in its Cheetos and Doritos, became the latest global brand to be named in the media over the historic deforestation. Spoor was eager to tell his side of the story.\n\nThe company\u2019s headquarters are on the fifth floor of the Wyndham hotel in the regional capital of Pucallpa, a city of 300,000 on the banks of the Ucayali River. When I met Spoor in the lobby one morning, he was wearing what passes for executive attire in these parts: a loose nylon shirt, khaki pants, and hiking boots. He looked more like a tourist heading off to hike the ruins of Machu Picchu than the head of a palm oil empire.\n\nThe son of a Protestant minister in Iowa, Spoor earned a degree in civil engineering before working for Exxon and leading companies that recycled spent oils and other industrial waste. One of his operations, NewStream, which Spoor ran from 2008 to 2014, was accused by the Massachusetts attorney general of illegally dumping wastewater tainted with lead, chromium, and other hazardous chemicals into a municipal treatment facility that flows into the Ten Mile River. In April 2014, Spoor signed a consent decree on behalf of NewStream to settle the case and the company paid a fine; he has denied that NewStream released any hazardous waste. Two months later, he headed to Latin America. His first stop was Mexico, to run another waste recycler. Then, in 2019, he joined Ocho Sur to oversee a different kind of cleanup.\n\nBefore accepting the position, Spoor visited the plantations with one of Ocho Sur\u2019s shareholders. He marveled at the efficiency of the African oil palm, which can produce five times as much edible oil per acre as corn or soy. Every 10 days, each tree develops a 50-pound cluster of fruits oozing with thick, red oil. They will keep producing for the next 20 years. The catch is that oil palm can be profitably grown only within 10 degrees of the equator, a region that overlaps with the planet\u2019s most biodiverse ecosystems.\n\nAs environmental activists raised the alarm about the palm oil industry\u2019s toll on the tropical forests of Southeast Asia two decades ago, Unilever, the world\u2019s largest buyer of palm oil, teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund and other parties to establish the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The roundtable launched a program in 2007 that certifies growers whose plantations are not on recently deforested or contested lands. Only a fifth of palm oil sold across the globe was certified by 2022. Spoor\u2019s mission was to get Ocho Sur\u2019s crop certified as deforestation-free, but exactly what that means depends on when you start the clock.\n\nSpoor and I headed out of Pucallpa in a four-wheel-drive truck driven by Krassimir Doldourov, a chain-smoking Bulgarian who oversees the plantation\u2019s road maintenance work. After an hour, Doldourov swung onto a dirt road with tire-swallowing holes. We passed abandoned farms, cattle pastures, and stray dogs, but not much forest. Finally, Doldourov maneuvered the truck down the scoured bank of a large, brown river, a tributary to the Ucayali, and onto the platform of Ocho Sur\u2019s pontoon-style ferry, powered by two outboard motors.\n\nOn the other side of the river, we passed a series of signs Spoor had installed when he took the job. \u201cWe work in harmony with nature,\u201d read one. \u201cWe protect wildlife,\u201d read another. \u201cWe conserve forests,\u201d read a third.\n\nJulia Urrunaga, who leads research in Peru for the Environmental Investigation Agency, says of Ocho Sur, \u201cThey need to be ordered to reforest and leave.\u201d\n\nAs Spoor pointed out, most deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon today comes at the hands of small-scale farmers, and he wanted to convince me that industrial agriculture, which had deepened climate impacts elsewhere, could achieve the opposite here. Ocho Sur is the largest formal employer in the Department of Ucayali and accounts for about half of its exports, meaning that it provides economic opportunities to thousands of people who might otherwise be clearing forest for cattle or short-lived crops like banana or cassava. Oil palm, as he rightly noted, can sequester more carbon than such annual crops, though studies have found it absorbs less than half that of a standing forest. \u201cIt\u2019s a permanent crop that\u2019s going to grow for decades and decades and decades,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that people are going to do here in the jungle?\u201d Doldourov asked. \u201cThey are going to grow coca.\u201d\n\nIn Spoor\u2019s view, only sustained investment could lead to the cultivation of valuable crops like oil palm on all the degraded land we had passed. If not, he said, settlers will keep clearing primary forest and abandoning the spent land a few years later. Fighting this migratory agriculture was one of the goals of Peru\u2019s National Plan to Promote Oil Palm, enacted in 2000, which helped attract the company\u2019s investors to the region over a decade ago. \u201cThose plantations, 20 years from now, will be the greenest areas in the whole zone,\u201d Spoor said. \u201cPeople are going to look back and go, \u2018Wow, look at those two islands of green!\u2019 and, in some weird way, that will have been the result of what we started.\u201d\n\nTo dig deeper into the origins of Ocho Sur\u2019s plantations, I flew north to the jungle city of Iquitos to meet with William Park, a self-described \u201ceco-social entrepreneur\u201d from Bronxville, New York. Over an a\u00e7ai bowl at the Dawn on the Amazon Caf\u00e9, a favorite spot for travelers and expats, Park relayed his life story. He had served in the Marine Corps and earned a biology degree in college, but a childhood meeting with the founder of the organic food company Arrowhead Mills shaped his unconventional path. After a job running sales for a hemp apparel company, he lit out for Peru, where he launched Eco Ola, an export business in Amazonian superfoods, with the goal of helping local communities develop sustainable economies from their native forests. Operating between two worlds \u2014 conservation and business \u2014 made him particularly suited to recognize what had unfolded here on the Amazon River back in June 2013.\n\nOne day, Park was sitting on this same patio when he heard troubling news from a friend who lived upriver in Tamshiyacu, an isolated village on the edge of an uninterrupted swath of rainforest that stretched for hundreds of miles. The region, which is believed to have the world\u2019s greatest concentration of uncontacted Indigenous groups, is also home to several threatened species, including the bald-headed uakari monkey. \u201cIt\u2019s a vitally important area,\u201d Park said. Now, according to Park\u2019s friend, a massive palm oil plantation was springing up in the area. Workers had been conducting surveys and slashing paths with machetes.\n\nOil palm fruits being processed at Ocho Sur\u2019s mill in Ucayali. Every 10 days, each tree develops a 50-pound cluster of fruits oozing with thick, red oil.\n\nInitially, Park was skeptical. He often heard rumors of new megaprojects, but they usually fell apart before they got off the ground or turned out to be scams. Tamshiyacu seemed too remote to be worth anyone\u2019s while, he thought.\n\nHe was wrong. Before long, workers showed up there with two dozen bulldozers and excavators. They proceeded east, widening and grading a dirt road for some 6 miles until they reached their destination. \u201cClearcutting happening now, the neighboring communities are not happy,\u201d Park wrote to an environmentalist he knew. \u201cThe name of the company and its international affiliations are not known but it is rumored to be a Malaysian company.\u201d\n\nHis email eventually landed in the inbox of Matt Finer, a scientist then with the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington, DC. Finer hunted for satellite images to confirm the devastation, while other environmentalists followed a paper trail to figure out who was behind the operation. Julia Urrunaga, who works as a researcher with the Environmental Investigation Agency tracking deforestation in the region, discovered a network of companies recently registered in the region. First, she found \u201cPlantaciones de Loreto\u201d based in Iquitos, then \u201cPlantaciones de Ucayali.\u201d Ultimately, she unearthed more than two dozen interrelated companies. Like a series of nesting dolls, six of these companies were owned by two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, which were in turn owned by a Cayman Islands-based company called United Oils Limited. This corporate labyrinth obscured the true shareholders and decision-makers, but one figure stood out in the records: Dennis Melka.\n\nWorkers at the Ocho Sur palm oil plantation.\n\nIn business records Urrunaga obtained and recently shared with me, Melka is the only one authorized by each of these entities to approve payments for \u201can unlimited amount.\u201d\n\nMelka, Urrunaga learned, was a venture capitalist who had made his name developing palm oil plantations on Borneo, but she couldn\u2019t find much detail about his plans for Peru, or even what crops he planned to grow. Images online showed a sharply dressed man in his late 30s with a bald head and blue eyes.\n\nFiner, meanwhile, got his hands on the first clear satellite images showing strips of bare, red earth in the forest as the Tamshiyacu plantation took shape. Finer notified a journalist at the local newspaper, La Regi\u00f3n, and a photograph of the naked landscape ended up on the front page. \u201cWhere is the environmental prosecutor?\u201d the paper asked.\n\nThey didn\u2019t yet know that Melka\u2019s clearing and planting was already further along in Ucayali.\n\nWhen I first heard about Melka\u2019s role in these events some years ago, I tried to talk to him in person at a conference in San Francisco. He was in his element, pitching investors, and looked relaxed in jeans and a blazer as he handed me his business card in a hotel banquet hall. He would be flying to Peru a few days later. When I started to ask about the deforestation allegations against him, his face grew tense, and he waved me away. \u201cI created thousands of jobs in Peru,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d\n\nFrom what I learned without his cooperation, Melka grew up in Marin County, California, and his first job out of college was at Credit Suisse in New York. After postings in London and Prague, he found his niche in the free-market mecca of Singapore, where he set up his own venture capital fund in 2006.\n\nIn those days, palm oil was booming on Borneo, a 90-minute flight to the east. \u201cWhen I started meeting the companies and talking to them, I realized this was a phenomenal business,\u201d Melka later told a Singaporean publication. \u201cThat\u2019s something I want to get into.\u201d\n\nHis biggest problem was that most available land on Borneo and other parts of Indonesia and Malaysia was controlled by Indigenous people or held in state forestry concessions. \u201cWithout special connections within the government, you won\u2019t be able to secure this land,\u201d a former Melka employee told me. Melka soon made those connections through a business partner, Graeme Iain Brown, whose father-in-law, according to an industry report, was a former Indonesian cabinet minister.\n\nIn 2009, Melka and his partners founded a company called Asian Plantations that obtained 50,000 acres of rainforest through what the company called \u201cnon-competitive\u201d negotiations based on \u201clong standing local relationships.\u201d They proceeded to clear-cut their land and plant oil palm, according to satellite analyses conducted by the Environmental Investigation Agency. Six years later, as a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, they sold that operation to Felda Global Ventures, the third-largest palm oil company in the world, for almost $200 million. (Brown told me the notions that they had deforested any land or benefitted from family connections were \u201ctotally false.\u201d)\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia dominated global palm oil production at the time, but usable land was predicted to run out by the end of the decade and Melka was already on the hunt for new territory. Company emails show that he reached out to government officials in the newly created country of South Sudan and in Myanmar, which was just opening for business after emerging from a military dictatorship. But Peru topped his list.\n\nUnder President Alan Garc\u00eda, Peru was welcoming foreign investors with open arms. Not only was Garc\u00eda\u2019s government offering sweetheart deals to foreign investors under its National Plan to Promote Oil Palm, but the country had more than 3 million acres suitable for oil palm. \u201cTax free at all levels!\u201d Melka raved in an email to a London-based investment advisor. \u201cLabor costs at US$11.50 per day. . . !\u201d And, unlike in much of Southeast Asia, Peru allowed foreigners to own plantations outright. Palm oil, as he put it in his pitch, was \u201cthe most profitable crop that humans can grow outside of narcotics.\u201d\n\nIt was more than a clever line.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the rise of the palm oil industry in Peru has been directly stimulated by the United Nations and by the US Agency for International Development, which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars there funding organizations that work to redirect coca farmers toward alternative crops. The first oil palm project, spearheaded by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 1991, helped 270 families in Ucayali \u2014 largely refugees fleeing Shining Path guerillas \u2014 to establish 3,000 acres of oil palm along a highway near Pucallpa. The United States later financed a mill that would be run by a farmer cooperative.\n\nBruno Tangoa, chief of the Shambo Porvenir indigenous community in the Ucayali region, who grow palm oil for Ocho Sur on their land.\n\nRolf Wachholtz, an economist hired to evaluate one of the UN\u2019s coca-eradication programs in 2010, praised it for improving the livelihoods of farmers but stressed that the UN needed to \u201cfocus more on environmental issues,\u201d including deforestation.\n\nMelka worked to take full advantage of the government aid. After making connections with diplomats and development agencies in multiple countries, he was even hired by USAID to provide a financier\u2019s perspective on its work in Peru. \u201cThe Peruvian industry needs scale,\u201d he said in a draft report he prepared in 2010. \u201cAll UN & USAID efforts should be focused on growing the productive resource and planting land.\u201d\n\nThat November, he repeated the theme when he gave a talk in Lima organized by the UN, along with his business partner Bill Randall, the managing director of Pacific Agri Capital, a private equity firm that Melka founded in 2008 to fund his Malaysian plantations. Peru still had only 100,000 acres of palm under cultivation, and Melka was seeking to triple that number, according to a documentary film, \u201cThe King of Cocaland.\u201d \u201cHe could impress anybody,\u201d said Wachholtz, the UN evaluator, who was in the audience that day. \u201cI found it crazy.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Melka established the first eight Peruvian corporations for the plantations he wanted to develop \u2014 several of which, according to company records, would be acquired by his offshore holding company, United Oils. In a letter to local authorities, he wrote that his company had \u201cextensive experience implementing the world\u2019s best practices for environmental stewardship.\u201d\n\nDuring a meeting at the US Embassy in Lima, Melka was introduced to Alfredo Rivera Loarte, an agronomist at the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Melka promptly hired him as a consultant to oversee plantation operations. Rivera\u2019s son Julio also came on board, as did another UN employee, Maria Teresa Trigoso. Doldourov, who drove Spoor and me around during my visit, had also worked at the UN, and built roads for United Oils before joining Ocho Sur.\n\nStay in the Loop!

Email * CAPTCHA Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nAlong with United Oils, Melka created United Cacao, having decided that the Tamshiyacu plantation to the north was better suited for that crop. Melka boasted of his UN ties every chance he got, writing in one pitch document that his senior managers collectively had several decades of experience with the organization.\n\nOver the next three years, Melka raised $38 million for United Oils, according to the company\u2019s shareholder records. Seed funds came from wealthy friends and friends of friends, some of whom told me they hadn\u2019t fully appreciated what they were supporting.\n\n\u201cAt some point I had started to learn more about orangutans and how they were being impacted by palm oil plantations\u201d on Borneo, said one American investor, who was so ashamed by his participation that he asked me to withhold his name. \u201cOh, fuck,\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cI just put my money with someone who is clearing forest in the Amazon.\u201d\n\nMelka quickly lined up more than a dozen investors. Early financers included Eric Varvel, then the CEO of Credit Suisse in the Asia-Pacific region and Steadfast Financial, a New York hedge fund with over $8 billion under management. At the company\u2019s launch, the majority shareholder, with $10 million in equity, was a fund managed by Randall at Pacific Agri Capital. Randall\u2019s fund received $3 million in capital from Anholt Services, a holding company that managed the $2 billion trust left behind by the Danish petroleum shipping magnate Torben Karlshoej, who founded Teekay. Though Anholt was an indirect investor in United Oils, the company received a privileged view of the company\u2019s inner workings directly from Melka, according to a confidentiality agreement signed in September 2012.\n\nIn 2014, after being assured by local counsel that Melka was complying with Peruvian laws, Anholt joined with a core group of shareholders in providing United Oils with an additional $48 million through a private bond offering. \u201cThe business can support easily US$50m in debt or so (or more),\u201d Melka assured a shareholder in an email. He had purchased $7 million of the company\u2019s debt himself.\n\nMelka told his shareholders that he was aiming for an initial public offering on either the Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange in early 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve been meeting with mid-tier investment banks with positive feedback,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGranted i-banks will always whisper \u2018sweet nothings\u2019 in a client\u2019s ear but at least there is interest.\u201d\n\nThe next challenge was acquiring land for the plantations. Outside conservation areas and Indigenous communities, much of the Peruvian Amazon was in the hands of regional governments: Undivided, untitled, and unclaimed, it was controlled by a glacial bureaucracy in a country where government corruption was widespread.\n\nWith his fresh infusion of cash, Melka needed to either find large blocks of land that cash-strapped authorities in Ucayali were willing to swiftly title and sell to him directly, or buy individual properties from homesteaders \u2014 settlers who had obtained \u201ccertificates of possession\u201d for untitled state lands by proving they had used it continuously for at least one year. According to Juan Luis Dammert Bello, a Peruvian geographer who has studied the growth of plantations in the Amazon, buying land from settlers is an attractive loophole for large developers who are restricted from clearing forest themselves.\n\nIncreasingly, shady intermediaries known as land traffickers were organizing peasants to invade untitled lands and then packaging and selling the properties for a profit. Sometimes, the \u201csettlers\u201d they enlisted never actually set foot on the land they were claiming: They just signed a document asserting that they had. Land-trafficking mafias, which operate in every region of Peru, have allowed developers to launder unclaimed swaths of rainforest into legal farmland. But experts say Melka\u2019s enablers would be the first to carry it out on such a large scale.\n\n\u201cMelka is the game changer,\u201d Dammert told me. \u201cThere is a before and an after.\u201d\n\nMelka used his UN ties to identify promising opportunities, according to \u201cThe King of Cocaland,\u201d the documentary film about Hans-Jochen Wiese, the leader of the UN\u2019s alternative development program in Peru. \u201cI was supposed to designate land suitable for growing oil palms,\u201d Pablo Ram\u00edrez Mori, an official with the regional agriculture authority in Ucayali told the filmmakers. Wiese, Ram\u00edrez said, \u201cagreed to this or that zone.\u201d Ram\u00edrez declined my request for an interview, saying it was \u201cup to the authorities to follow the process\u201d; Wiese, who died in an accident last year, had said his only goal in helping Melka was to help the Peruvian people.\n\nIn 2012, Melka acquired the 17,000-acre Tibecocha property, which included 222 parcels owned by an association of farmers. The association\u2019s members had obtained certificates of possession years earlier under questionable circumstances, according to Dammert\u2019s research. Apart from the extraction of high-value timber, Peruvian auditors found little evidence that they had cultivated it in a sustained way during their tenure, as required under the law. Most of them didn\u2019t even live nearby. Dammert has called it a textbook example of \u201cghost titling,\u201d where government officials create an association whose ranks they fill primarily with friends and relatives, hoping to profit from a subsequent sale. One sales contract, for a 109-acre parcel, indicates that Melka paid members of the group about $100 an acre.\n\nSome 10 miles west of Tibecocha, Melka obtained a second property, Zanja Seca, by different means. This included 11,000 acres of state land in Ucayali that had already been surveyed and would soon be mass-titled in an effort to support a hundred or so subsistence farmers who had abandoned coca under a USAID-funded program. As soon as they received their certificates of possession, these farmers were hoping to plant cacao and oil palm. But after a massive fiscal decentralization, the Ucayali government was in need of cash. Ucayali authorities began dragging their feet in finalizing the homesteading paperwork, according to a legal complaint filed by the farmers. Then, to their great surprise, Melka purchased all 11,000 acres directly from the state for a steal: $25 an acre. (This month, three officials were sentenced to prison by an anti-corruption court for abuse of their positions in making that deal.)\n\nWith his lands in hand, Melka hired contractors to bulldoze the forest, burying the trees in trenches to improve the poor tropical soil. Analyses of satellite images conducted by the Peruvian government and environmental groups indicate that more than 90% of the Zanja Seca and Tibecocha properties were covered with primary or secondary forest at the time Melka took ownership. A million palm seeds were soon imported from Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Ivory Coast. Worker camps, dining areas, and soccer fields were erected.\n\nWith Melka\u2019s development of the plantations came new roads, followed by more homesteaders, speculators, and land traffickers, according to Dammert and other researchers. Oil palm spread in the uplands, rice crops in the peatlands. Land conflicts were on the rise. Melka\u2019s two plantations were like a tightening vise, forcing communities in the middle to decide whether they would work with the company or against it.\n\nThe Tibecocha plantation stretches across 17,000 acres of what was once rainforest.\n\nOne of the communities trapped in this vise was Santa Clara de Uchunya, an Indigenous Shipibo village tucked away in a looping bend of the Aguayt\u00eda River, a tributary of the Ucayali. The Peruvian state granted the community about 540 acres in 1986. It wasn\u2019t much, but they had only to cross the river to hunt wild game, gather native fruits, and harvest natural dyes for pottery and textiles they sold in local markets. Now, those forests were being cleared.\n\nIn an April 2015 letter to the director of the regional agriculture authority, the leaders of Santa Clara de Uchunya complained about their situation. \u201cOur ancestral territory has been granted to Plantaciones de Pucallpa for the planting of oil palm,\u201d they wrote. They requested a territorial expansion to make up for what was being lost. And to help their cause they summoned a prominent Indigenous activist, Washington Bol\u00edvar D\u00edaz, a descendant of the neighboring Kakataibo people.\n\nBol\u00edvar had helped found a federation uniting nine Kakataibo communities and became an eloquent defender of Indigenous rights. He was immediately recognizable by his long hair and the beaded necklaces and headdresses he wore for meetings.\n\nIn May 2015, Boliv\u00e1r filed a legal complaint with Peru\u2019s Public Ministry, which has the power to launch criminal investigations. In it, he alleged that corrupt officials in the regional agriculture department had conspired with Melka\u2019s company to steal and deforest their lands. He described visiting the Tibecocha property one morning that month with a contingent from Santa Clara de Uchunya as part of a government inspection. Bol\u00edvar said he was shocked to hear \u201ccrying baby monkeys\u201d and \u201cwounded animals looking for their mothers\u201d as the sun beat down on a landscape that had become \u201ca cemetery of trees.\u201d\n\nMelka tended to move fast, and that held true as he snapped up land. A new, stricter agricultural law had gone into force in Peru in 2012, but he didn\u2019t wait for the government\u2019s sign-off on an environmental management plan or obtain a \u201cchange of use\u201d authorization to demonstrate the property\u2019s suitability for growing crops, according to a 2022 audit by Peru\u2019s comptroller general. Nor did he leave 30% of the property\u2019s forest cover intact, as required under the law, the audit found. In some cases, the audit said, Melka had cleared property he did not even own, including several hundred acres of a state-owned timberland known as the Biabo Cordillera Azul, which abutted the Tibecocha lands.\n\nNone of that corner-cutting stopped Melka from working toward his dream of earning environmental plaudits for his palm oil. In October 2013, a United Oils subsidiary, Plantaciones de Pucallpa, joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Becoming a member was the first step toward getting the farm certified as 100% sustainable, which could mean a 2% to 7% premium in US and European markets. According to roundtable records, Melka\u2019s subsidiary affirmed that it had not cleared any forest for Tibecocha. Melka prepared for certification by commissioning an art-deco-style poster showing a worker hoisting a palm seedling in front of a pale yellow sun. \u201cUnited Oils,\u201d it reads. \u201cWorld\u2019s Finest Palm Oil.\u201d\n\nAn Ocho Sur weighing station. The company purchases oil palm fruits from local growers it has verified as deforestation-free.\n\nGovernment investigators were now fanning out across Ucayali to interview hundreds of suspects and witnesses, as part of the criminal investigation that Bol\u00edvar\u2019s complaint set off. They soon discovered Melka was on the verge of pulling off his most brazen scheme. To skirt the reputational risks of buying more land directly, his employees had begun selecting parcels for homesteaders to clear themselves, then lending them money for fertilizer and seedlings.\n\nThey would effectively become contract farmers for United Oils \u2014 in debt to the company from the moment they set foot on their new land.\n\nMelka\u2019s team had pitched the idea directly to farmers. \u201cWhat is oil palm? Where will it take us?\u201d one of the sons of Alfredo Rivera, the manager Melka hired after his decades with the United Nations, told a group gathered near Zanja Seca, according to a transcript by a researcher who attended the meeting. \u201cLook, how I have credit cards like a casino! One for my wife, one for me, another one for my wife, and another one for me. That is what oil palm is.\u201d\n\nThe farmers\u2019 paperwork would get fast-tracked by the regional agriculture director, a man named Isaac Huam\u00e1n P\u00e9rez who was a true believer in the promise of oil palm to alleviate poverty. \u201cWhat alternatives do we have?\u201d he asked me. Though he said he had never met Melka, he had longstanding ties to the United Oils team. He had known Alfredo Rivera since the 1990s. Huam\u00e1n also told me he was \u201ca great friend\u201d of Ulises Salda\u00f1a Bardales, the former mayor of Pucallpa whom Melka had hired as institutional relations manager.\n\nOne of the farmers who seized the opportunity was Freddy Monteluiz Paima, who lives with his wife and two children in the community of Esperanza, a village on the left bank of the Aguayt\u00eda. When I arrived at his wooden home one May afternoon, he told me that he had no idea what oil palm was until Melka\u2019s people arrived.\n\nBut the money sounded good, and he said he happily joined 16 other residents in 2015 who heeded the company\u2019s call. They grabbed their chainsaws and piled onto several tuk tuks, heading out to a 500-acre plot of land that a local land trafficker had told them they could claim as their own to cultivate oil palm for the company. \u201cThat is where the conflict began,\u201d he recalled.\n\nMelka had sought to bring another 12,000 acres into cultivation through this sharecropping strategy. In fact, a total of 128 certificates of possession, totaling at least 7,000 acres, were rubber-stamped by the titling division overseen by Huam\u00e1n, the regional agricultural director. Apart from Monteluiz and a few others from Esperanza, most of the other new landholders had no connection to the area; some went to relatives of Huam\u00e1n or other officials in his office, according to a prosecutorial report I obtained. When Ucayali\u2019s field-titling team visited the area in September 2015, the settlers could not even point out their own parcels. The property lines had all been drawn in a back office in Pucallpa, signed off on by the town\u2019s mayor, who was working with the land trafficker. The process was so haphazard that some of the parcels Huam\u00e1n approved were partway inside a lake.\n\nThe plan quickly backfired. On September 24, 2015, according to prosecutors\u2019 records and interviews with participants, Bol\u00edvar and a few dozen residents of Santa Clara de Uchunya, outfitted with rusty machetes and rifles, headed out to the disputed land to confront the settlers. Monteluiz and his companions fled into the jungle, leaving behind their chainsaws.\n\nBy then Julia Urrunaga, of the Environmental Investigation Agency, had published the first detailed report on Melka\u2019s modus operandi in Malaysian Borneo and Peru, arguing that a failure to prosecute him would be \u201cto expose Peru\u2019s national forest patrimony to rampant illegality and ultimately deforestation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost is simply too high, the victims too many, for Peru not to act,\u201d she and her colleagues wrote.\n\nPeruvian regulators had issued a stop-work order to the Zanja Seca plantation for failing to comply with environmental regulations; now they ordered work to halt on the Tibecocha plantation too. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil followed suit with its own stop-work order.\n\nIn a response to the roundtable, the company wrote, \u201cMost of these lands had been degraded by the illegal cultivation of coca, and by other exploitations of the forest, such as illegal timber and migratory cultivation over 40 years.\u201d As for the growing international controversy, Melka responded by lashing out. In one unsigned email to a Czech journalist, he called Bol\u00edvar \u201ca total fraud\u201d and warned the reporter to \u201ccease and desist from attacking our company.\u201d\n\nFor over a year, Melka was able to defy the stop-work orders and operate without consequence. He could not, however, operate without capital. The first revenue from palm oil sales wouldn\u2019t arrive until the end of 2016, and he was so underfinanced, according to one investor, that he wasn\u2019t spending enough to adequately fertilize the trees. \u201cBank accounts are empty,\u201d Melka emailed his board. \u201cSuppliers are physically protesting outside the office doors.\u201d\n\nThat February, United Oils defaulted on a $5 million interest payment on its corporate bonds. The $48 million principal would be due in six months time. Melka wrote his shareholders to say that his attempts to obtain bridge financing had gone nowhere. United Oils was on the verge of insolvency, and Melka would soon be publicly named in a criminal investigation against the company and its collaborators.\n\nThe crisis pitted Melka\u2019s investors against one another. Some shareholders stood to gain in a bankruptcy and some stood to lose, depending on how much of the company\u2019s debt they held.\n\nThe company\u2019s final balance sheet, dated March 2016, tallied the company\u2019s assets at $77 million. If a foreclosure auction reaped offers in that ballpark, the surplus could pay back most of what the shareholders had put in, and then some.\n\nBut debt trumps equity, and Anholt, the lead creditor with more than a third of the debt, had oversight over any sale. That gave Bill Randall of Pacific Agri Capital grave concerns: Though Randall\u2019s funds had been pivotal in the company\u2019s early days, they had only purchased 6% of the company\u2019s debt. Anholt, he warned in a May 11 memo, might try to \u201ckeep the price of the assets as low as possible and attract as little number of bidders for the assets as possible.\u201d\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, Anholt\u2019s lawyer wrote back, creditors had no obligation to achieve the highest possible price. As for Melka, company balance sheets show that his stake in the plantations would remain around 15% after a sale. (Randall did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Anholt referred all questions about its investment to Spoor.)\n\nAdvertisements soon appeared in the pages of El Peruano and The Jakarta Post inviting interested bidders to participate in a public auction of the plantations. On the auction\u2019s final day, July 14, Anholt and the other bondholders acquired all of United Oils\u2019 assets in exchange for forgiveness of their debt.\n\nThe new company\u2019s name: Ocho Sur.\n\nCorporate records indicate that 18 of the 19 shareholders in Ocho Sur funded entities that bankrolled Melka\u2019s work clearing and planting of the rainforest between 2012 and 2014. With Melka and other key personnel from the early days remaining involved, the only truly new player was Amerra Capital Management, a New York private equity firm whose funds purchased $10 million of United Oils\u2019 bonds.\n\nAccording to Peruvian prosecutors, Amerra had been told in a due-diligence document that United Oils had \u201ccaused the deforestation of approximately 7,000 hectares.\u201d Amerra\u2019s managing partner, Craig Tashjian, declined to comment, but a person who worked on the portfolio told me the information they received on the legality of the plantations was inconclusive. \u201cWe looked at this so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the investors took it for granted that Melka was right.\u201d\n\n\u00c1lvaro Rod\u00e1s Farro, the prosecutor specializing in organized crime who named Ocho Sur in the case against Melka, has argued that the transfer of the mature plantations was part of a criminal conspiracy in which Melka was the ringleader. He dubbed the maneuver \u201ccovert business succession.\u201d\n\nThe company has robustly denied this claim. \u201cOcho Sur is not the continuation of any previous company,\u201d the company wrote in February in response to a new report from the Environmental Investigation Agency. \u201cIt is incorrect and impossible to attribute to it any alleged actions that occurred before its existence.\u201d\n\nAs for the tight-knit circle of environmentalists in Peru who had been tracking Melka for the last several years, they were in the dark during the 2016 transition.\n\nUnless you had a budget for bodyguards \u2014 and Lucila Pautrat Oyarz\u00fan, the forest engineer who runs Ken\u00e9, a tiny Peruvian environmental NGO, certainly didn\u2019t \u2014 it was too dangerous to travel to Pucallpa at that time. Since 2010, at least 29 environmental defenders have been killed in the Peruvian Amazon. Pautrat instead monitored the situation from Lima, in a modest third-floor apartment where the shades were always drawn, messaging with government informants and managing undercover investigators.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until January 2017 that Pautrat first saw the name Ocho Sur in a document she obtained from the Peruvian business registry. Then she got a tip that Melka was still visiting Pucallpa, in his roles as a consultant and a member of the board. In fact, she learned, several key players \u2014 including Alfredo Rivera, Ulises Salda\u00f1a, and Krassimir Doldorouv \u2014 continued working their old jobs for the new company. Ocho Sur kept the same United Oils offices in what would become the Wyndham hotel. The signs were simply updated.\n\nThe campaigns against Ocho Sur \u2014 funded by what he called a \u201cpowerful, transnational ideological machine\u201d with \u201climitless\u201d cash \u2014 had cost the company millions in legal fees. Michael Spoor\n\nPautrat believed that she was witnessing a greenwashing operation of epic proportions.\n\nSoon, some of United Oils\u2019 enablers, including Isaac Huam\u00e1n, were sentenced to prison for obstruction of justice. But the plantations were receiving fresh investment; Amerra brought a crop consultant over from England, and the shareholders put their money into building a state-of-the-art mill.\n\nMichael Spoor was hired in 2019 after being recommended by an old friend, Joseph Massoud, the managing director of Anholt. Spoor said the overlap in employment in the company was not \u201csurprising or suspicious\u201d given how few qualified professionals are available in the region.\n\nOne of his first acts after taking the company\u2019s helm was to get rid of Melka. \u201cI went to the board of directors, and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t think we have a chance of success if he remains associated with the project,'\u201d Spoor told me. The company bought out Melka\u2019s shares and ended his consulting contract.\n\nNext, Spoor and the company\u2019s lawyers worked to get the $2.5 million in fines the company owed to government agencies overturned. In order to get the land reclassified as farmland, they had to pay the state approximately $450,000 to cover harvest rights for the timber that Melka had chopped down. In any event, Spoor thought he was making progress toward resolving the outstanding claims against the company. Then, in 2022, Peru\u2019s comptroller general released three audits, concluding that, despite the agency reversals Spoor had orchestrated, Ocho Sur\u2019s plantations could never be brought into compliance with existing laws. Spoor took issue with the agency\u2019s findings, saying the officials had \u201coverstepped their legal competence.\u201d\n\nSpoor has little good to say about the environmentalists who have sought to hold his plantations accountable. The campaigns against Ocho Sur \u2014 funded by what he called a \u201cpowerful, transnational ideological machine\u201d with \u201climitless\u201d cash \u2014 had cost the company millions in legal fees. They had also led it to be blacklisted, he said, by some of the world\u2019s largest food companies, including Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, and by such prominent commodities traders as Bunge and Louis Dreyfus.\n\nIn the past year, Ocho Sur and its supporters have participated in a slew of news coverage critical of environmental NGOs \u2014 what Peru\u2019s right wing calls the \u201ccaviar mafia.\u201d Willax Television, the Peruvian counterpart to Fox News, ran a story early this year claiming, without evidence, that Pautrat was hiding millions of dollars in an offshore account. One of Ocho Sur\u2019s lawyers made a cameo.\n\n\u201cIf I had this money,\u201d Pautrat told me, \u201cI would be living in Italy.\u201d Ken\u00e9\u2019s annual budget is $160,000.\n\nOne day in Pucallpa, Spoor connected me to one of his trusted advisors, \u00c1lvaro Agurto Mazzini, a gregarious entrepreneur who has been promoting Ucayali\u2019s economic development for over a decade. He wanted me to meet Ulises Salda\u00f1a, one of the employees whom Ocho Sur inherited from the Melka days and who now served as the community-relations manager.\n\nSalda\u00f1a emerged from an open-air restaurant with two coworkers and a broad-shouldered man in blue jeans and a Henley shirt. This third man stood out because his hair was pulled into a high ponytail atop his shaven head. It was Washington Bol\u00edvar, the activist who had helped Ucayali\u2019s Indigenous communities fight the palm oil plantations. Once Ocho Sur\u2019s most outspoken enemy, he had become the company\u2019s supporter.\n\n\u201cHe knows that Ocho Sur is defending the truth,\u201d Agurto said. \u201cThat the NGOs are shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation changes,\u201d Bol\u00edvar said, \u201cbecause what we want is to improve the quality of life of the people.\u201d He now frequently appears in the media as an Indigenous voice lambasting NGOs.\n\nBol\u00edvar was not the only one who\u2019d switched sides. In 2019, the state government granted Santa Clara de Uchunya a chunk of forest adjacent to Ocho Sur, which tripled the community\u2019s size to 1,544 acres. After an election in January 2022, their new leader, Wilson Barbar\u00e1n Soria, wrote prosecutors asking them to drop the community as an \u201caggrieved party\u201d in the criminal case against the company, because it was now in \u201cgood relations\u201d with Ocho Sur.\n\nSalda\u00f1a arranged to take me to visit Santa Clara de Uchunya the following day. When we arrived, a group of residents were gathered under a metal canopy as a television blared. We found a quiet place to speak with Barbar\u00e1n, the newly elected leader.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to live like our parents had lived,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe want to better ourselves.\u201d He said his people now had the chance to obtain an education to become teachers, lawyers, and police officers.\n\nIn his view, Ocho Sur had helped make all this possible by providing benefits like a Starlink terminal, a new health post, and a better road. \u201cThanks to la empresa, we have a line of communication to the internet,\u201d Barbar\u00e1n said.\n\nIn turn, Santa Clara de Uchunya had signed a pact with Ocho Sur to preserve its newly acquired forests for the next 25 years. It was a critical final step for Ocho Sur in legalizing its plantations. Since Melka had failed to preserve 30% of the forest he\u2019d purchased, as required under Peruvian law, Spoor needed to offset the deforestation by guaranteeing conservation elsewhere.\n\nAs Salda\u00f1a jumped in to explain that the conflict with the company had been blown out of proportion by the media, a woman emerged from the house next door and interrupted our conversation. \u201cSe\u00f1or, Ulises,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy do you deny it?\u201d There was an awkward moment as Salda\u00f1a calmly ignored her, saying that the majority of the community fully supported Ocho Sur.\n\nLuisa Mori Gonz\u00e1les at home in Santa Clara de Uchunya. She leads a group of 10 families who remain opposed to Ocho Sur.\n\nI later learned that the woman was the daughter-in-law of a woman named Luisa Mori Gonz\u00e1lez, who heads an organization made up of the resistance \u2014 a group of 10 or so families who remained opposed to Ocho Sur and didn\u2019t share Barbar\u00e1n\u2019s rosy assessment of the community\u2019s prospects.\n\nI found Mori in the back of the house, seated at a table near a wood fire stove, where a splayed possum was about to be cooked in a blackened pot. She expressed indignation about the pact the community had signed with the company, saying they were still a long way away from securing enough forest for their own future.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going to work during the next 25 years? Where are we going to hunt animals like this?\u201d she said, gesturing to the stove. Though the agreement with Ocho Sur allowed hunting and gathering in the forest, she said too many natural resources had already been lost. It was no longer possible, she said, to find the apacharama tree, whose bark was traditionally burned to ash and used in pottery.\n\n\u201cI am taking this position so as not to be tricked by the businessmen, the millionaire entities that are going to fool us with 1 kilo, 2 kilos of rice,\u201d she said. At stake, she said, was the future of the community. \u201cLife is not bought \u2014 life is borrowed,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as my ancestors left our territory for me, so I am going to leave it to my children and to my grandchildren.\u201d\n\nLater that day, Spoor and I met for lunch at a cabana with a palm-thatch roof overlooking the dark waters of Tibecocha Lake. It\u2019s a lovely spot on the edge of the property where Spoor has brought many of his influential guests. As the company chef prepared us a meal of risotto and breaded arapaima, an Amazonian fish, we leaned against the railing, gazed out at the forest on the opposite bank.\n\nHe told me he was proud to have opened a new weigh station to purchase palm fruits from farms it has verified as deforestation-free. \u201cIt is literally a cash register for farmers,\u201d Spoor said. \u201cFarmers who used to grow coca leaves are happy to switch to palm oil.\u201d Peru\u2019s ministry of agriculture liked the idea enough to finance families seeking to grow oil palm for Ocho Sur and other local mills on previously degraded land. Diane Farrell, the US deputy undersecretary of international trade, even attended a launch event at Ocho Sur\u2019s nursery.\n\nAs Spoor and I talked, I noticed a fresh clearing in the lakeside forest, where rice shoots were sprouting from the soggy soil. It had been leveled just six months earlier by farmers from Esperanza, who had once sought to grow oil palm for Melka. \u201cIt was a devastating surprise,\u201d Spoor said. He had been hoping, he said, to conserve that land to add to the company\u2019s offsets.\n\nSince Melka\u2019s arrival in 2010, the Ucayali region has experienced the highest rate of deforestation in Peru. In addition to the land-clearing on Tibecocha and Zanja Seca, one study documented 6,000 acres of forest destroyed from 2011 to 2016 by four communities that now grow oil palm on some of those lands for Ocho Sur. Coca farming, meanwhile, has increased by a factor of five. Researchers who have evaluated the impact of the USAID and UN eradication programs concluded that while they had produced some benefits, they sometimes pushed \u201cmarginalized coca growers into more precarious positions, often leading them to replant coca in more distant forests.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for USAID told me that the agency now works to limit deforestation by helping small coffee and cacao growers increase production and that the US government \u201cwill continue to partner with and strengthen institutional capabilities of Peruvian agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts.\u201d Candice Welsch, who heads the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in the Andean region, said the office\u2019s strategies had evolved in the decade since Hans-Jochen Wiese was leading alternative development. In 2022, the UN approved a resolution prioritizing biodiversity protection in its development work. \u201cWe never advocate for monocultures,\u201d Welsch said.\n\nWhen I asked Spoor recently how Ocho Sur could ever escape the land-clearing its plantations were built upon, he challenged me to identify anyone in the region who was truly worse off because of it today. \u201cDo you think 10 years from now, 20 years from now, people will say this is a tragedy?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m puzzled by this ideology that wants to keep people in poverty.\u201d He told me he hoped my story would focus on the \u201cparadox of human progress\u201d and show how \u201ceven amidst despair, seeds for a better future can take root.\u201d\n\nA mature oil palm in Shambo Porvenir.\n\nFor Ocho Sur, achieving that dream has meant erasing history. The company has vigorously challenged its inclusion in Rod\u00e1s\u2019 criminal case against Melka, filing a countersuit claiming that the prosecutor had overstepped his powers and engaged in \u201cideological persecution.\u201d Rod\u00e1s\u2019 office told me formal charges were imminent.\n\nBut the real battle over the company\u2019s future and the definition of deforestation has already shifted from the courts to the politicians.\n\nIn January, Peruvian lawmakers granted amnesty to landowners who, like Melka, had cleared their land without first obtaining the change-of-use authorization. Supporters of the new law have said it will help formalize the farming sector, but the move has been challenged in court on the grounds that it could worsen conflicts between settlers and Indigenous communities. Fighting in favor of the amnesty is a familiar name: Washington Bol\u00edvar. He is represented in these efforts by the law firm Estudio Ghersi, which is also defending Ocho Sur in the criminal case.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to Ocho Sur coming into full compliance with Peruvian law is its lack of an approved environmental management plan, but a separate regulation, enacted in June, gave companies across the Peruvian Amazon a chance to retroactively obtain the needed approvals.\n\nA few months after my visit, the Amazon was engulfed by record wildfires that incinerated over a hundred million acres of rainforest. The forests of Ucayali were among those going up in flames. In a climate of impunity, farmers and land traffickers had set hundreds of fires to clear new land for crops. These fires, I was told by one human rights organization, had swept through part of Santa Clara de Uchunya\u2019s new territory.\n\nThe firefighting crews had taken up residence in housing provided by Ocho Sur.\n\nThe European Union met the moment by voting last month to postpone its new deforestation regulations for a year.",

            "content": "SMX is Redefining Ethical Sourcing, KYC, and Data Security in a Tech-Driven World of Fashion and Electronics\n\n12/30/2024 - 07:00 AM\n\nForget the long debates- the bottom line consensus from both sides, despite the in-between rhetoric, is that there is an urgent need to transition from a linear to a circular economy. Ironically, as both sides pitch ambitious and sometimes far-fetched ideas on how to accomplish this monumental feat, a solution is already available. It comes from publicly traded Security Matters (NASDAQ:SMX), a company exploiting a unique niche by addressing global sustainability challenges through groundbreaking technology that can foster supply chain transparency, traceability, social accountability, and material authenticity.\n\nSMX's technological innovation lies in its ability to digitize physical objects by combining a chemical-based barcode with blockchain technology to create a \"digital twin.\" This powerful solution allows for tracking, tracing, authenticating, and verifying materials and products across their entire lifecycle. From raw materials to recycling, SMX can provide precisely what the conference leaders are asking for-the tools industries need to achieve a circular and closed-loop economy.\n\nNot all companies are in the dark. SMX has completed several proof-of-concept partnerships with global business giants, including PepsiCo, Brink's, Continental, and Intel. The common thread among all is demonstrating a reliable supply chain integration solution to protect against tampering with virtually any material, including liquids, metals, fabrics, and motherboards. Yes, motherboards.\n\nIts partnership with Intel proved it can verify the integrity of critical hardware, with SMX's technology enhancing product security by mitigating risks associated with counterfeiting and unauthorized alterations. That result may lead to more deals.\n\nA Vision for Circular Electronics\n\nThat's likely. SMX's proven outcomes align the company with the Circular Electronics Partnership's (CEP) vision of a sustainable and economically viable circular electronics industry. The electronics sector faces a surge in demand due to increased digital transformation, particularly in emerging markets. However, the linear production, use, and disposal model generates vast amounts of e-waste, contributing to resource depletion and environmental harm.\n\nLike in the commodity markets, the transition to circular electronics demands systemic change across design, manufacturing, and recycling processes. SMX's digital twin technology addresses key pain points by enabling transparency, efficient resource use, and the verification of sustainability claims. By embedding traceability and accountability into supply chains, SMX empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions that prioritize circularity.\n\nMore importantly, the technology closes a gap between a fragmented and punitive regulatory approach to mandating sustainability. For example, Los Angeles County's lawsuit against major beverage companies highlights the challenges posed by complex recycling mandates. While such measures have good intentions, they often fail to address the systemic barriers preventing effective recycling.\n\nA Unified Approach to Sustainability\n\nSMX's approach offers a cohesive solution. By integrating collection agents, recyclers, and manufacturers into a unified system, SMX's technology incentivizes participation across the supply chain. Its ability to create verifiable, unalterable records of material provenance ensures that all stakeholders-from corporations to consumers-can trust the authenticity and impact of sustainability initiatives. This collaborative model could serve as a blueprint for addressing recycling challenges at scale.\n\nSMX's innovations could also challenge the efficacy of traditional carbon credits in addressing plastic waste. While carbon credits focus on reducing emissions, they often overlook the complexities of plastic recycling and reuse. SMX's Plastic Cycle Token (PCT), a model that could be used in other markets, offers an alternative by enabling open-market trading of recycled plastics, creating a tangible economic incentive for circular practices.\n\nUnlike taxation or government-imposed quotas, SMX's solution empowers industries to self-regulate, leveraging market dynamics to drive sustainable behavior. The PCT not only facilitates transparent reporting but also bridges the gap between sustainability goals and actionable outcomes. By fostering market-driven accountability, SMX positions itself as a leader in transforming recycling into a commercially viable and scalable practice.\n\nA Giant Step Toward a Circular Economy\n\nBy allowing coordinated efforts to create a circular economy across geographies and industries, SMX could turn that global ambition into practice faster than many think. That can result from its solutions embodying the principles outlined by the CEP and being specifically designed for circularity, responsible business models, and robust recycling systems.\n\nIndeed, as the world accelerates toward digitization, the need for innovative solutions to manage resources responsibly has never been greater. SMX's pioneering technology not only supports industries in meeting regulatory requirements but also unlocks new opportunities for value creation.\n\nIn other words, instead of world leaders and decision-makers making long speeches about a problem they want to solve, they can stop, look, and listen to real-world, real-time solutions, like SMX's, that can do the job.\n\nAbout SMX (Security Matters) Public Limited Company\n\nAs global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThe foregoing material may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended.

            "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over PepsiCo's ( ) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on PepsiCo is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.20 = US$14b \u00f7 (US$101b - US$30b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThus, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 20%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 16% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nIn the above chart we have measured PepsiCo's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can for free.\n\nWhat Can We Tell From PepsiCo's ROCE Trend?\n\nIn terms of PepsiCo's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 20% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 22% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 20%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If PepsiCo can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\n\nThe Bottom Line On PepsiCo's ROCE\n\nIn short, we'd argue PepsiCo has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 30% return to shareholders who held over that period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nIf you want to continue researching PepsiCo, you might be interested to know about the that our analysis has discovered.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.\n\nDividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn\u2019t unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term.\n\nAlso read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nHistorically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market\u2019s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock\u2019s appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value.\n\nAccording to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience.\n\nThis resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cIdeally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can\u2019t always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that\u2019s when a stock is really interesting to me.\u201d\n\nHigh-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company\u2019s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\n5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 7.04%\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage company that offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. The company owns Frito-Lay, the largest producer of salty snacks globally, along with Pepsi, the second-largest nonalcoholic beverage brand, and Quaker Oats, a significant player in the packaged food sector. With its extensive global brand presence, strong marketing and innovation capabilities, and robust financial position, the company is well-positioned as an industry leader and consolidator. For instance, its recent acquisition of Siete Foods enhances its presence in the Mexican-American food segment, spanning salty snacks and packaged foods. In essence, PepsiCo is a solid consumer staples business, a sector renowned for its resilience during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) reported strong earnings for the third quarter of 2024, with revenues surpassing $23.3 billion. Although the company faced headwinds, including weaker results in North America, product recall challenges at Quaker Foods North America, and geopolitical disruptions in certain international markets, it demonstrated resilience. Through efficient cost management, the company sustained profitability while continuing to invest strategically to enhance its market position. In the past 12 months, the stock has fallen by nearly 10%.\n\nAmid these persistent challenges, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has revised its outlook for organic revenue growth, now expecting a modest low-single-digit increase, down from its earlier estimate of approximately 4%. Nonetheless, the company remains dedicated to shareholder returns, planning to distribute $8.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases in 2024. In addition, the company has been growing its payouts for 52 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.55%, as of December 29.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2024, 58 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is over $4.44 billion. With over 7.8 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 10th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shares of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), the energy drink maker already reeling from a 58 percent year-to-date decline, faced renewed pressure this month after a key analyst lowered its price target, citing concerns about sales and the impact of its distribution agreement with PepsiCo. This diminished valuation adds to the company\u2019s woes, which include slowing sales, revised financial forecasts, and a shareholder lawsuit alleging misleading disclosures.\n\nOn Dec. 16, Roth MKM, the investment bank, reduced its price target on Celsius shares to $38 from $40, according to Nasdaq.com. Nasdaq.com reported that analysts at Roth MKM pointed to anticipated higher promotional allowances in the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year. Critically, Roth MKM also suggested that the revised distribution agreement with PepsiCo would have a greater-than-expected negative impact on fourth-quarter revenue, according to Nasdaq.com.\n\nThe analyst price target cut comes on the heels of a securities class-action lawsuit alleging that the company misled investors about its operations and prospects.\n\nHagens Berman is investigating the allegations and urges investors in Celsius who purchased shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.\n\nClass Period: Feb. 29, 2024 \u2013 Sept. 4, 2024\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: Jan. 21, 2025\n\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/celh\n\nContact the Firm Now: CELH@hbsslaw.com\n\n844-916-0895\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint claims that Celsius failed to disclose several critical issues. These omissions include: excessive inventory shipped to PepsiCo beyond actual consumer demand; a projected decline in sales as PepsiCo worked through that overstock; unsustainable sales rates to PepsiCo that created a distorted picture of the company\u2019s performance; and, consequently, overstated business metrics and financial forecasts.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles began to surface on May 28, 2024, when Celsius shares fell nearly 13 percent following Nielsen data indicating a slowdown in sales growth. Analysts at the time raised the possibility of a significant sales contraction as PepsiCo reduced its inventory levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019s stock suffered another sharp decline on September 4, 2024, dropping more than 11 percent after a company presentation revealed a shortfall of $100 million to $120 million in PepsiCo orders compared with the previous year. The presentation also disclosed that PepsiCo had carried several million excess cases of Celsius products over the past 18 months.\n\nThese disclosures have prompted an investigation by Hagens Berman, a shareholder rights law firm. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether Celsius deliberately concealed the extent of its inventory buildup at PepsiCo,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you invested in Celsius and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, submit your losses now \u00bb\n\nIf you\u2019d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the Celsius case and our investigation, read more \u00bb\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Celsius Holdings should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

            "content": "Mukesh Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, is making waves in India\u2019s soft drink market with Campa Cola, employing strategies that mirror his success with Reliance Jio. By introducing aggressive pricing, Campa Cola has sparked a price war, challenging industry giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to defend their market positions.\n\nCampa Cola\u2019s Aggressive Pricing\n\nReliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, acquired Campa Cola in 2022 and relaunched the brand in 2023. With prices as low as Rs 10 for a 200ml bottle and Rs 20 for a 500ml bottle, Campa Cola has undercut competitors\u2019 prices by nearly 50 per cent. This move has pressured Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to reduce prices and launch promotional offers to retain customers.\n\nMarket Disruption\n\nInitially, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo faced minimal impact due to Campa Cola\u2019s limited distribution. However, as Campa Cola expanded its reach, the aggressive pricing strategy disrupted the market. For instance, Coca-Cola introduced a 350ml bottle with 150ml free for Rs 20 to counter Campa Cola\u2019s challenge.\n\nChallenges for Smaller Players\n\nIndustry experts note that the price war could lead to market consolidation. Smaller players with limited financial resources may struggle to sustain operations amidst intense competition. This dynamic, driven by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures, poses long-term implications for brand loyalty and market positioning.\n\nA Proven Playbook\n\nMukesh Ambani\u2019s approach with Campa Cola reflects the strategy that revolutionized India\u2019s telecom sector with Reliance Jio. By leveraging aggressive pricing and deep financial backing, Reliance aims to revive the 50-year-old brand and position it as a formidable challenger to global giants in the soft drink market.",
