            "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALNY) won expanded US approval for a heart drug that could be the biggest boon yet for the 23-year-old biotech \u2014 if it can beat out stiff competition from the likes of Pfizer Inc (PFE).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAlnylam\u2019s Amvuttra was approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, the company said Thursday in a statement. The shares rose as much as 12% in Friday trading in New York, the most intraday since August 2024. They had gained more than two-thirds over the past year through Thursday\u2019s close as investors anticipated the clearance.\n\nAmvuttra will now be available to treat ATTR-CM, a progressive disease that occurs when a protein becomes misshapen and builds up in the heart. Some 5,000 to 7,000 people each year in the US are diagnosed with the condition, but drugmakers say it\u2019s still largely undetected, creating opportunities for multiple competitors. Some 80% of those with this condition don\u2019t even know they have it, Alnylam has said.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nFDA approval of a second cardiomyopathy indication for Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra, maintained at the current list price, puts the company on track to meet 2025 guidance and may lift product sales to $5 billion by 2030... Amvuttra\u2019s broad label includes mortality, hospitalizations and urgent heart failure, differentiating it from Pfizer and BridgeBio\u2019s stabilizers.\n\n\u2014 Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Ann-Hunter Van Kirk and Jack Maltby. Read the research here.\n\nThe $33 billion biotech faces a big test: Pfizer\u2019s Vyndamax and Vyndaqel dominate the ATTR-CM market with sales of about $5 billion a year. BridgeBio Pharma Inc. (BBIO) also won approval in November for another competitor drug, Attruby.\n\nThree Drugs\n\nAlnylam, which already sells the drug to treat a related nerve condition, decided to maintain the current list of about $470,000 a year \u2014 far above rivals. Pfizer\u2019s drug is $270,000 a year and BridgeBio\u2019s is $225,000 a year, according to an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nAlnylam\u2019s label says its treatment reduces death, hospitalizations and \u201curgent heart failure visits,\u201d going further than the approved claims for the other two.\n\n\u201cWe believe the urgent heart failure language could give Alnylam an advantage,\u201d Ritu Baral, an analyst at TD Cowen, said, \u201cespecially for front-line use.\u201d",

            "content": "There\u2019s a new player on the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) block. Four months after greenlighting BridgeBio\u2019s Attruby for the rare cardiovascular disease, the FDA approved Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra Thursday as the first RNAi silencer for ATTR-CM.\n\nAmvuttra\u2019s approval ignites a three-way race with Attruby and Pfizer\u2019s tafamidis, which won the FDA\u2019s first approval for ATTR-CM in May 2019. Both Attruby and tafamidis are transthyretin stabilizers, while Amvuttra works by knocking down both the wildtype and mutant forms of the transthyretin RNA, in turn lowering the expression of the TTR protein. Alnylam is hoping this novel mechanism of action will set it apart from its competitors.\n\n\u201cThe FDA approval of AMVUTTRA for ATTR-CM marks a pivotal advancement for patients, providing a new and clinically differentiated treatment option that has been shown to improve outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality, and reduce progression for those living with this devastating disease,\u201d Alnylam CEO Yvonne Greenstreet said in a statement following the approval.\n\nBMO Capital Markets analysts in a Thursday note pointed to Amvuttra\u2019s \u201cincrementally differentiated\u201d label, which in addition to cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization benefits lists a reduction in urgent heart failure visits, setting it apart from Attruby and tafamidis.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts added in a Friday morning note that this \u201cbest case label positions Amvuttra for broad uptake and first-line usage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the second approval for Amvuttra, which was approved by the FDA to treat polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in June 2022.\n\nAlnylam management said on a Thursday call that it will sell Amvuttra in ATTR-CM at the ATTR-PN price of $90 000 per syringe or $360 000 per year, adding that it plans to decrease the net price over time, according to William Blair.\n\nOriginal article published March 17\n\nAlnylam\u2019s Amvuttra Expected to Make Three in Crowded ATTR-CM Space\n\nA decade ago, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy was basically a death sentence, Neil Kumar, CEO of BridgeBio, told BioSpace last year. Today, the outlook is much brighter. With effective medicines from Pfizer and BridgeBio on the market, survival rates have dramatically improved. Now, Alnylam\u2019s vutrisiran is on the cusp of joining them.\n\nOn March 23, the FDA is widely expected to approve vutrisiran\u2014which Alnylam markets as Amvuttra for polyneuropathy of hereditary ATTR (ATTR-PN)\u2014for the cardiovascular manifestation of the disease. The key question for analysts\u2014and likely Alnylam itself\u2014is, how much of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) market\u2014which is projected to reach $11.2 billion by 2030\u2014will Amvuttra be able to claim?\n\nIn ATTR-CM, the liver produces faulty transthyretin (TTR) proteins. Clumps of these misshapen proteins then build up in the heart\u2019s main pumping chamber, leading to cardiomyopathy that makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood to the body.\n\nPfizer\u2019s tafamidis\u2014marketed as Vyndaqel and Vyndamax\u2014came first in this space, winning the FDA\u2019s first approval for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) in May 2019. BridgeBio followed a little more than five years later with Attruby, which got the nod in November 2024.\n\nAlnylam believes Amvuttra\u2019s mechanism of action will set it apart from the competition. While tafamidis and Attruby are both transthyretin stabilizers, Alnylam\u2019s drug is an RNAi silencer that works by knocking down both the wildtype and mutant forms of the transthyretin RNA, in turn lowering the expression of the TTR protein.\n\nAmvuttra \u201cworks upstream of currently available therapies and, thanks to our unique technology, delivers rapid knockdown of the disease causing TTR protein, addressing the disease at its source,\u201d Tolga Tanguler, chief commercial officer at Alnylam, told BioSpace in an email. If approved for ATTR-CM, \u201cAmvuttra will be the first RNAi therapeutic for this indication and the only therapeutic to address both hATTR-PN and ATTR-CM.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the anticipated approval of Amvuttra will add another important, clinically differentiated treatment option for patients with ATTR-CM, a rare, progressive, and deadly condition,\u201d Tanguler continued.\n\nMore Competitive Variables\n\nThe ATTR-CM space is rapidly expanding. And while BridgeBio\u2019s launch of Attruby has \u201cexceeded [investor] expectations,\u201d the market expectation is that \u201cpeak sales of Amvuttra will be higher than [Attruby],\u201d Kostas Biliouris, director of biotech equity research, BMO Capital Markets, told BioSpace. Since its November 2024 approval, more than 1,000 unique prescriptions have been written for Attruby.\n\nBiliouris emphasized two key variables that could affect competition between Attruby and Amvuttra: administration and price. Amvuttra is administered in \u201conly four convenient, subcutaneous doses per year,\u201d Tanguler said, while Attruby is taken orally twice a day.\n\nAlnylam has not yet announced a price tag for Amvuttra in the new indication, but in ATTR-PN the drug is \u201calmost double\u201d the price of Attruby and tafamidis, Biliouris said.\n\n\u201cAlnylam may or may not decide to change the price, to lower it, when they get the approval in March, but this is a very important point to consider,\u201d he continued. Out- of -pocket costs could play a role in patient and prescriber decisions as well, Biliouris said. Because Amvuttra will be administered in a doctor\u2019s office and is therefore part of Medicare Part B, most patients will not pay anything out of pocket, while both tafamidis and Attruby are Part D, carrying an up to $2,000 out of pocket cost per year for patients, he explained.\n\nWhile Alnylam declined to comment on the potential pricing of Amvuttra in ATTR-CM, Tanguler said, \u201cWe believe that our science can only impact human health if patients have access to their medicines. . . . As such, we will measure our success by broad patient access to Amvuttra.\u201d\n\nAlnylam could also benefit from its experience and infrastructure in ATTR-PN, Biliouris said. In addition to Amvuttra, the company markets Onpattro for polyneuropathy caused by hereditary ATTR (hATTR). Together, the franchise brought in more than $1.2 billion in 2024, \u201cand it\u2019s been growing every year, which shows you they know how to do it,\u201d Biliouris said. \u201cThey have done it before successfully.\u201d\n\nAlnylam is aiming for Amvuttra to be a first-line treatment choice for ATTR-CM, according to Tanguler. The data from the company\u2019s Phase III HELIOS-B study\u2014in which Amvuttra led to a 36% risk reduction in all-cause mortality\u2014positions the drug for this role, he said.\n\nThe Label\n\nWhile Biliouris believes Amvuttra will be approved in ATTR-CM, one factor he is watching closely is the drug\u2019s label. Currently, the labels for tafamidis and Attruby are \u201cpretty similar,\u201d he said, listing improvement in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Amvuttra, however, has a chance to secure the much-coveted all-cause mortality benefit, according to Biliouris.\n\nWhile Attruby missed this secondary endpoint in the Phase III ATTRibute-CM trial, Amvuttra was successful in this metric in HELIOS-B, leading to a lower risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo. However, Biliouris said, \u201cthis can be just incremental, and it may not have a big impact on physicians and the uptake.\u201d\n\nThe second item Biliouris is watching for on the label is the possibility of a combination benefit with tafamidis. In HELIOS-B, \u201c[Alnylam] saw that there is a benefit from the combination of the two drugs . . . but the improvement was not statistically significant,\u201d he noted. Importantly, the trial was not designed to measure statistical significance on this metric.\n\nBMO\u2019s \u201cbull case\u201d is that the label will include an all-cause mortality benefit as opposed to only cardiovascular mortality and a possible mention of a combination benefit between Amvuttra and a transthyretin stabilizer, Biliouris said.\n\nOn Deck in ATTR-CM\n\nWhile Alnylam is in the spotlight this week, there are more therapies waiting in the wings for ATTR-CM, including another RNA silencer being developed by AstraZeneca and Ionis. Wainua, which is approved to treat hATTR amyloidosis, is currently being studied in the Phase III CARDIO-TTRansform study for ATTR-CM, which is expected to be completed in April 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, gene editing leader Intellia is working on what it calls a \u201cone and done\u201d treatment for ATTR-CM. The biotech presented Phase I data from nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z), a gene editor, in November at the American Heart Association\u2019s 2024 Scientific Sessions, showing \u201crapid, deep and durable\u201d reductions in serum levels of TTR, according to a press release. In patients with ATTR-CM, the mean TTR reduction was 90% at 12 months.\n\nNex-z could have the advantage of reducing treatment burden, an Intellia spokesperson told BioSpace in an email. \u201cMany patients experience anxiety from going to infusion centers frequently, spending time away from their families and work [to receive] repeated injections. A one-time option would eliminate that burden.\u201d The investigational treatment could also ultimately be more effective, the spokesperson continued. \u201cDosing every few months produces a cyclic rise and fall of TTR levels over time, with peaks and troughs. Our data show that a one-time dose can reduce TTR to very low levels and keep it there, maintaining treatment benefit at its maximum.\u201d\n\nIntellia is currently enrolling the Phase III MAGNITUDE trial and is \u201cahead of [its] internal target projections,\u201d according to the spokesperson. The company expects the trial to be fully enrolled by early 2027.\n\nFor its part, Alnylam isn\u2019t stopping with Amvuttra. The company is developing a third-generation TTR-targeting RNAi therapeutic called nucresiran, which is expected to elicit deeper and faster TTR knockdown and carries the potential for biannual dosing. Alnylam reported data from a Phase I trial of nucresiran in November 2024 showing \u201crapid knockdown of TTR that is sustained at six months following a single dose.\u201d A Phase III study of the candidate is expected to begin in the first half of this year, Tanguler said.\n\nTanguler stressed the importance of continued progress in this space, noting that ATTR-CM rates have increased approximately tenfold since 2019. Despite this, approximately 80% of patients remain undiagnosed globally, he said. \u201cThis is a large and growing category with significant unmet need.\u201d",

            "content": "If you're looking for reasonably priced stocks to pick up right now, you shouldn't overlook Pfizer (PFE -0.06%). The pharmaceutical giant isn't as risky an investment as it may appear to be. Its financials aren't in bad shape, and while the stock has been struggling, now could make a great time to load up on it.\n\nHere are three reasons why Pfizer could prove to be a steal of a deal this year.\n\n1. It's trading at an incredibly low earnings multiple\n\nBuying quality stocks at decent valuations can give you a good margin of safety and minimize your investment risk. And while many stocks trade at cheap valuations because they are highly risky, that isn't the case with Pfizer.\n\nThere is some uncertainty about the company's growth prospects, especially as patent protections on several important drugs in its portfolio will expire soon, but I don't believe the stock should be as heavily discounted as it is right now. The company is guiding for revenue of between $61 billion and $64 billion for 2025, which is comparable to how much it reported this past year ($63.6 billion).\n\nWhile that range does suggest a modest decline on the top line is likely, the company is still investing in growth opportunities -- its growth days are by no means over.\n\nCurrently, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 9, based on analysts' expectations for the year ahead. By comparison, the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at a forward P/E of nearly 18, making Pfizer look like a deeply discounted stock today.\n\n2. Its dividend can buffer investors' returns against market declines\n\nThe stock market is facing a lot of additional uncertainty this year due to President Trump's tariffs and trade wars. In times like these, investors may look for safety in the form of dividend income. At the current share price, Pfizer's dividend yields a mouthwatering 6.7%, so it could become a more popular option among income investors. That payout is well above the S&P 500's average yield of 1.4%.\n\nThose dividend payments could help serve as a buffer if stock prices suffer amid challenges to the economy this year. While investors may be worried about the sustainability of the dividend, it doesn't look to be in any danger. In 2024, Pfizer generated free cash flow of $9.8 billion, which was more than the $9.5 billion it paid out in dividends.\n\n3. The company looks to still be in acquisition mode\n\nPfizer previously told analysts and investors that it wanted to add $25 billion to its top line by 2030 via acquisitions and through its pipeline. CEO Albert Bourla says that the company has added about $20 billion thus far, with its acquisition of oncology company Seagen in 2023 contributing a big piece of that sum.\n\nWhile another big deal like that may not be on the horizon, Bourla did say on the company's earnings call in February that \"we are looking at more strategic opportunities right now, which will enhance pipeline in areas that we would like to play rather than near-term revenues.\"\n\nBy the sound of it, the company may be looking at more modestly sized acquisitions that could help ensure that Pfizer hits its revenue target. If that happens, that could be a catalyst that lifts the healthcare stock higher, as it might alleviate some concerns about the business.\n\n\n\nIt's a solid stock, but you'll likely need to be patient\n\n\n\nPfizer has been a cheap stock for a while, and barring some big development, it's likely that it'll take some time before it starts to rally again. The good news is that with meaningful acquisitions and stable financials, the stock looks to have a lot of upside potential. The market's view of the risks the business faces appears to be overblown.\n\nSo for investors who are willing to buy shares of Pfizer sooner rather than later, the payoff could be substantial, both from the potential share price gains and from the dividend income they could accumulate over the years.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other most undervalued biotech stocks to invest in.\n\nTrump\u2019s Tariffs and the Pharma Sector\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss Trump\u2019s tariffs and their effects on the American pharma sector. Although he was unsure of the intention behind these tariffs, he opined that the pharma industry was not all that special when compared to verticals such as industrials and technology, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nThe tariffs thus encompass the grander plan surrounding how the pharmaceutical industry fits into scaling up domestic manufacturing. A majority of pharma and biotech companies have a significant presence in the US. However, some questions still stand, such as whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America.\n\nHolz was unclear about the answers to these questions, but he believed that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. Further discussing the scenario, he said that boosting manufacturing facilities and capacities from scratch is not an easy endeavor, as it takes considerable years to reach a point where companies can domestically produce at a high rate. Therefore, the impact of tariffs on the production capacity and on-shoring of pharma companies remains fuzzy.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 11 Best Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe further discussed the potential impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs and the performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on the 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

Women who used Depo-Provera and subsequently developed a meningioma brain tumor can file a Depo Provera lawsuit seeking financial compensation. This new evidence is leading to a wave of Depo Provera lawsuits nationwide.\n\nOur lawyers are speaking to over 100 women a week who used Depo Provera and have been diagnosed with meningioma. Our law firm is committed to this litigation and handling Depo Provera lawsuits for women who had at least two injections and were later diagnosed with a meningioma brain tumor. If you meet these criteria, contact our Depo-Provera lawyers today at 800-553-8082 or contact us online.\n\nDepo Provera Lawsuit News and Updates for March 2025\n\nOur firm is committed to providing the latest news and updates on this new litigation. Here is what is happening right now:\n\nFiling a Lawsuit Is Now Easier\n\nMarch 20, 2025: A new court order has now cleared the way for women to file Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuits directly in the MDL, eliminating the usual need for cases to be transferred from other federal courts.\n\nLawyers have been waiting for this ruling to confirm this common MDL procedure. Direct filing streamlines the process and helps avoid unnecessary delays. JudgeRodgers also ruled that there is no need for a master complaint or short-form complaints, meaning that plaintiffs can move forward without the added procedural steps sometimes required of attorneys in mass tort litigation.\n\nThis decision is significant for both plaintiffs and attorneys. It accelerates the litigation process and allows new cases to be filed directly in the Northern District of Florida, regardless of where plaintiffs were diagnosed. Now it will be easier for women affected by Depo-Provera-related meningiomas to take action without unnecessary procedural obstacles. You can expect lawyers to proceed with filing claims now at a much faster pace.\n\nDepo-Provera Litigation in State Courts\n\nMarch 19, 2025: You are going to see many Depo-Provera lawsuits playing out not just in federal court but also in state courts, especially in Pennsylvania, California, and Illinois. Judge Rodgers recently appointed liaison counsel for those states, anticipating just this. The reason this is important is that while federal courts handle the consolidated MDL, state courts operate separately and have their own legal systems. In many instances, plaintiffs have strategic reasons to pursue their cases in state court rather than joining the MDL.\n\nState courts have procedural rules that make it easier to prove certain claims, and juries in certain jurisdictions are historically more sympathetic in pharmaceutical cases, which can lead to higher verdicts and settlements. We have seen this in Pennsylvania quite a bit lately where cases filed in Philadelphia get higher values than claims in the MDL. In some situations, state courts also move faster than the MDL, allowing plaintiffs to reach trial more quickly. Judge Rodgers as the MDL judge alleviates this issue a bit because she likes to move fast. But an MDL can only go so fast.\n\nUltimately, while the MDL will serve as the central hub for Depo-Provera litigation, Pennsylvania, California, and Illinois state courts will likely remain active and could get to trial faster than the MDL.\n\nMDL Leadship Appointments and New CMO\n\nMarch 17, 2025: Judge Rodgers finalized her appointment of lawyers to serve on the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel steering committee (\u201cPSC\u201d). The PSC acts like a representative body for all plaintiffs in the MDL and makes collective decisions on behalf of those plaintiffs. Judge Rodgers also issued a new Case Management Order setting scheduling deadlines for the initial \u201cpilot\u201d cases. Those scheduling orders set a July 25, 2025 deadline for discovery on the issue of federal preemption, with preemption summary judgment motions due by August 24, 2025. General causation fact discovery closes in October and Daubert motions on general causation experts are due by February 2026.\n\nDirect Filing in the Depo Provera MDL\n\nMarch 14, 2025: Judge Rodgers issued Pretrial Order No. 10, allowing plaintiffs in the Depo Provera MDL 3140 to file their cases directly in the MDL rather than having to jump through the hoop of first filing in another federal district and waiting for transfer. This direct filing procedure is intended solely for pretrial coordination and consolidated discovery. Plaintiffs must identify their \u201cDesignated Forum\u201d\u2014the district where they would have filed initially their case\u2014ensuring that jurisdictional considerations remain intact. Additionally, Depo Provera attorneys admitted pro hac vice in other MDL cases may file directly without needing local counsel, reducing procedural hurdles.\n\nThis order significantly improves efficiency in the litigation by eliminating delays associated with case transfers, ensuring that all pretrial matters are handled uniformly in a single court. It also clarifies that direct filing does not waive Lexecon rights, meaning cases will still be remanded to their original districts for trial unless parties agree otherwise. Furthermore, defendants waive personal jurisdiction objections for pretrial proceedings, but they retain the right to challenge jurisdiction later, preserving their legal defenses. Importantly, direct filing does not alter choice of law principles, meaning statutes of limitations and other legal considerations will still be determined based on the plaintiff\u2019s original forum.\n\nThis streamlined approach is a standard practice in MDL class action lawsuits. Everyone wins, it is more efficient for plaintiffs, defendants, and the courts.\n\nLitigation Gets Moving: 10 Key Developments\n\nMarch 11, 2025:\n\nJudge Rodgers will demand that this litigation gets rolling and lawyers in the Depo Provera MDL are complying. Attorneys have already submitted a Joint Rule 26(f) Report outlining a proposed discovery plan and case management schedule. The report reflects significant progress in organizing the litigation, focusing on expediting discovery and ensuring a fair process for Plaintiffs alleging injuries from Depo-Provera, focusing, of course, on intracranial meningioma.\n\nThese are the top 10 areas of agreement:\n\nRule 26(f) Conference: The parties held a productive meeting on March 3, 2025, discussing critical issues such as discovery sequencing, document production, custodians, and ESI protocols. Plaintiffs provided early Rule 34 document requests to facilitate meaningful discovery discussions. Direct Filing and Service: The parties agreed to allow direct filing of cases into the MDL, which is a big deal for efficiency. Instead of Plaintiffs having to file in their home districts and then transfer their cases to the MDL (a slow and cumbersome process), they can now file directly into the centralized litigation. This streamlines the process and avoids unnecessary procedural delays. On the service of complaints, the parties decided to use BrownGreer\u2019s MDL Centrality platform, an electronic system that simplifies document management and tracking. This helps reduce delays that often occur with traditional methods of serving legal documents. In short, the system is designed to keep things moving quickly, which benefits Plaintiffs looking to push their cases forward without administrative bottlenecks. Pilot Case Schedule: The Pilot Cases will act as a testing ground for the litigation, setting a roadmap for how things will unfold in the broader MDL. The parties have agreed on key deadlines for: Amended complaints\n\nDiscovery\n\nExpert disclosures\n\nDispositive motions (motions that could potentially end the case before trial) A notable point of contention? Expert testimony and preemption. Plaintiffs argue that expert testimony is crucial to challenge Defendants\u2019 likely preemption defense (the argument that federal law prevents state-law claims). Defendants, unsurprisingly, claim expert testimony isn\u2019t necessary for this issue. This is a classic MDL battle\u2014Defendants want to shut the case down early using legal arguments, while Plaintiffs want a full evidentiary record to support their claims. Protective Orders and Confidentiality: The parties agreed on a confidentiality order to protect sensitive information, including provisions for phased privilege review and clawback protections under Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d). Threshold Proof of Use and Injury: Plaintiffs will complete a questionnaire to provide initial proof of Depo Provera use and meningioma injury. Defendants can challenge Plaintiffs who submit insufficient proof, but Plaintiffs have the right to fix issues before their cases are dismissed. This process is common in pharmaceutical MDLs. Defendants want to weed out weak claims early, while Plaintiffs push for flexibility to ensure legitimate cases are not thrown out over paperwork errors. This setup helps prevent frivolous claims and ensures that legitimate cases are not dismissed on technicalities. The fight over what constitutes \u201csufficient proof\u201d will likely be an issue in some cases but not many. Document Production and ESI Protocol: Defendants, particularly Pfizer, outlined their IT infrastructure and custodial data sources. Plaintiffs pushed for comprehensive document production, including non-custodial sources, and proposed an ESI protocol to ensure efficient and transparent discovery. The documents are really going to be key to finding out what Pfizer knew and when it knew it. Deposition Protocol: The parties agreed on a deposition schedule, with Plaintiffs securing 35 deposition days for Pfizer witnesses and additional days for other Defendants. Plaintiffs also ensured the right to videotape depositions and conduct remote depositions when necessary. Dismissal of Authorized Generic Distributors: Plaintiffs and Defendants Greenstone and Prasco discussed potential dismissal of these Defendants in cases where Plaintiffs did not use their products during the relevant periods. Science Day and Medical Monitoring: The parties agreed that a Science Day is unnecessary given the early focus on general causation discovery. Medical monitoring class actions will remain stayed (thankfully) pending resolution of common defenses. Special Master and CPA Appointment: The parties agreed to appoint Special Master David Herndon and CPA Randall Sansom to assist with case management and the Common Benefit Fund (how the MDL lawyers get paid for their work).\n\nWill things start happening quickly from here? No, if you are not used to the pace of mass torts. But compared to most MDLs, this litigation will likely proceed at a furious pace.\n\nAnother Unknown Depo Provera Side Effect?\n\nMarch 8, 2025: As lawsuits against Pfizer over Depo-Provera\u2019s link to meningioma brain tumors continue to grow, more evidence is emerging that the company may have downplayed other serious risks associated with its blockbuster birth control shot.\n\nA recently published case study highlights how a 21-year-old woman with no prior clotting history developed an extreme and life-threatening condition called Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens (PCD)\u2014a severe form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\u2014shortly after receiving a Depo-Provera injection. She suffered massive blood clots in her leg and lungs (pulmonary embolisms) and required multiple emergency procedures, including thrombectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and venoplasty. While Depo-Provera\u2019s label does include warnings about blood clots, those warnings are often less emphasized than those for estrogen-based contraceptives.\n\nThis case raises serious questions about whether Pfizer failed to fully disclose the scope of Depo-Provera\u2019s clotting risks, particularly for young women without traditional risk factors for thrombosis. Getting a DVT at age 21 certainly raises eyebrows. The connection between hormonal contraceptives and blood clot risks is well known, yet Depo-Provera has often been marketed as a safer alternative to combination birth control pills. However, research has suggested that progestin-only contraceptives\u2014including Depo-Provera\u2014may still increase the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly in women with underlying risk factors like obesity, smoking, or a genetic predisposition to clotting disorders.\n\nPfizer continued to sell Depo-Provera without adequately warning patients about the extent of these risks\u2014a pattern eerily similar to its handling of the drug\u2019s connection to intracranial tumors. If Pfizer failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the full scope of Depo-Provera\u2019s dangers, it would be yet another example of how the company prioritized profits over patient safety\u2014a concern that is central to the ongoing litigation.\n\nJudge Rodgers\u2019 Comment About Women Attorneys in Depo Shot Leadership Under Attack\n\nMarch 4, 2025: U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers is facing a judicial misconduct complaint from the conservative group Article III Project after she issued an order emphasizing the need for female attorneys to be represented in leadership roles in the Depo-Provera multidistrict litigation. What is this about? Judge Rodgers stated in a February 23, 2025 order that \u201cfemales should be adequately represented within leadership.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs in this litigation are all women. This just makes sense, right? But according to Article III Project, this constitutes \u201cimpermissible bias and judicial misconduct,\u201d because it allegedly suggests that gender\u2014not merit\u2014should influence who leads the litigation. The group\u2019s complaint, submitted to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judicial conduct and disability review board, argues that Rodgers\u2019 remarks violate judicial impartiality and amount to improper favoritism.\n\nThis is nothing short of ridiculous. Rodgers\u2019 statement did not mandate female leadership, nor did it suggest that gender should be prioritized over qualifications\u2014it simply called for a balanced and diverse leadership team reflective of the plaintiffs involved in the litigation. Encouraging diversity in legal leadership is hardly controversial, and judges nationwide have been making similar efforts in multidistrict litigation. This complaint attempts to manufacture a scandal where none exists, attacking a judge for promoting inclusivity while ignoring the reality that legal leadership has long been dominated by men.\n\nDepo-Provera MDL Adds 8 Cases in First Month\n\nMarch 3, 2025: During its very first month of existence, 8 new cases were transferred into the Depo-Provera brain tumor class action MDL. There are now 78 total cases pending in the MDL. It will be very interesting to see how the monthly volume of new cases develops early in this litigation, which could have a large field of potential plaintiffs.\n\nFirst Depo Provera Case Management Order\n\nMarch 1, 2025: Judge Rodgers has issued Case Management Order No. 1, outlining the initial steps for organizing the proceedings. During a February 21, 2025, case management conference, the Court selected five pilot cases to guide the litigation\u2019s progress. The order mandates that all parties meet in person for a Rule 26 conference on March 3, 2025. The outcome of that meeting must be detailed in a Joint Rule 26 Report, which is due by March 7, 2025. A follow-up case management conference is scheduled for March 10, 2025, where the judge will discuss the Joint Rule 26 Report and next steps in the litigation. Additionally, the Court has invited submissions for a proposed Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leadership slate, which must be filed by February 28, 2025. The judge will review the proposals before making a determination on leadership appointments.\n\nGet More Depo Provera Lawsuit Updates and News February 22, 2025: Another California Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, a Lawndale, California, woman alleges that her use of Depo-Provera caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. The plaintiff, who began receiving Depo-Provera injections in 2011, claims that she was never warned of the risks associated with the drug. According to the complaint, she developed severe headaches, dizziness, vision loss, hearing loss, poor coordination, and seizures, leading to the discovery of a meningioma in 2015. She subsequently underwent a craniotomy and six months of radiation therapy, suffering significant physical and financial hardship. This case was filed in California but will get transferred to the MDL in Florida. February 19, 2025: New Study Confirms Meningioma Risk A new study suggests that medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), the active ingredient in Depo-Provera, significantly increases the risk of meningioma, a type of brain tumor. Researchers analyzed medical records from 2006 to 2020, comparing women who used MPA with those who used a common oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel, EE-LNG). The results showed that women who used MPA for more than one year had a 3.55 times higher risk of developing meningiomas compared to EE-LNG users. This increased risk remained even for women who had used MPA for multiple years. The study controlled for factors like obesity, radiation exposure, and prior contraceptive use, reinforcing the association between MPA and meningiomas. The findings add to growing concerns about the safety of long-term MPA use, especially since meningiomas account for 40% of all brain tumors. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended adding a meningioma warning to the drug\u2019s label, but the U.S. FDA has yet to do so. This difference in regulatory action, as we talk more about below, raises questions about whether American patients are being adequately warned. Given these risks, women using Depo-Provera may want to consider alternative contraceptives and discuss their options with a healthcare provider. February 18, 2025: Magistrate Judge Hope T. Cannon Judge Cannon will be the magistrate judge in this litigation. This magistrate worked with Judge Rodgers in the 3M earplug litigation that recently settled. Judge Cannon was appointed as a United States Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Florida in 2019. February 17, 2025: Pretrial Order Judge Rodgers has issued Pretrial Order No. 4 to set up rules for handling all lawsuits related to Depo-Provera. This order ensures that all cases follow the same process and are managed efficiently. The court has created a master docket, which is like a central filing system where most legal documents will be submitted. If a filing applies to all cases, it will be labeled accordingly. If it only applies to some instances, it must be filed in both the master docket and the specific individual case docket assigned to that lawsuit. The order also adjusts the rules for out-of-state attorneys who want to represent plaintiffs in these cases. This is national litigation and most of the lawyers will not be barred in Florida. Typically, attorneys must provide a Certificate of Good Standing from their home state\u2019s bar association. Judge Rodgers has waived this requirement, which is commonplace in MDLs. Also, and this is a nice gesture, if an attorney has already paid a pro hac vice fee (which is the fee for a lawyer to appear in court without being licensed in that state) in another district for a Depo-Provera case, they do not have to pay it again in Florida. Attorneys who want to officially represent someone in the case must file a Notice of Appearance in each lawsuit they\u2019re handling. Those already licensed in Florida\u2019s Northern District don\u2019t need special approval, but they must still notify the court. Lastly, for serving legal documents (officially notifying defendants about the lawsuit), the court says the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure must be followed unless both sides agree on a different method. This order helps organize what is expected to be thousands of lawsuits about Depo-Provera. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are very amped up about this litigation, and we are excited to see it moving forward. February 10, 2025: How Many Depo Provera Plaintiffs? There was an estimate that came out today projecting the number of potential Depo-Provera meningioma cases, setting the projected range between 16,651 and 18,156 for progesterone receptor-positive cases, with a broader estimate spanning from 27,752 to 30,261 total cases within the 18-55 age demographic. This interesting projection operates on the premise that women who used Depo-Provera within this timeframe and were subsequently diagnosed with meningioma would have a more straightforward burden of proof compared to those who used the drug earlier in life and developed meningioma decades later. The estimate aims to be conservative by focusing on cases where the causal link may be more immediately evident based on existing scientific data. Of course, litigation success depends on more than just biological plausibility\u2014it requires clear and specific causation, which will be contested in court. Many cases will face challenges related to individual risk factors, gaps in medical documentation and proof of use, and alternative explanations for tumor development. Yet this estimate may also be too low. If the number of calls our law firm is getting from victims is any indication, it is indeed too low. We have been signing up new clients daily, even though we do not market other than provide information to victims online. So I wonder if this estimate fully accounts for delayed diagnoses or long-term users outside of the core demographic. February 8, 2025: Big Surprise \u2013 The MDL Will Be in Florida The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated more than 70 lawsuits alleging that Pfizer failed to warn patients and doctors about the risk of brain tumors associated with Depo-Provera, assigning the litigation to the Northern District of Florida under Judge M. Casey Rodgers. The decision comes after a jurisdictional debate, with Pfizer and generics maker Prasco advocating for New York, while most plaintiffs preferred California, where most of the lawsuits had been filed. A smaller group pushed for Florida, arguing that it was geographically neutral and not in the home jurisdiction of any defendants. We all expected the litigation to land in either New York or California. But the MDL Panel has a mind of its own. In its ruling, the JPML cited Judge Rodgers\u2019 extensive experience with large-scale MDLs, including the recent 3M earplug litigation, which led to a $6 billion settlement. The Panel is right about this. Judge Rodgers is widely recognized for her skill in handling complex litigation and measured approach to both plaintiffs and defendants. Her writing skills, organizational efficiency, and ability to manage large-scale cases have been praised in previous MDLs. The fact that she is nearing the conclusion of the massive 3M litigation likely made her an attractive choice, because she now presumably can oversee another major class action lawsuit. Plaintiffs and defendants are expected to get a fair shake with Judge Rodgers. February 5, 2025: Ohio Depo Shot Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday, an Ohio woman sued Pfizer alleging Depo-Provera caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. The plaintiff, a resident of Clinton County, Ohio, claims that she received Depo-Provera injections for contraception between 2008 and 2011, and again from 2022 through 2024, before being diagnosed with the tumor in November 2023. February 4, 2025: The European Double Standard Almost all women taking Depo-Provera in the U.S. had no idea what was happening in Europe, where similar progestogens have already been restricted or outright pulled from the market due to their link to brain tumors. In France, regulators removed three high-dose progestogens from shelves before the now-famous Roland study even dropped\u2014because, apparently, some countries do not need a neon sign flashing \u201cbrain tumors\u201d to take action. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and UK regulators updated Depo-Provera\u2019s label to warn about meningioma risks. January 30, 2025: JPML Hearing Is Today The JPML hearing was today. There will be an MDL. The question is where these federal lawsuits will be housed. During the hearing in Miami, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued that California is the most appropriate venue, as the majority of the over 70 Depo shot lawsuits are already filed there, and the state recognizes innovator liability\u2014allowing claims against the brand-name drug manufacturer even when plaintiffs took the generic version. They also noted that many affected women have undergone brain surgery and may face travel restrictions, making California a more accessible forum. Pfizer, as we have been telling you, really wants the litigation in New York where the company is headquartered. It argues that key witnesses and evidence are located there and that the litigation is not solely centered on California. One of the attorneys representing a generic drug manufacturer suggested that the early filings in California were a strategic move to influence venue selection. Pretending there is not some truth to this argument is silly. But that does not change the fact that California is a better venue for this litigation. The judges left few tea leaves\u2014some lawyers predicted New York, others predicted California. So we do not know where they will come down. We should know in the next few weeks their decision. January 29, 2025: Filing the Best Depo Provera Lawsuits First Attorneys are strategically filing the most compelling Depo-Provera lawsuits first, focusing on cases involving prolonged use, severe injuries, and well-documented medical histories. These lawsuits often center on women who received numerous injections over many years and subsequently developed multiple or large intracranial meningiomas, requiring invasive surgeries and long-term treatment. By prioritizing these high-impact birth control shot lawsuits, lawyers aim to highlight the serious risks associated with the birth control shot and the failure of Pfizer and other manufacturers to provide adequate warnings. These early lawsuits will likely shape the trajectory of the litigation, helping to establish liability and set the stage for future claims. January 28, 2025: Is It All About the Money? We discuss anticipated Depo-Provera settlement amounts in detail below. Some ask whether these cases are solely about the money victims may receive. The answer is both yes and no. These lawsuits serve a larger purpose: they help protect women by holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for their actions. But you must remember that in civil cases like these, financial compensation is the only form of justice available to victims. The time for sympathy or apologies from Pfizer and the other defendants has long passed. From our perspective, our mission is clear: to maximize the settlement compensation our clients deserve for their suffering. So, yes, in some ways, it is about the money\u2014but it is also about ensuring justice. January 21, 2025: New Depo Provera Class Action Lawsuit A new Depo-Provera class action lawsuit for medical monitoring has been filed to address potential long-term health risks associated with this birth control shot. This lawsuit differs from more traditional personal injury or wrongful death claims that our lawyers are involved with in that it seeks to establish a medical monitoring program rather than pursue compensation for injuries or deaths that have already occurred. This Depo-Provera meningioma class action focuses on creating a court-supervised medical monitoring program for individuals who used Depo-Provera for over a year and face an elevated risk of developing intracranial meningiomas, even though they have not yet been diagnosed with these brain tumors. It seeks proactive remedies, such as diagnostic screenings, early detection programs, and associated medical costs, rather than seeking damages for injuries already sustained. In contrast, personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits our lawyers are handling revolve around women who have already suffered specific harm, such as physical injuries, neurological complications, or fatalities linked to Depo-Provera usage. These cases aim to recover compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other damages directly related to the injuries or deaths caused by Depo-Provera. January 20, 2025: Pfizer\u2019s Claim in the MDL Pfizer claims that it sought to update Depo-Provera\u2019s label to warn of the risk of meningiomas, but the FDA blocked the proposed update due to insufficient evidence. Pfizer is setting up its preemption defense\u2014a legal argument asserting that federal regulatory decisions shield the company from liability under state law. Essentially, Pfizer argues that because the FDA allegedly overruled its attempt to warn, it cannot be held responsible for failing to include the warning. However, preemption defenses in pharmaceutical product liability cases are rarely successful. Courts often scrutinize such claims closely, requiring clear and compelling evidence that the FDA explicitly prohibited a manufacturer from issuing a stronger warning. Pfizer has not produced all the information to support its claim. So our guess is that when Pfizer starts producing documents, it will not come out as clean as it now suggests. This would be a double-edged sword for Pfizer. Pfizer\u2019s reliance on this defense may suggest an acknowledgment that Depo-Provera was linked to significant harm, such as brain tumors in women who used the product. Plaintiffs have more claims in this litigation than just failure to warn. January 16, 2025: How Does Depo Provera Cause Meningioma? Scientists believe that the link between Depo Provera and meningioma arises from its high levels of synthetic progestin, which mimics the progesterone. Meningiomas are known to express hormone receptors for both progesterone and estrogen. When exposed to elevated hormone levels, these receptors can stimulate tumor growth. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to high doses of progesterone can over-activate these receptors, creating a biological environment conducive to tumor development. In essence, each injection of Depo Provera acts like adding fuel to a fire, compounding the risk with every dose. The study that triggered this litigation shows a dose-response relationship: the more injections a woman receives, the higher her risk of developing a meningioma. This explains why cases involving just one injection are exceedingly rare. Many women got just one shot. But our lawyers are getting virtually no calls linking that level of exposure to a brain tumor. It is the cumulative effect of synthetic progestin exposure that makes long-term use particularly dangerous and underpins the growing wave of Depo birth control lawsuits. Many women who have used Depo Provera for over 15 years have reported symptoms consistent with meningioma diagnoses. While anecdotal, these accounts align closely with scientific research, which mirrors patterns observed in other hormone-sensitive conditions, such as breast and uterine cancers. Prolonged hormone exposure is a well-established risk factor for these diseases, and the parallels to Depo Provera\u2019s link to meningioma are difficult to ignore. From a legal perspective, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys do not need to establish the exact biological mechanism behind the association. We just need to prove the strong connection between Depo Provera and meningiomas. But jurors want to know: How does this happen? This litigation is just getting started, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are already poised to answer that question for jurors. January 12, 2025: New Lawsuit in Boston In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the District of Massachusetts, a Woburn woman initiated claims against several pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer Inc., Viatris Inc., Greenstone LLC, and Prasco LLC, over alleged injuries caused by Depo Provera. The plaintiff alleges that prolonged use of the medication, administered between 1996 and 2005, caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. While there is a pending MDL motion, there is a good argument that plaintiffs\u2019 Depo Provera lawyers should wait until next month before filing any lawsuits outside of California (and right next to New York) because we are arguing the MDL should be there. Hopefully, MDL coordination will help everyone get on the same page. January 10, 2025: MDL Panel Hearing The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) hearing to consider centralizing the growing number of lawsuits under MDL No. 314 will be in Miami, Florida, on January 30, 2025, in the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. Courthouse. You can expect the Panel to approve the MDL. Even Pfizer agrees there needs to be an MDL to manage so many Depo Provera lawsuits. The remaining drama is whether the Depo shot meningioma lawsuits will be housed in New York or California, as we discuss more below. How will a Depo Provera class action lawsuit work? Again, it is not definitionally a class action lawsuit. The Depo Provera litigation is set to proceed as an MDL, or multidistrict litigation, which is the preferred approach for handling large-scale pharmaceutical cases involving numerous plaintiffs and complex claims. Unlike a class action lawsuit, where one representative litigates on behalf of the entire group, an MDL consolidates cases for pre-trial proceedings under one federal judge while allowing each plaintiff to retain their individual claim. This approach is particularly well-suited for Pfizer Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuits, where injuries like meningiomas linked to high-dose progestin vary significantly in severity and damages. January 8, 2025: Inoperable Brain Tumors Our attorneys are getting more calls from women with inoperable meningiomas than we expected. These tumors cannot be safely removed because of their proximity to critical brain structures. Positioned near vital areas like the optic nerves, brainstem, or major blood vessels, they make surgical intervention too dangerous. These will be strong claims because they can cause significant physical and emotional suffering. These women only have limited options, such as radiation therapy or long-term monitoring, for hopefully definitive relief. Women affected by these tumors frequently endure debilitating symptoms, including severe headaches, vision loss, memory problems, and other neurological impairments, adding to the ongoing challenges of living with this condition. January 3, 2025: New Depo Provera Brain Tumor Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in San Diego, California, a plaintiff alleges that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, along with related entities Pharmacia & Upjohn and Pharmacia LLC, failed to warn about the significant health risks of Depo-Provera. The plaintiff, who received quarterly injections of Depo-Provera between 2009 and 2015, claims that Pfizer and related entities failed to warn her or her healthcare providers about the risks associated with long-term use of these injections. According to the complaint, the plaintiff began experiencing severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and lethargy before a 2015 MRI revealed a meningioma. She underwent invasive brain surgery to remove the tumor, which resulted in ongoing medical challenges, including the need for regular monitoring and imaging. The lawsuit further claims that Pfizer and its predecessors knew or should have known for decades that medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), the active ingredient in Depo-Provera, was associated with an increased risk of developing meningiomas. Despite evidence from multiple studies and international regulatory actions, including labeling updates in the European Union and Canada, Pfizer allegedly failed to update U.S. labels or issue adequate warnings. The plaintiff contends that safer alternatives to Depo-Provera, such as a lower-dose version (Depo-SubQ Provera 104), were available but were not promoted or widely prescribed. She argues that had she been informed of the risks, she would have chosen alternative contraceptive methods. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for her physical, emotional, and economic losses, as well as for Pfizer\u2019s alleged negligence, failure to warn, and defective product design. January 1, 2025: Depo-Provera Litigation Gaining Traction The Depo-Provera litigation is picking up significant momentum as more plaintiffs come forward with claims that the birth control shot caused them to develop meningiomas. The increasing number of lawsuits suggests that the scientific evidence linking Depo-Provera to brain tumors is strong enough to sustain significant litigation. With multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceedings likely, attorneys expect a streamlined process that will allow these cases to move forward efficiently. Several factors are contributing to the rapid expansion of this litigation. First, more women are recognizing the connection between their long-term use of Depo-Provera and their brain tumor diagnoses. Second, regulatory actions in Europe\u2014where Depo-Provera now carries a warning for meningioma risk\u2014are increasing pressure on Pfizer to acknowledge these risks in the United States. Finally, expert testimony and epidemiological studies continue to reinforce the causal link between synthetic progestin exposure and tumor development, strengthening the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This growing litigation signals a significant challenge for Pfizer and its co-defendants, as the legal landscape for hormone-based contraceptive litigation continues to evolve. With a rising number of plaintiffs and mounting scientific evidence, the Depo-Provera lawsuits could develop into one of the most significant pharmaceutical mass tort cases of the decade. December 30, 2024: Pfizer Foreshadows Preemption Defense in JPML Response Pfizer recently filed a response to the MDL petition, which pushed for New York as the better venue for the Depo Provera brain tumor MDL. In that response, however, Pfizer\u2019s defense lawyers made a very deliberate point of laying out the outline of what will likely be an affirmative defense based on the federal preemption doctrine. The preemption defense is common in drug litigation. It basically involves the drug manufacturer arguing that they cannot be sued for failure to warn under state law, because changes to a drug warning label are governed by federal law and the FDA. Based on the long preamble to the JPML filing, Pfizer is going to argue that the failure to warn claims should be dismissed because they asked the FDA for authorization to put a warning about meningioma on the Depo Provera warning label, but the FDA \u201crejected\u201d that request. Preemption defenses are rarely successful in pharmaceutical injury litigation. December 7, 2024: New Lawsuit in Pennsylvania State Court As we have been saying, we expect a substantial Depo Provera docket in Philadelphia. On Thursday, a new Depo shot lawsuit was filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County. A Philadelphia resident alleges that prolonged use of the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera caused her to develop a debilitating meningioma. The plaintiff, who began these injections as a teenager, claims that the manufacturers, including Pfizer and several associated companies, failed to adequately warn of the risks linked to the synthetic hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate, the active ingredient in Depo-Provera. The plaintiff, who underwent multiple brain surgeries and suffers from ongoing physical and cognitive impairments, seeks compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries. The lawsuit also includes claims against healthcare providers affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System for their alleged failure to disclose safer contraceptive alternatives. December 2, 2024: California Woman Files New Depo Provera Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. Central District of California, a Santa Clarita, California woman has brought claims against Pfizer, Viatris, Greenstone, Prasco, Pharmacia & Upjohn, and Pharmacia for serious injuries allegedly caused by the Depo shot. The plaintiff alleges that her long-term use of the drug, which contains a high dose of synthetic progestin, led to the development of two intracranial meningiomas\u2014tumors requiring invasive brain surgery. The lawsuit asserts that the defendants knew for decades about the risks of meningiomas associated with Depo Provera but failed to provide adequate warnings to physicians or patients in the United States, despite labels in the EU and Canada identifying these risks. The plaintiff claims she was administered approximately 76 injections over 19 years, which she believes substantially contributed to her injuries. Again, the Depo lawsuits you are seeing filed are the cases with long-term usage and this case is obviously no exception. She underwent complex surgical treatment to remove the tumors and continues to experience vision loss and other complications. The complaint highlights several studies dating back to the 1980s that documented the relationship between progestin-based drugs and meningiomas, alleging that the defendants failed to investigate these risks or alert the medical community. The plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages for negligence, failure to warn, and strict liability, among other claims, and argues that the defendants could have mitigated risks by promoting safer alternatives like the lower-dose Depo-SubQ Provera 104 formulation. November 30, 2024: Depo Provera Class Action MDL Sought in Northern California We have been talking about where the Pfizer Depo Provera class action lawsuit might be. The focus has been on northern or central California. A motion has been filed requesting the coordination of over 20 lawsuits related to the contraceptive Depo-Provera in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The motion, submitted to the MDL Panel, seeks to consolidate the cases under one judge in California, citing the high number of cases already filed in the state and the unique innovator liability laws that allow plaintiffs to sue the brand-name manufacturer, Pfizer, even if they used the generic version of the drug. The motion references 22 lawsuits, with 18 filed in California and six specifically in the Northern District. Other cases are pending, as we talk about below, in Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Nevada. The argument for consolidation also points to California as a key jurisdiction for the anticipated influx of thousands of cases, given the large number of women who have used Depo Provera and the recent study linking the drug to a 550% increased risk of intracranial meningiomas. November 25, 2024: ACOG Disappoints Last week, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) addressed the study indicating that Depo-Provera users may face a 5.5-fold increased risk of developing meningioma compared to non-users. Regrettably, ACOG\u2019s communication downplays this significant finding by presenting the risk as \u201cfive out of 10,000 women using medroxyprogesterone acetate may develop meningioma compared to one out of 10,000 women not using the medication.\u201d This framing minimizes the relative risk increase, potentially leading patients to underestimate the seriousness of the association. The study says you may be 5.5 times more likely to get a brain tumor. Why not just say that? Additionally, ACOG\u2019s characterization of meningiomas as \u201cbenign\u201d neglects the severe physical, emotional, and financial burdens that these tumors can impose. There is nothing benign about the hardships endured by women calling our law firm daily living with the consequences of these growths. Given the statistical significance of the study\u2019s findings, ACOG should provide clear and comprehensive information that honestly reflects the concern. ACOG does good work, but things like this leave them open to attacks that their primary purpose is preventing malpractice lawsuits and protecting their pharmaceutical friends. November 18, 2024: Why 150 Milligrams? Depo-Provera is administered at a 150 mg dose via intramuscular injection, delivering a potent and prolonged release of progestin into the bloodstream. But why exactly was this dosage chosen? The 150 mg figure seems arbitrary, especially considering that lower-dose alternatives, like Depo-SubQ Provera 104, have been shown to be effective. If contraception can be achieved at a lower dose, why did Pfizer stick with such a high amount? This raises critical questions that need to be addressed in pretrial discovery. Was this dose ever rigorously tested against lower doses in clinical trials to assess whether it was truly necessary? Or was the 150 mg dose simply a relic of early formulations that Pfizer never felt compelled to re-evaluate? Given the increasing number of lawsuits linking Depo-Provera to serious health risks, including brain tumors, it is crucial to determine whether this high dosage played a role in amplifying those risks. If there were safer alternatives, and Pfizer ignored them, that would be a significant piece of the liability puzzle in this litigation. November 14, 2024: Projected Number of Depo-Provera Lawsuits Depo Provera lawyers are trying to determine just how many possible lawsuits there could be. As we discuss in more detail below, this litigation was triggered by a study reporting that medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) increases the risk of meningioma by a statistically stunning 5.5 times. So let\u2019s walk through this. There are approximately 2-3 million prescriptions for Depo-Provera filled annually in the United States. The overall incidence of meningioma in the US is estimated to be around 9.5 per 100,000 people per year. If we assume that the increased risk applies uniformly to all users of Depo-Provera, then for every 100,000 Depo-Provera users, approximately 52.25 cases of meningioma could occur each year. This figure is derived by applying the 5.5-fold increase in risk to the baseline incidence rate (9.5 per 100,000). Is this calculation underestimating the real impact? Based on the number of victims already calling our attorneys to discuss filing a Depo-Provera compensation claim, this estimate might be low. Our lawyers just began speaking with affected individuals for over a month and we have nearly 100 signed claims. That is an unscientific way to look at it. Still, this much volume suggests that either the calculated number of cases underrepresents the reality, or a lot of women are now making the connection between their symptoms and Depo-Provera use. November 13, 2024: Pfizer\u2019s Post-Market Surveillance One of the central questions in this litigation will be whether Pfizer\u2019s internal safety monitoring systems were sufficient to detect and respond to early reports linking Depo Provera to meningiomas. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will closely scrutinize Pfizer\u2019s pharmacovigilance practices\u2014its post-market surveillance efforts\u2014to determine whether the company adequately identified and assessed brain tumor risks or whether it ignored red flags that warranted further investigation. As discovery progresses, Depo Provera lawyers will really be drilling down to analyze Pfizer\u2019s internal documents, communications, and adverse event reports. Did Pfizer entirely overlook the problem or, more likely, become aware of a potential link between Depo-Provera and meningiomas but fail to take appropriate action? It will be interesting to see whether Pfizer\u2019s monitoring mechanisms were designed to detect long-term risks associated with synthetic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate, the active ingredient in Depo Provera. I think we know what the answer will be. Bear in mind plaintiffs do not need to prove that Depo Provera should never have been brought to market or that the drug should be recalled. Liability will hinge on whether Pfizer either knew or should have known about a significant risk of meningiomas and failed to adequately warn physicians and patients. If evidence shows that Pfizer had sufficient data suggesting an increased brain tumor risk and still chose not to update its warning label or conduct further safety studies, it will be held accountable for failing to uphold its duty to ensure patient safety. November 12, 2024: Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 There will be a lot of focus in this litigation on Depo Sub-Q Provera 104. This is a lower-dose version of the popular Depo-Provera contraceptive injection, designed to be administered subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly. It contains 104 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, compared to the 150 mg dose in the traditional Depo-Provera, and is injected into the fatty layer just below the skin. Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 is seemingly much safer. It likely carries a significantly lower brain tumor risk. Meningioma is associated with high cumulative doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate over time. Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 delivers a reduced dose (104 mg rather than 150 mg), which not only provides effective contraception but also exposes users to lower levels of synthetic progestin per injection. Why wouldn\u2019t Pfizer push for the better product? The most logical explanation is profit-driven motives. The original Depo-Provera has been well-established in the contraceptive market for years, with a strong user base and widespread recognition. Introducing a new formulation might not have been seen as necessary to maintain market share. There were also risks. The product\u2019s lower dosage and more convenient subcutaneous administration offer patients advantages. But these same features may extend the time between necessary doses, reducing repeat purchases, which risks shrinking revenue per patient over time. Another fear may have been that the subcutaneous administration of Depo Sub-Q could require additional training for healthcare providers and patients. Ensuring proper usage and addressing potential concerns about self-administration may have posed logistical challenges that could impact sales. You can bet this was a focus on in-house discussions within Pfizer. Depo Provera lawyers will have a lot of questions about this when Pfizer corporate representatives are deposed and there will be a lot of internal documents that will flush this out. November 7, 2024: Questions You Have About Filing a Depo Provera Lawsuit A bit less formally, our lawyers answer the 12 most common questions women have about filing a Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuit. November 5, 2024: New Depo Provera Lawsuit Filed in California In a new Depo Provera lawsuit, a Fontana, California woman claims Depo-Provera caused her to develop a life-threatening brain tumor. She says that the companies responsible, including Pfizer, Viatris, and their affiliates, failed to disclose the risks despite decades of scientific evidence linking the drug to meningioma. According to the suit, the plaintiff used Depo-Provera injections from 1999 to 2018, after which she began to suffer neurological symptoms that led to the discovery of a sizeable intracranial meningioma requiring invasive surgery. Where should a Depo Provera MDL be located? This case was filed in the Northern District of California, which increasingly looks like the best option. If this is how it plays out, any Depo shot lawsuit filed in federal court in Texas, New York, Florida, or anywhere else in the country would be transferred for pretrial handling in California. October 31, 2024 \u2013 European Warning As we have talked about, Pfizer has implemented label changes for Depo-Provera in the European Union and the United Kingdom, along with potential updates in other regions. The added cautionary language under \u201cSpecial warnings and precautions for use\u201d in the EU label states: \u201cMeningioma: Meningiomas have been reported following long-term administration of progestogens, including medroxyprogesterone acetate. Depo-Provera should be discontinued if a meningioma is diagnosed. Caution is advised when recommending Depo-Provera to patients with a history of meningioma.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will, with good reason, continue to pound Pfizer over the head with this. The optics of warning there and not warning here are just awful. But the reality is this wording is vague and falls short of addressing the severity of the risk. The label merely suggests \u201ccaution\u201d in prescribing Depo-Provera to patients with a history of meningioma without any strong warnings about the drug\u2019s potential to cause these tumors, even in those without such a history. It advises discontinuation only after diagnosis, disregarding the likelihood of irreversible harm by that stage. Pfizer needs a stronger, more explicit warning on this product everywhere that provides a real warning of the risk of meningioma. If it chooses to give this watered-down warning in the U.S.\u2014and there will be a warning, eventually\u2014plaintiffs\u2019 Depo Provera lawyers will correctly view it as no warning at all. October 30, 2024: Depo Provera Design Defect Claim The core of every Depo Provera lawsuit is Pfizer\u2019s failure to warn. But there is also a strong strict liability design defect claim in this litigation. A strict liability design defect claim asserts that a product was inherently dangerous due to its design, making it unreasonably unsafe for consumers even if the manufacturer exercised care during production. In the Depo Provera litigation, the claim is that the drug\u2019s design\u2014particularly the high dose of progestin\u2014was unreasonably dangerous, posing a risk of serious health issues like intracranial meningioma. Could the product be made safer? Yes. Pfizer has already made the product safer. Depo-SubQ Provera 104 uses a lower dose and can be injected subcutaneously. Pfizer allegedly promoted the high-dose version, neglecting to warn the medical community and consumers about potential risks. So a key claim in every Depo Provera suit will be that Pfizer should have either promoted the subcutaneous option or redesigned the original formula to mitigate the risks. Moreover, Depo Provera lawyers will claim that Pfizer avoided marketing the safer alternative to maintain its market share and did not fully disclose these safety concerns. Thus, under strict liability for a design defect, the plaintiffs argue that Pfizer is responsible for the injuries caused by Depo Provera due to the inherent risks associated with its design. These strict liability design defect claims for Depo-Provera are especially compelling because the safer alternative is not a competitor\u2019s product. It came from Pfizer itself. Usually, proving that a safer design exists in a design defect case is tough. It often means comparing apples and oranges across different manufacturers. But here, Pfizer had already developed and received approval for Depo-SubQ Provera 104, a version with a lower dose that significantly reduces risks of severe side effects, like intracranial meningioma. This internal comparison within Pfizer\u2019s own lineup underscores the questions: why wasn\u2019t the safer alternative the standard choice made for the generic and how can Pfizer feign protection as a generic manufacturer? October 29, 2024: When to File for a Depo Provera Class Action? Why haven\u2019t lawyers filed for a Depo Provera class action lawsuit? The main reason lawyers have not filed for a Depo Provera class action\u2014more technically, as we discuss below, a multidistrict litigation (MDL)\u2014is mainly due to the current lack of \u201cnumerosity\u201d in active claims. Right now, there are only three Depo Provera lawsuits in federal court. For an MDL to be established, there must be a certain critical mass, or numerosity, of similar lawsuits filed nationwide. While more plaintiffs are sure to emerge, perhaps thousands, this is not necessarily enough to persuade the MDL Panel that decides these things. As we talk about below, our lawyers expect there will be a good number of Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuits filed in state court in Pennsylvania. October 27, 2024: Depo Provera Attorney Advertisement Underscore the High Hopes for Depo Provera Settlements If you are a woman between 18-55 and on Facebook, it is hard to imagine you have not seen an advertisement for Depo Provera lawsuits. (Our law firm does not advertise. Our clients are lawyer referrals, word-of-mouth, and this website.) As we discuss below, the average verdict or settlement payout in a meningioma lawsuit is $3 million. The possible number of lawsuits, the ability of Pfizer to pay settlement and jury awards, and the compensation successful cases may bring are attracting many attorneys to this litigation. October 21, 2024: When Will a Meningioma Warning Be Added? The absence of a meningioma warning on the U.S. label of Depo-Provera, despite its inclusion on European labels, raises real concerns regarding patient safety and transparency. In Europe, Pfizer has proactively updated Depo-Provera\u2019s label to reflect the potential risk of meningiomas, likely in response to emerging research and regulatory pressure. In the United States, the FDA has yet to mandate a similar warning\u2014and Pfizer has not sought one\u2014even though studies linking hormonal contraceptives to meningioma risk have been circulating for years, even before this new study. The optics are terrible for Pfizer. The FDA should require a warning on Depo Provera today. October 11, 2024: Two Shots or Four? Depo-Provera lawyers are debating the criteria for determining eligibility in meningioma lawsuits, specifically the number of injections required to establish a causal relationship. While evidence points to a dose-response relationship between Depo-Provera use and a heightened risk of meningioma, the exact threshold for this risk remains unsettled. Our law firm has set the criteria at two shots for two main reasons. First, the science does not definitively establish the minimum number of injections that could trigger meningioma development. With such uncertainty, it is safer to err on the side of allowing more women the opportunity to seek justice. More importantly, the pivotal study indicates a risk ratio of 5.5, translating to a 450% increase in risk\u2014an alarming figure that far exceeds typical risk increases in similar studies. Considering this elevated risk, if a woman developed meningioma after just two shots of Depo-Provera and lacks other significant risk factors\u2014such as radiation exposure or rare genetic conditions associated with meningioma\u2014it would be like handing a jury a jigsaw puzzle with only one piece missing. The conclusion they will almost certainly draw is that Depo-Provera is the missing piece causing the tumor. October 8, 2024: Depo Provera Lawsuit Statute of Limitations Many women contacting us are worried about the deadline for filing a Depo-Provera lawsuit. Lawyers are always concerned about the statute of limitations. But there should not be many statute of limitations issues in this case for women acting now. There are two primary reasons why the statute of limitations should not be a significant concern. The first reason is the discovery rule, which every state has, in varying forms. The discovery rule is a legal principle that delays the start of the statute of limitations until a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should know, about both the injury and its connection to the defendant\u2019s conduct. In the context of Depo-Provera meningioma lawsuits, women who developed brain tumors could not have reasonably suspected the link between their condition and Depo-Provera until recent scientific studies were published. Before these studies, neither the public nor the medical community widely recognized that Depo-Provera could be associated with brain tumors, making it unreasonable for plaintiffs to connect their diagnosis to the drug years earlier. The second reason is the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. We can convincingly argue that the defendants\u2014manufacturers, and marketers of the Depo shot\u2014willfully, intentionally, and deliberately concealed the known risks associated with the long-term use of Depo-Provera. By asserting that the defendants actively hid safety-related warnings, manipulated product labeling, and intentionally withheld crucial information regarding the dangers of intracranial meningiomas, fraudulent concealment allows the statute of limitations to be \u201ctolled\u201d or paused because the defendants\u2019 deceptive actions prevented the plaintiffs from knowing about their potential claims. October 6, 2024: Depo Provera Lawsuits in Philadelphia You are likely to see a large number of lawsuits from all over the country filed in state court in Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Why would a case in Texas, New York, or California be filed in Pennsylvania state court? The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas is known for its experienced judiciary in handling complex mass tort and product liability cases, making it an attractive venue for plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. The court\u2019s Complex Litigation Center (CLC) is widely regarded for its efficient management of large caseloads and has historically rendered significant verdicts and settlements in favor of plaintiffs. Why are plaintiffs from other jurisdictions allowed to file in Pennsylvania? One of the defendants in the litigation, Viatris Inc., has its headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which allows plaintiffs to sue all defendants in state court in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has procedural laws that provide some flexibility in consolidating cases, which can streamline litigation and make it more cost-effective for plaintiffs. Additionally, the state\u2019s rules on expert testimony are often considered more favorable to plaintiffs, making it easier to present scientific evidence that might be challenged under stricter standards in federal court (although that does not appear to be a concern in this litigation). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Philadelphia juries are often regarded as being particularly empathetic and fair to individuals who have suffered harm due to corporate negligence. Known for their willingness to hold large companies accountable, these juries tend to take a hard look at the impact on victims, making the city an attractive venue for plaintiffs seeking justice against powerful corporate defendants. Our lawyers have seen time and time again how this reputation can significantly influence the dynamics of litigation and settlement discussions. Pfizer and the other defendants may see the risk of facing a jury trial in Philadelphia as a compelling reason to make fair Depo Provera settlement offers. So, ultimately, what our attorneys think you will see is a Depo Provera federal class action-type lawsuit (an MDL) and mini-class actions in various state courts around the country. October 1, 2024: Lawyers Seek Compensation For Generic Depo-Provera Users Can you sue for failure to warn if you were taking generic Depo Provera? Usually, the answer to this question is no. But plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have an argument around this problem to seek compensation for victims who used a generic. The allegation is that Pfizer used its subsidiaries, Greenstone and Prasco, to market an \u201cauthorized generic\u201d version of the drug. This generic is chemically identical to the brand-name product but sold under a generic label. By doing so, Pfizer maintained market dominance and revenue while limiting liability for labeling and safety warnings, thus exposing consumers to the same risks without adequate disclosure. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will contend that even if an \u201cauthorized generic\u201d is marketed by a subsidiary, Pfizer still has a duty to ensure that all versions of the drug, branded or not, contain appropriate warnings about known risks, such as the increased risk of meningiomas. So these lawsuits will contend that Pfizer failed to include critical warnings about the risk of meningiomas on Depo Provera\u2019s label, and this omission extended to the authorized generics distributed by Greenstone and Prasco. It certainly follows that Pfizer should be liable for these failures because the authorized generic was essentially the same product under Pfizer\u2019s control. September 25, 2024: Will There Be a Depo Provera Class Action Lawsuit? Most likely, this litigation will be consolidated in an MDL. Why not a class action lawsuit? A Depo-Provera class action lawsuit would combine all plaintiffs into a single, unified case, with one trial or settlement covering everyone. Any compensation would be divided equally among participants, regardless of individual circumstances. That does not work because the injuries women have suffered are so different. An MDL works differently, allowing each plaintiff to retain their individual case, meaning their injuries and damages are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In an MDL, pretrial proceedings are consolidated to make the process more efficient, but the cases remain separate. Individual cases still proceed to trial if a global settlement is not reached. This structure just makes more sense in a case like this. In addition to federal MDLs, state MDLs can also be created when enough cases are filed within a single state court system. State MDLs follow a similar process by grouping related cases under one judge for pretrial proceedings, but they remain within the jurisdiction of state courts rather than federal ones. This can happen in the Depo Provera litigation in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, where some Depo Provera corporate defendants reside so they can be sued there. In large pharmaceutical litigations like Depo-Provera, it\u2019s common to see parallel MDLs at both the state and federal levels, each working toward a global resolution or individual trial outcomes. September 22, 2024: Why Pfizer Should Be Responsible for the Generics It Owns Many authorized generic manufacturers involved in the Depo-Provera litigation\u2014Greenstone, Viatris, and Prasco\u2014are directly or indirectly connected to Pfizer, giving the pharmaceutical giant significant control over how these generics are manufactured, marketed, and labeled. Greenstone was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer and operated under Pfizer\u2019s infrastructure, with its personnel reporting directly to Pfizer. Even after Greenstone was merged into Viatris through a spinoff in 2020, Pfizer retained a reported 57% ownership stake in Viatris, making it the majority stakeholder. Prasco, another authorized generic distributor, also relied heavily on Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing and product pipeline to market \u201cgeneric\u201d versions of Depo-Provera. Because Pfizer maintained control over these entities and their operations, it is reasonable to hold Pfizer responsible for any failures to warn associated with these products. Pfizer\u2019s influence extends beyond manufacturing. These generics did not simply replicate the original drug. They operated under Pfizer\u2019s direct oversight, using identical formulations and infrastructure. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers can effectively argue that because these companies acted as extensions of Pfizer\u2019s business, any failure to update the original Depo-Provera label with appropriate warnings about meningiomas also applies to the generics. Pfizer should not pretend it could not change the warning for the generics when it could change the warning for Depo Provera. It would be the height of insanity to let Pfizer shift liability to its subsidiaries or partners when it actively benefited from and de facto controlled their operations, creating a coordinated distribution network that profited handsomely from misleading labels across all product versions. April 25, 2024: Pfizer Releases Public Statement Addressing Links To Meningioma Brain Tumors The maker of Depo-Provera, Pfizer, released a public statement addressing the new BMJ study linking the birth control shot to meningioma brain tumors. Among other things, the statement from Pfizer indicated: \u201cWe are aware of this potential risk associated with long-term use of progestogens and, in collaboration with regulatory agencies, are in the process of updating product labels and patient information leaflets with appropriate wording.\u201d March 29, 2024: British Medical Journal Finds Link Between Prolonged Use Of Depo-Provera And Increased Risk Of Brain Tumors A study published in the British Medical Journal found that prolonged use of Depo-Provera causes a significant increase in the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors. The study found that women who used Depo-Provera were more than 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with meningiomas compared to women who never used the birth control shot. This study\u2019s findings will jumpstart the Depo-Provera litigation. This is unusually strong scientific evidence linking the drug to meningioma. The risk ratio of 5.5\u2014indicating that Depo-Provera users are more than five times as likely to develop meningiomas compared to non-users\u2014goes beyond what is typically seen in comparable studies.\n\nDepo Provera Lawsuit FAQs Is Depo-Provera the Next Mass Tort That Will Explode in 2025? Yes. The science linking Depo-Provera to meningioma is some of the strongest in pharmaceutical litigation. A BMJ study found that women using the birth control shot for over a year were 5.6 times more likely to develop a meningioma. This is a huge deal because a 5.6 times increased risk is not just a small red flag. It is a flashing siren. In mass tort cases, having such clear, statistically significant evidence linking a drug to a serious condition makes it much easier for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to prove their claims. It puts massive pressure on the defendants. Although things have slowed down a bit as 2025 progresses, our lawyers are still seeing an avalanche of new cases. With the Depo-Provera class action lawsuit (MDL actually) now set up with a judge who will put the pedal to the metal, this litigation will move fast. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are putting more energy into the Depo-Provera litigation right now than any other mass tort in the country. How Much Money Could a Depo-Provera Lawsuit Be Worth? It is still early, and there is a long way to go before we can confidently predict Depo-Provera settlement payouts. But based on what we know, we can give you our best assessment. Our attorneys estimate that individual settlements could range from $275,000 to over $1 million. The most severe cases\u2014those involving multiple surgeries, permanent disabilities, or life-altering complications\u2014could be worth even more. These are not minor injuries. We are talking about brain surgery, long-term cognitive issues, and a lifetime of medical monitoring. Pfizer has the resources to fight, but the scale and seriousness of these claims put this litigation in high-value mass tort territory. When all is said and done, we predict the key question will not be whether these cases will settle\u2014it will be when and how much. But we have some work to do first. We flush out the nuances of how our lawyers view Depo shot lawsuit settlement payouts below. How Do We Know Pfizer Knew About the Brain Tumor Risk? This is not a new problem. Studies linking Depo-Provera to meningioma go back to 1983, when researchers discovered that synthetic hormones could stimulate progesterone receptors in these tumors. That was a significant red flag\u2014if anyone had bothered to look. European regulators saw the warning signs and required Pfizer to add a meningioma warning. Canada followed suit. And in the United States? Still nothing. Pfizer knew the risks. The science was there. But instead of updating the warning label, it kept the information quiet and the sales rolling. Because, as history has shown, profits tend to win when profits and public safety go head-to-head. What\u2019s Happening in Court? Where Are These Cases Filed? The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated more than 80 cases into an MDL in the Northern District of Florida under Judge Casey Rodgers. Expect thousands more cases to follow. Meanwhile, Philadelphia state courts may also see a significant number of claims. Who Qualifies for a Depo-Provera Lawsuit? If you received at least two injections of Depo-Provera and were later diagnosed with a meningioma brain tumor, our lawyers think you may have a viable claim. The strongest claims involve long-term users (5 or more years). But even women with shorter exposure may be eligible. How Many Depo-Provera Lawsuits Are Expected? Current estimates suggest there could be between 16,000 and 18,000 cases involving women diagnosed with progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas. But that number may only be the beginning. When you account for delayed diagnoses and cases that have not yet been connected to Depo-Provera, the actual total could be far higher. Of course, not all of these women will make a claim.) We are seeing this firsthand. The volume of calls our law firm receives makes it hard to believe this will remain a limited tort. The number of affected women\u2014and the severity of their injuries\u2014suggests this litigation will grow exponentially. How Can I File a Depo-Provera Lawsuit? 800-553-8082 or If you or a loved one developed a meningioma brain tumor after using Depo-Provera, you may be entitled to significant financial compensation.

Often called the birth control shot, it is an injectable form of contraception for women. It is administered by injection (in the arm or butt) every three months and provides a highly effective, long-lasting option without the need for daily attention, as long as it is taken on schedule.\n\nPfizer has made a fortune from Depo Provera. A recent National Health Statistics Report from December 2023 indicates that nearly 24.5% of all sexually experienced women in the United States used Depo-Provera at some point between 2015 and 2019.\n\nDepo-Provera\u2019s journey to approval as a contraceptive involved decades of regulatory challenges and controversy. Initially developed by Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in the 1950s, Depo-Provera\u2014depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)\u2014was intended as an injectable treatment for endometrial and renal cancers.\n\nDepo-Provera\u2019s effectiveness as a contraceptive stems from its use of a high-dose synthetic hormone (progestin) that suppresses ovulation for extended periods. In 1967, Upjohn applied to the FDA to market the drug as a contraceptive, but the FDA rejected the application, citing concerns about potential cancer risks\u2014a decision that foreshadowed the current brain tumor litigation. Undeterred, Upjohn submitted two additional applications in 1978 and 1983, both of which were also rejected due to ongoing safety concerns.\n\nBefore receiving FDA approval in the United States, Upjohn successfully introduced Depo Provera as a contraceptive in international markets, gaining approval in France as early as 1969. In the U.S., the drug sparked intense debate as data on its long-term effects continued to surface. After years of additional studies and increasing global acceptance, the FDA approved Depo Provera as a contraceptive in 1992.\n\nControversy persisted, especially around potential links to bone density loss and increased risks of certain cancers and neurological conditions, such as meningiomas. Upjohn merged with Swedish company Pharmacia in 1995, and Pfizer ultimately acquired Pharmacia & Upjohn in 2002, inheriting the regulatory responsibilities and liabilities associated with Depo-Provera.\n\nAlthough Depo-Provera has been available in generic form for many years, most generic versions of Depo-Provera are actually still manufactured by Pfizer and then sold as generics by various companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Depo Provera Works\n\nDepo-Provera contains a special type of synthetic hormone called progestin. This hormone prevents pregnancy by blocking the release of eggs during ovulation and thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. It also thickens the mucus lining of the cervix, which helps keep out sperm.\n\nWhen administered consistently, Depo-Provera is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is why it is so wildly popular. Although primarily designed and approved as a contraceptive, it is also commonly prescribed for managing other gynecological conditions. For instance, Depo-Provera is frequently used to alleviate symptoms associated with endometriosis, providing patients relief from pain and discomfort.\n\nStudy Links Depo-Provera to Brain Tumors\n\nIn March 2024, a significant new scientific study was released, which found a clear link between the use of Depo-Provera and the development of a specific type of brain tumor called a meningioma. The new study was published in the renowned British Medical Journal.\n\nThe study investigated the relationship between the use of certain hormone medications, known as progestogens, and the risk of developing a type of brain tumor called meningioma. The research focused on a variety of progestogens, analyzing data from the French National Health Data System, which included women who had undergone surgery for meningioma in France.\n\nThe study included 108,366 women, with 18,061 women who had undergone surgery for meningioma. So this is a big study.\n\nThe findings were significant in a few areas:\n\nLong-term use (defined as more than one year) of specific progestogens, including medrogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and promegestone, was linked to an increased risk of developing meningiomas.\n\nConversely, the study found no increased risk associated with other hormonal treatments such as progesterone, dydrogesterone, and some types of hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs).\n\nOur lawyers review many studies in drug litigations. One of the big numbers is the odds ratio. The odds ratio represents the likelihood of developing a condition among users compared to non-users. For example, an odds ratio of 2 would mean that users are approximately twice as likely to develop the condition.\n\nIn this case, the study looked at medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which is Depo-Provera. For MPA, nine cases exposed out of 18,061 total cases (0.05%) vs. 11 controls exposed out of 90,305 total controls (0.01%). That is a stunning odds ratio of 5.55. You rarely see a tort claim where there is a study as strong as this one.\n\nPrevious Studies Put Pfizer on Notice of a Problem\n\nThis was not the first study that suggested a risk of meningioma. In 1983\u2014that\u2019s right, 1983\u2014a study published in the European Journal of Cancer & Clinical Oncology identified the presence of a high concentration of progesterone receptors in human meningioma cells. This study focused on the relationship between progesterone and meningioma growth by examining the concentration of hormone receptors, specifically progesterone receptors, in meningioma cells. The research demonstrated that meningioma cells possess a greater density of progesterone receptors compared to estrogen receptors.\n\nThe key finding of this study was that meningioma cells contained a higher density of progesterone receptors compared to estrogen receptors. This suggested that meningiomas, which are typically slow-growing brain tumors, could be influenced by progesterone levels. So more than 40 years ago, we had a biological explanation for how hormone-based drugs like Depo-Provera (which contains synthetic progesterone) might accelerate the growth of these tumors.\n\nThis was not lost on the authors. The researchers concluded that the high presence of progesterone receptors suggests that progesterone, rather than estrogen, might be a key driver in the growth of these tumors. So the study helps demonstrate that prolonged use of progesterone-based drugs like Depo Provera may significantly increase the risk of meningiomas should have been a concern as far back as 1983.\n\nIn 1991, a study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery explored the effects of mifepristone, an anti-progesterone agent, on meningiomas. Mifepristone competes with progesterone for binding to progesterone receptors, thereby inhibiting the action of progesterone on tumor cells.\n\nThe research found that mifepristone was effective in reducing the growth of meningiomas, which are brain tumors known to express a high density of progesterone receptors. By blocking progesterone from binding to its receptors, mifepristone hindered the hormone\u2019s ability to stimulate tumor growth. This discovery provided compelling evidence that progesterone plays a central role in promoting the growth of meningiomas, especially in tumors sensitive to hormonal changes.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings had significant clinical implications that should have sounded an alarm if anyone cared enough to pay attention. The research demonstrated that hormone-blocking treatments could serve as a viable therapeutic option for managing meningiomas. It was not just a theory\u2014it was a breakthrough that could have fundamentally altered how these tumors were treated. This research highlighted the potential of anti-progesterone therapies like mifepristone to regress tumor growth, particularly in cases where progesterone was a contributing factor.\n\nSo if blocking progesterone could significantly reduce tumor growth, why were pharmaceutical companies not prioritizing thinking about what would happen if you increased progesterone? It seems pretty obvious synthetic progesterone found in Depo-Provera might stimulate meningioma development. This finding supports the argument\u2014as does this 1990 study\u2014that Depo Provera could cause or exacerbate meningiomas, strengthening the causation claim in these lawsuits.\n\nMeningioma Brain Tumors\n\nA meningioma is a type of brain tumor that develops in the protective membranes that cover the brain. Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumor, accounting for 40% of all reported tumors in the brain.\n\nMost meningiomas are non-cancerous, but a certain percentage can be cancerous. Meningiomas are usually slow-growing tumors and may exist in the brain for many years without symptoms before being diagnosed.\n\nMeningiomas are categorized into three different grades:\n\nGrade I : A totally non-cancerous meningioma that grows very slowly, accounting for 8 out of 10 cases.\n\n: A totally non-cancerous meningioma that grows very slowly, accounting for 8 out of 10 cases. Grade II : Non-cancerous but more rapidly growing, making treatment more difficult. Grade II meningiomas are atypical tumors that include subtypes like atypical, clear cell, and chordoid meningiomas, each exhibiting cellular changes that increase recurrence risk and may require both surgery and radiation for treatment. These are only about 15% of meningiomas but over 25% of the calls our lawyers have received so far have been Grade II meningioma brain tumors.\n\n: Non-cancerous but more rapidly growing, making treatment more difficult. Grade II meningiomas are atypical tumors that include subtypes like atypical, clear cell, and chordoid meningiomas, each exhibiting cellular changes that increase recurrence risk and may require both surgery and radiation for treatment. These are only about 15% of meningiomas but over 25% of the calls our lawyers have received so far have been Grade II meningioma brain tumors. Grade III: Malignant (cancerous) tumors that grow fast and aggressively, comprising less than 2% of cases.\n\nUsually, meningiomas are first spotted with an MRI scan and may be found by accident, especially in patients who do not show symptoms. For these patients, doctors sometimes choose to keep an eye on the tumor instead of operating right away. But if surgery is needed, doctors aim to remove the whole tumor and part of the surrounding area to prevent it from coming back. Surgery is the best treatment for spinal meningiomas and usually has good outcomes with a low risk of the tumor coming back. Advances in imaging and surgical techniques have, thankfully, made the process safer and more effective.\n\nTreatment for a symptomatic intracranial meningioma usually involves a highly invasive brain surgery known as a craniotomy, where a portion of the skull is removed to access the brain and meninges. Due to the tumor\u2019s sensitive location, complete removal may be risky and technically challenging, often necessitating additional treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Key risk factors include the presence of superficial meningiomas, moderate to severe peritumoral edema, involvement of critical peritumoral veins, and WHO grade II-III meningiomas.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the likelihood of patients experiencing postoperative anxiety and depression, often leading to an increased use of sedatives and antidepressants during recovery. Additionally, surgery for intracranial meningioma may trigger seizures, necessitating epilepsy medications (which often come with their own risks). Meningiomas that are associated with the use of progesterone-based contraceptives typically occur at the skull base, making their removal more complex and heightening the risk of complications.\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of the treatment, as well as the potential for long-term neurological complications, we expect high settlement payouts for claims like this if this litigation is as successful as we expect. But we think, as we discuss further below, all three grades are strong personal injury claims.\n\nDepo-Provera Product Liability Lawsuits\n\nPharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, are legally obligated to ensure that their products are reasonably safe for consumers and to provide clear and accurate warnings about potential risks associated with their use. This duty falls under what is known as \u201cstrict liability\u201d for failure to warn. It means that even if the drug itself is not inherently defective, a manufacturer can still be held liable if they fail to adequately disclose serious side effects or risks that are reasonably foreseeable.\n\nIf a drug manufacturer fails to meet this responsibility, they can be held accountable for any harm their product causes. Patients and healthcare providers rely on the safety information provided by manufacturers when making decisions about medication use. A critical component of any drug\u2019s safety profile is the warning label, which must include all known or reasonably knowable risks. This information helps doctors make informed decisions so patients can make an informed choice based on the benefits and potential dangers of a drug.\n\nIn the case of Depo-Provera, the link between the drug and meningiomas was not listed as a potential risk or side effect in the drug\u2019s warning label, at least not in the United States. Depo shot lawsuits will argue that Pfizer knew or should have known of the risks so its failure to update its warning label to reflect this potential danger makes a failure to warn claim.\n\nIf Pfizer had disclosed the increased risk of meningioma associated with their product, what would have been the outcome? Simply put: fewer sales for Pfizer. Many patients\u2014arguably most\u2014would opt for alternative contraceptive methods, and healthcare providers would have exercised greater caution in prescribing the drug, especially for long-term use. There are so many birth control options. Transparency about these risks could have significantly altered the decision-making process for both patients and physicians, ultimately leading to different and apparently safer choices.\n\nWho Is Eligible to File a Depo Provera Lawsuit?\n\nOur law firm is looking to bring a Depo-Provera lawsuit for women who received at least two injections of the Depo-Provera birth control shot and were subsequently diagnosed with a meningioma (or other type of brain tumor). These are our firm\u2019s minimum eligibility criteria. We talk about our thinking on this eligibility criteria in our October 11 update above.\n\nWomen who used the Depo-Provera birth control shot for more extended periods will likely have stronger claims than those who used it only a few times. There is a dose-response relationship. But it is believed that receiving the shot at least twice is sufficient to establish a viable claim.\n\nSo far, we have had a few cases with a limited number of Depo injections. Most women calling our law office because they have a brain tumor have used the drug for an extended period.\n\nWhy Pfizer May Face Significant Liability in Depo-Provera Lawsuits\n\nPfizer\u2019s potential liability in Depo-Provera lawsuits stems, as we have been saying, from the fact that it failed to adequately warn consumers about the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors.\n\nBy law, drug manufacturers are supposed to provide clear warnings about any risks tied to their products. But when it comes to Depo-Provera, Pfizer left out the risk of meningiomas on the warning label, despite growing evidence linking long-term use of the shot to this serious condition. Patients need to trust that they\u2019re getting the full picture when making decisions about their health.\n\nThe link between progesterone and meningiomas has been recognized or should have been recognized for decades\u2014especially by pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, which is responsible for conducting FDA-mandated post-market surveillance to monitor their products for potential safety concerns.\n\nThis failure to warn could expose Pfizer to significant financial liability in product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs will argue in Depo Provera meningioma lawsuits that if they had been informed about the tumor risk, they could have made a more informed decision about using the contraceptive. It is a pretty easy argument to make. So by never acting to update the label, it may be very easy to paint Pfizer as prioritizing profit over safety. If this argument lands with a jury, it will influence both jury perceptions and potential settlement amounts in the Depo shot litigation.\n\nYou have to remember how serious the injuries \u2013 and the fear of the injuries \u2013 are in this litigation. Ultimately, there are so many birth control options. Why pick the one that could cause you a brain tumor? Our lawyers believe this litigation will be different from other birth control lawsuit settlements exactly because the injury is both terrifying.\n\nDepo-Provera Brain Tumor Lawsuit Settlement Amounts\n\nAny projection of settlement amounts for Depo Provera lawsuits should begin with some caveats. It is very early in this litigation to provide an accurate estimate of the potential settlement compensation for Depo-Provera brain tumor cases. At this point, we still do not yet know if the scientific evidence will be admissible. But our lawyers can still make an educated guess based on various assumptions and based on settlement payouts in similar tort cases involving comparable facts and injuries.\n\nDepo-Provera Settlement Predictions\n\nIf the evidence supporting causation holds up in court, our lawyers estimate that Depo-Provera brain tumor cases involving significant complications could result in settlement payouts ranging from $275,000 to $500,000. This range reflects the varying degrees of severity associated with meningiomas, which can significantly impact the level of compensation awarded to plaintiffs.\n\nThe difference in symptoms, prognosis, and treatment options between a Grade I (non-cancerous) meningioma and a malignant Grade III meningioma is very significant. A Grade III meningioma is potentially life-threatening and very serious, while Grade I meningiomas are much less damaging and usually not life-threatening.\n\nHow many cases will fall in each of these categories? At this point, we have no idea. But our attorneys firmly believe that Grade III depo shot cases will have meaningful compensation. The trial value of those brain cancer lawsuits\u2014the average settlement\u2014could be in the tens of millions. If there is a global settlement, you will not see average payouts go that high\u2026but these will be significant cases and some of them could settle for well over $1 million if this litigation plays out like we think it might.\n\nKeep something else in mind. The defendant is Pfizer. That company is worth over $150 billion. It is flush with COVID profits and can pay global settlements in the billions without breaking much of a sweat. This is a big deal. Our attorneys are involved with several mass tort lawsuits now in which the question of how much the defendant can really afford to pay creeps into the conversation. We do not have this problem with Depo-Provera lawsuits against Pfizer.\n\nOther Meningioma Lawsuits Give Us More Information on Settlement Compensation\n\nA study of meningioma lawsuits provides insight into how lawyers and juries assess the severity of these injuries. The average payout for plaintiffs in these cases was over $3 million, with neurosurgery-related claims resulting in the highest settlements.\n\nSo, not to belabor the point, if lawyers like us can do their jobs and establish what appears to be a strong link between Depo-Provera and meningiomas, the potential damages awarded could also be substantial.\n\nHow Would a Depo-Provera Settlement Potentially Take Shape? What would a Depo Provera settlement look like? Yes, it is early to talk about settlement. We just filed for an MDL in the last week. But women signing up for a Depo Provera lawsuit want to know that they are getting into and what they will likely be required to do to get to a settlement. This litigation is almost certainly heading toward an MDL (multidistrict litigation), likely in both federal and state courts. Think of an MDL as a way to bundle individual cases under one roof\u2014kind of like a class action, but with each case still standing on its own. In an MDL, pretrial proceedings like discovery and motions are consolidated to speed things up and reduce redundancy. Lawyers test the waters with bellwether trials, early test cases that help set the tone for settlement negotiations. There will be an MDL. What we do not know at the time of this writing (February 2025) is whether the federal MDL will be in New York or California. If these trials go really badly for Pfizer\u2014and with the scientific evidence in these cases, that is a strong possibility\u2014the company will likely settle before there is even a first trial. If history is any guide, most plaintiffs in the Depo Provera MDL will not need to show up in court. For most, it is submitting medical records and paperwork mainly done by the lawyers. Settlement payouts will probably be tiered, meaning those with confirmed meningiomas requiring surgery will get the largest settlement compensation. Who Are the Possible Defendants in a Depo Shot Lawsuit? These are the key defendants in a Depo Provera meningioma lawsuit: Pfizer Inc. : The primary defendant, holding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Depo-Provera and the entity responsible for the drug\u2019s labeling and safety information. Pfizer has maintained control over Depo-Provera\u2019s production and labeling since acquiring Pharmacia & Upjohn in 2002. There is no question Pfizer is the target defendant. It has deep, deep pockets \u2013 especially now, as we talk about above, with all of the Covid vaccine cash it is sitting on \u2013 and it is the most responsible defendant.\n\n: The primary defendant, holding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Depo-Provera and the entity responsible for the drug\u2019s labeling and safety information.

Proof Needed for a Depo Provera Lawsuit Individuals who qualify for a Depo-Provera brain tumor lawsuit will eventually need to prove two key facts to support their claim: (1) that they used the Depo-Provera birth control shot, and (2) they were diagnosed with meningioma or another type of brain tumor. Use of Depo-Provera can be proven with medical records such as records from the prescribing doctor. Insurance billing records can also be used to prove that the plaintiff used the birth control shot. Plaintiffs can also use medical records to prove that they have been diagnosed with a meningioma. Your Depo Provera attorney will help you put all of this together. Our job is to gather and present this evidence effectively, ensuring the strongest possible case. This involves conducting a thorough investigation, consulting medical experts, and identifying any gaps in the proof. Depo Provera Statute of Limitations In this litigation, plaintiffs should generally have more time than you might think to file a Depo Provera lawsuit. In most states, claims over ten years old will still be able to get around any concerns the statute of limitations. Why? The discovery rule and equitable tolling will play a key role. The statute of limitations is the legal deadline by which a lawsuit must be filed. In product liability cases like those involving Depo Provera, the deadline generally begins when the injury occurs. However, many plaintiffs only discover the link between their symptoms and the drug after the initial injury, often due to delayed effects or lack of information about risks. Which is exactly what we have in the Depo shot litigation. Discovery Rule The d",

While it historically sold many types of healthcare products and chemicals, now prescription drugs and vaccines account for the majority of sales. Top sellers include pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13, cancer drug Ibrance, and cardiovascular treatment Eliquis. Pfizer sells these products globally, with international sales representing close to 50% of total sales. Within international sales, emerging markets are a major contributor.\n\nPfizer: A Financial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization: Boasting an elevated market capitalization, the company surpasses industry averages. This signals substantial size and strong market recognition.\n\nPositive Revenue Trend: Examining Pfizer's financials over 3 months reveals a positive narrative. The company achieved a noteworthy revenue growth rate of 21.93% as of 31 December, 2024, showcasing a substantial increase in top-line earnings. As compared to competitors, the company surpassed expectations with a growth rate higher than the average among peers in the Health Care sector.\n\nNet Margin: Pfizer's net margin is below industry averages, indicating potential challenges in maintaining strong profitability. With a net margin of 2.31%, the company may face hurdles in effective cost management.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE): The company's ROE is below industry benchmarks, signaling potential difficulties in efficiently using equity capital. With an ROE of 0.45%, the company may need to address challenges in generating satisfactory returns for shareholders.\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA): Pfizer's ROA lags behind industry averages, suggesting challenges in maximizing returns from its assets. With an ROA of 0.19%, the company may face hurdles in achieving optimal financial performance.\n\nDebt Management: Pfizer's debt-to-equity ratio is below the industry average at 0.72, reflecting a lower dependency on debt financing and a more conservative financial approach.\n\nThe Basics of Analyst Ratings\n\nAnalysts work in banking and financial systems and typically specialize in reporting for stocks or defined sectors. Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish \"analyst ratings\" for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter.\n\nSome analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.\n\nWhich Stocks Are Analysts Recommending Now?\n\nBenzinga Edge gives you instant access to all major analyst upgrades, downgrades, and price targets.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share, indicating a change of -18.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 points to a change of -4.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 indicates a change of +0.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.",

He will be replaced on an interim basis by Director Ian Smith, a former Vertex Pharmaceuticals executive. A search for a permanent CEO is underway. Stoke is developing a treatment for a rare and severe form of epilepsy.\n\nCEO Ed Kaye is stepping down, the company said. He will be replaced on an interim basis by Director Ian Smith, a former Vertex Pharmaceuticals executive. A search for a permanent CEO is underway. Stoke is developing a treatment for a rare and severe form of epilepsy. Sarepta Therapeutics said a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy died following treatment with its Elevidys gene therapy. The cause was acute liver failure.\n\nCRISPR company Arbor gets more cash from ARCH\n\nCRISPR company Arbor Biotechnologies said today that it raised a $73.9 million Series C led by ARCH Venture Partners, after it got regulatory clearance to start its first clinical trial in a rare disease affecting the liver and kidney.\n\nThat amount is a far cry from the $215 Million Series B that the company raised four years ago, when low interest rates fueled a gene-editing bubble. CEO Devyn Smith declined to comment on whether the biotech, which is spun out of Feng Zhang\u2019s lab, had to take a cut in valuation in this new round, but he implied it may have: \u201cPeople can probably determine what most rounds are looking like these days.\u201d\n\nStill, the new investment should give Arbor funding into 2027, providing it more time to collect data and begin proving out its thesis.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead more from STAT\u2019s Jason Mast.\n\nFDA\u2019s chaotic (and cramped) first day in the office\n\nPicture this: You arrive to the office and there\u2019s a long line just to get into the building. You\u2019re scared to drink the water in the building since it tested positive for Legionella bacteria a few months ago. Some of your colleagues are assigned to work in conference rooms shared with dozens of other people. Another is assigned to work in a storage closet inside of a district courthouse, underneath jail cells.\n\nThis is what it looked on the first day back to the office for most FDA employees yesterday, after the Trump administration earlier this year ordered all government employees to return to work in person.\n\nSince the pandemic, the FDA had been allowing employees to work from home to attract highly-skilled workers despite paying lower salaries than industry. According to a 2022 staff survey, about 64% of the agency\u2019s staff had some sort of remote work agreement.\n\nNow, experts worry that this return-to-office mandate \u2014 coupled with the chaotic firings and rehirings led by Elon Musk \u2014 will lead to a staff exodus at FDA.\n\nRead more from STAT\u2019s Lizzy Lawrence.\n\nGenetics expert is first NIH director to leave under Trump\n\nEric Green, the longtime director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, has abruptly left his role, according to two employees with knowledge of the situation and internal communications reviewed by STAT.\n\nHe\u2019s the first director of one of the NIH\u2019s 27 institutes to leave his position in President Trump\u2019s second term. His departure comes as the NIH is bracing for more layoffs, as well as a restructuring aimed at centralizing some of the agency\u2019s core functions. It remains unclear if Green\u2019s departure is a harbinger of more shakeups to the agency.\n\nRead more.\n\nThe key figures to know in HHS\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is quickly filling out with allies of President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. My colleague Isa Cueto tells us about eight key people to know in the agency.\n\nThey include Hannah Anderson, HHS deputy chief of staff on policy. She was a health policy adviser to the Senate HELP Committee Republicans, primarily focused on prescription drug pricing and private health insurance.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also HHS principal deputy assistant secretary Shana Weir, who is perhaps best known for working to overturn the 2020 election results in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nRead more.\n\nOpinion: Don\u2019t ban direct-to-consumer drug ads\n\nPoliticians, including newly confirmed health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have long called for a ban on pharma TV ads, but banning them won\u2019t work as intended, Hal Rosenbluth, CEO of health tech company New Ocean Health Solutions, argues in a new opinion piece.\n\nJust as as alcohol prohibition drove demand underground, banning DTC drug ads might push patients toward less reliable sources of medical information, like social media influencers, online forums, or even black-market drug channels, he said.\n\nInstead, policymakers should focus on implementing stricter regulations on pharma ads to help consumers make more informed choices, such as using clearer language and being more transparent about side effects, Rosenbluth writes.\n\nRead more.\n\nMore reads",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against other undervalued S&P 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Michael Cuggino, President and Portfolio Manager of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 and began discussing his fund\u2019s performance. Despite a challenging market environment, his fund achieved a 4% return this year, which he attributed to diversification rather than reliance on a single asset class like gold. The portfolio includes gold, silver, diversified equities, and bonds. When asked about market reactions to tariff-related headlines, Cuggino emphasized the importance of not overreacting to daily news fluctuations. He described the market\u2019s behavior as herky-jerky and advised investors to focus on long-term opportunities rather than reacting impulsively. His base case anticipated some turbulence due to the transition under the new administration\u2019s economic policies. His strategy involves identifying opportunities during volatile periods rather than making significant portfolio changes.\n\nThe discussion also featured David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, who provided insights on Washington\u2019s role in market volatility. Zervos acknowledged that while policies such as tariffs, immigration reforms, and drug policies were largely unfolding as expected, the speed of changes under the current administration was surprising investors. He pointed out rapid spending cuts and layoffs in the public sector as key contributors to market unease. For instance, courts recently ordered the federal government to rehire probationary employees who had been dismissed. Zervos likened this abrupt shift to transitioning from a public-sector-reliant economy to one driven by the private sector, which is a process that has introduced significant uncertainty. Regarding tariffs specifically, Zervos downplayed their overall impact on the US economy, which he described as domestically driven. While tariffs could affect specific industries like wine or automobiles with high overseas components, he argued that broader economic trends would be shaped by deregulation, reduced business costs, and a shift toward private-sector efficiency. He warned that the speed of these transitions could lead to short-term volatility but maintained optimism about long-term productivity gains.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top S&P 500 stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15.

The drug delivered $1.2 billion in U.S. revenue last year, up 31% from 2023.\n\nChief Executive Albert Bourla says the company is on an upswing, after Pfizer beat analyst estimates recently for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\n\u201cEverything is clicking,\" Bourla said.\n\nPfizer made a big bet on Nurtec. The drug was the crown jewel of an $11.6 billion deal that closed in 2022. Analysts estimated the medicine would ring up $4 billion in yearly sales by 2030, revenue Pfizer was counting on as sales from older products faded.\n\nBut Nurtec sales under Pfizer got off to a disappointing start. It was Pfizer\u2019s fault, said Peter McAllister, a neurologist and co-founder of New England Institute for Neurology and Headache, one of the country\u2019s biggest prescribers of migraine drugs, in Stamford, Conn.\n\n\u201cInstead of really getting out there promoting\" Nurtec, he said, Pfizer \u201cmade it an orphan stepchild of their cardiovascular division. They assigned reps and people who really had priorities that were not in the headache space.\"\n\nAamir Malik, who began leading Pfizer\u2019s U.S. commercial business early last year, gave priority to turning around Nurtec. \u201cWe felt like there was a lot more that could be done,\" he said.\n\nPeter McAllister, a neurologist, says Pfizer has put more emphasis on its migraine business than it did a few years ago.\n\nPfizer revamped its sales approach. It shifted dozens of reps\u2014the salespeople who call on doctors\u2014to the eastern U.S. from the West. The reason: Many of the more than 800 migraine specialists and headache centers like McAllister\u2019s are there.\n\nThe company also encouraged the reps to spend more time with doctors, especially those who prescribed a lot, to explain the drug\u2019s benefits and answer questions. It told the reps to dial back the virtual sales meetings that had increased during the pandemic and to see doctors in person\u2014and for longer. It tied employee bonuses to meeting with frequent prescribers, rather than with doctors broadly.\n\nMcAllister sees a difference. \u201cThey needed to get reorganized and to put more emphasis on it, and I\u2019m seeing that now,\" the doctor said. McAllister has consulted for migraine drugmakers, including Pfizer.\n\nAnother reason that physicians weren\u2019t prescribing Nurtec: reimbursement. Health plans tend to restrict coverage of migraine drugs, requiring patients to try older, less expensive medicines first and doctors to fill out paperwork. Doctors weren\u2019t prescribing Nurtec figuring plans wouldn\u2019t cover it.\n\nPfizer began offering help. It set up a website to explain to patients what insurance policies say and how they can get financial support. It created a toll-free hotline for doctors and patients to ask for help navigating prior authorization and other insurer restrictions. Its reps gave doctors such as Alan Finkel, a neurologist and co-founder of the Carolina Headache Institute in Durham, N.C., pamphlets breaking down insurance policies.\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts help him and his office navigate health coverage that is complicated \u201cbecause there\u2019s a lot of caveats,\" Finkel said. He has consulted for migraine drugmakers, including Nurtec\u2019s developer.\n\nNurtec sales have picked up. The drug delivered $1.2 billion in U.S. revenue last year, up 31% from 2023.\n\nAbrysvo, Pfizer\u2019s shot for a respiratory virus known by its initials RSV, was supposed to build on the company\u2019s success with a Covid-19 vaccine. Analysts expected a blockbuster with yearly sales reaching some $2 billion.\n\nPfizer\u2019s RSV vaccine Abrysvo in the manufacturing process.\n\nBut a rival RSV shot, GSK\u2019s Arexvy, got off to a better start. To catch up, Pfizer overhauled how it packages, sells and distributes vaccines.\n\nThe company improved the shot\u2019s vial after pharmacies and hospitals complained that the vaccine used up too much refrigerator space and took too long to prepare. Pfizer redesigned the vials to make them easier to store and use.\n\nThe company had been selling Abrysvo alone, rather than bundled with other company shots. Yet pharmacies\u2014where most RSV vaccines are given\u2014found buying bundles of vaccines to be more convenient. And Pfizer, by bundling vaccines together, could compete on the breadth of its offerings, rather than simply price.\n\nPfizer poached workers from rivals who knew how to write vaccine contracts and bundle shots. The company began offering pharmacies a package including Abrysvo and Prevnar, Pfizer\u2019s big-selling pneumonia shot.\n\nAbrysvo\u2019s share of vaccine administration in retail pharmacies increased to 43% during the RSV season last year, up from 32% during the period in 2023, according to prescription data-tracking firm Iqvia. By the second half of 2024, Abrysvo had a 48% share in pharmacies and other locations, Pfizer said. Abrysvo sales have pulled roughly even with those of GSK\u2019s Arexvy.\n\nWrite to Jared S.

An advocate for women\u2019s health, Wolf launched an investigation into the vaccine approval process when, according to her, she began to come across reports of menstrual irregularities and related issues following vaccine administration. According to Wolf, she landed a dubious goldmine of sorts: \u201cThere are 450,000 documents, internal documents, Pfizer\u2019s own documents, collated as they tested and developed this injection. And a successful lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration, which had custody of these documents, resulted in the release of these documents.\u201d Convinced that most journalists would not report on the papers, Wolf says she put together the project with 3,250 doctors and scientists from all over the world and produced 109 reports on these documents, 50 of which were published in the book.\n\nAccording to Wolf, billions of dollars were poured in to overcome valid scientific questions about the Pfizer vaccine and combat any sort of vaccine hesitancy. The rushed release and approval of a vaccine, which she says bypassed the stringent 10-15-year safety evaluation process, causes \u201cserious reproductive damages, with live birth rates dropping by 13-20 per cent\u201d in her reckoning. Research papers affirming the vaccine\u2019s safety, Wolf claims, were in academic journals the rich had bought up, along with the journalists. Wolf, in her session, did note that the Indian vaccines might have performed differently if similar outcomes were not recorded here. The pandemic, according to her, has changed billions of lives and bodies forever due to the isolation and \u2018unsafe vaccine administration\u2019.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead More\n\nPublished By: Shyam Balasubramanian Published On: Mar 16, 2025",

The main objective of the study was to establish the safety of PF-07820435 and detect early signals of efficacy, as well as determine the drug\u2019s recommended dose for further studies. The study was initiated in February last year.\n\nSTING, which stands for \u201cstimulator interferon genes,\u201d is a protein that plays a central role in a patient\u2019s anti-cancer immune response by activating type I interferons and other inflammatory players. An orally available drug, PF-07820435 belongs to a class of drugs called STING agonists, which work by triggering the STING pathway and promoting immune activity against cancer cells.\n\nAs of this writing, PF-07820435 remains on the pharma\u2019s pipeline page.\n\nIf Pfizer does eventually decide to completely drop PF-07820435, it will be the latest casualty in the pharma\u2019s push to trim its pipeline and refine its business strategy.\n\nIn December 2024, Pfizer turned its back on Sangamo Therapeutics and its gene therapy candidate giroctocogene fitelparvovec, which the companies were previously developing for hemophilia A. Phase III data released in July 2024 showed that 84% of patients treated with giroctocogene fitelparvovec maintained factor VIII activity above 5%, and majority achieved factor VIII levels greater than 15% of normal.\n\nPfizer and Sangamo were supposed to file a Biologics License Application for giroctocogene fitelparvovec this year. The termination of the companies\u2019 partnership will take effect on April 21, after which the pharma will transition the hemophilia A program back to Sangamo.\n\nLast month, Pfizer announced it was pulling its hemophilia B gene therapy Beqvez from markets worldwide\u2014a decision the company pinned on \u201cthe limited interest patients and their doctors have demonstrated in hemophilia gene therapies.\u201d\n\nPfizer, in September 2024, likewise withdrew Oxbryta, an oral hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor that won the FDA\u2019s approval in 2019 for sickle cell disease. The drug has since been linked to a higher occurrence of complications and death.",

While the broader market declined by 4.1% last week, Pfizer's modest price change may reflect resilience given such context.

During this period, the company has navigated several significant developments. One pivotal factor was the surge in COVID-19 vaccine sales that bolstered revenues, as evidenced by a rise to US$78 billion\u2013US$80 billion in revenue guidance for 2021. In addition, Pfizer's return of the dividend policy, including increases such as the US$0.41 quarterly dividend declared in March 2023, provided meaningful income to shareholders.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer's clinical and product successes played an essential role, highlighted by multiple regulatory approvals like the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization for COMIRNATY in late 2020 and numerous other vaccine developments. Yet, challenges such as declining COVID-related product sales, leading to a US$3.369 billion net loss in Q4 2023, underlined the company's cyclical pressures. Relative to the US Pharmaceuticals industry, which saw a 0.8% return decline over the last year, Pfizer's performance was below par. Nonetheless, the company maintained a focus on innovative treatments and strategic alliances to strengthen its position within the sector.\n\nIs Pfizer part of your asset mix?

            "content": "In what may be the largest political contribution ever given to a political party in Kentucky, the drug maker Pfizer Inc. gave $1 million last month to the building fund of the Republican Party of Kentucky.\n\nA report filed by Republican Party of Kentucky Building Fund last week with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance listed the $1 million from Pfizer along with five other big corporation contributions in the final quarter of 2022 totalling $1.65 million.\n\nThat is an extraordinarily large haul for the fund which had raised only $6,000 during the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nThe other large corporate donors to the fund in late 2022 were:\n\nMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, $300,000;\n\nAltria Client Services LLC, of Richmond, VA., $100,000;\n\nComcast Corp., of Philadelphia; $100,000;\n\nAT&T, of St. Louis; $100,000;\n\nDelta Air Lines, of Atlanta, $50,000.\n\nState and federal campaign finance laws set limits on how much a person or political action committee can give to the executive committee of either political party. (A person can give no more than $15,000 per year.) And corporation contributions to a party\u2019s executive committee are prohibited.\n\nBut part of a campaign finance bill passed by the General Assembly in 2017 allowed each party to establish a building fund that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts. It also allowed the building funds to accept contributions from corporations.\n\nThe Kentucky Democratic Party\u2019s building fund has not yet filed a report on its contributions and expenses for the last quarter of 2022.\n\nThe election registry website says that money in a party building fund \u201cmay be used for expenditures related to the purchase, construction, maintenance, renovation, and repair of the state executive committee\u2019s main headquarters facility.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from Kentucky Lantern, Sean Southard, spokesman for the Republican Party of Kentucky, released a statement Monday that said in part \u201cthe Republican Party purchased the lot next door to our Frankfort headquarters and is planning an expansion project. Our current headquarters was acquired in 1974. With the growth of the Republican Party in Kentucky, we have a need for additional space.\u201d\n\nA sign identifies the party headquarters as the Mitch McConnell Building, in honor of U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nIn response to a question about the huge size of the corporate contributions, Southard\u2019s statement said, \u201cAs we raise funds into the building fund account, we are following both federal and state law. The funds raised into this account can only be used for certain expenditures related to the building and are not eligible to be spent on candidate or issue advocacy.\u201d\n\nPfizer has long had a lobbying presence in Kentucky and for years it has retained the lobbying firm headed by John McCarthy to represent its interests in Frankfort.\n\nMcCarthy, a former chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky who is still a member of its executive committee, did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment on the Pfizer contribution.\n\nPfizer is a multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company based in New York; its brands include Viagra, Zoloft and Lipitor and more recently the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the antiviral Paxlovid.\n\nFueled by sales of its COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer\u2019s revenue doubled to $81.3 billion from 2020 to 2021. The company ranks 43rd on the Fortune 500 list.</a></p>\n\nFor the first three quarters of 2022, Pfizer reported $76 billion in revenues. </p>\n\nPfizer is no stranger to political spending. In 2022, the company spent $11.6 million lobbying the federal government, putting it in the top dozen lobbying spenders, according to Open Secrets.\n\nIts affiliates and PAC contribute generously to federal candidates of both parties.\n\nPfizer announced in November that it will triple or even quadruple the price of its COVID-19 vaccine once it goes on the commercial market next year, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\nComcast, Altria Client Services (formerly Phillip Morris), AT&T and Delta Air Lines, also are registered to lobby the Kentucky General Assembly. Metropolitan Life Insurance does not retain a lobbyist in Frankfort, according to records of the Legislative Ethics Commission.\n\nKentucky Lantern is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

As proud as we are of our nearly two centuries of work, we know that reaching such a milestone is only possible because we don\u2019t take a single year\u2014or single day\u2014for granted.\n\nThat means both celebrating our accomplishments and relentlessly improving. Today, we\u2019re sharing our Annual Review, which outlines how we did just that in 2024.\n\nThe good news is that 2024 was a successful year for Pfizer; the great news is that 2025 is yet another opportunity to outdo yesterday. The results compiled inside our Annual Review detail the ways we excelled over the past year and how our work positions us for the future.\n\nAs with our previous Annual Review, the report is comprised entirely of a letter from our CEO Albert Bourla. He begins by sharing that we achieved or exceeded our goals around each of the five strategic priorities put in place for 2024:\n\nAchieve world-class Oncology leadership\n\nDeliver the next wave of pipeline innovation\n\nMaximize performance of our new products\n\nExpand margins by realigning our cost base\n\nAllocate capital to enhance shareholder value\n\n\u201c2024 was a special year for Pfizer, our 175th anniversary as a company. That\u2019s 175 years of groundbreaking innovation and positive impact for millions of patients around the world. As proud as we are of what we\u2019ve achieved, we\u2019re even more excited about our future. We believe we have a clear strategy, scientific leadership and strong capabilities that position us to create sustained, long-term value for shareholders and positive impact for the people who place their trust in us for their health,\u201d Bourla writes.\n\nThe letter then goes on to highlight Pfizer\u2019s financial performance in 2024 before delving into the accomplishments from the past year, including strides we\u2019ve made in our work to expand patient access to medicines, our fight against cancer, the increasing incorporation of Artificial Intelligence into our processes, and more.\n\nAs Albert writes, Pfizer\u2019s strong 2024 positions us well for the future, with the strategy, leadership, and capabilities in place to help us reach our 200th anniversary.\n\nRead on to learn more about Pfizer\u2019s 2024 in our 2024 Annual Review (Pfizer.com/Annual)",

            "content": "Mack MacKenzie has seen many radical industry shifts throughout his professional life, from the emergence of the internet and e-commerce to ERP and blockchain \u2014 but nothing comes close to what\u2019s happening in the world right now.\n\n\u201cAll of that was tremendous and exciting, but I think that AI might just beat them all out,\u201d he said.\n\nMacKenzie has spent the last 21 years of his career at Pfizer, where he currently serves as vice president of digital for the company\u2019s oncology division, business innovation division and enterprise AI. He has seen the organization\u2019s cancer research capabilities evolve over time, fueled by its acquisition of Seagen, an organization specializing in antibody-drug conjugates.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition has expanded our oncology pipeline, and it allows us to develop more innovative therapies that target various cancer types more effectively,\u201d MacKenzie explained. \u201cIt also combines the expertise and infrastructure of both our companies to enable new life-saving treatments for patients faster than before.\u201d\n\nHe believes that Pfizer sits at the intersection of an \u201calmost \u2018Golden Age of Science\u2019 and the advent of AI.\u201d Sitting within the overlap of these two emerging trends, the company is in the perfect position to pursue its mission, which is to \u201cdeliver breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nAs Pfizer continues to amplify its cancer research initiatives, the company is leaning on an arsenal of advanced technology and expertise to achieve its goals, offering a workplace in which brilliant minds have the opportunity to do even more brilliant things for the world.\n\nWhen AI Meets Human Intelligence\n\nOn average, it takes between 11 to 14 years for a new drug to hit the market. But with AI, some believe that this time could be cut in half.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s actually achieved that yet, but at Pfizer, we believe there\u2019s a significant opportunity for AI to help us move in that direction,\u201d MacKenzie said.\n\nSo far, AI has enhanced the company\u2019s ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that could be missed using traditional methods. The organization is also deploying AI solutions for drug discovery, as the technology has made it easier to expand and advance higher quality drug targets.\n\nAccording to MacKenzie, AI can help accelerate the company\u2019s patient recruitment objectives as well. When dealing with specialized medicine in oncology, it can be difficult to find patients who match certain clinical trial criteria, but partnerships leveraging AI have helped find and identify suitable trial participants more easily.\n\nOf course, AI alone isn\u2019t the key to Pfizer\u2019s continued push toward cancer research innovation. MacKenzie said that this work requires individuals with advanced degrees in various disciplines, such as molecular biology, computational biology, bioinformatics and clinical research. There are also individuals with extensive backgrounds in computer science, data science, AI and machine learning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multi-disciplinary approach that allows us to integrate cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning into our research processes, enabling us to make faster and bigger strides in understanding and treating cancer,\u201d MacKenzie said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a multi-disciplinary approach that allows us to integrate cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning into our research processes, enabling us to make faster, bigger strides in understanding and treating cancer.\u201d\n\nTeams of data scientists, data analysts, clinicians and technologists work in tandem to drive progress, staying in sync through regular meetings, while driving alignment and knowledge-sharing with the help of collaborative platforms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative approach that not only accelerates the research process but also fosters our culture of continuous learning and breakthrough innovation,\u201d MacKenzie said.\n\nA $10-Billion Investment To say Pfizer takes its clinical research and development efforts seriously would be an understatement. According to MacKenzie, the company invested over $10 billion in research and development initiatives last year, believing that these efforts put it one step closer to delivering more and better clinical breakthroughs. Fueled by this investment, the organization has partnered with various AI innovators and platform providers to mature technology that can more effectively advance drug targets and optimize clinical trial designs and operations.\n\nThe Opportunity to Change Others\u2019 Lives \u2014 and One\u2019s Own\n\nEarlier in his career, before MacKenzie began working at Pfizer, he didn\u2019t appreciate the value of pursuing work with purpose.\n\nNow, more than two decades after joining the company, he feels grateful to have a career that\u2019s as fulfilling as it is impactful.\n\n\u201cWhen you can align everything you\u2019re working on day in and day out and everybody around you on a mission like saving lives, it\u2019s incredibly inspiring and motivating. It instills a deep sense of purpose and responsibility,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s that sense of impact that strengthens my relationship to my work, and it drives me to push the boundaries of innovation and strive for excellence every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you can align everything you\u2019re working on day in and day out and everybody around you on a mission like saving lives, it\u2019s incredibly inspiring and motivating.\u201d\n\nInspired by this sense of impact, team members are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs, supported by a \u201cShark Tank environment\u201d that fosters a culture where colleagues can find sponsorship to pursue their dreams.\n\n\u201cIf you have a great idea, it\u2019s not like you have to struggle for a long time to try to find the right environment to bring it to fruition,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cPfizer provides the best of both worlds; the scrappiness of a startup with the scale of one of the world\u2019s largest companies in healthcare.\u201d\n\nInnovative thinking is a cornerstone of Pfizer\u2019s culture, promulgated by opportunities for team members to share their knowledge \u2014 and earn recognition for it. MacKenzie shared that team members can perform research with external partners through the company\u2019s Breakthrough Accelerator program. Winners can be granted awards to carry their ideas forward. The company also hosts an annual Growth Week, during which employees participate in a series of learning opportunities, such as guest speaker panels, to learn more about new technologies and areas of the business.\n\nAdditionally, MacKenzie noted, Pfizer\u2019s annual AI Festival gives team members the skills needed to apply the latest AI advancements to their own work. During the festival, employees get to dive into the nuances of AI applications and speak with representatives from some of the world\u2019s leading AI-focused organizations. All in all, the event gives team members the chance to refine their skill sets and network with others in the process.\n\n\u201cPfizer is an enormous organization with about 80,000 people, so a lot of time, there\u2019s work going on in other parts of the organization you don\u2019t even know about,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way to kind of connect both in person and virtually.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Pfizer offers a space for researchers and technologists to reach their full potential. As team members expand their own understanding of the industry\u2019s latest advancements, they get to apply this newfound knowledge to their work, enabling them to accomplish work with the potential to change the world.\n\nFor MacKenzie, Pfizer\u2019s continued use of AI signals the start of a major transformation \u2014 and he can\u2019t wait to see it for himself.\n\n\u201cI believe that very quickly, we\u2019re going to see some tremendous changes in almost every way the business operates moving forward, and it\u2019s really exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hyper-optimistic about the impact it could have not just on Pfizer but on global health.\u201d",

Best of luck, and do keep in touch\u2026\n\nA group of U.S. senators sent letters to five telehealth companies that offer care through direct-to-consumer portals from pharmaceutical manufacturers Pfizer and Eli Lilly, interrogating their financial relationships, STAT tells us. The questions seek to determine whether contracts between pharma and telehealth companies could violate the federal anti-kickback statute. The lawmakers, led by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in October sent similar letters to Pfizer and Lilly demanding answers about their relationships with the telehealth prescribers, which patients can access through websites PfizerForAll and LillyDirect, which also offer patients the ability to fill prescriptions for their medications online. The questions to telehealth companies highlight the regulatory gray area created when virtual care providers market specific drugs. Pharmaceutical companies\u2019 marketing is closely regulated, limiting the claims they can make about a medication\u2019s safety and efficacy, and requiring disclosure of side effects and contraindications. Telehealth companies that prescribe a range of medications have not been held to the same standards.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to terminate four demonstration projects at the end of 2025, closing out models affecting primary care, kidney care and healthcare payments in the state of Maryland, The Wall Street Journal says. The agency will also make changes to other projects, including dropping a planned initiative that would offer certain generic drugs to Medicare enrollees for $2. CMS said its planned terminations would save nearly $750 million, and an agency official said the projects would affect millions of patients. The projects were offered through the CMS Innovation Center, a special office that launches and tests new ideas in the agency\u2019s programs, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

In response, UpScriptHealth stated, \u201cWe are reviewing and will respond to Senator Durbin\u2019s letter.\u201d\n\nThe letter notes that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, spend approximately $6 billion annually on Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising.\n\nThe American Medical Association stated, \u201cDirect-to-consumer advertising inflates demand for new and expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate.\u201d\n\nCiting a study, the letter adds that more than two-thirds of drugs advertised on television were considered \u201clow therapeutic value.\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office review found that TV-advertised drugs made up 58% of Medicare\u2019s total prescription drug spending from 2016 to 2018. For instance, direct-to-consumer ads contributed over $886 million to Medicare spending on Pfizer\u2019s Xeljanz in 2022.\n\nA patient who visits Pfizer\u2019s website and then has a telehealth appointment with a prescriber selected by Pfizer is much more likely to request Pfizer\u2019s medication. Additionally, the letter states that the prescriber may be incentivized to prescribe such medication, whether or not it is medically necessary or clinically appropriate.\n\nThe senators have asked UpScriptHealth to respond by April 15.\n\nSimilar letters were sent in October 2024 to Eli Lilly And Co LL and Pfizer, demanding answers about the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 recent move to establish new DTC telehealth platforms.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

            "content": "Strong regulatory frameworks provide a predictable and efficient pathway for scientific advancements to translate into real-world impact, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for patients worldwide.\n\nNational Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) play a vital role in ensuring that patients receive safe and effective medical products. Their collaboration and constant dialogue with pharmaceutical companies at every stage \u2014 from R&D to clinical trials and post-approval monitoring \u2014 are key to success. Additionally, NRAs rely on each other to maintain high regulatory standards, fostering a more efficient and globally connected regulatory environment.\n\nOver the past months, we have worked closely with members of the IFPMA regulatory science committee to shape our engagement at DIA Europe 2025 \u2013 a key platform for sharing industry experience and engaging with regulatory authorities around the world.\n\nTwo central themes have emerged: regulatory reliance and how regulatory systems can accelerate access to breakthrough medical innovations, while ensuring supply chain resilience and continuity.\n\nThe role of regulatory reliance\n\nAs pharmaceutical R&D becomes increasingly global, regulatory reliance offers a powerful tool for improving regulatory efficiency, particularly in regions where resources are limited. According to the WHO, regulatory reliance is a hallmark of a mature regulatory system, signifying efficiency, transparency, and trust in regulatory decision-making.\n\nBy leveraging existing regulatory assessments, reliance helps avoid duplicative reviews, accelerates approvals, and optimizes resources, ultimately speeding up regulatory processes through predictable timelines that accelerate patient access to innovative medical products around the world.\n\nRegulatory reliance can be applied across the entire product lifecycle: inspections, post-approval changes, clinical trials, quality control.\n\nHowever, for reliance to be effectively implemented, certain challenges related to regulatory capacity-building, trust in external evaluations, and alignment of regulatory processes, need to be addressed. Strengthening regulatory reliance frameworks will require continuous collaboration between regulatory authorities, industry stakeholders, and global health organizations. This is why DIA Europe provides such a powerful platform for engagement.\n\nConvergence and collaboration: Building mutual trust\n\nMutual trust between all parties is the foundation of regulatory reliance, and transparency is a key principle for good regulatory practice. To facilitate reliance activities, IFPMA has developed a template that provides a transparent overview of differences between the documentation submitted for marketing authorization or post-approval changes in the relying and the reference NRA. This template is being tested, with the aim to help streamline reliance-based assessments and foster greater trust between industry and NRAs.\n\nBeyond templates, accurate and comprehensive data is crucial for making informed decisions about convergence and reliance. IFPMA worked with Clarivate to gather feedback from experts and publicly available sources on how different countries regulate post-approval changes (PACs) in biotherapeutic products. The findings reveal significant variations in regulatory approaches, emphasizing the need for greater convergence with WHO standards.\n\nDiscussions around regulatory reliance, convergence, and trust are critical to shaping a more agile and patient-centered regulatory landscape. Through collaboration with and between regulatory bodies, we can reduce barriers to access and streamline approval processes.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other best pharma stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhy is China the Talk of the Town in the Pharma Industry?\n\nThe US pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a distinct trend never seen before with large American pharma companies continually looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior.\n\nExperts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nAlthough the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nHow Will the Pharma Industry Perform in 2025?\n\nWe talked about the potential performance of the pharma industry in a recently published article on 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

PROTAC degraders use the cell\u2019s natural protein degradation machinery to target cancer by marking pathogenic proteins for proteasomal destruction.\n\nThese drug candidates are thought to potentially have a number of advantages over current cancer therapies because their unique mechanism of action allows them to target previously undruggable proteins, they also have the potential to be very selective and overcome drug resistance as they are effective against mutations or overexpression that render inhibitors ineffective and also have good catalytic efficiency.\n\nArvinas, a biotech company based in New Haven, CT, was founded in 2013 and was initially the sole developer of vepdegestrant. In 2021, Pfizer partnered with Arvinas to develop the drug further after promising Phase I results.\n\nIn this study, the researchers tested vepdegestrant monotherapy versus fulvestrant in 626 adults with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed following prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy.\n\nAccording to a press statement from the companies, the primary endpoint was an improvement in progression free survival in the intent to treat and estrogen receptor 1-mutant populations, with a secondary endpoint of overall survival.\n\nIn the estrogen receptor 1-mutant group, progression free survival was improved by over 40% (preset hazard ratio of 0.60), meeting the primary endpoint specifications, but this goal was not met in the larger \u201cintent to treat\u201d population that also included people without this specific mutation.\n\nNo major safety concerns were reported and the statement reported that the safety profile was in line with that of earlier studies.\n\nThese results are topline results and the trial is continuing. No results for overall survival have been shared to date, as less than a quarter of the required number of events have occurred.\n\n\u201cThe first Phase III data readout for a PROTAC degrader represents a significant achievement and these data show that vepdegestrant has the potential to provide clinically meaningful outcomes for thousands of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors harbor estrogen receptor 1 mutations,\u201d said John Houston, chairperson, CEO, and president at Arvinas, in a press statement.\n\n\u201cThese data from VERITAC-2 support the potential of vepdegestrant to give patients whose tumors harbor ESR1 mutations additional time without disease progression, compared to fulvestrant,\u201d added Megan O\u2019Meara, MD, interim chief development officer, Pfizer Oncology.\n\nThe companies stated that the broader, more detailed results of the trial will be shared at a later date.",

Due to the use of a smaller D4 platform scale, incorporating the highly accurate Smart Force Transducer (SFT) weighing technology, these feeders require significantly less floor space than previous models. The feeder\u2019s modular quick-change design allows the easy exchange of feeder sizes, using the same scale and drive for fast adaptation to new processes and formulations while also ensuring easy cleaning and maintenance. The quick-change feeder bowl, agitator, and screw combinations can be quickly decoupled from the feeder drive, allowing for simple and fast changeover and cleaning of the feeders. The updated modular concept features a newly developed drive using a servo motor, which helps reduce the overall footprint and offers a much larger turndown range, including low feed rates. For an optimal wash-in-place result, every unit has an integral 2-degree pitch, facilitating maximum drainage during the cleaning processes.\n\nThe KCM-III features a new, powerful CPU with extended memory and optimized control algorithms to ensure faster communication with the feeder drive, weighing system, and peripherals. In combination with the latest generation of Smart Force Transducer (SFT) load cells, the KCM-III also offers a significantly higher weighing resolution of 8,000,000:1 in 20 ms. The latest generation of SFT load cells allow for even higher sampling rates at 450 samples per second. These higher rates result in better noise filtering as well as less weight shift under vibration. In addition, the optimized controls lead to better short-term feeding accuracy as the control system reacts quickly to changes in the system. In the pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing world, where traceability is becoming more and more important, the KCM-III automatically stores up to seven days of log and event files, as well as trace and process data.\n\nThe new batch dispensing system will most certainly help to advance the production of groundbreaking medicines for a variety of applications. Coperion K-Tron\u2019s complete line of equipment meets the rigid requirements of the industry, including strict adherence to cGMP guidelines and standards as well as the use of FDA-approved materials of construction.",

(Credit: National Cancer Institute on Unsplash)\n\nArvinas and Pfizer announced that their Phase 3 VERITAC-2 clinical trial of breast cancer candidate vepdegestrant has achieved its primary endpoint.\n\nThe primary endpoint was achieved following a statistically significant improvement shown in progression-free survival (PFS) for vepdegestrant in the oestrogen receptor 1-mutant (ESR1m) population compared to fulvestrant.\n\nThe trial focused on patients with oestrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It highlighted that vepdegestrant, an investigational oral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) ER degrader, exceeded the pre-specified hazard ratio target in the ESR1m subgroup.\n\nHowever, the study did not reach statistical significance for PFS within the broader intent-to-treat population.\n\nPfizer oncology interim chief development officer Megan O\u2019Meara said: \u201cPatients with advanced ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer face significant clinical challenges, with limited treatment options following disease progression and the development of resistance to available endocrine therapies.\n\n\u201cThese data from VERITAC-2 support the potential of vepdegestrant to give patients whose tumours harbour ESR1 mutations additional time without disease progression, compared to fulvestrant.\u201d\n\nAt the time of analysis, less than 25% of required events for overall survival (OS) had occurred, rendering this data immature.

(Nasdaq: ARVN) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 VERITAC-2 clinical trial (NCT05654623) evaluating vepdegestrant monotherapy versus fulvestrant in adults with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed following prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy. These are the first pivotal data for vepdegestrant, a potential first-in-class investigational oral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) ER degrader.\n\nThe trial met its primary endpoint in the estrogen receptor 1-mutant (ESR1m) population, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to fulvestrant. The results exceeded the pre-specified target hazard ratio of 0.60 in the ESR1m population. The trial did not reach statistical significance in improvement in PFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.\n\n\u201cThe first Phase 3 data readout for a PROTAC degrader represents a significant achievement and these data show that vepdegestrant has the potential to provide clinically meaningful outcomes for thousands of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors harbor estrogen receptor 1 mutations,\u201d said John Houston, Ph.D., Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer and President at Arvinas. \u201cWe want to thank the patients and investigators who participated in this trial, and we look forward to sharing these data with health authorities as well as at a medical conference in 2025.\u201d\n\nOverall survival was not mature at the time of the analysis, with less than a quarter of the required number of events having occurred. The trial will continue to assess overall survival as a key secondary endpoint. In the trial, vepdegestrant was generally well tolerated and its safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. Detailed results from VERITAC-2 will be submitted for presentation at a medical meeting later this year, and these data will be shared with global regulatory authorities to potentially support regulatory filings.\n\n\u201cPatients with advanced ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer face significant clinical challenges, with limited treatment options following disease progression and the development of resistance to available endocrine therapies,\u201d said Megan O\u2019Meara, M.D., Interim Chief Development Officer, Pfizer Oncology. \u201cThese data from VERITAC-2 support the potential of vepdegestrant to give patients whose tumors harbor ESR1 mutations additional time without disease progression, compared to fulvestrant.\u201d\n\nVepdegestrant is an investigational oral PROTAC ER degrader for ER+/HER2- breast cancer being jointly developed by Arvinas and Pfizer and is designed to harness the body\u2019s natural protein disposal system to specifically target and degrade the ER. In February 2024, the companies announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of vepdegestrant for monotherapy in the treatment of adults with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with endocrine-based therapy.\n\nAbout Metastatic Breast Cancer\n\nAbout 2.3 million new breast cancer diagnoses were reported globally in 2022,1 and it is estimated there will be nearly 320,000 people diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. in 2025.2 Estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer accounts for approximately 70% of all cases.3\n\nNearly 30% of women initially diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will ultimately develop metastatic breast cancer (MBC),4 the most advanced stage in which the disease has spread beyond the breast to other parts of the body. Treatment advances have helped those with MBC better manage symptoms, slow tumor growth, and may allow them to live longer, but most patients ultimately develop resistance to current standard-of-care treatments in the first-line setting and experience disease progression. ESR1 mutations are a common cause of acquired resistance and are found in approximately 40% of patients in the second-line setting.5 6 7\n\nAbout the VERITAC-2 Clinical Trial\n\nThe Phase 3 VERITAC-2 clinical trial (NCT05654623) is a global randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of vepdegestrant (ARV-471) as a monotherapy compared to fulvestrant in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The trial enrolled 624 patients at sites in 26 countries who had previously received treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy.\n\nPatients were randomized to receive either vepdegestrant once daily, orally on a 28-day continuous dosing schedule, or fulvestrant, administered intramuscularly on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle starting from Day 1 of Cycle 2. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat and ESR1m populations as determined by blinded independent central review. Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint.\n\nAbout Vepdegestrant\n\nVepdegestrant is an investigational, orally bioavailable PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) protein degrader designed to specifically target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) for the treatment of patients with ER-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. Vepdegestrant is being developed as a potential monotherapy and as part of combination therapy across multiple treatment settings for ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.\n\nIn July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted vepdegestrant Fast Track designation as a monotherapy in the treatment of adults with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with endocrine-based therapy.\n\nAbout Arvinas\n\nArvinas (Nasdaq: ARVN) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Through its PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) protein degrader platform, the Company is pioneering the development of protein degradation therapies designed to harness the body\u2019s natural protein disposal system to selectively and efficiently degrade and remove disease-causing proteins.

In a press announcement, Pfizer and Arvinas reported that vepdegestrant treatment resulted in a \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful\u201d progression-free survival (PFS) improvement in patients carrying mutations in the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene.\n\nHowever, in the intent-to-treat population\u2014which encompasses all patients who were randomized in the trial\u2014vepdegestrant did not elicit a significant improvement in PFS.\n\nIn a note to investors on Tuesday morning, analysts at BMO Capital Markets noted that vepdegestrant\u2019s failure in the \u201cwild type population\u201d could limit its market opportunities down the line. \u201cThis population represents a sizable opportunity\u201d for Arvinas and vepdegestrant, according the analysts, \u201crepresenting as much as 27% of patients in the frontline setting and more moving into later lines of therapy.\u201d\n\nEstablishing efficacy in the wild type population could have opened up approximately \u201c$4 billion in additional revenue upside for vepdegestrant across treatment lines,\u201d BMO continued. However, the analysts noted that after VERITAC-2\u2019s readout, \u201cwe find it unlikely that vepdegestrant will be able to significantly tap into the upside of this wild type population.\u201d\n\nBMO expects Arvinas to be \u201cmeaningfully negatively impacted\u201d by Tuesday\u2019s data\u2014a forecast that has at least partly already come to pass. Arvinas crashed 43% in premarket trading on Tuesday.\n\nNevertheless, Arvinas CEO John Houston appeared upbeat, saying in a statement that the readout \u201crepresents a significant achievement,\u201d pointing to the potential of vepdegestrant to \u201cprovide clinically meaningful outcomes\u201d for metastatic breast cancer patients carrying ESR1 mutations.\n\nThe magnitude of PFS improvement in patients with the ESR1 mutation with vepdegestrant \u201cexceeded the pre-specified target\u201d of a 40% reduction in the risk of death or disease progression, according to the release, though Pfizer and Arvinas did not provide a more specific figure for their drug candidate.\n\nData for overall survival had not yet matured at the time of data collection, according to the companies\u2019 news release. VERITAC-2 will continue to follow patients to assess this outcome, one of its key secondary endpoints.\n\nPfizer and Arvinas will present detailed results from VERITAC-2 at an upcoming medical congress and will present these data to regulatory authorities, potentially building toward an approval for vepdegestrant, despite the uneven results.",

Rather, they inform the regulatory agencies of any new information regarding approved medicines.\n\n\u201cMarketing authorisation holders have a legal obligation to continuously monitor the safety profile of a medicine, including vaccines, for as long as the medicine or vaccine is on the market,\u201d a HALMED spokesman said.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, they are required to submit all new information and findings related to the medicine\u2019s safety to the competent regulatory authorities for review and evaluation. In addition, regulatory authorities also receive reports of suspected side effects directly from patients and healthcare professionals.\u201d\n\nHALMED noted that drug manufacturers are also compelled to periodically submit all collected data on the safety of medicines and vaccines in the so-called PSUR, or Periodic Safety Update Report.\n\nThe most recent PSUR for Comirnaty \u2013 the brand name for Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine \u2013 covered the second half of 2023, and the EMA issued its recommendations based on this document in July 2024 (archived here).\n\nEMA found that the risk-benefit balance remained unchanged and kept the authorisation for the vaccine. The next PSUR review procedure is expected to start this month.\n\nThe EMA press office told AFP Fact Check that the most recent safety update to the product information took place in November 2024, to include further information on the safety of vaccines in infants born to people vaccinated during pregnancy and immunocompromised participants (archived here). The update added data from three scientific studies that found no new dangers or side effects.\n\nThe EMA also noted that the agency, together with national healthcare authorities and manufacturers, is responsible for detecting and managing safety signals, which is any information on possible side effects that warrants further investigation (archived here).\n\nOnce a signal is investigated, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) issues a recommendation on what to do if it suspects it might be a side effect (archived here and here). All signals are publicly available (archived here), and the process of recognising new side effects, as was the case with myocarditis and pericarditis, can be tracked in the table.\n\nAccording to the EMA, and as evidenced in the available data, the most recent safety signal reviewed was \u201cpostmenopausal haemorrhage\u201d, which was considered in March 2024, but PRAC did not find sufficient evidence that it was linked to the Cominarty vaccine (archived here).\n\nThe most recent safety information on Covid-19 vaccines, including Comirnaty, states that all vaccines authorised for use in the EU are safe and effective (archived here).\n\n\u201cSince December 2020, people in the EU and EEA received almost 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines, making it the largest vaccination programme in history,\u201d the EMA says on its website.\n\n\u201cRegulators have an unprecedented amount of data to confirm the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nPfizer also denied publishing the list circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cPfizer did not publish this list, which does not reflect the established efficacy and safety profile of the vaccine,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told AFP Fact Check in an email.\n\n\u201cWith billions of doses of the vaccine administered around the world, the safety profile for the vaccine for all authorised groups continues to be favourable.\u201d\n\nMisinterpreted adverse effects\n\nThe purported side effects found in the false Facebook posts do correspond to a list from a 2021 Pfizer document (archived here).\n\nThe document listed all adverse effects reported and recorded after vaccination in addition to a list of pre-specified medical problems that could theoretically be attributed to the vaccination.\n\nThis list of adverse effects has previously been misinterpreted to be a list of confirmed side effects, which AFP Fact Check has already debunked here in Croatian and here in Serbian.\n\nIn September 2023, HALMED told AFP Fact Check that any incident following a vaccination does not necessarily mean it was caused by the jab.\n\n\u201cInformation about reports of suspected side effects does not mean that the medicine or active substance causes the observed effect or that it is unsafe for use,\u201d the agency said. \u201cOnly a thorough review and scientific assessment of all available data allows for conclusions to be drawn about the benefits and risks of a medicine.\u201d\n\nMore AFP fact checks on the topic of vaccines can be found here, and on Covid-19 can be found here.",

Credit: Shutterstock / Maria Sbytova.\n\nPharma giant Pfizer and Arvinas\u2019s human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer therapy, vepdegestrant, has seen mixed results after it was only able to extend progression-free survival (PFS) in certain patients in a Phase III trial.\n\nTopline results from the company\u2019s Veritac-2 trial (NCT05654623) showed a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS in patients with oestrogen receptor 1-mutant (ESR1m) breast cancer. However, the company said that it was not able to improve PFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.\n\nThe global randomised study enrolled 624 patients at sites in 26 countries who had previously received treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors alongside endocrine therapy. The trial pitted vepdegestrant against AstraZeneca\u2019s Faslodex (fulvestrant).\n\nData on overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was not yet mature with less than a quarter of the required number of events having occurred.\n\nPfizer describes vepdegestrant as a potential first-in-class investigational oral proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) oestrogen receptor degrader. Developed as part of a $2.4bn partnership between Pfizer and Arvinas, the oral drug was designed for a natural protein disposal system to specifically target and degrade oestrogen receptors.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the mixed results, Arvinas\u2019 stock price dropped more than 51% from $17.70 per share down to $8.59 at the time of publication (11 March 10am EST).\n\nArvinas president John Houston said: \u201cThe first Phase III data readout for a PROTAC degrader represents a significant achievement and these data show that vepdegestrant has the potential to provide clinically meaningful outcomes for thousands of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours harbour oestrogen receptor 1 mutations.\u201d\n\nIt follows after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation for the investigation of vepdegestrant as a monotherapy. Research by GlobalData estimates that by the end of next year, the breast cancer therapy could bring in as much as $75m for the two companies, with that figure expected to rise to $841m by the end of 2030. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that breast cancer caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nPfizer oncology chief development officer Megan O\u2019Meara said: \u201cPatients with advanced ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer face significant clinical challenges, with limited treatment options following disease progression and the development of resistance to available endocrine therapies.\n\n\u201cThis data from the Veritac-2 trial supports the potential of vepdegestrant to give patients whose tumours harbour ESR1 mutations additional time without disease progression, compared to Faslodex.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the field of HER2 breast cancer, NiKang Therapeutics has concluded the first cohort dosing in the open-label Phase I trial of NKT3964. Meanwhile, Phoenix Molecular Designs has started dosing in the Phase II arm of a trial examining its metastatic breast cancer candidate, PMD-026.",

This development, combined with the FDA's Fast Track designation for vepdegestrant, positions the company well within the healthcare sector. Additionally, Pfizer's collaboration with Arvinas highlights its commitment to innovation, while the Q4 earnings report showed strong financial performance year-over-year. The broader market experienced a 4.6% downturn amid concerns about tariffs and economic volatility, but Pfizer's targeted advancements and strategic alliances helped it ride these challenges better than some others. As the market contends with shifts due to geopolitical factors, Pfizer's initiatives and clinical successes suggest a focus on expanding its treatment arsenal, which may offer value in turbulent times.

Key elements contributing to this return include the robust performance of its COVID-19 vaccine, which has been a cornerstone of its recent revenue streams. The collaboration with BioNTech, particularly with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, marked a milestone in Pfizer's pharmaceutical advancements. In recent years, the company also achieved significant earnings growth, outpacing the industry, which can be attributed to its successful clinical trials and product releases.\n\nMoreover, Pfizer's share repurchase program has demonstrated its commitment to enhancing shareholder value, as evidenced by the repurchase of over 153 million shares. Despite facing legal challenges and investor pressure, such as litigation related to Oxbryta and interactions with activist investor Starboard, Pfizer has remained resilient. Its strategic alliances in the oncology space and continued investment in pipeline developments have positively impacted long-term returns, supporting its position in the healthcare sector despite recent market underperformance.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nArvinas lost more than half of its market value Tuesday morning after the Connecticut-based biotechnology company and partner Pfizer disclosed anticipated results from a late-stage clinical trial of a new kind of breast cancer drug they\u2019re developing.\n\nArvinas and Pfizer described the findings as a \u201csignificant achievement,\u201d citing the pronounced benefit they observed in a subgroup of patients with a specific breast cancer mutation. But analysts had hoped the drug, called vepdegestrant, might work more broadly.\n\nThe companies only released summary data from the study, indicating that results \u201cexceeded the pre-specified target\u201d for showing a benefit on progression-free survival versus the trial\u2019s comparator drug, fulvestrant, in that subgroup of patients. The difference between the groups overall was not significant.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nFulvestrant has been on the market for more than two decades, during which it\u2019s become a standard treatment for metastatic breast cancers that rely on high estrogen levels and don\u2019t express a protein called HER2. It works by binding to, and helping degrade, estrogen receptors on tumor cells.\n\nFor several years now, researchers have sought to develop new kinds of estrogen-degrading therapies, including ones that can be taken orally rather than injected like fulvestrant. One, from Menarini Group, was approved in 2023, while another, from Eli Lilly, recently posted positive data in Phase 3 testing.\n\nArvinas is trying to do the same, but with a drug that works in a different way. Known as a \u201cPROTAC,\u201d or proteolysis-targeting chimera, it is designed to prod cells into trashing disease-linked proteins, such as the estrogen receptor.\n\nArvinas is a leader in this field of targeted protein degradation, so Tuesday\u2019s data were also looked to as a test of whether these types of medicines can be more effective than other approaches.\n\nAt least so far, vepdegestrant doesn\u2019t appear to have clearly outperformed other next-generation estrogen-targeting drugs. The benefit Arvinas and Pfizer reported as statistically significant was in trial participants who have mutations in a gene called ESR1. Treatment led to at least a 40% reduction in the risk of tumor progression or death among this subgroup \u2014 about on par with data for Menarini\u2019s approved Orserdu and Lilly\u2019s still experimental imlunestrant.\n\n\u201cInvestors were hoping for the drug to work more broadly than the oral [selective estrogen-receptor degrader]s and demonstrate activity in patients without an ESR1 [mutation],\u201d wrote Andrew Berens, an analyst at Leerink Partners, in a client note.\n\nBerens also noted how the data did not yet show a survival benefit in either the ESR1 group or the broader study population. While that\u2019s not unexpected, as survival data takes a longer time to mature, Arvinas and Pfizer didn\u2019t characterize whether results were trending in a direction that might eventually favor their drug.\n\nAnalysts Li Watsek, of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bradley Canino, of Stifel, also view Arvinas\u2019 data as roughly on par, but not better, than the results for Menarini\u2019s and Lilly\u2019s drugs.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this means PROTAC may not be as differentiated as oral SERDs, which so far have only been shown to be superior to fulvestrant in the ESR1 [mutant] patients,\u201d Watsek wrote in a client note.\n\nPfizer and Arvinas said treatment with vepdegestrant was \u201cgenerally well tolerated,\u201d with a safety profile consistent with prior testing. The company plans to present full data from the study at a medical meeting later this year, as well as discuss the data with regulators to determine the path forward to approval applications.",

            "content": "An alternative to Paxlovid, the only antiviral pills approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19, is on the horizon. Pfizer\u2014the maker of Paxlovid\u2014has begun Phase 3 clinical trials of a next-generation coronavirus antiviral, ibuzatrelvir.\n\nIbuzatrelvir offers several advantages over its predecessor. It doesn\u2019t have the drug-drug interactions that prevent many people with COVID-19 from taking Paxlovid. And participants in ibuzatrelvir\u2019s Phase 2 clinical trial didn\u2019t report \u201cPaxlovid mouth,\u201d an unpleasant side effect of the drug in which people experience a lingering taste described as metallic or, more colorfully, like grapefruit mixed with soap.\n\nDespite its drawbacks, Paxlovid is a marvel of modern medicinal chemistry. Experts says its discovery and development show what a well-resourced anti-infective program can produce. The drug, which combines the compounds nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, entered human clinical trials in March 2021, just 12 months after its first synthesis\u2014stunning speed for making a new bespoke drug. At the time, vaccines for COVID-19 were just becoming widely available in the US, and the prospect of an antiviral pill offered another avenue for avoiding hospitalization or death from the disease. By early 2022, Paxlovid was available under emergency use authorization, and it had received full FDA approval by May of 2023.\n\nCredit: RCSB Protein Data Bank\n\nStill, the drug\u2019s side effects, along with a high list price\u2014nearly $1,400, although that\u2019s usually covered by insurance or US government programs\u2014have contributed to its underutilization. A retrospective study published in January 2024 found that out of 309,755 people who were eligible to receive Paxlovid when they were treated for COVID-19 by the US Department of Veterans Affairs health-care system in 2022, only 12.2% received the drug. And even though that percentage climbed over the course of the study, it was only at 23.2% in December of 2022.\n\nOne factor that prevents doctors from prescribing Paxlovid is drug-drug interactions related to its ritonavir component. Ritonavir doesn\u2019t do anything to fight SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That\u2019s the job of Paxlovid\u2019s nirmatrelvir component, which works by blocking SARS-CoV-2\u2019s main protease (Mpro, also known as the 3CL protease), thereby preventing the virus from replicating. But nirmatrelvir is susceptible to metabolism, so to get it to stick around long enough to block Mpro, Pfizer scientists added ritonavir to the mix.\n\nIbuzatrelvir is coming forward to make sure we can reach more patients. Charlotte Allerton, head of preclinical and translational sciences, Pfizer\n\nPeople who take Paxlovid consume two 150 mg doses of nirmatrelvir and one 100 mg dose of ritonavir twice a day for 5 days. Ritonavir binds with CYP3A4 enzymes, which are responsible for metabolism, and gives nirmatrelvir a pharmacokinetic, or PK, boost. Unfortunately, ritonavir can also boost the lifetime of other medications in dangerous ways. This means people who take any of a long list of other drugs, including the immunosuppressant voclosporin and the sedative midazolam, can\u2019t take Paxlovid.\n\nBecause of this, says Northwell Health chief pharmacy officer Lisa Mulloy, ibuzatrelvir could be an important therapy for people at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19, such as those who have undergone organ transplants or are undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nCharlotte Allerton, Pfizer\u2019s head of preclinical and translational sciences, says the drugmaker \u201cwanted to bring forward a second-generation molecule that didn\u2019t require that PK boosting and wouldn\u2019t have inherent drug-drug interactions that would preclude it from being widely prescribed to patients.\u201d\n\nTo do this, the Pfizer scientists focused on making a molecule that was less susceptible to metabolism. One spot they quickly identified for modification was the geminal dimethyl group on nirmatrelvir\u2019s rigid fused bicyclic ring system. It\u2019s prone to oxidation by CYP3A4 enzymes.\n\n\u201cAs part of optimizing the substituents in that position and the overall molecule, we were looking at balancing lipophilicity,\u201d Allerton says. The fused bicyclic ring with a geminal dimethyl group was lipophilic.\n\n\u201cWe know that if we take down lipophilicity\u2014we make it less greasy\u2014that it will likely be less easily metabolized. But of course, that has to be balanced,\u201d Allerton says. Make the molecule too polar, and it won\u2019t be taken up by the body when it\u2019s swallowed. \u201cIt won\u2019t cross the gut wall, and also we won\u2019t get the good antiviral cellular activity that we required,\u201d she says.\n\nThe team\u2019s solution was to replace that fused bicyclic ring system with a proline that has a pendant trifluoromethyl group. This change also makes ibuzatrelvir less rigid than nirmatrelvir. There is a lower barrier to rotation around the amide bond of that proline group. The Pfizer scientists propose that this rotation makes the crystalline form of ibuzatrelvir easier to dissolve and boosts its oral bioavailability compared with that of nirmatrelvir.\n\nThe other key difference between nirmatrelvir and ibuzatrelvir is that the trifluoroacetate group in nirmatrelvir has been replaced with a methylcarbamate in ibuzatrelvir.\n\nBoth molecules are alike in all other respects: both have structures that look like short peptides, and they both contain a nitrile group that reacts with a cysteine in SARS-CoV-2\u2019s Mpro. The Pfizer scientists described ibuzatrelvir\u2019s medicinal chemistry campaign in a Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper that was published in April 2024 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c02469).\n\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational chemistry influenced ibuzatrelvir\u2019s design, Allerton says. Such capabilities expedite the company\u2019s drug discovery process and help them get to molecules that are most likely to meet the criteria they want, she says, instead of making lots of compounds and profiling them in the laboratory, which is a slower process.\n\nFor example, Allerton says, their models can predict a molecule\u2019s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties. \u201cWe can predict them on virtual molecules before we make them, and it really helps us move much more quickly to the molecules that we should be making,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile drugmakers sometimes create next-generation antivirals to address viruses\u2019 resistance to their predecessors, Allerton emphasizes that this is not the case with the development of ibuzatrelvir. Authors of a study published in Sept. 2024 concluded that it was rare for drug-resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 to emerge after nirmatrelvir treatment (JAMA Network Open, DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.35431). \u201cIbuzatrelvir is coming forward to make sure we can reach more patients,\u201d Allerton says.\n\nLike nirmatrelvir, ibuzatrelvir binds tightly to the Mpro active site. Because of that, and because it\u2019s dosed at high concentrations, Allerton and her team think that the second-generation antiviral will also have a low risk of clinical resistance.\n\nUniversity of Oxford medicinal chemist Lennart Brewitz says he was impressed by the way Pfizer modified nirmatrelvir to arrive at ibuzatrelvir. \u201cJust looking at the structures, they don\u2019t differ massively,\u201d he says. And yet, Brewitz says, the Pfizer team made this molecule much more useful because it doesn\u2019t need to be dosed with ritonavir.\n\nThis work showed how focused, properly funded medicinal chemistry can deliver new medicines within a very short time frame, at least for infectious disease. Christopher J. Schofield, medicinal chemist, University of Oxford\n\nPaxlovid \u201cwas developed under intense time pressure and extremely difficult conditions for them to work in, and it wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d says Christopher J. Schofield, who is also a medicinal chemist at Oxford. Under normal circumstances, Schofield says, he\u2019s confident that \u201cthe follow-up compound would likely have been the one they actually took forward.\u201d\n\nBrewitz and Schofield wrote a commentary about ibuzatrelvir that also appeared in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2024, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c01342). They say there\u2019s a larger lesson to be learned from Pfizer\u2019s development of Paxlovid and ibuzatrelvir.\n\n\u201cThis work showed how focused, properly funded medicinal chemistry can deliver new medicines within a very short time frame, at least for infectious disease,\u201d Schofield says. Similarly focused efforts could lead to treatments for other infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis (TB), Schofield says. \u201cIt can be done. It does not take 15 years to make a new anti-infective medicine.\u201d",

            "content": "Hickey weighed in on the uncertainty dominating markets, emphasizing that no one can predict the full impact of tariffs. He referenced Target CEO Brian Cornell\u2019s comments earlier in the day about the lack of certainty regarding tariffs, taxes, rates, and the economy. Hickey remarked that this stew of uncertainty is keeping investors cautious. He noted that intraday rallies, such as the one seen earlier in the day after bouncing off the 200-day moving average, are often short-lived due to unpredictable policy developments. For instance, Trump\u2019s speeches have recently been followed by market declines, adding to investor hesitancy. He also highlighted historical context for pullbacks like the current one: since World War II, there have been 64 instances of a 5% drop from all-time highs in the S&P 500. While not uncommon, he advised caution in the short term due to unpredictable market reactions.\n\nCamporeale highlighted the difficulty of navigating the rapid pace of headlines surrounding trade discussions out of Washington. Entering the year with a 10% equity overweight, JP Morgan has since reduced this to 5%, reallocating some exposure to US, developed non-US, and emerging markets. Camporeale noted that while policy uncertainty raises questions about growth and earnings outlooks, the US economy remains strong, with a 4% unemployment rate, 3% GDP growth, and solid corporate balance sheets. He said that despite short-term market turbulence, recession risks remain low, and their portfolio maintains an equity overweight alongside high-yield exposure. He also pointed out that it is still early in President Trump's second term and too soon to draw definitive conclusions about its impact. He believes that lower interest rates could pave the way for positive fiscal and deregulation policies that have yet to fully materialize. Despite current market fears, he remains optimistic about the economy\u2019s strength and low recession probability.\n\nOn a down day for major market averages, Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, and Phil Camporeale, portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management, discussed the ongoing volatility. They both appeared on CNBC's 'Closing Bell Overtime' on March 5 to talk about how tariff policy raises uncertainty around growth and earnings outlook.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Undervalued US Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other undervalued US stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBoth experts agreed that uncertainty around tariffs and other policies will continue influencing market behavior in the near term. However, they emphasized different aspects, Camporeale focused on economic strength and strategic positioning within portfolios, while Hickey stressed caution amid ongoing unpredictability in policy-driven market movements.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top US stocks that had a forward P/E ratio under 15. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 1000 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Pfizer Inc. (PFE) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of March 6: 8.76\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global biopharmaceutical leader that discovers, develops, and delivers a portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines across a range of therapeutic areas. These include cardiovascular, infectious diseases, and oncology. It serves patients worldwide through its extensive distribution network and strategic collaborations.\n\nThe company's oncology segment is supported by the Seagen acquisition. This acquisition brought Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) a portfolio of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and expanded its oncology pipeline and capabilities. Padcev plus pembrolizumab is the leading first-line treatment for advanced urothelial cancer in the US, with potential to triple its patient reach. As of Q4 2024, Braftovi/Mektovi saw a 27% year-over-year global growth, and recent data showed survival improvements in colorectal cancer. Lorbrena became a standard treatment for lung cancer and grew 37% globally.\n\nThe company is actively expanding its oncology pipeline. Phase 3 studies are ongoing for sigvotatug vedotin in lung cancer, and new studies are planned for first-line lung cancer and head and neck cancer with Candida. A Phase 3 readout for multiple myeloma is expected, which will potentially triple its patient base. In 2025, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will focus on R&D productivity, with several potential regulatory approvals and Phase 3 readouts.\n\nParnassus Value Equity Fund stated the following regarding Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer\u2019s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us. The company completed its acquisition of Seagen, which should strengthen Pfizer\u2019s pipeline in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Pfizer also offers an attractive dividend yield.\u201d\n\nOverall PFE ranks 5th on our list of the most undervalued US stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The 1880s manse, designed by Marshall J. Morrill for Charles Erhart, one of the Pfizer co-founders, sold in 2021 after being on the market for years. The new listing photos show its lavish details are still intact, including plasterwork, mantels, wainscoting, and stained glass. The house was already renovated and restored when it last sold and while there are some new wall finishes, it looks like no new major renovations have been undertaken.\n\nAt 280 Washington Avenue in the Clinton Hill Historic District, the stately brownstone has had a colorful history. Plans were filed in 1887 for a pair of houses by Morrill, both for owner Erhart and to be constructed by builders E. Rutan and Long & Barnes. When the pair of residences were completed in 1889 a write-up in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle described the lush interiors designed by the decorating firm Herts Brothers. Parlors were \u201cfinished in the French Renaissance style\u201d and there was fine woodwork throughout, including mahogany, oak, and cherry. The fourth floors included billiard rooms as well as bedrooms for the servants.\n\nAn early occupant of No. 280 was Erhart\u2019s daughter, Fanny. The 1900 census records Fanny and husband Rudolph Erbsloh in the manse with two young daughters and three servants, including a governess. The house later served as the administrative offices of the Brooklyn Public Library and was known as the Bishop\u2019s House when it was home to the head of the Catholic Diocese.\n\nEventually, a musician bought it and one of the former members of the post-punk group Killing Joke lived there as his roommate. The home\u2019s more recent owners were well known in the neighborhood and to Brownstoner readers for hosting musical and other events at their home and helping to get Clinton Hill\u2019s Greene Hill Food Co-op off the ground. Brownstoner has written about the home numerous times, including in 2011 when the owners found historic documents while doing the renovation. The property also got its own write-up in the New York Times.\n\nThe owners put the property on the market in 2018 with a price tag of $13.5 million and ultimately sold for $9.05 million in 2021.\n\nIt is a lot of house. The 25-foot-wide single-family boasts five floors of living space with historic details, including an original working elevator, as well as modern upgrades like central air, radiant heat, a wine cellar, and parking. A planned upgrade to the garage was approved by LPC in 2024, but not undertaken.\n\nThe front parlor is particularly impressive, with intricate plasterwork on the ceilings, pilasters framing the doorways and mantel, and wood floors with an intricate inlaid border. Details continue in the formal dining room, where there is wainscoting, another mantel, and stained glass.\n\nAt the rear of the parlor level, a kitchen extension has a curved wall of windows and a copper dome roof \u2014 an homage to a conservatory that once stood in the rear yard. The kitchen, which appears unchanged since the 2018 listing photos, has custom cabinetry, radiant heat, and a view of the landscaped backyard. The listing notes that fittings for a new custom kitchen were purchased but not installed, and could be included in the sale if desired.\n\nJust two of the six bedrooms are pictured; both have mantels and wainscoting. The second floor includes the primary suite, with bedrooms at front and rear, a balcony overlooking the front yard, a walk-in closet, and an en-suite bath with a mantel and a large soaking tub. The room is wrapped in extravagant hand-painted de Gournay wallpaper.\n\nListed by Wendy Maitland, Vladimir Luzader, and Emma Maitland of Atelier, the house is priced at $10.35 million. Worth the ask?\n\n[Listing: 280 Washington Avenue | Broker: Compass] GMAP\n\n[Photos via Atelier]\n\nRelated Stories\n\nEmail tips@brownstoner.com with further comments, questions or tips.

            "content": "The story could have been much different for Novavax. The Maryland-based biopharma developed and secured the FDA\u2019s greenlight for a COVID-19 vaccine in less than two and a half years; the only problem? Three other vaccines got to market even faster.\n\nIt typically takes some 5 to 10 years to develop a vaccine. Thanks to a combination of extreme urgency, government funding and strategic partnering, Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty won the first FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) on Dec. 11, 2020, exactly nine months after the World Health Organization officially declared the pandemic on March 11. Moderna\u2019s Spikevax and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine quickly followed. Novavax\u2019s Nuvaxovid won FDA emergency use authorization in July 2022.\n\nThe first-to-market advantage was significant: Pfizer reported a whopping $36.8 billion in sales from Comirnaty in 2021 and another $37.8 billion in 2022 while Novavax saw only $1.5 billion from Nuvaxovid in the time it was on the market in 2022. All have since encountered the so-called \u201cCOVID cliff,\u201d with sales falling off considerably as the pandemic has waned.\n\nAhead of the five-year anniversary of the WHO declaration, BioSpace sat down with Silvia Taylor, EVP and chief corporate affairs and advocacy officer at Novavax, to discuss her company\u2019s experience on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cI guess that was one of the learnings, that speed is really relative,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is just a hypothetical, but what if others had taken three years and we would have taken two?\u201d In that case, she mused, rather than wondering why Novavax fell behind, the question would have been, \u201cWhat made you so successful?\u201d\n\nStrategic Lessons Learned\n\nFor context, Taylor compared Novavax to Germany\u2019s BioNTech as being \u201cthe small innovator\u201d in the global health crisis.\n\nUnlike BioNTech, however, Novavax elected to go it alone at the development stage. \u201cWe had a little bit more time to scale and build a commercial infrastructure and build distribution capabilities, and so we chose to do that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cNow, with the benefit of hindsight, could we have been potentially faster? We have no idea. We can\u2019t speculate on what didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nWhile Taylor indicated that Novavax\u2019s technology made its vaccine an attractive option, it may also have delayed its development. Protein-based technology\u2014on which Novavax\u2019s Nuvaxovid is built\u2014is \u201cterrific,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t happen as quickly [as mRNA].\u201d\n\nBut speed is not the only consideration, Taylor emphasized, adding that it\u2019s important to think about what the world really needs when it comes to infectious diseases with pandemic potential. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to have multiple technology platforms . . . because we know not every one is right for every person.\u201d\n\nWhile Novavax didn\u2019t partner with another pharmaceutical company at the early stages, it has leveraged several collaborations during the post-approval phase. Nuvaxovid was, after all, the 38-year-old company\u2019s first-ever commercial launch, Taylor noted. \u201cWe were really in a learning mode.\u201d\n\nIn May 2024, the company signed a licensing agreement with Sanofi in which the larger pharma took the \u201clead role\u201d in commercializing the vaccine, according to Taylor. Additionally, Novavax has signed material transfer agreements with two other \u201cmajor pharmaceutical companies,\u201d though Taylor could not disclose any further details.\n\nThese material transfers \u201cgive other companies access, in this case, to our adjuvant matrix, and allow them to study it and understand how they might apply that to their own portfolios, their own vaccines in development,\u201d she said.\n\nPartnering is also a key element of Novavax\u2019s COVID-19 strategy moving forward. The company currently has a combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine in Phase III development. For this product, Taylor said Novavax decided not to do full-scale development or commercialize the vaccine without a partner. So, while the company awaits data from that trial\u2014which it expects in mid-2025\u2014it is also \u201chaving a lot of productive conversations with potential partners,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned and decided that\u2019s what we want to do.\u201d\n\nNovavax is also in conversations with the FDA about a potential accelerated approval pathway for the combo vaccine. If that comes to fruition, it could give Novavax an advantage in a space where it once again faces stiff competition. Moderna released positive Phase III data for its combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine, mRNA-1083, in June 2024, while Pfizer and BioNTech reported mixed Phase III data for their own combo in August of the same year. Moderna\u2019s product is currently under FDA review, while Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s data left the partners \u201cevaluating the next steps\u201d for the vaccine.\n\nHowever, Novavax\u2019s wholly owned combination COVID-19-flu vaccine is not its only shot on this particular goal. The Sanofi pact also gave the larger pharma a license to combine Nuvaxovid with one of its market leading flu vaccines, \u201cand they\u2019ve decided to do that, not with just one candidate, but two,\u201d Taylor said. Both vaccines were granted FDA fast track designation in December 2024.\n\n\u201cI think combination therapies, where you can target two infectious diseases with one vaccine, that\u2019s where the [COVID-19] market\u2019s going,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2018Readiness Posture\u2019\n\nWhile Novavax awaits revenue for these potential products, it is facing the same COVID cliff as its peers.\n\nLast month, the company revealed its Q4 and full-year 2024 earnings, reporting $50 million in Nuvaxovid sales in the fourth quarter compared to $251 million in the same period the previous year. Total 2024 Nuvaxovid revenue was $190 million compared to $531 million in 2023.\n\nBut Novavax is looking forward. \u201c[COVID] was never our long-term strategy,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe saw the fact that we were able to get our COVID vaccine out as validation of our technology platform and our ability as an innovator.\u201d\n\nIn its earnings report, Novavax CEO John Jacobs laid out three strategic priorities: the Sanofi partnership, leveraging its technology platform and pipeline to forge additional partnerships and advancing its technology platform and early-stage pipeline. On that note, the company has an experimental vaccine for avian flu (H5N1) ready for clinical development.\n\n\u201cIf we were able to do this for COVID-19,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cwhat if, for example, an avian influenza pandemic hits?\u201d\n\nWhen developing its COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax leveraged funding from both the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed. While H5N1 is still simmering\u201476 people, mainly farm workers, were infected with the H5 avian influenza strain in 2024, according to the United Nations\u2014Novavax is already in talks with organizations that provide non-dilutive funding \u201cto explore the potential of getting that funding to take that to the next level,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s the readiness posture of the world, of the U.S. We\u2019re ready to continue that development.\u201d\n\nOn a broader scale, Taylor said the pharmaceutical industry also learned a lot about communication during a global pandemic. \u201cI think misinformation was so rampant during the [COVID-19] pandemic, but . . . I don\u2019t know that it impacted our vaccine so much as people\u2019s attitudes toward vaccination in general.\u201d\n\nIndeed, flu vaccination rates have declined since the pandemic, with 9.2 million fewer doses being administered in pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices compared with an average year prior to COVID-19, according to The Conversation.\n\nGoing forward, Taylor said, things need to change. \u201cI think that everybody from public health officials within government, NGOs, pharmaceutical companies, we all have to think about, how do we put information out there in a very consistent and concise way?\u201d Although that didn\u2019t happen during COVID, lessons have been learned, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d",

AstraZeneca\u2019s main research and development areas include oncology, rare diseases, and biopharmaceutical intervention, and it has numerous ongoing projects. Global company headquarters are located in Cambridge, England, and it has more than 80,000 employees in more than 60 countries worldwide.\n\nHistory and the 1999 merger AstraZeneca was founded in 1999 when the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra AB merged with U.K.\u2013based pharmaceutical company Zeneca Group. At the time, it represented one of the largest mergers to ever occur between two European companies. Astra AB dated back to 1913 and had established itself as a leading domestic pharmaceutical manufacturer in Sweden. The company\u2019s first blockbuster drug was Xylocaine (lidocaine), a numbing agent that quickly gained popularity in the United States after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the 1950s. Zeneca Group was founded in 1993 in Britain and maintained a major share of the oncology care market in both the U.K. and the U.S. The company\u2019s main specialties were cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory drugs, as well as those relating to oncology and anesthesia. Early 2020s: Product diversification and a failed acquisition\n\nOpen full sized image The numbing drug that put Astra AB on the map. \u00a9 Science & Society Picture Library/Getty Images\n\nSome of AstraZeneca\u2019s most widely prescribed medicines in the 21st century include: Tagrisso (osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer\n\n(osimertinib), a targeted therapy to treat non-small-cell lung cancer Farxiga (dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure\n\n(dapagliflozin), which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure Crestor (rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol\n\n(rosuvastatin), a statin used to treat high cholesterol Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AstraZeneca also manufactures the popular proton-pump inhibitor drugs Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) and Prilosec (omeprazole magnesium), which are used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 2012 AstraZeneca became a founding member, with nine other pharmaceutical companies, of the nonprofit TransCelerate BioPharma Inc. The organization\u2019s mission is to improve access to information that helps facilitate the creation of new medicines. Some recent efforts have centered on refining methods to digitally share clinical trial information. Pfizer, Inc., another of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies, attempted to acquire AstraZeneca in 2014. The acquisition would have resulted in the creation of the world\u2019s largest drug company. However, the deal garnered much criticism in Britain, primarily because of alleged tax breaks and job cuts that would have resulted from the merger. AstraZeneca ultimately declined the sale on the grounds that its profitability potential was greater than the price offered by Pfizer. COVID-19 vaccine and controversy AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was created by the University of Oxford. The Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was a double-stranded DNA-based vaccine, as opposed to the popular Moderna and Pfizer offerings, which were based on single-stranded RNA. Commonly known by the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine received high efficacy ratings and proved easier to store than most competitors\u2019 vaccines, which often required storage in below-freezing temperatures. Demand outpaced supply, and the European Union registered complaints that AstraZeneca had failed to deliver millions of promised doses in early 2021.\n\nOpen full sized image Should employers be able to mandate vaccinations? \u00a9 Scaliger/Dreamstime.com",

            "content": "Trending stock analysis: Moderna stock soared last week followed the revelation of insider buying activity and a favorable ruling in a patent dispute against Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX).\n\n\n\n\n\nInsider Purchases Worth Millions\n\n\n\nIn recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was revealed that two members of Moderna's board made significant purchases of the company's stock. CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel and board member Paul Sagan bought a substantial amount of common stock.\n\n\n\nBancel acquired a large number of shares through Boston Biotech Ventures, a firm he controls. On the same day, Sagan also purchased a notable quantity of shares. This insider activity typically indicates strong confidence in the company's future prospects, which may encourage other investors to consider entering the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna Stock Performance Overview\n\n\n\nDespite the recent surge, Moderna\u2019s stock has faced challenges this year. Year-to-date, shares have declined by over 15%, contrasting with an industry-wide growth of 6%. This underperformance raises questions about the company's outlook and competitive position within the biotechnology sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna\u2019s Legal Victory in Patent Dispute\n\n\n\nIn addition to the positive reactions from insider trading, Moderna secured a legal win in a patent dispute against Pfizer and BioNTech. A German court ruled that both companies infringed on Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine patent. As a result of this ruling, Pfizer and BioNTech are required to compensate Moderna, although the exact amount will be determined in subsequent proceedings.\n\n\n\nThe legal battle revolved around the use of Moderna\u2019s patent in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer and BioNTech. While the two companies acknowledged utilizing the patent, they contended that a press release from Moderna in 2020 allowed for its use during the pandemic. They argued that their actions were legal until the World Health Organization declared the pandemic over in May 2023.\n\n\n\nHowever, the court dismissed this argument, asserting that Moderna had formally revoked permission for the use of its patent in March 2022. This ruling established that Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s continued use of the patent post-revocation was unauthorized, granting Moderna the right to seek compensation. It is worth noting that Pfizer and BioNTech may appeal this decision to a higher court.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplications for the Pharmaceutical Industry\n\n\n\nThe ruling is seen as a pivotal moment in the realm of pharmaceutical intellectual property rights. Industry analysts and investors are closely watching the ongoing developments in this case, as it could set important precedents for future patent disputes. The outcome may influence how pharmaceutical companies approach patent agreements and licensing in the context of public health emergencies.\n\n\n\nModerna\u2019s partnership with Merck on a personalized cancer vaccine has been a bright spot in its narrative. Last week, optimism around this mRNA-based therapy, which targets melanoma and other cancers, gained traction. Executives expressed confidence in a potential launch within a few years, backed by promising clinical data showing reduced recurrence rates in late-stage trials. For a company seeking to diversify beyond its COVID-19 roots, this pipeline advancement reassured investors of long-term growth potential, driving the stock higher as faith in its mRNA platform deepened.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges Tempering the Rally\n\n\n\nDespite the soar, Moderna faces headwinds that kept the rally in check. Its reliance on future approvals and competition in the vaccine space\u2014particularly from rivals like Pfizer and Novavax\u2014remains a concern. The stock\u2019s year-to-date decline from higher levels in 2024 underscores ongoing profitability challenges, with sales forecasts for 2025 still modest compared to pandemic peaks. These factors suggest the surge was more a reaction to immediate catalysts than a full reversal of its longer-term struggles.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nModerna's recent stock performance, driven by insider purchases and a favorable legal ruling, indicates a potential turning point for the company. However, investors should remain cautious, considering the broader context of the biotechnology sector and the ongoing challenges that Moderna faces. The outcome of the patent dispute with Pfizer and BioNTech may not only affect Moderna but could also have far-reaching implications for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. As market dynamics evolve, staying informed about these developments will be crucial for investors.\n\nWhen considering shares, indices, forex (foreign exchange) and commodities for trading and price predictions, remember that trading CFDs involves a significant degree of risk and could result in capital loss.\n\n\n\nPast performance is not indicative of any future results.

I could win this tournament finally, so I feel really great now,\" she said.\n\nTakeda had a dominant 2024 season in Japan, winning eight times, including two majors, and finishing as the tour's points leader.\n\n\"I'm really happy to win this tournament because the course layout, it's really, really different...compared to Japanese courses,\" she said. \"I could win this tournament because my strongest point is driving distance, so it worked well.\"\n\nAustralia's Minjee Lee (67) finished alone in second, followed by Japan's Ayaka Furue (68) in third at 10-under.\n\nThree other Japanese claimed top-10 finishes, with Mao Saigo tying for fifth at 6-under and Miyu Yamashita and Nasa Hataoka sharing eighth a shot further back.\n\nLi Shuying's tie for fifth was the highest finish for host China.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nAthletics: Chepkirui wins Nagoya Women's Marathon, Sato crosses 2nd\n\nSki jumping: Ryoyu Kobayashi rebounds to 3rd place in large hill at worlds",

            "content": "Analysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Pfizer Inc. (PFE) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 8.76\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a pharmaceutical company that mainly manufactures, markets, and sells related products worldwide. In recent years, the company has focused on expanding its presence in oncology, including a major $43 billion acquisition of Seagen to strengthen its cancer treatment portfolio. It projects significant growth in this sector over the next five years, aiming to double its patient base by 2030 and introduce at least three new blockbuster drugs\u2014each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. With oncology revenue rising 25% in 2024, the company\u2019s growth momentum in this area is already gaining traction.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a 12% operational revenue increase from its non-COVID products over the past year, underscoring its focus on strategic execution. The company successfully met its $4 billion net cost savings target through an ongoing cost realignment initiative and has now raised its goal to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. As part of its Manufacturing Optimization Program, Pfizer aims to achieve $1.5 billion in net cost savings by 2027, with the first benefits expected in the latter half of 2025. The company remains optimistic about restoring its pre-pandemic operating margins in the coming years.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), one of the best dividend stocks, currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, following a 2.4% increase in December 2024, extending its streak of annual dividend growth to 15 consecutive years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 6.5%, as of March 6.\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 3rd on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Moreover, she claimed that the vaccines failed to effectively prevent Covid-19 transmission, contrary to initial claims.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhen questioned about alternatives to vaccines, Wolf clarified that the issue is not about rejecting vaccines entirely but rather about acknowledging the failures of specific vaccines.\n\nShe suggested that Indian vaccines might have performed differently and expressed willingness to have her team analyse the data. Wolf also referenced the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was withdrawn from the market, highlighting the need for rigorous safety assessments.\n\nWhen asked about ways to stop the transmission of the virus, she said, \"I have read 400 years of English literature and what's clear is humanity faces waves after waves of infectious disease. Typhus, Cholera, Pneumonia, and we have known how to control the spread of viruses. You don't crowd people into households, depress their immune system and not pay any attention to sanitation and hygiene, and that escalated infectious disease.\"\n\nShe further attacked the US media, Bill and Melinda Gates foundations adding, \"Bill Gates was a major investor in mRNA injection and were flowing millions of dollars in news outlets to overcome vaccine hesitancy.\"\n\nWolf also accused academia of corruption in the peer review process that cleared the clinical trial data of vaccines.",

            "content": "This week the CDC did something unprecedented. It made easily available the conflicts of interest for the panelists on the ACIP\u2014 that's the committee that decides what vaccines to recommend to American adults and children. The new web-tool is quick, easy and revealing.\n\nMake no mistake: the ACIP has made tremendous errors.\n\nThey recommended that the covid-19 booster be added to the children's immunization schedule. Not only is there no randomized data on meaningful endpoints to support that claim, there is no data at all to support that claim\u2014 because the claim applies to novel products that have not even been made. The ACIP knows that a baby born in 2027 will need a covid shot only made in 2027* at 6 months of age. That\u2019s fortune-telling, not science. The committee made no substantive effort to mitigate the risk of myocarditis in young men. It didn\u2019t delay doses or space them out promptly. It did not advise against Moderna. The committee made no effort to reduce the burden of vaccination among people who had already had covid. They gave no credit for natural immunity. The committee repeatedly sought a one-size-fits-all policy even though all scientific evidence suggested an age gradient of benefit and risk. The committee repeatedly declined to follow the lead of multiple European nations that were more sensible and focus on the elderly.\n\nNow we can easily look up the financial conflicts and members of the committee. Let me show you a few examples:\n\nIn some cases, these members recused themselves or did not participate in votes for trials that they helped run, or for companies that they immediately had a financial relationship, but many of them did shape the discussion and vote on other, related vaccine products and related spaces.\n\nLet me give you a thought experiment:\n\nImagine one company makes a maternal RSV vaccine. The vaccine lowers lower respiratory tract hospitalizations (LRTH) from RSV, but the trial fails to find an improvement in all-cause lower respiratory tract hospitalizations. The vaccine is also linked to a non-statistically significant increase in low birth weight babies, as is a competing product, raising question of a class effect.\n\nHow do you vote? Should we recommend it? Or should we note that the reduction in RSV LRTH didn\u2019t translate to all-cause LRTH, and certainly not all cause hospitalizations and death? Do we worry about the safety?\n\nHow you vote might be different if parallel to the meeting you are meeting with 3 other companies with similar products who want you to run their trial. If you vote for a low bar now, it will make it easy for a low bar in the future. You might recuse yourself from the current vote, but your actions paved the regulatory trajectory for the space.\n\nOf course, this is the reality. And it applies more broadly. The more you vote to recommend products under considerable uncertainty, the more you benefit the companies. The more revenue the companies have, the more they invest back in you. The more vaccine trials you conduct\u2014 the more QI projects you run for Pfizer or Sanofi, the more consulting you do years later for Merck.\n\nThe people who shape the standards of evidence for vaccine safety and efficacy are those whose entire careers benefit from lower standards of approval. That means more products\u2014 even if some of those are eventually withdrawn (e.g. J&J covid).\n\nIf I make donuts, a high regulatory bar for cupcakes is bad for me too. Maybe it is best to get people who don\u2019t run bakeries to vote on cupcake policy.\n\nNow, you might argue: this is the case on all drug advisory committees. Exactly! It is a problem everywhere, but surely you must concede that optics matter the most for vaccines!\n\nWe have to accept there is a growing faction of people skeptical of vaccines. These people are extremely concerned that the profit motive is taking precedence over an impartial and sober examination of the evidence. These people will be less likely to accept your recommendations if they view it as compromised. So why continue to tolerate these conflicts?\n\nSome argue that there is no one who can serve on these committees who isn\u2019t conflicted. Every single person smart enough to advise on vaccines works with companies. This just isn\u2019t true. Will Ward is an internist who writes in these pages. He is a recent residency graduate. He is a student of EBM. If I give Will 2 weeks to research a vaccine, I would personally trust his recommendation more than any vaccinologist\u2014 because he knows how to review data.\n\nThe same is true for dozens of others students of evidence based medicine. Yes, of course, you need to learn the basics of RSV and LRTH, but the key questions about risk and benefit can be adjudicated by any careful student of EBM.\n\nAnd guess what: most of these people\u2014 thoughtful doctors, methodologists, economists, statisticians\u2014 do not have conflicts in this space.\n\nMany have expressed concern that Mr. Kennedy will seek to modify the ACIP. It would be unimaginable for him not to. The current status quo allows too many people who benefit from low regulatory standards to shape this discussion. The status quo has made too many mistakes. A cornerstone of public health is that our processes should be acceptable to the American people, but that is not the case. There is a concerning decline in childhood immunization across the board. Perhaps Americans need to heard the message of what vaccines are safe and effective from someone who isn\u2019t stuffing their pockets with Merck money. The status quo\u2014 ignoring these conflicts and public perception\u2014 will only lead to more measles outbreaks\u2014 a great tragedy. Instead, rebuilding ACIP with thoughtful, non-conflicted experts is best.\n\nAnd finally, how smart as these vaccine experts anyway? Toddlers in day care\u2026 that was embarrassing and wrong.\n\n*against a strain that Peter Marks decides on while on the toilet at 3 AM",

Her findings suggest that the vaccines were rushed to market under emergency use authorisation in the US, bypassing the typical 10-15 year safety evaluation process.\n\nThe Pfizer Papers have revealed alarming data on vaccine-related injuries, especially reproductive damages.\n\nWolf, who herself didn\u2019t any COVID-19 vaccine, has claimed that live birth rates have dropped by 13% to 20%, attributing the decline to adverse effects of the vaccines.\n\nShe also claimed that the vaccines failed to effectively prevent COVID-19 transmission, according to indiatoday.in.",

In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and possible revocation of their licenses.\n\nSome congressional Republicans are also pressing regulators to revoke federal approval for mRNA-based COVID shots, which President Donald Trump touted as one of the signature achievements of his first term.\n\nThe opposition comes at a critical juncture because vaccines using mRNA have applications well beyond avian flu and COVID. They hold the promise of lifesaving breakthroughs to treat many diseases, from melanoma to HIV to Zika, according to clinical trials. The proposed bans could block access to these advances.\n\nMRNA is found naturally in human cells. It is a molecule that carries genetic material and, in a vaccine, trains the body's immune system to fight viruses, cancer cells and other conditions. An advantage of mRNA technology is that it can be developed more quickly to target specific variants and is safer than developing a vaccine made from inactivated virus.\n\n\"Right now, if we had a bird flu pandemic, we would have a shortage of the vaccine we need,\" said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \"The one thing that could save us is mRNA vaccine. The challenge would be if mRNA is banned. This is truly dangerous policy.\"\n\nA vile of a COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer is held up at a CVS Pharmacy in Eagle Rock, Calif., Sept. 14, 2023. Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe pushback conflicts with innovations championed by Trump. He assembled tech tycoons at the White House just after his inauguration to announce Stargate, a $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative that could help transform cancer treatment by creating tumor-targeting mRNA vaccines. The fledging partnership between Oracle, SoftBank Corp. and OpenAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, envisions leveraging AI in part to improve health outcomes. Patients would undergo blood tests and AI would be used to find cancer.\n\nScientists would examine the DNA and RNA (RNA and mRNA serve different functions in a cell) of a specific patient's tumor to create a vaccine to teach that person's immune system to target and destroy cells driving cancer growth.\n\n\"Imagine early cancer detection, the development of a cancer vaccine for your particular cancer aimed at you, and have that vaccine available in 48 hours,\" Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said at the White House event.\n\nScores of mRNA clinical trials for cancer vaccines are underway and some have shown dramatic results, cutting the risk of death and recurrence roughly in half for certain patients. In research led by the Yale School of Medicine, for example, patients with advanced kidney cancer remained cancer-free about three years after an mRNA-based treatment in an early-phase trial.\n\nBut some politically conservative doctors, lawmakers, and researchers question the safety of mRNA vaccines, especially COVID shots made with the technology. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA in 2021 to rescind approval for COVID shots and called them \"the deadliest vaccine ever made\" -- a controversial statement that has been refuted.\n\nNow that he's newly confirmed as Health and Human Services Secretary, Kennedy is poised to oversee federal approvals of vaccines, with the power to shape policy such as immunization schedules and appoint vaccine opponents to committees that advise on the approval of shots.\n\nBloomberg reported late last month that Trump administration health officials were reevaluating a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna as part of its push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines.\n\nHHS and White House spokespeople didn't return emails seeking comment.\n\nSupport for an mRNA ban is coming from other sources too. In February, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said on X that the \"FDA should immediately revoke approval of these shots,\" and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is leading an investigation into the safety of the vaccines. Trump in February signed an order to strip federal funds from schools that require covid shots for attendance.\n\nVaccine skepticism has become pronounced among Republicans since the pandemic. Four in 10 Republicans who responded to a KFF poll published in January said it was \"probably\" or \"definitely true\" that \"more people have died from covid-19 vaccines than from the virus itself.\" Just a quarter of Republicans reported holding that view in 2023.\n\nThe effort is also finding traction at the local level. A district health department outside Boise, Idaho, last year banned its health department from administering COVID-19 vaccines, and local lawmakers in Franklin County, Washington, passed a resolution in February against mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe ABCs of mRNA\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends COVID vaccines for anyone 6 months and older, especially seniors and people who are immunocompromised. About 29 million doses had been administered to adults in the 2024-25 season in retail pharmacies and doctors' offices through Feb. 8, based on federal data.\n\nGiven as a shot, mRNA enters muscle cells and teaches them to produce a spike protein found on the surface of a virus. The body's immune system then targets the spike protein, priming it to identify and fight the virus -- in this case, the coronavirus that causes COVID. The body's cells then break down the mRNA and remove it, according to federal health researchers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Mar. 6, 2025. Al Drago/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nMore than 13 billion covid vaccines had been administered worldwide as of August 2024.\n\nResearchers say the vaccinations saved countless lives -- estimates for the first year alone go as high as 19.8 million -- in the throes of a pandemic that had hospitals ordering refrigerated mobile morgues and deliberating over which patients to put on ventilators. Two University of Pennsylvania scientists credited with developing the mRNA technology behind the shots were awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2023.\n\nThe FDA says the COVID vaccines are safe, with fewer than one in 200,000 vaccinated individuals experiencing a severe allergic reaction or heart problems like myocarditis or pericarditis, and the agency notes that \"inaccurate information about these vaccines, particularly the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, continues to circulate.\"\n\nWhile many people hadn't heard of the mRNA platform until the COVID shots were rolled out, it was discovered in the 1960s. The first mRNA flu vaccines were tested in mice in the 1990s. A clinical trial involving direct injection of mRNA to fight cancer occurred in 2008. Clinical trials involving the COVID mRNA vaccines involved tens of thousands of volunteers.\n\nReviews of mortality data showed \"no unusual patterns of death were detected that might suggest a potential safety concern,\" based on a September 2024 report by a technical working group that provided guidance to the CDC.\n\nBut those calling for a ban on all mRNA vaccines say there is a dearth of long-term safety data, and they say covid vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were hastily approved without proper vetting. They assert without strong evidence that the vaccines cause serious injuries to the heart, nerves and immune and reproductive systems, and can lead to cancer.\n\nThe vaccine has been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation and inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, although the severity has varied and most patients fully recovered, the CDC says.\n\n\"The allegations are beyond reason,\" said Anne Schuchat, a career scientist who worked on COVID and who twice served stints as acting director of the CDC. \"The mRNA COVID vaccines were extensively studied after use and do not have those problems.\"\n\n\"I'm concerned about the whole mRNA technology. I don't trust anything that fools the body,\" said Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist and anti-vaccine activist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I'm really glad people are waking up and realizing it's not the thing to do anymore.\"\n\nVaccines generally work by tricking the body into producing antibodies to fight illnesses.\n\nPfizer spokespeople didn't return an email seeking comment. A Moderna spokesperson, Chris Ridley, said legislative efforts to ban or restrict mRNA medicines are largely driven by misunderstandings about their safety profile and mechanism of action. While mRNA-based shots do not modify DNA, for example, that misconception is frequently cited in support of restrictions, Ridley said.\n\n\"If enacted, these measures could hinder important research and limit patient access to innovative treatments, potentially delaying life-changing medical advancements,\" Ridley said in a written statement.\n\nNetworks of Opposition\n\nGroups opposed to the mRNA technology have built a vast and well-funded legal, marketing, and social media network. Members hold conferences to discuss strategies, fund lawsuits against vaccine mandates, and produce reports on the covid vaccines.\n\nAs for state legislative efforts, measures introduced this year have varied and their progress has been mixed. Montana's measure, for instance, was blocked. Idaho lawmakers in February held a hearing on its bill, which calls for a 10-year moratorium on mRNA vaccines. Idaho's proposal, likely to be amended, as well as Iowa's and Montana's have featured criminal penalties for providers who administer all or certain mRNA vaccines. In addition, some state bills, such as legislation in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, focused on the use of the vaccine in livestock and food production.\n\nVarious bills are pending in the Texas Legislature to restrict mRNA vaccines in both livestock and humans. South Carolina's pending bill would require anyone administering certain COVID mRNA vaccines to inform patients that the shot is contaminated with fragments of \"bacterial plasmid DNA.\"\n\nKen Paxton, Texas Attorney General, speaks with the media at the U.S.Supreme Court, February 26, 2024, in Washington. The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nCOVID mRNA shots may have minute amounts of residual DNA from production processes but they are heavily degraded and pose no risk, according to the Global Vaccine Data Network, which evaluates vaccine safety concerns.\n\nSpeakers at some legislative proceedings have included representatives from Children's Health Defense, an activist, anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy.\n\nThe Florida surgeon general in January called for a halt in the use of covid mRNA vaccines. And in Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton in January moved to appeal a lawsuit he filed claiming Pfizer misrepresented the safety of its mRNA shot.\n\nEfforts to restrict the shots have raised the profile of groups such as the Independent Medical Alliance, which advocates for mRNA-based COVID vaccines to be withdrawn from the market.\n\n\"We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,\" said pediatric cardiologist Kirk Milhoan, a senior fellow at the alliance.\n\nGroups opposed to mRNA shots are pointing to a recent study to urge more caution. Yale University researchers reported in February that they found spike protein still circulating in a subset of individuals with a debilitating, post-vaccination condition. Some of the individuals who experienced chronic illness after getting the shots had detectable levels of spike protein more than 700 days after vaccination. This study was small -- 42 participants -- and not peer-reviewed.\n\nIts findings also don't show the spike protein is a health risk or a cause of vaccine injury.\n\n\"It's an initial, provocative study in which you can't draw conclusions,\" said William Schaffner, past medical director of National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"This is one of the most widely used vaccines around the globe. It's the furthest thing from an experimental vaccine.\"\n\nBut what this growing pushback shows, according to some researchers, is that distrust isn't coming only from fringe groups anymore.\n\n\"There are truly amazing mRNA cancer vaccines out there,\" said Kate Broderick, chief innovation officer at Maravai LifeSciences, which works on vaccine development. \"My fear as a scientist is that it's been tainted in the public.\"",

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -5.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.5%. This estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.99 indicates a change of +0.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.",

            "content": "This week has brought enough announcements and updates to fill a third news roundup. Today, we\u2019ve got a rundown of news from Roche and AskBio, as well as updates from the NIH and Pfizer.\n\nRoche is expanding its presence in the Boston area, announcing Friday the launch of a new \u201cinnovation center\u201d at Harvard University\u2019s Enterprise Research Campus in nearby Allston, Massachusetts. The company plans for its new center to act as a hub for its research work in cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases, as well as to support some of its AI activities. Manu Chakravarthy, Roche\u2019s global head for CVRM product diseases, will lead the site, which eventually could employ as many as 500 people, Roche said. The Swiss drugmaker joins peers like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in growing its Boston footprint. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nThe National Institutes of Health said Thursday it will centralize peer review for all grants, research and development contracts and cooperative agreements under a single center. The policy change will apply to the first step of the peer review process, in which review groups score proposals for scientific and technical merit. Of those, 22% have in the past been conducted by individual institutes while the rest are done in the NIH\u2019s Center for Scientific Review. Those done by study groups in the individual centers now will shift to the main Center for Scientific Review. The second step of the peer review process, for mission relevance, will continue to be done by the individual centers or the NIH director\u2019s office. The NIH said the scientific and technical merit reviews conducted by the individual centers cost 300% of those done by the Center for Scientific Review. The policy change will save $65 million a year, NIH said. The policy change follows layoffs at NIH and a Trump administration bid to cut reimbursement of overhead costs at NIH grantees. Jay Bhattacharya, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for NIH director, is awaiting Senate votes on his confirmation. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAskBio, the gene therapy subsidiary of Bayer, has begun dosing patients in the second cohort of a trial testing its treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Started in 2023, the study is enrolling adults with a specific \u201c21/R9\u201d form of the progressive muscle-wasting disease. Enrollment of the second cohort follows a review by the trial\u2019s monitoring board of data from the study\u2019s first phase. Sarepta Therapeutics is also developing gene therapies for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nPfizer on Thursday appointed James List to lead its internal medicine portfolio, putting the endocrinologist in charge of the company\u2019s pipeline of drugs for cardiometabolic diseases, including obesity. List was previously global therapeutic head for cardiovascular and metabolism at Johnson & Johnson and, before that, head of diabetes development at Bristol Myers Squibb. He conducted post-doctoral research at Massachusetts General Hospital on GLP-1, the hormone that\u2019s now at the center of obesity treatment. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

Feel free to contact Angela Gabriel at angela.gabriel@biospace.com.\n\nGRO Biosciences\n\nMarch 14\n\nGRO Biosciences began exploring strategic alternatives about six months after raising a Series B funding round and recently cut an undisclosed number of employees, including research staff, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based synthetic biology company founded in 2016 also no longer lists two key executives on its leadership page, Fierce noted: Daniel Mandell, the founding CEO, and Christopher Gregg, the chief scientific officer.\n\nBorn out of genetics professor George Church\u2019s lab at Harvard University, GRO Biosciences closed its Series B round in July 2024, raising $60.3 million to help advance its pipeline and further develop its platform. The company planned to use the money mostly to start a Phase I clinical trial for its lead program ProGly-Uricase, an investigational enzyme-based therapy that had been proposed for severe and refractory gout. GRO is now exploring strategic alternatives to advance that program, Fierce reported.\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals\n\nMarch 7\n\nAtea Pharmaceuticals let go about 25% of its workforce this quarter, a cost-cutting move that\u2019s expected to save roughly $15 million through 2027, the company announced March 6. The Boston-based clinical-stage biotech had 56 employees, including 39 in research and development, on March 4 according to an SEC filing on that date, suggesting that\u2019s how many employees will remain post-layoffs.\n\nWith its leaner staff, Atea is preparing for a Phase III trial of nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor bemnifosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor\u2019s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial\u2019s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement. The company reported an accumulated deficit of $364.2 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, in its March 4 SEC filing but noted it expects to fund activities into 2028.\n\nALX Oncology\n\nMarch 6\n\nALX Oncology is letting go of 30% of its workers as part of \u201ca strategic prioritization and resource optimization exercise,\u201d the South San Francisco\u2013based company announced Wednesday. As of September 30, 2024, ALX had 89 employees, according to an SEC filing.\n\nMost of the laid-off employees worked on preclinical research, according to ALX, and the company will now prioritize continued development of the CD47-blocker evorpacept in breast and colorectal cancer, as well as its EGFR-targeted ADC candidate ALX2004. Due to its preclinical cost-cutting, ALX now expects its cash runway to extend into the fourth quarter of next year.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nMarch 6\n\nBristol Myers Squibb will lay off 57 workers from its Redwood City, California facility next month, according to a WARN notice filed on February 26. The latest layoff, first reported by Fierce Pharma, is part of a billion-plus-dollar cost-cutting program announced last year and expanded last month. BMS laid off more than two thousand employees in 2024 in total. According to BMS\u2019 website, its Redwood City R&D campus is focused on the tumor microenvironment.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nMarch 5\n\nFor the second time this year and following its decision to pause two CAR T programs, Atara Biotherapeutics has divulged a roughly 50% workforce reduction, according to a March 3 SEC filing. The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers.

However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024.

About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

            "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Pfizer (PFE). Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pfizer due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nQ4 Earnings & Sales Beat\n\nPfizer reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents per share. The company had recorded earnings of 10 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Its earnings growth was driven by improved revenues and lower costs.\n\n\n\nRevenues came in at $17.76 billion, up 22% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. Revenues reflected an operational increase of 21% and a positive currency impact of 1%. Total revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion.\n\n\n\nRevenues mainly benefited from a one-time, non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter.\n\n\n\nHigher sales of Pfizer\u2019s key non-COVID products like Vyndaqel, Padcev and Eliquis and newly acquired products from Seagen, coupled with higher Paxlovid sales, drove the top line in the quarter. However, sales of some key drugs like Prevnar, Xeljanz and Ibrance and new RSV vaccine, Abrysvo declined in the quarter.\n\n\n\nSeagen drugs contributed $915 million to the top line in the fourth quarter and $3.4 billion in 2024. Revenues from Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID products rose 11% operationally in the fourth quarter and 12% in 2024 (exceeding the guidance range of 9-11%).\n\n\n\nInternational revenues declined 12% on an operational basis to $8.54 billion. U.S. revenues rose 88% to $9.22 billion.\n\nAdjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 4% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.28 billion due to lower spending behind the marketing of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, partially offset by an increase in spending for certain oncology drugs, newly launched and acquired products. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 8% to $2.99 billion as higher spending on certain acquired assets from Seagen was partially offset by lower spending on some vaccine programs and savings from the cost realignment program.\n\nSegment Discussion\n\nPfizer reports its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment \u2014 Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Sales of the Primary Care segment rose 26% operationally to $8.91 billion. The Specialty Care unit recorded sales of $4.44 billion, up 12%. Sales of Oncology rose 27% to $4.06 billion, driven by strong contributions from Padcev, Xtandi, Lorbrena and Braftovi/Mektovi.\n\n\n\nPrimary Care\n\n\n\nIn Primary Care, alliance revenues and direct sales from Bristol-Myers rose 13% to $1.83 billion driven by continued share gains in the oral anti-coagulant market and recent launches in international markets. However, sales were hurt by lower pricing in the United States due to unfavorable channel mix. Alliance revenues from Eliquis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66 billion as well as our model estimate of $1.61 billion.\n\n\n\nGlobal Prevnar family revenues declined 4% to $1.56 billion, driven by fewer adult vaccinations in the United States. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult and pediatric). Prevnar revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and beat our model estimate of $1.53 billion by a slight margin. Prevnar sales declined 7% in the United States and were flat in international markets\n\nDirect sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty were $3.38 billion in the quarter, down 38% year over year due to lower vaccinations globally and lower contracted doses. Comirnaty sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion and our estimate of $3.13 billion.\n\n\n\nPaxlovid revenues were $727 million in the quarter against negative $3.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paxlovid revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $589 million and our model estimate of $546 million.\n\n\n\nNewly acquired product Nurtec ODT/Vydura contributed $392 million in the quarter, which rose 39% year over year, driven by strong demand in the United States and launches in international markets.\n\n\n\nAmong the new products, Pfizer\u2019s RSV vaccine, Abrysvo, recorded sales of $198 million, down 62% year over year. Abrysvo revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $363 million as well as our model estimate of $425 million. While Abrysvo sales benefited from the launch uptake in international markets and demand growth for the maternal indication, sales in the United States for the older adult indication were hurt due to revised recommendations for RSV vaccinations issued in June 2024 by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\n\n\nSpecialty Care\n\n\n\nGlobal Vyndaqel family revenues of $1.55 billion rose 60% year over year, driven by continued demand growth as more patients are diagnosed, primarily in the United States and developed Europe, and increased affordability in the United States. The Vyndaqel family includes global revenues from Vyndaqel as well as revenues for Vyndamax in the United States and Vynmac in Japan. Vyndaqel family sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our model estimate of $1.52 billion.\n\n\n\nXeljanz sales declined 29% to $349 million. Enbrel revenues declined 9% to $183 million.\n\n\n\nOxbryta generated sales of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, down 91% year over year. In September, Pfizer announced that it is voluntarily withdrawing all lots of Oxbryta from the global markets where it is approved.\n\nAnother new drug, Cibinqo recorded revenues of $64 million in the quarter, up 71% year over year.\n\n\n\nOncology\n\n\n\nPfizer\u2019s acquisition of Seagen in December 2023 added antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs \u2014 Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak \u2014 to its cancer portfolio. Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak contributed $285 million, $444 million, $129 million and $36 million, respectively, to Pfizer\u2019s oncology revenues in the fourth quarter. Pfizer is particularly seeing strong demand trends for Padceb.\n\n\n\nIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 2% year over year to $1.1 billion. Lower demand trends globally due to competitive pressure and price decreases in some developed international markets hurt sales growth. Ibrance revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 billion and were in line with our estimate.\n\n\n\nXtandi recorded alliance revenues of $565 million in the quarter, up 24% year over year, driven by strong demand following approval for expanded use in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer received in the fourth quarter of 2023. Inlyta revenues were $242 million in the quarter, down 8%.\n\n\n\nLorbrena revenues were $192 million in the quarter, up 31% driven by market share gains following positive data from the phase III CROWN study presented in June 2024. Braftovi/Mektovi revenues were $170 million, up 30% year over year.\n\nRevenues from oncology biosimilars were $209 million, down 35% year over year.",

            "content": "In this Pharmaceutical Executive Video Interview, Peter Ax, Founder & CEO of UpScriptHealth, discusses the impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry, highlighting that tariffs will initially affect pharmaceutical companies, particularly those dealing with branded medications and generics. He notes that tariffs could lead to strategic supply chain changes, including potential US manufacturing shifts. Digital health platforms like UpScriptHealth aim to reduce friction and costs in healthcare, potentially offsetting tariff impacts. Ax emphasizes the importance of telehealth in ensuring medication availability and the strategic partnerships between digital health platforms and pharma companies to improve patient care and access. He also praises Pfizer's approach to delivering comprehensive care rather than just selling medications.\n\nCan you share insights on how your recently partnership with Pfizer is helping to navigate current challenges in drug pricing and delivery, and how it might be relevant in a scenario with increased tariffs?\n\nI can't speak for Pfizer, but I can tell you my view is that Pfizer has made a strategic decision to be a part of the solution for the problems in healthcare. It's not about selling a medication specifically to a patient, or it\u2019s a lot about delivering care that that they can help solve the patient's problem. And that might mean that the patient is prescribed their drug. It might mean that the patient is prescribed 10 other drugs, but they're going to provide a mechanism that patients can access care and receive great treatment. And if you think about PfizerForAll, they're not focused in on the brand strategy down below where you're kind of looking at specific medications. They're focused on \u2018Let's treat migraine headaches\u2019, \u2018Let's treat respiratory illnesses, including COVID\u2019, \u2018Let's treat whatever category of disease they want to treat\u2019, and let's just be sure that we're helping patients get great access to care. I give Pfizer enormous credit for their approach to this, to this problem.",

            "content": "NEW YORK, September 25, 2017 - SpringWorks Therapeutics, a mission-driven medicines company dedicated to developing innovative potential new treatments for underserved patient communities, announced its launch today with a completed $103 million Series A financing funded by Bain Capital Life Sciences, Bain Capital Double Impact, OrbiMed, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and LifeArc (formerly known as MRC Technology). SpringWorks Therapeutics also has rights to four clinical-stage experimental therapies from Pfizer.\n\n\u201cSpringWorks Therapeutics will pursue the development of medicines across therapeutic areas, focused on diseases where there is an urgent need and the potential for the greatest impact for patients,\u201d said Lara S. Sullivan, M.D., MBA, Founder and President of SpringWorks Therapeutics and a former Vice President at Pfizer. \u201cWe initially have rights to four very promising experimental therapies and, over time, plan to expand our pipeline by partnering with other life science companies and academic institutions who share in our mission.\u201d\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics was originally conceived by Pfizer as an innovative way to advance investigational therapies that may hold significant promise for underserved patients. SpringWorks Therapeutics\u2019 collaborative business model is designed to deliver both social and financial returns via partnerships with a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, biopharmaceutical partners, patient groups, funders and philanthropists. Pfizer\u2019s contribution consists of both equity capital and royalty- and milestone-bearing licenses to experimental therapies.\n\n\u201cPfizer sees SpringWorks Therapeutics as a groundbreaking new model for collaboration to deliver on the promise of medical research and development, so that more people have the potential to overcome disease. We hope that our investment in SpringWorks Therapeutics will, over time, enable us to realize even more value for patients and society,\u201d said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., DFAPA, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer. \u201cSpringWorks Therapeutics started as an idea about a new way to get things done with\u2014and for\u2014patients, it\u2019s been a tremendous team effort, and we and our partners are excited to see it become a reality.\u201d\n\nPromising Pipeline with Four Clinical-Stage Experimental Therapies\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics is focused on underserved patient populations where there is great medical need. The company plans to move forward potential programs for four diseases, all of which currently have no cure. SpringWorks Therapeutics plans to expand its pipeline by partnering with other life science companies and academic institutions who share in the company\u2019s mission.\n\nDESMOID TUMOR\n\nA desmoid tumor is a rare, non-metastatic tumor of connective tissue cells, which can cause severe morbidity, pain and loss of function in children and adults. Desmoid tumors can show up in almost any part of the body, and desmoids that are faster growing or located near vital organs can cause life-threatening problems. Approximately 900-1,200 people are diagnosed with desmoid tumors each year in the U.S.1 Currently available treatments include unapproved medical therapy, radiation therapy, thermal ablation and surgery, which can be dangerous, costly and offer limited effectiveness. SpringWorks Therapeutics is planning to initiate a Phase 3 program to establish safety and efficacy of nirogacestat (PF-03084014), its gamma-secretase inhibitor, and will work collaboratively with the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation to enable the needs of the patient community to be addressed.\n\nNEUROFIBROMATOSIS\n\nNeurofibromatosis (NF) refers to three genetic disorders\u2014NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis\u2014which cause tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body and can lead to blindness, deafness, disfigurement, cancer, bone abnormalities, learning disabilities and severe pain. NF1 affects one in 3,000 individuals and usually is diagnosed in childhood when symptoms begin to appear.2MEK inhibitors have shown encouraging activity in reducing tumor size in clinical Phase 1-2 studies in patients with plexiform neurofibromatosis, one of the many manifestations of NF1. SpringWorks Therapeutics is planning to initiate a Phase 3 program to establish safety and efficacy of its MEK 1/2 inhibitor (PD-0325901) in the NF1 population and will work collaboratively with the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation to enable the needs of the patient community to be addressed.\n\nHEREDITARY XEROCYTOSIS\n\nHereditary xerocytosis (HX) is a genetic disorder in which red blood cells become dehydrated due to loss of potassium and cell water. The fragility of the dehydrated red cells can lead to a ranging severity of anemia and can cause complications including jaundice, fatigue, splenomegaly and gallstones. In some cases, it will lead to severe anemia that requires frequent blood transfusions. HX affects an estimated one in 10,000 people, and symptoms begin shortly after birth.3 There is no approved therapy for this disease. Senicapoc (PF-05416266) has demonstrated a good safety/tolerability profile in previous Phase 1-3 studies in other indications. SpringWorks Therapeutics plans to assess the potential activity of senicapoc in hereditary xerocytosis.\n\nPOST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that some people develop after experiencing traumatic or life-threatening events, serious injury or sexual violence. PTSD involves the persistent re-experiencing of the traumatic event, which results in avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, as well as negative feelings and heightened anxiety-like symptoms. PTSD is often seen in military veterans, first responders, rape and battery victims, and abused children. Around 8.6 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 18-64 have been diagnosed with the disease.4 Over 200,000 veterans in the U.S. live with PTSD, which is currently treated with antidepressants such as SSRIs and trauma-focused psychotherapy; however, the disease can result in suicide even with treatment. SpringWorks Therapeutics\u2019 FAAH inhibitor (PF-0445784) has demonstrated a good safety/tolerability profile in previous Phase 1 studies. The effectiveness of PF-0445784 in PTSD is to be determined. Cohen Veterans Bioscience (CVB) and SpringWorks Therapeutics plan to assess patient populations that could benefit from this mechanism.\n\nExperienced Leadership Team\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics is led by a preeminent team of industry veterans, including:\n\nDaniel S. Lynch, Executive Chairman, who has over 25 years of industry experience serving in management and board positions for a number of top-tier biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nLara S.

However, once vaccine supply shortages in many parts of the world had lessened, the company issued another press release in March 2022, stating: \u201cModerna is expanding its patent pledge to never enforce Covid-19 patents in the Gavi COVAX AMC for 92 low- and middle-income countries\u201d.\n\nIn an August 2022 press release announcing the lawsuit, the company stated that it was under the expectation that following this update, Pfizer and BioNTech would honour its intellectual property rights and pursue a commercially reasonable licence for markets outside of the AMC 92 countries.\n\nIMITATION IS NOT FLATTERY\n\nIn the suit, Moderna contended that Pfizer and BioNTech had copied two essential features of Moderna\u2019s patented technologies in their development of the Comirnaty vaccine. Despite having options that would have \u201csteered clear of Moderna\u2019s innovative path\u201d, Pfizer and BioNTech had allegedly chosen a vaccine containing the exact same mRNA chemical modification as Moderna\u2019s own vaccine, Spikevax.\n\nThe company also claimed that, though again having many options available to them, the pair had replicated Moderna\u2019s method of encoding the full-length spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation for a coronavirus.\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nIn 2023, the European Patent Office (EPO) revoked Moderna\u2019s EP 565 patent, and a Dutch court invalidated EP 949. Objections to EP 949 were also filed with the EPO around the same time, leading to the suspension of the German court proceedings. However, in May 2024, after the EPO upheld EP 949 with minor changes, the D\u00fcsseldorf court resumed the infringement case for that patent.\n\nDuring the proceedings, BioNTech and Pfizer agreed that they had infringed Moderna\u2019s patent EP 949, but argued the company\u2019s October 2020 pledge authorising its use was valid until the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the end of the Covid-19 pandemic on 5 May 2023.\n\nThis argument was not accepted by the D\u00fcsseldorf court, which agreed that Moderna\u2019s follow-up press release in March 2022 had revoked patent use permissions.\n\nThe court instructed BioNTech and Pfizer to provide estimates for the profits obtained from the patent infringement, as well as the extent of use. Compensation owed to Moderna will be decided in a separate proceeding.\n\nA spokesperson for BioNTech told reporters: \u201cToday\u2019s decision has no immediate impact on Pfizer, BioNTech, or Comirnaty. We continue to believe that EP949 is invalid, and therefore not infringed, and will appeal the D\u00fcsseldorf District Court\u2019s decision on this patent.\u201d\n\nOVER IN THE US\n\nModerna\u2019s victory in Germany was, however, tainted by a decision issued on the same day by the US Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). The PTAB determined that two of Moderna\u2019s mRNA patents are invalid.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech had argued before the Board that the patents were \u201cunimaginably broad\u201d and that the \u201cbasic idea\u201d was \u201cknown long before\u201d Moderna\u2019s invention date. Moderna had hit back, stating their inventions \u201cchanged fundamental assumptions in pandemic preparedness\u201d.\n\nModerna sued Pfizer and BioNTech in a Massachusetts federal court in August 2022 for alleged patent infringement. That lawsuit is still ongoing.\n\nTHE PARTIES\n\nIn the D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Court, Moderna was represented by Nina Bayerl, Frank-Erich Hufnagel, Elena Hennecke, Vanessa Werlin, Anton Porsche and Denise Gruber of Freshfields.\n\nBioNTech was represented by Christine Kanz, Andreas Staudigel, Max von Leitner, Moritz Lohr and Carolin Wollschlaeger of Hoyng ROKH Monegier, as well as Georg Schnappauf and Thomas Wilk of Zwicker Schnappauf & Partner.\n\nPfizer was represented by Anja Lunze, Gisbert Hohagen, Nora Wessendorf, Verena Bertram, Julius Zacharias and Aurel-Damian Roscher of Taylor Wessing. The company was also represented by Ulrich D\u00f6rries, Michael Eder and Nicolas Raeder of df-mp.",

            "content": "Today, D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Court handed down its judgment in favour of Moderna in its battle against BioNTech and Pfizer for infringement of the former\u2019s mRNA patents (case ID: 4b O 62/22).\n\nIn August 2022 Moderna filed infringement suits against Pfizer and BioNTech at the court concerning two patents, EP 3 590 949 and EP 3 718 565. Both protect \u201cribonucleic acids containing n1-methyl-pseudouracils and uses thereof\u201d and \u201crespiratory virus vaccines\u201d respectively. Moderna accuses Pfizer and BioNTech of infringing both patents with their mRNA vaccine Comirnaty.\n\nEarly on Moderna emphasised that it is not seeking to remove Comirnaty from the various markets or seeking an injunction to prevent future sales. Instead, Moderna is requesting damages for all sales made by its competitors after 8 March 2022.\n\nJudges find Moderna revoked use\n\nThe judges have now ordered the defendants to provide information on the extent of the use of EP 949, and on the prices and profits achieved. Furthermore, the judgment stated that the defendants had to pay the plaintiff reasonable compensation and damages. This is according to a press release from the court seen by JUVE Patent.\n\nBioNTech and Pfizer did not dispute having infringed the patent. However, both companies argued a press release distributed by Moderna in October 2020 authorised the use of the patent during the COVID-19 pandemic. BioNTech and Pfizer claimed this authorisation was valid until 5 May 2023 when the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be over, thus rendering the permission null and void.\n\nThe judges around presiding judge Daniel Vo\u00df did not follow this argument, stating that the Moderna had revoked the permission to use the patent by means of a further press release on 7 March 2022.\n\nThe high-calibre panel of Civil Chamber 4b included not only Daniel Vo\u00df but also Sabine Klepsch and judge Schr\u00f6der. Like Daniel Vo\u00df, Klepsch is also a UPC judge and heads the parallel chamber 4c at D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Court. She helped out in the dispute by representing the sister chamber.\n\nThe parties may appeal to the Higher Regional Court D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nA spokesperson for BioNTech commented, \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the D\u00fcsseldorf District Court not to stay the infringement case related to EP 949 and its finding that EP 949 has been infringed by Pfizer and BioNTech do not change our unwavering and unequivocal stance that this patent is invalid. It is important to note that an appeal to the European Patent Office\u2019s Technical Board of Appeal regarding the ongoing opposition to this patent is pending. Today\u2019s decision has no immediate impact on Pfizer, BioNTech, or Comirnaty. We continue to believe that EP949 is invalid, and therefore not infringed, and will appeal the D\u00fcsseldorf District Court\u2019s decision on this patent.\u201d\n\nThe court has not yet determined how much money Moderna is owed. This will be determined in a separate proceeding.\n\nIn addition to Germany and the UK, Moderna had also sued its Mainz-based competitor BioNTech in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Ireland. The disputes all revolve around the same two patents.\n\nBack to life in 2024\n\nHowever, in late autumn 2023 the EPO revoked EP 565 and a Dutch court also revoked EP 949. Furthermore, nine opponents filed an objection to the granting of EP 949 at the EPO Opposition Division. In addition to Pfizer and BioNTech, these were GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, the Dutch company etherna Immunotherapies and four straw men. D\u00fcsseldorf Regional Court therefore suspended the infringement proceedings concerning both patents.\n\nAfter the EPO Opposition Division upheld EP 949 in May 2024 the related infringement case in D\u00fcsseldorf resumed. The EPO made slight changes to the originally filed version of EP 949 but these do not affect the claims on which Moderna bases its lawsuits in Germany and in the UK.\n\nAs a result of the EPO ruling the D\u00fcsseldorf Court proceeded with Moderna\u2019s claims regarding EP 949. The panel around Daniel Vo\u00df heard the case on the 21 January 2025. In their current decision, the judges found the patent sufficiently valid in view of the Opposition Division\u2019s decision which rejected the defendant\u2019s opposition.\n\nThe fact that the dispute over the grant of the two Moderna patents continues at the EPO has not had an impact here. Appeals against both decisions are now pending before both Boards of Appeal but the boards have not yet scheduled any oral hearings.\n\nFirst win for Moderna in UK\n\nIn early July 2024, Moderna celebrated a big win in the UK. The High Court found Pfizer and BioNTech are infringing Moderna\u2019s EP 949 with their COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and owe the US company damages. However, High Court judge Richard Meade also declared EP 565 invalid. An appeal against the decision is now also pending. The UK Court of Appeal will probably hear it next summer.\n\nAdditionally, the Court of Appeal in the Netherlands will probably review a first-instance decision in the summer. In late 2023, Moderna suffered a defeat at the District Court The Hague when the court declared the Dutch part of EP 949 invalid due to lack of novelty.\n\nPan-European teams\n\nModerna instructed a pan-European team from Freshfields for the infringement proceedings spanning several European countries. Amsterdam partner Rutger Kleemans leads and coordinates the team.\n\nIn the German proceedings Freshfields partners Nina Bayerl and Frank-Erich Hufnagel have the lead. Elena Hennecke, Vanessa Werlin, Anton Porsche, and Denise Gruber complete the full-service law firm\u2019s team.\n\nRight from the start, Moderna has also relied on a team of patent attorneys from Hoffmann Eitle. Partner James Ogle had the lead in the EPO proceedings regarding EP 949. Joachim Renken and David Miller also belong to the team.\n\nShortly before the oral hearing at the EPO, Moderna also took on board D\u00fcsseldorf-based patent attorneys Carla Roth and Lars Hemsath. At that time both worked at IP firm K\u00f6nig Szynka Tilmann von Renesse. In February large parts of the firm merged into Hoffmann Eitle, bulding one of the strongest outfits for pharmaceutical and biotech patents in Germany.\n\nContinuity on defendant side\n\nBioNTech\u2019s go-to firm for various disputes over mRNA vaccines is Hoyng ROKH Monegier. D\u00fcsseldorf-based partner Christine Kanz is responsible for the German infringement proceedings. Her team includes Andreas Staudigel, Max von Leitner, Moritz Lohr and patent attorney Carolin Wollschlaeger. Hoyng ROKH is also involved in the Dutch and Belgian proceedings for BioNTech.\n\nKanz and her team are also representing BioNTech in a newly filled claim at the Unified Patent Court. Earlier this year, US biotech company Promosome claimed BioNTech and Pfizer have infringed one of its patents. On the patent attorney side BioNTech retained Munich-based firm Zwicker Schnappauf & Partner. Partners Georg Schnappauf and Thomas Wilk are not only involved in the EPO and UPC proceedings but also in the German infringement cases. In the UK, BioNTech\u2019s firm of choice is Powell Gilbert.\n\nPfizer has also relied on law firm Taylor Wessing since the beginning of the dispute in most European countries. The full service firm is active for Pfizer in Germany, Belgium, the UK and the Netherlands. The German team is lead by Munich-based partners Anja Lunze and Gisbert Hohagen and also includes salary partners Nora Wessendorf, Verena Bertram, and Julius Zacharias as well as associate Aurel-Damian Roscher.\n\nOn the patent attorney side, Pfizer relies on Munich IP-firm df-mp with a team comprising Ulrich D\u00f6rries, Michael Eder, and Nicolas Raeder. D\u00f6rries also represents Pfizer in the EPO opposition proceedings.",

            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TRIMTECH Therapeutics, a biotech company harnessing targeted protein degradation (TPD) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the closing of its $31 million (\u00a325 million) seed funding round. The financing was led by Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC) and SV Health Investors\u2019 Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), with M Ventures and Pfizer Ventures joining. Additional investors also include Eli Lilly and Company, MP Healthcare Venture Management (MPH), Cambridge Enterprise Ventures, and Start Codon.\n\nThe investment will support further development of the Company\u2019s growing pipeline of potent, CNS (central nervous system) penetrant therapeutics based on its aggregate-selective degrader molecules known as TRIMTACs. The pipeline is focused around the development of treatments for severe neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\nTRIMTECH is leveraging the innate properties of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to selectively and potently degrade protein aggregates associated with a range of diseases which are not well served by current TPD approaches. This novel approach harnesses TRIM21\u2019s unique properties in the form of the Company\u2019s TRIMTAC degrader molecules to develop medicines that address the needs of large patient populations with limited treatment options.\n\nThe Company was founded by CIC and DDF in conjunction with their joint entrepreneur-in-residence, Damian Crowther, and academic co-founders Leo James (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology) and Will McEwan (UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Cambridge).\n\nTRIMTECH has also appointed the following leading life science executives to the Board of Directors: Michael Anstey, Partner at Cambridge Innovation Capital); Laurence Barker, Partner at SV Health Investors (SV); Hakan Goker, Managing Director at M Ventures, Jeffrey Moore, President at MP Healthcare Venture Management; Marie-Claire Peakman, Partner at Pfizer Ventures.\n\nNicola Thompson, CEO, TRIMTECH Therapeutics, said: \u201cThis oversubscribed financing round and the outstanding quality of our investor syndicate is a great endorsement of TRIMTECH\u2019s unique approach to targeting the selective removal of aggregated proteins that underpin so many CNS diseases, and recognizes our impressive scientific foundations and world class team. We extend our thanks to all of our supporters and look forward to working with the new Board members, as we now push forward with progressing the pipeline.\u201d\n\nLaurence Barker, Partner, SV Health Investors\u2019 Dementia Discovery Fund, said: \u201cThe team at DDF is thrilled to co-lead the creation of TRIMTECH to advance its TRIMTAC platform, which harnesses TRIM21\u2019s unique ability to degrade aggregated proteins while preserving functional monomers. While targeted protein degradation has revolutionized drug discovery, effective clearance of protein aggregates remains a major challenge. TRIMTECH\u2019s differentiated approach directly addresses this gap, opening new possibilities for treating neurodegenerative conditions and beyond.\u201d\n\nMichael Anstey, Partner, Cambridge Innovation Capital, said: \u201cCIC is proud to have been part of the creation of TRIMTECH and co-led this financing round. With over 55 million people affected by Alzheimer\u2019s and millions more battling other neurodegenerative disorders, this groundbreaking innovation has the potential to transform the course of treatment for these patients.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit: www.trimtechtherapeutics.com",

A D\u00fcsseldorf court ruled in favor of Moderna, according to a Wednesday court filing.\n\nThe court ruled that Pfizer and BioNTech must disclose any revenue gained from Moderna's patented technology, although the amount remains to be determined, and that they will pay extra.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech exercised legal authorization to use their patent until May 2023. The court made a decision that Moderna legally withdrew their consent in March 2022 so their previous patent permission became void. Legal analysts view the court decision as a major advancement within pharmaceutical intellectual property rights that affects the industry.\n\nIndustry stakeholders and investors now watch closely for further updates in this high-stakes patent conflict.",

            "content": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company is ready to shift its manufacturing operations into the U.S. should the need arise. He made the comments at the 45th TD Cowen Annual Health Care Conference in Boston.\n\nSpeaking to analyst Steve Scala on Monday, Bourla explained that Pfizer has 13 production plants in the U.S., \u201cprobably the largest manufacturing network of any other company,\u201d as per a transcript of the event from Seeking Alpha. A few of these facilities \u201care mega, mega sites,\u201d Bourla added, pointing especially to those involved in the production of antibodies and sterile injectables.\n\nSo, \u201cif something happens,\u201d Pfizer will be well-positioned to respond to potential tariffs \u201cby transferring from manufacturing sites outside, to manufacturing sites here the things that can be transferred quickly,\u201d Bourla added.\n\nBourla\u2019s comments on Monday come after he, alongside other Big Pharma CEOs, met with President Donald Trump late last month. When Trump won the election last year, many industry analysts and observers were optimistic, with some analysts raising the possibility of him repealing\u2014or at least toning down\u2014the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)\u2019s drug price negotiation program. Others, meanwhile, said the Trump administration could foster a more industry-friendly environment, particularly regarding dealmaking.\n\nThese hopes seem to have been dashed at the closed-door event, however. Reporting from Bloomberg at the time revealed that Trump threatened the pharma execs with tariffs if they continued to manufacture their drugs and other products abroad. The president also refused to give his word that he\u2019d attempt to water down the IRA.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs play a big part in what analysts at Jefferies call \u201cpolitical uncertainty.\u201d In a note to investors on Monday evening, the firm pointed to the difficult \u201cmacro backdrop\u201d this year so far, which has weighed on the industry. While big companies with solid pipelines\u2014such as Gilead, Amgen and Vertex\u2014will continue to be largely insulated from these factors, small-to-medium players are and will likely face headwinds, according to the analysts.\n\nJust a few days before the meeting, Trump also floated the idea of slapping additional duties of around 25% on imported products, including pharmaceuticals. These levies could \u201cgo very substantially higher over the course of a year,\u201d according to reporting from CNBC.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump also announced tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China. Though these additional fines are related to what the White House called the \u201cextraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs\u201d without substantiation, their effects on biopharma could also be profound. Seeking Alpha analyst Edmund Ingham wrote at the time that the China tariffs are especially problematic for the industry, particularly as companies are \u201cincreasingly looking to China to find promising new drug candidates.\u201d\n\nThese tariffs\u201425% on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% on goods from China\u2014began March 4.\n\nFollowing these threats, Eli Lilly last week announced that it was making a $27 billion commitment into the U.S., primarily to boost its domestic manufacturing capacity. Lilly will erect four new manufacturing facilities over the next five years, which the company says will in turn will create around 3,000 new jobs for engineers, scientists and other related workers. Construction activities will provide some 10,000 opportunities.",

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. (PFE), headquartered in New York, discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products. With a market cap of $149.8 billion, the company offers medicines, vaccines, medical devices, and consumer healthcare products for oncology, inflammation, cardiovascular, and other therapeutic areas.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and PFE perfectly fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the general drug manufacturers industry. PFE thrives on its strong product lineup, including popular vaccines and blockbuster drugs. With a commitment to research and development, Pfizer continues to invest in innovation, ensuring a steady stream of new products. International sales make up nearly half of its revenue, highlighting its global reach and competitive standing in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, PFE slipped 16.8% from its 52-week high of $31.54, achieved on Jul. 30, 2024. Over the past three months, PFE stock gained 2.7%, underperforming the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF\u2019s (IHE) 5.7% gains during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of PFE dipped 1.1% on a YTD basis and declined 1.3% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming IHE\u2019s YTD gains of 10.9% and 5.9% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, PFE has been trading below its 50-day moving average since October 2024, experiencing some fluctuations. The stock is trading below its 200-day moving average since November 2024.\n\nPFE has seen underperformance due to declining sales of COVID-19 products and upcoming patent cliffs for top-selling products like Eliquis. The launch of generic versions of Eliquis in 2028 could significantly impact revenue. The company is also set to lose exclusivity on other blockbuster products like Ibrance, contributing to lower revenue and a drop in share price.\n\nOn Feb. 4, PFE shares closed down more than 1% after reporting its Q4 results. Its adjusted EPS $0.63 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.48. The company\u2019s revenue was $17.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street forecasts of $17.5 billion. PFE expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $2.80 to $3, and expects revenue in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion.\n\nIn the competitive arena of general drug manufacturers, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY) has taken the lead over PFE, showing resilience with a 5.9% gain on a YTD basis and a 17.7% uptick over the past 52 weeks.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish on PFE\u2019s prospects. The stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 22 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $30.47 suggests a potential upside of 16.1% from current price levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Dr. Dolsten has served on several public boards in the US and Europe and has vast experience in business development, including 10 different mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cBy creating oral alternatives to biologics such as antibodies and peptides and designing oral drugs for hard-to-drug intracellular targets, the work Orbis Medicines is doing will dramatically expand access to treatment for patients suffering from many chronic and devastating diseases, which is truly the next frontier in drug discovery,\u201d said Dr. Dolsten. \u201cWhat the Orbis Medicines team led by Morten are achieving in the field of oral macrocycle medicines positions the company to be a disruptor of the biologics market. I believe Orbis Medicines has the potential to become the leading oral macrocycles and oral biologics biotech company.\u201d\n\nDr. Dolsten\u2019s accomplishments include the introduction of a new class of oral medications for autoimmune diseases, the development and approval of targeted anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and Pfizer\u2019s rapid R&D response to the COVID-19 pandemic (see \u201cNote to Editors\u201d below for more information).\n\nOrbis Medicines is pioneering the systematic discovery and development of targeted, orally available macrocycles for diseases and targets traditionally treated with biologics. Orbis develops compounds known as nCycles, which can address a wide range of validated protein targets with unique oral bioavailability and membrane permeability features.\n\nAbout Orbis Medicines\n\nOrbis Medicines is pioneering a new era for oral macrocycle drug discovery. Its nGen platform systematically delivers macrocycle candidates, termed nCycles. These are optimized for oral bioavailability, which has historically hindered therapeutic development of this versatile class of molecules. Orbis\u2019 pipeline is initially focused on nCycle candidates against targets validated by blockbuster biologic drugs delivered by injection. Proof-of-concept of Orbis\u2019 work has been published in Nature Communications and Nature Chemical Biology. The company has raised \u20ac116 million in venture funding to date, including a \u20ac90 million series A round led by NEA with new investors Lilly Ventures, Cormorant, EIFO and existing investors Forbion and Novo Holdings. Orbis is located in Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland. For more information, please visit: www.orbismedicines.com\n\nAbout nGen\n\nnGen is Orbis Medicines\u2019 technology platform for generating nCycles, a new class of fully synthetic macrocycle compounds optimized for oral bioavailability and membrane permeability. It consists of multiple proprietary integrated elements in a \u201clab in a loop\u201d system starting with hit finding libraries of 100 billion compounds. The highly automated chemistry-based nGen platform can synthesize and analyze up to 100,000 distinct synthetic macrocycles in weeks, allowing the company to discover candidates with the right properties to enable oral dosing and intracellular targeting. The scale and quality of the data produced from these real compounds, paired with machine learning, creates an industry-leading platform that de-risks and accelerates development.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nNotable accomplishments of Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D., during his tenure as Chief Scientific Officer, President, Pfizer Research & Development\n\nIntroduced a new class of oral medications for autoimmune diseases dominated by biologics, including first-in-class JAK inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib) for rheumatoid arthritis & ulcerative colitis, first-in-class Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor Cibinqo (abrocitinib) for atopic dermatitis and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma/Janus kinase 3 (Tec/JAK3) drug Litfulo (ritlecitinib) for alopecia areata.\n\nOversaw the development and approval of targeted ALK inhibitors in the highly competitive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) market, including first-in-class ALK inhibitor Xalkori (crizotinib) and third-generation ALK inhibitor Lorbrena (lorlatinib). Other major drug approvals during Dr. Dolsten\u2019s tenure at Pfizer included the breast cancer drug Ibrance (palbociclib), the myeloma drug Elrexfio (elranatamab-bcmm), the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Talzenna, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor Inlyta (axitinib), the oral anti-coagulant Eliquis (apixaban), the transthyretin amyloid stabilizing drug Vyndaqel (tafamadis), the Prevnar 20 vaccine and the RSV vaccine Abrysvo.\n\nSpearheaded Pfizer\u2019s rapid R&D response to the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving emergency use authorization and subsequently full approval for the oral antiviral therapy Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty, in partnership with BioNTech.\n\nDr. Dolsten announced his retirement from Pfizer in July 2024.",

It was the \u2018return on Meta\u2019 and it was like \u2018Meta\u2019s return since it came public was 17%\u2019 and that was not even the CAGR it was just like 17%. 17%. I was like no, and I went back and said I think that\u2019s wrong. And it said you\u2019re right, its 300%.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber pointed out that the output from most AI chatbots has to be cross-referenced with each other, Cramer countered and pointed out that the process was too time-consuming. \u201cBut by the time I\u2019m finished with that, I could have hand-counted it,\u201d shared the CNBC TV show host.\n\nHe was also full of praise for the late actor Gene Hackman whose death shocked the media industry. Cramer recalled:\n\n\u201cYeah I was a great friend of Gene for a very long time. He did move on. Uh from when he was a great partner of mine at my hedge fund. And he was a quiet genius. You\u2019d learn from him every time. He came into my office one day. I happened to be a huge Gene Hackman fan. And he was in the lobby, and he said, can I see you, and I said listen nobody\u2019s the wizard. But he was so thoughtful and great by the way in so many things that he did. For instance, he did a painting of me that I\u2019ve always kept, that he did in early 2000. But a remarkable man, a kind man, obviously a great actor. One of the most humble people I\u2019ve ever met. Never in a million years, I remember one time when my eldest said to him you are a great basketball coach and he said, no you see, that was a movie.\u201d\n\nHe also recounted Hackman\u2019s movies that he liked and commented on the contrast with the movies that Hackman actually liked. Cramer stated:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny cause the movies that he loved, I told him I loved obviously Conversation, you know, I loved French Connection. The ones that he loved were very different. He loved Royal Tenenbaums, he loved things where he played . . . .but the best thing he ever said to me was, I was in a couple of deals, and he said, and they backfired, and he said, Jim, sometimes you just get had. Simple man, great man.\u201d\n\nCycling back to the trade tensions between the US and China, he added the market is wondering what \u201cthe President going to do about China?\u201d While admitting that \u201cChina\u2019s not as important as it was, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cramer added: \u201cBecause everybody in the end is concerned about what the President\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean there are 18 friendly countries that are allowed unlimited selling. And they\u2019re saying look, maybe that is arbitrary, and they\u2019re to go over the President\u2019s people about, how, to change those midnight rules that were put together by the Biden Administration right at the end of his term. So be aware that there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, in NVIDIA, no moving parts in Snowflake.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 92\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. While pharma stocks, in general, have struggled lately as high rates make their impact on research and development, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has struggled due to its high debt load as well. The stock is up by a modest 2% over the past year. In his previous comments about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Cramer has remained optimistic about the firm\u2019s CEO Dr. Bourla. This time around, he shared how the company is using AI in its operations:\n\n\u201cThey do contract research, they make . .and they [Salesforce] got Pfizer. Which is the single biggest account out there. They got Pfizer. And lost in the shuffle of Agentforce, I mention it only because Agentforce is such a big deal and Mark, I had to bring up Pfizer.\u201d\n\nOverall PFE ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

So, there will be risks and opportunities.\u201d\n\nHe added that the industry\u2019s current strategy is to stay close to the administration and try to \u201cinfluence the environment.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the company was concerned about Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, Bourla noted that Pfizer likely has the largest manufacturing network in the U.S. within the industry, with 13 manufacturing sites.\n\n\u201cWe have the capabilities here and the manufacturing sites are operating in good capacity right now,\u201d Bourla said. \u201cIf something happens, we will try to mitigate it by transferring from manufacturing sites outside to the manufacturing sites here.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed pharma companies to bring more production to the U.S. as part of his broader effort to boost domestic manufacturing. In February, Trump met with top industry executives, including Eli Lilly (LLY) CEO David Ricks. A week later, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new U.S. manufacturing facilities.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has proposed several tariffs. He announced last month plans to impose tariffs \u201cin the neighborhood of 25%\u201d on imported vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals starting in April.\n\nMeanwhile, 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada are set to take effect on Tuesday, and duties on Chinese goods will rise by 10%.\n\nTrump also suggested that tariffs on imported goods from the European Union are \u201ccoming very soon.\u201d And he recently signed a memorandum that directs his advisers to draft new \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners.\n\nThese new tariffs would factor in not just the tolls other countries impose on U.S. goods, but also foreign subsidies, exchange rates, and taxes on imports \u2014 all things Trump argues give other nations an unfair edge.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

            "content": "\u201cGLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,\u201d \u201cIndeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.\u201d\n\nAccording to JP Morgan Research, obesity and diabetes will drive the GLP-1 market\u2019s growth to $100 billion by 2030. By that year, there may be 30 million GLP-1 users in the US or around 9% of the total population. Increased demand for obesity medications will benefit some industries, such as biotech, while posing problems for others, such as the food and beverage sector.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Semaglutide, a market leader for obesity drugs and the generic version of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, was the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023. Nearly 88% of all new prescriptions were for it. Tirzepatide, Liraglutide, and Semaglutide are the only three GLP-1 weight-control drugs currently approved by the FDA.\n\nMorgan Stanley Research has increased its prediction for the global market for obesity medications from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030 in light of this demand increase. In 2023, brand-name obesity drugs brought in almost $6 billion.\n\nMost people have tried to include fitness and weight loss into their everyday routines. Due to the immediate physical and psychological benefits of increasing one\u2019s fitness, the weight loss and fitness sector is rather large globally. The WHO estimates that over one billion individuals worldwide\u2014650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children\u2014are obese. A brand-new class of weight-loss drugs that don\u2019t require rigorous diets or exercise routines appears to be ground-breaking. These innovative drugs can help people who are overweight or obese shed 15% to 20% of their body weight. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, \u201cThis may be the largest opportunity we\u2019ve ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d Medication for weight loss is very popular. Investors are comparing the US top in weight-loss medications with the leading in artificial intelligence chips.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Weight Loss Drug Stocks to Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other best weight loss drug stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChallenges and Accessibility Issues in the GLP-1 Weight Loss Medication Market\n\nThe latest generation of GLP-1 medications are being hailed by some as \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d that can cure obesity. However, not all obese persons can utilize GLP-1s due to their high cost and restricted insurance coverage. At the current rate, treating 40% of obese Americans would cost more than $1 trillion annually, according to Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor and the chairman of MIT\u2019s economics department. That is nearly equal to what the government spends on Medicare as a whole. That is a startling amount.\n\nThe usage of GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the past decade, whereas among those with type 2 diabetes, it has decreased by roughly 10%, per a report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The prolonged medicine shortage that results could restrict diabetics\u2019 access to the treatments, the experts caution. As the need for obesity drugs rises, it is imperative to guarantee that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 medicines, stressed Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sinai\u2019s Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.\n\nThe FDA says the shortages are a result of rising demand. The GLP-1 medication scarcity is a \u201cmajor public health concern\u201d that is unlikely to be addressed in 2024, according to the European Medicines Agency, suggesting that the shortages are not limited to the US. NPR reports that some people with diabetes have had to cut back on the number of drugs they can take due to shortages that have made it difficult for them to have their prescriptions filled.\n\nJulia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim were among the panelists on \u201cWeighing the Future of Obesity Drugs,\u201d which discussed the potential of GLP-1 medications, which were initially developed to treat diabetes but are now being used to treat obesity. The evolution of GLP-1 medication delivery from weekly dosages to several daily injections was also noted by Netschert, who also emphasized current attempts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse effects. Notwithstanding their remarkable effectiveness, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are currently undergoing treatment with GLP-1 drugs, according to Netschert, because of supply constraints.\n\nIn their dispute over who should pay, Angeles claimed that the majority of patients paid cash, while Netschert cited large insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements. Up to 700 million individuals worldwide may need these drugs outside of the United States, according to Netschert. Notably, the panel discovered that the UK had the fastest approval rate of GLP-1 drugs of any nation, demonstrating the recognized worth of these drugs. In general, UK payors are strict.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that demonstrated over 10% analyst upside, had a market cap above $2 billion and were backed by strong institutional ownership. We then ranked these stocks based on their price target upside.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Pfizer Inc. (PFE) the Best Weight Loss Drug Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 21.37%\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), standing ninth among the best weight loss drugs to buy according to analysts, is a global pharmaceutical company specializing in innovative medicines, vaccines, and healthcare products sold worldwide. While traditionally focused on various medical conditions, the company is now entering the obesity treatment market with danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for weight loss. This positions the company as a potential competitor in the rapidly growing weight loss drug sector, attracting significant investor interest.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is focusing on oral GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss, aiming to provide a convenient alternative to injectables. Its lead candidate, danuglipron, is being developed as a once-daily pill after discontinuing the twice-daily version due to side effects. A dose optimization study is planned for late 2024 following promising Phase 2b results showing 8%-13% weight reduction. Additionally, the corporation is advancing other weight loss drugs, including a once-daily GLP-1 pill in Phase 1 and a GIP inhibitor set for Phase 2 trials in 2024.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is prioritizing oncology for future growth, aiming to add blockbuster drugs by 2030. It invested $43 billion in acquiring Seagen to strengthen its pipeline and may pursue further acquisitions. Management projects 10%-18% earnings growth in 2025, with analysts estimating 14% annual growth over the next 3-5 years. The company also offers a strong 6.3% dividend yield, with the dividend recently increased by 2.4%, making it a top vaccine stock choice among hedge funds.\n\nAstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is further strengthening its position in the weight loss market by investing $80 million in SixPeaks Bio, a startup developing a weight loss antibody that preserves muscle mass. The company has an option to acquire SixPeaks once it reaches the investigational new drug filing stage.\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 9th on our list of best weight loss drug stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Big Pharma Is Still Alive\n\nThe last few years have seen the healthcare sector change radically thanks to biotech innovation. The most visible part was mRNA vaccines, but the arrival of gene therapies, cheap genome sequencing, or stem cell therapies are all there to usher in a new era of medical marvels (you can follow the links for deeper coverage of these topics).\n\nMost of these innovations have been done by smaller companies, and R&D efforts by the biggest pharmaceutical companies have often been not very successful .\n\nNevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is still dominated by a few giant corporations. Such blue-chip multi-billion dollar companies are not only the historically dominant players but might as well stay on top for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy is that? How is it that even radical innovation might not threaten incumbent companies?\n\nThe Big Pharma Business Model\n\nTo understand how \u201cBig Pharma\u201d can stay on top, we can look at the example of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe innovation itself was very much invented by BioNTech, which took an actually quite old scientific concept and turned it into an entire technology platform.\n\nWhen the pandemic arrived, it was the perfect time for such a \u201cprogrammable\u201d vaccine to shine. And it did. But BioNTech did not commercialize it themselves. They partnered with Pfizer to handle approval, production, and commercialization quickly. After all, rival Moderna and countless other companies were pushing for their own COVID-19 vaccine, so time was of the essence.\n\nSimply put, Pfizer brought to BioNTech needed resources in manufacturing, funding, distribution, sales network, clinical trials, handling of regulators, etc\u2026\n\nInnovation vs Acquisitions\n\nAnother way for Big Pharma to stay relevant is simply to buy out successful biotech companies.\n\nBiotechnology is a field littered with failed projects and companies. So when one turns out successful, both founder and investors might want to cash out after 10-15 years of patience, hard work, and a bit of luck.\n\nAnd who could be more qualified than Big Pharma firms, able also to take the innovative drugs and bring them forth to their network of tens of thousands of doctors at once?\n\nThey also have the needed financial firepower. For example, with $512B of market capitalization, Johnson & Johnson, the largest pharmaceutical company in 2021 by revenues , registered a net income of almost $18B and a free cash flow of $17B.\n\nMany biotech firms, astonishingly from a scientific and innovation point of view, often trade below a billion dollars. So, if you look at the yearly free cash flow of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, this is a lot of dry powder for acquisitions.\n\nTop 5 Blue Chip Pharmaceutical Companies\n\nTo qualify as a \u201cblue chip,\u201d we consider only the top 20 companies according to their 2021 revenues .\n\nThe term \u201ctop\u201d is rather subjective, as is here a mix of existing drug portfolio, historical performance, R&D pipeline, and financial position. We will highlight some of the central parts of the business and incoming important innovations instead of going deep into the entire therapeutics portfolio or the company's financial results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $ 1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences.\n\nOncology.\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nThe company has grown sales by 6% yearly in the last 20 years, with a 13.2% return to shareholders in the last 10 years. The stock is also one of the rare \u201cdividend aristocrats,\u201d having rising dividends every year for 60 consecutive years.\n\nOverall, Johnson & Johnson is a very safe bet on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on long-term holdings and the stock price compounding while also giving a moderate but stable and growing dividend.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nThe Danish company is highly focused on diabetes & metabolic diseases like obesity, together making 88% of the company's revenues.\n\nThe focus on obesity is rather recent, with significant growth in this segment in 2022\n\nThe company is also working on an expanding rare disease portfolio and chronic diseases like kidney or liver pathologies.\n\nThe company is well-placed to benefit from the worldwide rise of chronic metabolic diseases. This should provide very safe revenue streams and continuous growth in the short term.\n\nA key vulnerability for Novo Nordisk in the long term is the possibility of permanently curing diabetes through stem cells, gene editing, or another new therapeutic method. This is something we have discussed previously when covering Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics. This is more likely to happen soon for type-1 diabetes, with type-2, the most common, much more likely to be still treated by reducing symptoms for a longer period of time.\n\nSo Novo Nordisk provides a safe place for conservative investors, but they will want to monitor tightly the development of the diabetes market and the arrival of potential competitors. The entry of Novo Nordisk into new segments like chronic diseases and obesity might be the right option to sustain the company in the long run.\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon .\n\nSo far, some of the consequently lost revenues have been compensated by the pandemic-boosted sales of the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nThe company is mostly active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nThe new start product of Merck is Keytruda, a cancer drug (monoclonal antibody), with sales growing 16%-27% over the last 3 years. It is already approved for multiple cancers and has 13 new applications under review in phase 3 of clinical trials.\n\nThe company's revenues and earnings have grown significantly in the last 3 years, especially in 2022.\n\nThis financial success should persist until 2028, when Keytruda loses its patent protection. So, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company can reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nBut Pfizer is not just mRNA vaccines, with a total of 10 products with more than $1B of sales per year.\n\nThe company is targeting new product launches: 4 in 2023 and up to 12 by 2024.\n\nIts' management is keen to insist that the growth story is not Covid-dependent, with plans to bring non-Covid sales from the current average of $50B to $84B by 2030.\n\nThey also insist that the windfall profits from the pandemic will \u201callow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation\u201d\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybean, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nBayer's valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of RounUp to cause cancer.\n\nSince then, the company's valuation has fallen to less than what it paid for acquiring Monsanto. This has been a distraction from its solid performance in the seeds, other pesticides, and healthcare segments.",

            "content": "Buying low to sell later when the stock's price is high is a time-honored investing strategy. With the benchmark S&P 500 index near its all-time high, though, now might seem like the wrong time to go looking for stocks that trade at bargain prices.\n\nIf a frothy market has kept you sidelined, I've got some good news. While most investors are focusing on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, a couple of terrific businesses are flying under the radar.\n\nShares of Pfizer (PFE 0.47%), and UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.48%) have been beaten down to near 52-week lows. Here's why they look like terrific bargains right now.\n\n1. Pfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer are down by about 57% from a peak they reached in late 2021. Sales of COVID-19 products that declined faster than expected, plus upcoming patent cliffs for its top-selling products, have kept the stock under pressure.\n\nPfizer's stock price has declined over the years, but not its dividend payout. In January, Pfizer raised its quarterly dividend payout for the 16th year in a row. At recent prices, the stock offers a huge 6.6% dividend yield.\n\nIn 2024, sales of a next-generation blood thinner called Eliquis grew 9% to $7.4 billion for Pfizer. That works out to 11.6% of total revenue. Unfortunately, generic versions of Eliquis are expected to launch in the U.S. market beginning in 2028, which could reduce this huge revenue stream down to a tiny trickle.\n\nPatent cliffs are a problem for all big pharmaceutical companies. By reinvesting the profits that its aging blockbusters produce into an enormous development pipeline, Pfizer can offset the losses and continue growing its bottom line.\n\nPfizer has more than likely launched enough future blockbusters to offset upcoming Eliquis losses and continue pushing its big needle forward for at least another decade. In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nine new drugs from Pfizer's pipeline and last year was another big one. In 2024, the FDA granted more than a dozen approvals to Pfizer products.\n\nPfizer reported total revenue that rose by 7% last year. If we exclude declining sales of its COVID-19 products, total sales surged by 12% year over year. This year, management expects adjusted earnings to reach a range between $2.80 and $3.00 per share. That's a lot more than the company needs to meet a dividend obligation currently set at $1.72 annually. An upcoming patent cliff for Eliquis could limit growth, but not to a degree that makes it impossible to continue a steady pace of dividend payout raises.\n\n2. UnitedHealth Group\n\nShares of UnitedHealth Group are down by about 25% from a peak they reached last November. Unexpectedly high healthcare utilization rates hammered profits and the stock price lower this year.\n\nThe stock has been falling because medical costs rose 9% in 2024 but total revenue climbed just 6% over the same period. As a result, net income declined by a striking 35% last year to $15.51 per share.\n\nHospitals have raised pries a little faster than UnitedHealth Group expected,but this enormous healthcare conglomerate has levers it can pull to keep its bottom line moving in the right direction. For starters, it can raise premiums that members and plan sponsors and their employees will most likely accept. After years of consolidation in the insurance industry, options are limited.\n\nUnitedHealth Group doesn't just run America's largest private insurance operation, it's also the nation's largest employer of physicians. It's hard to imagine a better way for an insurer to retain more of the premiums it receives each month than by directly employing the physicians who order tests and procedures that drive up medical expenses.\n\nIn November of 2023, UnitedHealth's Optum Health division said it employed 90,000 American physicians, or roughly 10% of the total. At last November's investor day conference, management wasn't as vocal about how many physicians it employs but did mention it completed 16 million home health visits in 2024.\n\nUnitedHealth Group stock price is down but the company has raised its dividend payout a whopping 94% over the past five years. At recent prices it offers a minuscule 0.4% yield but it's growing so fast that this stock could be a significant source of passive income by the time you're ready to retire. Adding some shares to a diverse portfolio now to hold over the long run looks like the right move.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical Innovation At The Core Of Healthcare\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been built on the back of scientific innovation. The first innovators a century ago have turned into large pharmaceutical companies regularly re-inventing themselves.\n\nThis is because life sciences and medicine have evolved equally fast in the last few generations. In addition, patent protection often expires less than 10-15 years after the commercialization of a new therapy, forcing pharmaceutical companies to invent new products constantly.\n\nThanks to this pressure to constantly innovate, even large companies kept the incentives to stay able to invent regularly life-changing medicine.\n\nIn this article, we will see some of the best healthcare innovators in all arrays of medicine, from cancer treatments to vaccines, rare diseases, neurosciences, or metabolic therapies.\n\nTop 10 Pharmaceutical Stocks for Healthcare Innovation\n\n(These stocks are organized by market capitalization at the time of writing of this article)\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ +0.09% )\n\nThe largest pharmaceutical company by revenues in 2022, with $94B. The company operates as a conglomerate of 3 sub-businesses: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer healthcare (by importance order).\n\nIt operates no less than 29 products or platforms with more than $1B in annual sales. Non-medical professionals might be more familiar with some of the consumer health products like Listerine, Neutrogena, or Tylenol. Still, more than half of its revenues are from pharmaceuticals, with a focus on 6 therapeutic areas:\n\nImmunology.\n\nInfectious diseases.\n\nNeurosciences\n\nOncology\n\nCardiovascular & metabolism.\n\nPulmonary hypertension.\n\nJ&J was the second largest pharmaceutical company by R&D investment in 2022 and boasts an impressive lineup:\n\n6 new products were approved in 2022.\n\n20 large MedTech pipeline programs.\n\n81 innovation deals.\n\n20 new equity investments in 2022.\n\n8 licensing agreements in 2022.\n\nWith its highly diversified activities in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, J&J is a good pick for investors looking to bet on pharmaceutical innovation with as little volatility as possible.\n\n(You can read more about J&J's innovation strategy from this transcript of a speech given at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference )\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY +0.79% )\n\nBMS is a pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in cancer, hematology, immunology, and cardiology.\n\nThe company is targeting its risk-adjusted sales to grow from $10B-$13B in 2025 to $25+B in 2030, with the growth coming from both currently commercialized blockbuster drugs increasing their market and new therapies. The new therapies are growing very quickly, having more than doubled revenues between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBMS also has more than 50 therapies in the early stage of clinical trials, of which half are in oncology.\n\nWith half of the 2020-2025 revenues expected to come from the new product portfolio, BMS has already achieved remarkable innovations and should strongly increase its operating margins.\n\nThe success is the commercialized new product portfolio is very encouraging, and BMS might be on the verge of a decade of explosive growth driven by its new product portfolio and its strong performance in all of its 4 core segments.\n\nInvestors will want to pay close attention to phase 3 of clinical trials and the continuing new product sales growth.\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S NVO +1.47% )\n\nNovo Nordisk's innovation has traditionally been razor-focused on diabetes, the core segment for the company. This is still true, with 10 clinical trials ongoing in the field .\n\nHowever, the major innovation of Novo Nordisk is in the obesity market, with its newly launched Wegovy, an injectable medicine for weight loss initially used for diabetes.\n\nThe drug is showing strong medical results and has been regularly sold out, even with Novo Nordisk increasing production capacity several times. The drug is proving so popular that a TikTok-induced mania even increased the shortage .\n\nThe company is also working on growth hormones and acquiring the connected medical device BIOCORP .\n\nWhile its diabetes business is likely stable for the next decade, innovative treatment could slowly endanger this market, especially for type-1 diabetes.\n\nSo, the expansion in the obesity market is likely to represent the long-term prospect for growth for Novo Nordisk. We discussed This market in more detail in our article \u201c Top Companies In Obesity Treatments .\u201d\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. MRK +1.46% )\n\nMerck has changed since its 2021 spin-off of women's health and biosimilar products in Organon . The company is currently most active in infectious diseases, vaccines, oncology, and cardiovascular & metabolic disorders.\n\nAt its core, Merck is a technology company that goes beyond just pharmaceuticals. For example, it has a semiconductor offer (equally useful for many biotech equipment like DNA readers). It also controls Sigma Aldrich, a leading supplier of laboratory and testing materials and consumable s , which is part of the broader life science offering , which relies on 59 manufacturing sites and proposes 300,000 products.\n\nThe company has an ambitious R&D roadmap , with 1 new pharmaceutical launch every 1.5 years. This includes the potential of a new therapeutic method for cancer, relying on targeted DNA disruption.\n\nMerck combines steady cash flow from its industrial capacities (semiconductors and life sciences) with the potential of new blockbuster drugs in cancer and neurology.\n\nWith Merck's flagship drug, Keytruda, losing its patent protection in 2028, these innovations will be needed to keep the company's income growing.\n\nSo, investors in Merck will want to keep an eye on the R&D portfolio to see if the company has been able to reinvent itself after that date.\n\nPfizer Inc. PFE -0.43% )\n\nAlready a large company, Pfizer made it big with the Covid-19 vaccine. It generated no less than $37B in 2021, for example, almost half of the company's revenues. The pandemic also boosted the sale of the antiviral pill Paxlovid by another $20B.\n\nPfizer sees the pandemic windfall profits as leverage to expand with new products and to \u201c allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue to our 2030 top-line expectation . \u201d\n\nAmong these opportunities for the next 2 years are 4 vaccines, of which 3 are mRNA, one treatment for growth hormone deficiency, and two for inflammatory diseases. It also covers 7 new indications for existing drugs and 4 business development deals.\n\nIn the longer term, a lot more potential launches could also work in a large variety of applications. This includes a potential competitor on obesity to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, new vaccines, hemophilia therapies, and cancer treatments.\n\nPfizer is a company that has demonstrated with the pandemic its ability to cash in on innovation and taken a strong lead in the vaccine sector. Combined with its previously well-established lines of business in oncology and inflammatory disease, this should reassure investors of Pfizer's ability to keep bringing new therapies to the market.\n\nBayer is equal parts an agriculture company and a pharmaceutical company.\n\nAfter its merger with Monsanto, it is one of the world's largest biotech and seed companies. It controls most of the traditional GMO seed market and is also working on using CRISPR for the next generation of seeds for corn, soybeans, wheat, etc\u2026\n\nThe pharmaceutical activity, under prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), is roughly half of the company\u2019s revenues, with the other half made of the agricultural business. It covers a large spectrum of therapeutic areas, with a third of its sales in the cardiovascular segment.\n\nBayer\u2019s focus on innovation is on\n\nEye treatments, in partnership with Regeneron (Eylea is the second best-selling drug of Bayer)\n\nStem cell treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease and heart attacks, in partnership with BlueRock Therapeutics .\n\n. Gene therapies, in partnership with AskBio .\n\n. Oncology (cancer treatments): 2 drugs in clinical trials in phase III, 2 in phase II, and 8 in phase I\n\nFar from a distraction, the agricultural segment of the company shares many R&D capacities and human resources with the pharmaceutical segment.\n\nHowever, Bayer's stock valuation has been hammered down due to legal risk from its Monsanto acquisition and court case on the potential of the pesticide RoundUp to cause cancer.\n\nSo investors will want to assess if the pharmaceutical segment is at a deep discount due to these legal issues or if the risk is too high despite Bayer's other IPs and R&D pipeline quality.\n\nAmgen Inc. AMGN +0.04% )\n\nAmgen is maybe the poster child of success in biotechnology, both for its technological achievement and from an investing point of view. It went from a price of $0.11/share in 1984 to a recent price in the $225-$285/share range in 2022.\n\nIts first achievement was creating the first recombinant human erythropoetin in 1989. It would follow with treatments for rheumatoid arthritis in 1998 and osteoporosis and cancer in 2010, among other protein and biological-based therapeutics.\n\nIt currently has a total of 27 approved treatments, treating 11 million patients. Its most quickly growing products (9 products worth $ 10.5B in sales) have grown their sales volume by 16% in 2022.\n\nIt has 39 potential drugs in its pipeline, of which 18 are already in clinical trials phase 3 , with a strong predominance of inflammation and oncology for these most advanced clinical trials.\n\nAnother innovation is AMG 133, an obesity treatment that is hoped to be more powerful than the existing therapies. AMG 133\u2019s unique advantage would also be a long half-life, with a dosage every 4 weeks instead of the required weekly treatment of Wegovy .\n\nBecause it is only entering phase 2 of clinical trials and because the company focuses on a wide array of therapies, AMG 133 is less central to the investment thesis for Amgen. Still, a potential 5-20 billion dollar blockbuster drug could seriously boost the company's bottom line. So, with Wegovy showing the market is larger than expected, this is something investors in Amgen will want to keep an eye on.\n\nThe company also has a biosimilar department (the equivalent of generic drugs for biotech treatments), with 5 approved drugs and 3 drugs in the R&D pipeline .\n\nAmgen has historically been one of the most innovative pharmaceutical companies ever made, almost single-handedly creating the biotech sector. Its impressive R&D pipeline shows Amgen is determined to keep that reputation intact, including by venturing into new segments like the obesity market.\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. GILD -0.56% )\n\nGilead is the other big biotech success story of the last 30 years. Where Amgen focuses on unique proteins, Gilead is centered around specific therapeutic areas, with a predilection for untreated diseases, mostly in virology at first and then in oncology .\n\nAn emerging focus is also inflammation, the root cause of many other hard-to-treat diseases. Still, HIV represents by far the bulk of Gilead's current income.\n\nIt currently has 30 approved drugs , most of them for HIV, Hepatitis, and cancer. Its R&D pipeline contains 59 clinical trial programs, of which 19 are in phase 3.\n\nThe R&D programs are overwhelmingly dominated by infectious diseases and oncology clinical trials, deepening Gilead's specialization, especially with 13 HIV-related clinical trials.\n\nGilead is a surprisingly \u201cniche\u201d biotech for its market cap, very focused on HIV and, to some extent, oncology. Investors in Gilead might want to understand the dynamic of the HIV drug market as most of the company's ongoing cash flow is tied to it.\n\nThe company behind the Covid mRNA vaccine sold by Pfizer is now using the money made during the pandemic to expand its offer widely.\n\nIt is now developing mRNA vaccines for shingles, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, and the herpes virus. This makes it a leading company in the field of mRNA vaccines, with only its competitor Moderna ( MRNA ) developing more mRNA vaccines than BioNTech. You can read more about the future of mRNA technology in our article \u201c The Next Application for mRNA Technology: Cancer Therapies .\u201d\n\nBioNTech is also working on various other therapeutic methods, including cell and gene therapies, antibodies, and chemical drugs.\n\nAs the great winner of true transformation innovation with the arrival of mRNA during the pandemic, BioNTech has a spotless image with investors, even if the current stock price cooled down from the pandemic highs.\n\nThe company's future will depend on expanding mRNA to replace many older vaccines and on mRNA capacity to be used for other applications, of which cancer is the most promising financially.\n\nThe other big winner of the pandemic and the mRNA vaccine technology, Moderna, is doubling down on the vaccine application of mRNA. It has no less than 32 clinical trials for mRNA vaccines, covering 14 pathogens like the RSV, Zika, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, or cytomegalovirus .\n\nDespite the focus on vaccine application, Moderna also has some research programs regarding cancer application, cardiac regeneration, and rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis in partnership with the leader in this sector, Vertex.\n\nThis R&D frenzy is fueled by the revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and represents a tripling of R&D spending in 2023 compared to 2020.\n\nModerna is also looking to use its available cash, $16.4B in Q1 2023, to acquire licenses from smaller biotech or directly acquire these companies. The focus seems to be on technology platforms, which include synthetic genome company OriCiro , metagenomics and AI gene discovery Metagenomi , and macrophage therapies Carisma Therapeutics .\n\nModerna is, for now, a mRNA company with strong prospects in infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases. In the long run, its collaboration with startups working on new biotech technologies could yield out-sized results, similar to how mRNA used to be just a theoretical concept for decades.",

Here are some reasons why these stocks make sense:\n\nReliable Income Stream: Regular dividend payouts can help cover living expenses, reducing reliance on savings or pensions. Potential for Growth: Many dividend stocks also offer long-term capital appreciation, making them a dual-purpose investment. Inflation Hedge: Rising dividends can protect against the eroding power of inflation, ensuring that your purchasing power remains intact.\n\nHowever, these investments are not without risk. Higher yields often signal potential volatility or declining stock value, so careful selection and diversification are essential. Retirees must also weigh the balance of growth and income based on their specific financial needs.\n\nTop Ultra-High Yield Dividend Stocks for 2025\n\n1. Altria Group Inc. (MO)\n\nAltria, one of the largest tobacco companies in the U.S., is known for its robust dividend yield of around 7.8%. Despite declining smoking rates, the company has managed to sustain and grow its payouts for over 50 consecutive years, earning it the prestigious Dividend King status. Altria\u2019s ability to navigate challenges within its industry and pivot to alternative markets, such as cannabis and smokeless products, showcases its resilience.\n\nKey Advantages : Diversification into smokeless products and cannabis. Strong financial performance with a focus on shareholder returns. Commitment to maintaining its reputation as a dividend leader.\n\n:\n\nFor retirees, Altria represents a reliable income source with the potential for modest capital gains.

(AGNC)\n\nAGNC is a mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) with an impressive dividend yield exceeding 13%. It specializes in residential mortgage-backed securities, benefiting from favorable interest rate conditions. While AGNC offers exceptional yields, retirees should be mindful of the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.\n\nKey Advantages : High yield supported by interest rate trends. Expertise in navigating the mortgage-backed securities market. Proven ability to adapt to shifting economic landscapes.\n\n:\n\nWhile AGNC\u2019s yield is extraordinarily high, retirees must weigh the risk-to-reward ratio carefully.

Consider these steps to evaluate potential investments:\n\nCheck Dividend Sustainability: Look for companies with a payout ratio below 70% to ensure dividends are sustainable and not overly reliant on borrowing. Analyze Financial Health: Review balance sheets and cash flow statements for signs of financial stability, focusing on metrics like debt-to-equity ratio. Understand Market Trends: Favor companies operating in growing or stable industries to mitigate potential risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid overconcentration by spreading investments across different sectors to manage risk and exposure. Consult Expert Resources: Platforms like U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Morningstar can provide in-depth analysis and ratings.\n\nFAQs About Ultra-High Yield Dividend Stocks\n\n1. What is a dividend yield?\n\nDividend yield is the percentage of a company\u2019s annual dividend relative to its stock price. For example, if a stock priced at $100 pays an annual dividend of $5, its yield is 5%.\n\n2. Are high dividend yields risky?\n\nHigher yields often indicate higher risk, such as financial instability or declining stock value. Always assess a company\u2019s fundamentals before investing.\n\n3. Can dividend stocks lose value?\n\nYes, like all equities, dividend stocks can lose value due to market fluctuations or poor company performance. It\u2019s essential to maintain a long-term perspective.\n\n4. How often are dividends paid?\n\nMost companies pay dividends quarterly, but some offer monthly or annual payouts. Check the company\u2019s dividend schedule before investing.\n\n5. What are Dividend Aristocrats and Kings?\n\nDividend Aristocrats are companies that have increased their dividends annually for at least 25 years. Dividend Kings have done so for 50+ years, representing the pinnacle of dividend reliability.",

            "content": "Analysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Pfizer Inc. (PFE) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 9.07\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical company mainly manufactures, markets, and sells related products worldwide. The company is prioritizing its oncology pipeline as a key driver of future growth, with plans to introduce several blockbuster drugs by 2030. To strengthen its portfolio, the company is expected to continue seeking acquisitions of promising pharmaceutical firms. A significant portion of its pandemic-related earnings was used to acquire Seagen, a biotech company specializing in oncology, for $43 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported a 12% operational revenue increase from its non-COVID products over the past year, highlighting its strategic focus on execution. The company successfully reached its $4 billion net cost savings target through an ongoing cost realignment program and has now raised its goal to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. Under its Manufacturing Optimization Program, Pfizer aims to achieve $1.5 billion in net cost savings by 2027, with initial savings expected in the latter half of 2025. The company remains confident in its ability to restore pre-pandemic operating margins in the years ahead.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, following a 2.4% increase in December 2024, marking its 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. With a dividend yield of 6.51%, as of February 26, PFE is a good investment option for income investors.\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 8th on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "It can be difficult to decide which dividend stocks to buy. After all, more than 5,700 of them trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nHowever, three Motley Fool contributors think they can make the decisions easier. They believe that three dividend stocks are no-brainer buys right now -- and all three are big healthcare stocks. Here's why they picked Johnson & Johnson (JNJ -0.11%), Novartis (NVS -0.05%), and Pfizer (PFE 0.47%).\n\nLook beyond the legal and regulatory troubles\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Johnson & Johnson): There is no denying that Johnson & Johnson has an incredible dividend record. The company has raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. However, some might argue the stock is no longer a good pick for income investors. Johnson & Johnson has encountered legal troubles in the form of thousands of lawsuits regarding its talc-based products, which, some plaintiffs allege, gave them cancer.\n\nThat's on top of the U.S. government's newly acquired regulatory authority to negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Some of Johnson & Johnson's medicines have already been targeted, and it will result in lower revenue for the company from these products.\n\nHowever, Johnson & Johnson remains a no-brainer dividend stock. Despite its legal issues, it has maintained its AAA rating from Standard & Poor, the highest credit rating available, and a sign of the strength of its balance sheet. Johnson & Johnson can take care of its financial obligations. That's the clear message. Further, the drugmaker has moved closer to solving its legal issues with a proposed solution via a subsidiary that will put more than 99% of these lawsuits to bed.\n\nMost plaintiffs are already on board, so even if it isn't a done deal, it's moving in that direction. Lastly, Johnson & Johnson should succeed in navigating the new regulatory regime in the U.S. For one, the company has a strong medical device unit that grants it some diversification. It isn't solely dependent on its pharmaceutical business. Second, Johnson & Johnson has survived and thrived through many regulatory changes that directly affected its business over 100 years of history.\n\nExpect the company to find ways to get around this issue in the long run. In short, Johnson & Johnson's underlying business remains strong -- and its dividend program about as safe as they come -- despite its recent headwinds. The stock is still an excellent pick for income-oriented investors.\n\nNovartis is a dependable, high-yielding stock to own for years\n\nDavid Jagielski (Novartis): Swiss pharma stock Novartis pays a high yield, offers steady growth, and is priced reasonably, making it a potential ideal option for income-seeking investors. At 3.5%, its dividend yield is more than twice the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. The company has increased its payout for 28 straight years and with a payout ratio of around 64%, there's still room for even more rate hikes in the future, especially as Novartis' growth continues.\n\nWhat's appealing about the business is that it's going after sustainable and modest single-digit growth of around 5% per year, through to 2029 (at constant exchange rates); it isn't taking on big risks and swinging for the fences. The company has a robust pipeline with more than 100 projects ongoing, spanning multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and others. Meanwhile, the business already has many high-growth products in its portfolio, including heart medication Entresto, which generated 31% revenue growth last year.\n\nNovartis may not be the flashiest stock, but that can make it an underrated buy as it trades at just 13 times its projected future earnings (based on analyst forecasts). With a modest valuation, investors are getting a good margin of safety with the stock while locking in a fairly high yield. If you're a dividend investor in search of a high payout that's safe and growing, Novartis looks like a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nAn ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a bargain\n\nKeith Speights (Pfizer): You won't find many dividend stocks in the healthcare sector with a juicier dividend than Pfizer. The big drugmaker's forward dividend yield is an ultra-high 6.5%. Is this dividend in jeopardy of being cut? Nope. Pfizer's management plans to maintain and grow the dividend payout.\n\nI think Pfizer will be able to deliver on this commitment. The company already has a solid track record of dividends -- 345 consecutive quarterly dividend payments and 16 years in a row of increasing the dividend.\n\nMore importantly, Pfizer should have the products needed to generate sufficient free cash flow to keep the dividends flowing and growing. Sure, the company's COVID-19 sales have plunged. And, yes, Pfizer faces a looming patent cliff with several top-selling products losing exclusivity. However, the big drugmaker also has multiple strong growth drivers, notably including cancer drugs Adcetris and Padcev and migraine therapy Nurtec ODT.\n\nThere's another reason to buy Pfizer stock in addition to its fantastic dividend, though: valuation. Pfizer's shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.07. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a super-low 0.18, according to LSEG. If Pfizer can deliver only modest growth (which I think it can), this ultra-high-yield dividend stock is a bona fide bargain.",

Call Sokolove Law now at (800) 995-1212 .\n\nFor decades, millions of women have relied on Depo-Provera \u00ae shots as a form of birth control. However, some patients who used the injectable contraceptive have reported Depo-Provera long-term side effects, like bone density loss and meningioma brain tumors.\n\nLong-Term Side Effects of Depo-Provera Injections\n\nDepo-Provera is a birth control shot that\u2019s given once every 3 months and works by delivering a synthetic hormone called medroxyprogesterone acetate into the body. However, Depo-Provera has been linked to serious long-term side effects.\n\nWhile some side effects of Depo-Provera may be considered manageable, others can have serious and even life-threatening consequences.\n\nLong-term side effects of the Depo injection may include:\n\nBrain tumors (meningiomas)\n\nDepression and anxiety\n\nHeadaches\n\nMood changes\n\nOsteoporosis (weakened bones)\n\nSeizures\n\nVision or hearing loss\n\nWomen who developed brain tumors after using Depo-Provera may be able to file a birth control shot lawsuit against Pfizer Inc., the drug\u2019s manufacturer. Depo-Provera lawsuits allege that Pfizer didn't properly warn patients about the risk of meningiomas.\n\nFind out more about the potential long-term side effects of Depo-Provera.\n\nBrain Tumors (Meningiomas)\n\nAnother serious side effect of the Depo shot is meningiomas, which are tumors that grow on the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord.\n\nMeningioma brain tumors may lead to serious neurological issues like:\n\nChanges in personality\n\nChronic headaches\n\nDizziness\n\nMental health disorders\n\nSeizures\n\nVision problems\n\nA March 2024 study found that using Depo-Provera for over a year increased the risk of meningiomas by over 5 times.\n\nEven though meningiomas are often benign, patients may need surgery or ongoing medical monitoring to protect their health.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, we can help affected patients file a Depo-Provera brain tumor lawsuit and pursue compensation for treatment costs, lost wages, and more.\n\nBone Density Loss\n\nDepo-Provera can significantly reduce bone mineral density, leading to a higher risk of fractures and osteoporosis. Young women may be more vulnerable to this long-term side effect of the Depo shot because their bones are still developing.\n\nA lack of sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake while using Depo-Provera may worsen this side effect.\n\nIn a past Depo shot class action lawsuit, Pfizer was ordered to pay over $2 Million in Depo-Provera settlements for failing to properly warn patients about the risk of bone mineral density loss.\n\nHeadaches\n\nDepo-Provera has been associated with an increased risk of headaches, ranging from mild discomfort to debilitating migraines. These headaches may result from hormonal changes and can significantly impact a patient\u2019s daily life.\n\nIf you experience persistent or severe headaches while using Depo-Provera, talk to your health care provider. In some cases, headaches may be an early symptom of a meningioma, which is linked to prolonged Depo-Provera use.\n\nCall (800) 995-1212 now if you or a loved one used Depo shots and have been diagnosed with a meningioma. It costs nothing to speak with us.\n\nMenstruation Issues\n\nDepo-Provera can cause irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, or even a complete stop of your menstrual period (amenorrhea). Over time, these imbalances may impact fertility, increase the risk of uterine health issues, or lead to endometrial changes that may require follow-up care.\n\nMood Changes\n\nSome patients may experience mood swings, anxiety, and depression from taking Depo-Provera. When left untreated, these mental health issues may interfere with daily activities and relationships.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing any changes or worsening of your mood, don\u2019t disregard your symptoms \u2014 speak with your health care professional. When meningiomas press on a certain part of the brain, they can cause neurological symptoms.\n\nSeizures\n\nSide effects of the birth control shot Depo-Provera also include an increased risk of seizures, particularly in patients with a history of neurological conditions or other predisposing factors.\n\nThe synthetic hormones in the injection may contribute to changes in brain activity, potentially triggering seizures in susceptible users.\n\nIf you began experiencing seizures after using Depo-Provera, contact your doctor to figure out the cause. Seizures could also be a sign of a meningioma, which has been linked to prolonged use of Depo-Provera.\n\nFiling a Depo-Provera Long-Term Side Effects Lawsuit\n\nWhile the Depo-Provera warning label includes some long-term side effects, Pfizer failed to make patients aware of potential complications like meningioma brain tumors.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company warned Canadian users about the risk of meningiomas but didn\u2019t list this potential side effect on the drug\u2019s warning label for American patients.\n\nAnyone who used Depo-Provera, Depo-SubQ Provera 104, or an authorized generic for over a year and developed a meningioma may be able to file a Depo shot lawsuit. This includes women who used the injectable contraception years ago.\n\nHowever, victims only have a limited amount of time to take legal action due to state laws called statutes of limitations, so it\u2019s important to act quickly.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, we can handle every step of a Depo-Provera long-term side effects lawsuit for patients diagnosed with a meningioma.

We\u2019ll explore billion-dollar acquisitions that redefined companies, like Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s $74 billion takeover of Celgene, and massive failures, like Pfizer\u2019s attempt to buy AstraZeneca for $118 billion. But big money doesn\u2019t always mean big success. As Eikon Therapeutics raises $350 million for Phase III melanoma trials and Bluebird Bio goes private in a $30 million deal, the biotech industry continues to be a high-stakes game of risk and reward. With Congress reintroducing the EPIC Act and the fight over IRA pricing rules heating up, today\u2019s discussion isn\u2019t just about past deals\u2014it\u2019s about what\u2019s next.

Call (800) 995-1212 now to see if we may be able to help you too.\n\nThe statute of limitations on Depo-Provera \u00ae claims is a deadline that determines how long you have to take legal action for a brain tumor caused by the birth control shot. In some states, you may have as little as 1 year to file a Depo-Provera lawsuit.\n\nHow Long Do I Have to File a Depo Shot Claim?\n\nDepo-Provera lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer Inc., alleging the company didn't adequately warn patients about the risk of meningioma brain tumors associated with long-term use of the Depo shot.\n\nIn October 2024, the first Depo-Provera shot lawsuit was filed by a patient who used this birth control from 2005 to 2021. Since then, women across the country have followed suit, seeking to hold Pfizer accountable and secure compensation.\n\nThere\u2019s only a limited amount of time to file a Depo shot claim due to laws called statutes of limitations. The statute of limitations for Depo-Provera lawsuits typically ranges from 2-3 years, but in some states, victims may have as little as 1 year after their brain tumor diagnosis to take action.\n\nIt\u2019s important to reach out to our team as soon as possible, so you don\u2019t miss your chance to pursue the justice and compensation you deserve.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, we'll handle every step of the process for you, so you can focus on your health and go about your daily routine.\n\nLet Sokolove Law Fight for You We've secured over $1.6 Billion for patients harmed by dangerous drugs and medical devices. Let us get you the money you deserve. Get a Free Case Review Now\n\nDepo Shot Lawsuit Deadlines in All 50 States\n\nEach state has its own laws that determine how long you have to take legal action for an injury related to a dangerous drug. An experienced attorney can explain the statute of limitations for Depo-Provera lawsuits in your state and act quickly to ensure your claim is filed in time.\n\nEven if you think the deadline in your case has passed, a Depo-Provera lawyer may still be able to help with your claim.\n\nFind out about the Depo-Provera statute of limitations in each state below.\n\nState Depo Shot Lawsuit Deadline Alabama 2 years Alaska 2 years Arizona 2 years Arkansas 3 years California 2 years Colorado 2 years Connecticut 3 years Delaware 2 years Florida 4 years Georgia 2 years Hawaii 2 years Idaho 2 years Illinois 2 years Indiana 2 years Iowa 2 years Kansas 2 years Kentucky 1 year Louisiana 1 year Maine 6 years Maryland 3 years Massachusetts 3 years Michigan 3 years Minnesota 6 years Mississippi 3 years Missouri 5 years Montana 3 years Nebraska 4 years Nevada 2 years New Hampshire 3 years New Jersey 2 years New Mexico 3 years New York 3 years North Carolina 3 years North Dakota 6 years Ohio 2 years Oklahoma 2 years Oregon 2 years Pennsylvania 2 years Rhode Island 3 years South Carolina 3 years South Dakota 3 years Tennessee 1 year Texas 2 years Utah 2 years Vermont 3 years Virginia 2 years Washington 3 years West Virginia 2 years Wisconsin 3 years Wyoming 4 years\n\nStatutes of limitations can be challenging to navigate without the help of an attorney. This is especially true in Depo shot cases, as many women who used the birth control years ago have only recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n\nOur Depo-Provera lawyers can determine the specific deadline in your case and identify any exceptions that could provide you with more time to file a claim.\n\nGet a free case review now to find out if we may be able to file a claim on your behalf \u2014 before it\u2019s too late.\n\nWhat the Statute of Limitations on Depo-Provera Means for You\n\nYou must file your lawsuit before the Depo shot statute of limitations in order to seek the compensation and justice you deserve.\n\nEach state has its own statute of limitations for Depo-Provera claims, so it\u2019s important to understand the deadline that applies in your case.\n\nWhile some states may allow upwards of 6 years to file a lawsuit, others may only provide 1 year after a diagnosis to take legal action.\n\nThe statute of limitations in Depo-Provera cases means that you:\n\nOnly have a limited amount of time to file a lawsuit and seek a Depo shot settlement\n\nCould miss out on money you may be entitled to if you wait too long\n\nShould start your claim immediately to pursue compensation for your medical expenses\n\nYour eligibility to take action hinges on filing before the deadline: If the deadline passes in your case, you may lose the ability to file a lawsuit against Pfizer for your meningioma diagnosis.\n\nDon\u2019t delay: Call (800) 995-1212 now to see if you may be able to pursue compensation for a meningioma. It costs nothing to speak with us.\n\n\u201cHiring Sokolove Law was the smartest thing we ever did. Filing the lawsuit was easy because the firm made it easy. We didn\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John, Firm Client\n\nDiscovery Rule for Depo Shot Lawsuits\n\nSome states have a discovery rule that applies to dangerous drug lawsuits like those being filed against Pfizer, which may give patients more time to take legal action.\n\nBecause the link between Depo-Provera and meningiomas wasn\u2019t established until the March 2024 study, the statute of limitations for these cases may not start until that date, even if you took the drug decades ago.\n\nThe discovery rule may allow the statute of limitations to start when you discover \u2014 or should\u2019ve reasonably discovered \u2014 the connection between your brain tumor and the Depo shot, rather than when you were first diagnosed.\n\nThis is especially important in Depo-Provera cases, as some women took this medication for many years before being diagnosed with a meningioma. This rule allows them to file a claim once they become aware of the injury and its cause.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, our Depo-Provera lawyers can review the facts of your case, go over your legal options, and act quickly to file your Depo shot lawsuit on time if you qualify.\n\nGet a free case review now to see if you may be eligible for compensation from a Depo-Provera lawsuit.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, Sokolove Law treated me with respect and compassion, recognizing the gravity of my circumstances and the impact it had on my family's well-being. Their unwavering dedication paid off, and they secured a favorable resolution in my case.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Firm Client in New York\n\nSokolove Law: Our Depo Shot Lawyers Can Help Nationwide\n\nWhen looking for a Depo-Provera lawyer, it\u2019s important to find someone who has the experience and resources needed to stand up to a powerful pharmaceutical company like Pfizer.\n\nAt Sokolove Law, we\u2019ve secured over $1.6 Billion for families across the country harmed by dangerous drugs and medical devices.\n\nOur Depo-Provera lawyers:\n\nCan help women in all 50 states\n\nHave over 45 years of experience fighting for victims of injustice\n\nNever charge any upfront costs or hourly fees\n\nCall (800) 995-1212 now or fill out our contact form to take the first step toward the compensation and justice you deserve.\n\nDepo-Provera Statute of Limitation FAQs",

Check out The OncFive, from our sister publication OncLive.\n\nTop News for Healthcare Providers from the Week of 02/23\n\n1. FDA Approves Expanded Use of Buprenorphine Extended-Release Injection for OUD Treatment\n\nOn February 24, 2025, Indivior announced the FDA approved a prior supplement submission for buprenorphine extended-release injection (SUBLOCADE) for opioid use disorder (OUD). The approval expands the injection site options and reduces induction time, allowing for faster treatment initiation. These updates aim to improve patient adherence and outcomes while maintaining the therapy\u2019s established efficacy and safety profile.\n\n2. Pfizer Drops Approved Hemophilia B Gene Therapy\n\nOn February 21, 2025, Pfizer announced it is discontinuing the development and commercialization of fidanacogene elaparvovec (Beqvez) for hemophilia B, less than a year after its FDA approval. The decision was attributed to limited market interest in gene therapies for hemophilia, with no patients having received the $3.5 million therapy commercially. This move follows Pfizer\u2019s broader retreat from gene therapy, including halting other investigational programs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia A.\n\n3. FDA Accepts Roflumilast Cream sNDA in Atopic Dermatitis for Ages 2-5 Years\n\nOn February 26, 2025, Arcutis Biotherapeutics announced the FDA accepted its sNDA for roflumilast cream 0.05% (Zoryve) for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children aged 2 to 5 years, with a PDUFA target action date of October 13, 2025. The application is supported by positive data from the phase 3 INTEGUMENT-PED trial, demonstrating significant efficacy and a favorable safety profile. If approved, roflumilast cream would offer a steroid-free, once-daily topical treatment option for young children with atopic dermatitis.\n\n4. Phase 3 Data Supports Sebetralstat Efficacy for HAE Attacks Ahead of PDUFA Date\n\nFindings from the phase 3 KONFIDENT and KONFIDENT-S trials presented at the 2025 AAAAI/WAO Joint Congress showed oral sebetralstat was rapidly administered and provided quick symptom relief in adolescents with hereditary angioedema-C1INH. The positive data support its potential approval as the first oral on-demand treatment for HAE. In September 2024, KalVista Pharmaceuticals announced the FDA accepted its NDA for sebetralstat for on-demand treatment of hereditary angioedema, with a PDUFA goal date of June 17, 2025.\n\n5. FDA Accepts sNDA for Risperidone Extended-Release Injectable Suspension for Bipolar I Disorder\n\nOn February 25, 2025, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Medincell announced the FDA accepted their sNDA for risperidone (UZEDY) extended-release injectable suspension for adults with bipolar I disorder. The application is based on existing risperidone data and prior evidence supporting risperidone\u2019s use in bipolar I disorder. If approved, risperidone would offer a long-acting treatment option aimed at improving adherence in this patient population.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other best vaccine store stocks to buy now.\n\nWhat Will Trump\u2019s Tariffs Mean for the Pharma Industry?\n\nOn February 24, CNBC reported that President Trump declared that sweeping US tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada \u201cwill go forward\u201d in a statement before the expiry of their month-long delay on their implementation. When asked about the postponed tariffs at a White House press conference, President Trump said:\n\n\u201cThe tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that foreign nations have been taking advantage of the US in \u201cjust about everything,\u201d reiterating his plans to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the tariffs will go forward, yes, and we\u2019re going to make up a lot of territory,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn February 21, Jared Holz, Mizuho Securities America\u2019s healthcare sector strategist, appeared on CNBC to talk about these tariffs and the ways they could affect the US pharmaceutical sector. Although he was unclear about the exact intention behind these tariffs, he said that he did not consider the pharmaceutical industry to be all that special with respect to other verticals, including technology and industrials, such that President Trump would intend to enlarge its presence in the US.\n\nTo him, the tariffs are not just about the generics or branded but are rather more about how the biotech or pharmaceutical industry fits into the grander plans around scaling up domestic manufacturing. Most biotech and pharma companies have a significant presence in the US. However, questions of whether they will hire more people in the US compared to Europe or Asia and whether they will bring back more business to America still stand without answers.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Performing Pharma Stocks So Far in 2025 and 10 Oversold Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nTariffs and On-Shore Capacity in the US\n\nAlthough Holz was unclear about the answers to such questions, he did say that anything coming out of Europe or China would obviously be fair game. The pharmaceutical companies would say that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as part of the Biden administration is incredibly crippling, and the business that needs to be tied up to make the earnings based on that is very challenging for the sector. Adding Trump\u2019s tariffs to the list would complicate the sector possibly more than others, with the tariffs acting as a \u201cthird strike\u201d against the US pharma sector.",

The company also added a new sentence to the page\u2019s introduction paragraph: \u201cOur culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is based on merit\u2014one where hard work, talent, and contributions drive success, and barriers to opportunity are removed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther sections of the webpage underwent similar changes. A section previously titled \u201cDiversity in Our Global Supply\u201d has been renamed \u201cInclusive Supplier Strategy.\u201d The paragraph under this heading now states, \u201cAll areas of our business groups are dedicated to finding and selecting the best suppliers,\u201d replacing the previous language that emphasized advancing DEI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. However, a company spokesperson told STAT News, which first reported the changes, \u201cWe constantly update and evolve the content and design of our website to reflect our current programs, initiatives, and commitments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe changes come as the pharma industry is recalibrating its public approach to DEI and aligning itself closer to the new administration. CEOs of major drugmakers reportedly met with Trump earlier this month. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Biogen (BIIB) have also recently removed references to DEI from their annual reports, according to Bloomberg. The Trump administration is attempting to eliminate diversity programs across public and private sectors, including at public schools and in the military.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly (LLY) CEO David Ricks, alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, announced this week that the company plans to invest $27 billion in four new manufacturing sites in the United States. In an interview on Wednesday, the executive simultaneously called for \u201cextended or improved\u201d tax cuts.",

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Pfizer has been doing relatively well. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nDoes Growth Match The P/E?\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nPfizer's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 274%. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 65% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 16% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nIn light of this, it's curious that Pfizer's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently some shareholders are skeptical of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Pfizer's P/E\n\nGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\n\nWe've established that Pfizer currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is higher than the wider market. When we see a strong earnings outlook with faster-than-market growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you need to take into consideration.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nFrom a certain perspective, domestic equities are off to a strong start this year. Despite a large selloff on February 21, the S&P 500 has gained a healthy 2.2% in less than two months, and the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average are not far behind. If they can keep this momentum going, they're probably in for another successful year. Looking at the market in detail however, US stock indexes appear to be riding the coattails of the significant lead they built up after Trump's election on November 5 last year, much unlike their overseas competitors. According to JPMorgan, the relative underperformance of US stocks this year represents a 10% - 20% reversal of the pro-US investment pattern seen from April 2023 until the end of last year. Furthermore, the current excitement around Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has caused investors to reconsider US equity values, making Chinese tech stocks more tempting in the short term.\n\nInflation expectations have also risen, with the one-year projected inflation rate for US consumers rising to 4.3% in February from 3.3% in January. This increase in inflation expectations, along with a slowing economy, has sparked fears about stagflation, which is characterized as stalled growth and rising prices. According to a Bank of America poll of global fund managers published on February 18, the number of investors expecting stagflation in the coming year has hit a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, perceiving a trade war as a low-probability risk.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to rule out US stocks completely, given that US shares outperformed their international counterparts from the 2008 financial crisis to the end of 2024. Although international markets appear to be the hot place to be right now, analysts have much to like about US equities, particularly as S&P 500 companies report their most profitable quarter in years, with Wall Street projecting double-digit profit growth this year. According to Richard Ward, Chief Investment Officer of Curated Wealth Partners, overseas companies have performed better recently because stock pickers are seeking for bargains, not because of their fundamentals. Ward believes that investors should stay in US markets and look towards lower-cost sectors such as small caps and financials instead. He added:",

In 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech partnership swooped in as a saviour with their covid-19 mRNA vaccine, Comirnaty. It was one of the first vaccines to receive emergency approval during the pandemic, and Pfizer quickly followed it up with its antiviral drug Paxlovid.\n\nThis Covid portfolio was supposed to take the company to new heights.\n\nHowever, the all-or-nothing strategy has taken Pfizer downhill in recent years. To quote its chief executive, the \u201cpride of the pharmaceutical industry\" has \u201cended up in a situation that very rapidly deteriorated\".\n\nHow the covid boom gave way to a deep slump\n\nThe covid boom flushed the company with cash, which the Seattle-headquartered global biotechnology company deployed towards a string of new deals. In fact, against a combined covid portfolio sales of $56 billion in 2022, Pfizer signed deals worth a whopping $70 billion. Apart from the mega $43 billion deal for oncology pioneer Seagan in 2023, the deals included the $11.6 billion acquisition of migraine drug maker Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. Ltd and the $5.4 billion acquisition of Global Blood Therapeutics Inc., which manufactures drugs for sickle cell anemia.\n\nBut as the pandemic ebbed, Pfizer\u2019s covid portfolio sales dwindled from a peak of $56 billion in 2022 to $9 billion in 2024. Also, its new deals were not exactly playing out as expected. The sickle cell anemia drug had to be recalled after clinical trials uncovered higher mortality rates, the efficacy of the migraine drugs was nothing to write home about, and Pfizer\u2019s dreams with obesity drugs got sidetracked after discovering serious side effects.\n\nIt can be argued that many of Pfizer\u2019s deals were miscalculated and may turn out to be funds down the drain. An activist investor, Starboard has been challenging management on these capital allocation decisions. Investors, in general, have also lost patience.\n\nNYSE-listed Pfizer Inc. has corrected by more than 50% from its peak in 2021. NSE-listed Pfizer Ltd, in which the global parent has a 64% stake, has had a similar journey. Of course, the NSE stock has been coloured by local factors such as currency-depreciation tailwinds and headwinds from the FII sell-off since September 2024.\n\nAre things looking up?\n\nOne of Pfizer\u2019s largest deals has been the acquisition of Seagen in 2023 for $43 billion. And from the looks of it, this may very well be the deal reviving Pfizer\u2019s fortunes. In response to the deal (among other things), Pfizer Ltd\u2019s stock had appreciated by 74% to peak at \u20b96,164 apiece in September 2024.\n\nIn the quarter ended December 2024, $1 billion of Pfizer\u2019s $4 billion oncology-driven revenue had come from Seagen. In fact, buoyed by Pfizer\u2019s scale, Seagan\u2019s 33% share in FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology is expected to contribute $10 billion to Pfizer\u2019s risk-adjusted revenues in 2030.\n\nEven excluding Seagan, Pfizer\u2019s oncology portfolio has been rising from strength to strength. Its cancer drug Xtandi, which received NMPA approval in July 2024, clocked more than $500 million in revenues in the quarter ended December 2024. Furthermore, the combination of Xtandi and Talzenna has been proven to improve survival by 9-14 months, and the FDA has approved Pfizer-Astella\u2019s Padcev for the treatment of typically unresponsive refractory lymphomas.\n\nBraftovi and Mektovi, cancer drugs for which Pfizer has exclusive rights in the US, Canada, and certain emerging markets, have witnessed 65% year-on-year sales growth.\n\nThanks to these positive developments in its oncology portfolio, along with a seasonal uptick in its covid portfolio sales to $4.1 billion, Pfizer has been able to report revenue growth for two consecutive quarters now. Full-year revenues came in at $63.6 billion, having witnessed 12% year-on-year growth even after excluding the seasonally higher growth seen in its covid portfolio. Supported by significant developments in its internal medicine and oncology R&D pipelines, the company has reaffirmed its revenue guidance of $61-64 billion for 2026.\n\nMore recently and closer home, Pfizer Ltd surged by 9% intraday on Monday, shining bright against the gloomy backdrop of the 1% correction in the broader Nifty 50 index. The optimistic turn in sentiment was brought about by the company\u2019s board approval for a marketing and supply partnership with Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nUnder the agreement, the companies will jointly market and sell Ativan and Pacitane in India. Given Mylan\u2019s established networks with super-specialists in central nervous system therapy, the partnership is expected to help Pfizer enhance its distribution and in-clinic presence.\n\nAre Pfizer\u2019s corrective steps sufficient?\n\nIn what can be perceived as an acknowledgement of indiscriminate acquisitions during the covid windfall, Pfizer has shifted focus to cost-cutting in the last couple of years. Costs were cut by $4 billion, and debt was paid down by $7.8 billion in 2024. This has not come at the cost of R&D expenses, which have grown by about 6% over last year to $3 billion in the three months ended December 2024.\n\nDividend payouts have also continued during the year. The company has also shaken up its leadership by promoting its Oncology chief to the position of chief scientific officer, thereby reiterating Pfizer\u2019s commitment to growing its oncology portfolio. A new chief strategy and innovation officer and two new board members have also been instated.\n\nNotwithstanding these corrective steps, in addition to the deals gone wrong, Pfizer has been falling behind competition in a tough regulatory environment. It lost the RSV vaccine race to GSK even as the CDC\u2019s revised RSV recommendations shrunk the RSV market in the US. It also gave up control of a bowel control drug before it could bear fruit.\n\nIt has also lost exclusivity in Canada, while some of Pfizer\u2019s key drug trials failed and had to be withdrawn from the markets. Furthermore, its patents for sale of Eliquis and Prevnar are slated to expire in 2026, which is expected to impact more than 10% of its revenues.\n\nThe company also has a kitty of $10 billion to fuel further inorganic expansion, the fate of which is a matter of conjecture.\n\nFinally, in terms of macro impact, former US President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has been squeezing the margins of pharma companies. Matters have been made worse by a change in the US presidency and anticipated cuts in government funding for biopharma research.\n\nConspiracy theories in the US around vaccines, the newly appointed US health secretary who holds an \u201canti-vaccine\" view, and a growing resentment of US citizens towards healthcare and insurance industries have also added fuel to the fire. While the president\u2019s and health secretary\u2019s meetings with the who\u2019s who of the pharma industry lend some hope, the US president's turn is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nFor more such analyses, read Profit Pulse.\n\nAnanya Roy is the founder of Credibull Capital, a SEBI-registered investment adviser.

They found that patients suffering from it have reduced amounts of white blood cells and lower levels of naturally produced antibodies that combat the virus.\n\n\"I've never been more wrong about anything. That is the No. 1 thing I've been wrong about,\" said Ms Kelly of her decision to take the vaccine and booster.\n\nDr Malhotra, a COVID-19 vaccine sceptic with ties to Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

(Source: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (fda.gov))\n\nQ: How did the FDA arrive at the decision to approve COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA)? What is\n\ndifferent now when compared to the December 2020 authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?\n\nA: FDA conducted a thorough evaluation of the data and information submitted in the Biologics License Application (BLA) for COMIRNATY before making a determination that the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. (Source: Q&A for COMIRNATY(COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA) | FDA)\n\nQ: How is COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) related to the PFIZER-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?\n\nA: They are the same. The FDA-approved Pfizer-BioNTech product COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under EUA have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID-19 vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. Therefore, providers can use doses distributed under EUA to administer the vaccination series as if the doses were the licensed vaccine. For purposes of administration, doses distributed under the EUA are interchangeable with the licensed doses. The Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers provides additional information about both the approved and authorized vaccine. (Source: Q&A for COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA) | FDA)\n\nQ: Will the emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine remain in effect\n\nafter the approval?\n\nA: Yes. The EUA remains in effect for the two dose primary series in individuals 12 years of and older and as a third primary dose for individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. Additionally, the FDA authorized the vaccine for emergency use to allow for a single booster dose administered at least 6 months after completion of the vaccination primary series in certain populations. (Source: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/qa-comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-mrna)\n\nQ. If I received one manufacturer for Dose 1, can I receive a different manufacturer for Dose 2 and be considered complete? Ex: Dose 1 was Moderna, but can Dose 2 be Pfizer/COMIRNATY?\n\nA. Yes, Mixing the vaccines will result in a completed/compliant series. It is recommended to make EVERY EFFORT to immunize the patient with the same product, when giving a series. There is little to no safety data to support the use of mixed series. It is in the patient\u2019s interest to receive a single manufacturer for their vaccination series to ensure the best response (as has been studied to date). A VAERS report should be completed if a mixed series is performed for any reason. Reference the following website for the latest information as recommendations have been changing with each CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid- 19-vaccines us.html. The following is a useful poster on deviations: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/covid19-vaccine-errors-deviations- poster.pdf\n\nQ. Are the COVID-19 vaccines rigorously tested?\n\nA. Yes. Clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in tens of thousands of study participants to generate the scientific data and other information needed by FDA to determine safety and effectiveness. These clinical trials are being conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by the FDA. (Source: Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. How is it that COVID-19 vaccines have been developed so quickly?\n\nA. In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. Efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety. Recognizing the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines, the FDA is utilizing its various authorities and expertise to facilitate the expeditious development and availability of vaccines that have met the agency\u2019s rigorous and science-based standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness. Early in a public health crisis, FDA provides clear communication to the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to the scientific data and information needed to ensure development of vaccines and works quickly to provide advice on their proposed development plans and assessment of the data that are generated.\n\n(Source: Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. What are the plans for continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA for emergency\n\nuse?\n\nA. FDA expects vaccine manufacturers to include in their EUA requests a plan for active follow-up for safety, including deaths, hospitalizations, and other serious or clinically significant adverse events, among individuals who receive the vaccine under an EUA, to inform ongoing benefit-risk determinations to support continuation of the EUA. FDA also expects manufacturers who receive an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue licensure (approval). Post-authorization vaccine safety monitoring is a federal government responsibility shared primarily by FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other agencies involved in healthcare delivery. The U.S. government \u2013 in partnership with health systems, academic centers, and private sector partners \u2013 will use multiple existing vaccine safety monitoring systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines in the post-authorization/approval period. Some of these systems are the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative, and Medicare claims data. (Source: Emergency Use Authorization for\n\nVaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. What is V-safe and how do I participate in it?\n\nA. V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Through v-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Depending on your answers to the web surveys, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information. V-safe will also remind you to get your second COVID-19 vaccine dose if you need one. Once you get a COVID-19\n\nvaccine, you can enroll in v-safe using your smartphone. Your healthcare provider will give you an information sheet on v-safe that explains how to register and get started. V-safe is free to use \u2014 you will need a smartphone with a modern browser and access to the internet to participate. Participation is voluntary and you can opt out at any time. To opt out, simply text \u201cSTOP\u201d when v-safe sends you a text message. You can also start v-safe again by texting \u201cSTART.\u201d Note: V-safe cannot schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments, nor serve as an official record of being vaccinated against COVID-19. You will receive a COVID-19 vaccination card at your vaccination appointment. V-safe does not provide medical advice. If you have symptoms or health problems that concern you at any time following COVID-19 vaccination, please contact your healthcare provider. (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html)\n\nQ. How do we know the vaccine is safe given the speed of vaccine development and rollout?\n\nA. Key Points about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC:\n\n\u2022 Millions of people in the United States and around the world have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\n\n\u2022 The United States is using established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.\n\n\u2022 Results from U.S. and global monitoring efforts are reassuring. No unexpected patterns of reactions or other safety concerns have been identified during early vaccine safety monitoring. And, if they show up, we have systems in place to quickly identify them and take action.\n\n\u2022 All of the currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines, have been carefully reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA is responsible for reviewing all safety data from clinical trials to determine if the expected benefits of vaccination outweigh potential risks.\n\n\u2022 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed all safety data before recommending the current COVID-19 vaccines for use.\n\n(Source: Answering Patients\u2019 Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination | CDC)\n\nQ. If I experience medical complications from the COVID-19 vaccine, will the VA cover it?\n\nA. If the vaccine caused a chronic disability in active service, the VA would consider that under the general principles for service connection. Whether the vaccine is only approved for emergency-use is not a factor the VA would consider. (Source: VA SME)\n\nQ. Can I get multiple vaccines in one visit to the doctor?\n\nA. The COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines may be administered on the same day with exception of the live smallpox vaccine. (Source, CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/adolescent-easyread.html) Per the updated 7 Oct 2021 Assistant Secretary of Defense Health Affairs Co-Administration Guidance memo, the available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccine products (i.e., Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY\u00ae) vaccines) may be co-administered with other vaccines without regard to timing, with the exception of the live smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000\u2122). Members should always check with their provider on which tests they can get before, during or after an appointment for COVID-19 vaccination. The TB test is authorized before, during or after a COVID-19 vaccination appointment.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against other best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nAfter much suspense, the US Federal Reserve finally began cutting interest rates in late 2024, dropping the federal funds rate by 75 basis points in two cuts in September and November, with the market expecting further cuts this year. The Fed\u2019s decision came in reaction to falling US inflation and employment market statistics, which suggested that the elusive soft landing was still within reach. However, as February comes to a close, things appear to have changed. For the time being, the Federal Open Market Committee is projected to leave interest rates unchanged on March 19. That\u2019s because the labor market looks to be strong, and inflation is still over goal and slightly increasing. The FOMC\u2019s most recent meeting in January also said that \u201crespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed,\u201d implying that any reduction (if at all) will occur sometime later in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the 65-and-older population in the United States will grow from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050, when it is expected to account for more than a quarter of the total population. The World Economic Forum further predicts that half of kids born in the United States in 2007 would survive to the age of 103. As such, wages seem to be falling behind inflation as people live longer lives. That\u2019s especially true now that businesses have moved the burden of retirement savings to employees, giving 401(k)s instead of pensions that promise a fixed income each month.\n\nOne dilemma many face as they approach retirement is how much money they will need to live comfortably when they stop working. According to Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the average retiree household in the United States spends around $5,000 per month. With a median 401(k) balance of $210,724 for those aged 60 to 69, implementing the 4% withdrawal rule yields around $702 per month\u2014which, when combined with the average monthly Social Security payment of $1,976, still falls short of meeting basic needs. According to Dan Doonan, executive director of the National Institute on Retirement Security, non-wealthy workers still have insufficient retirement coverage, forcing them to save on their own:\n\n\u201cIn general, we\u2019re just asking way too much of individuals to get all this right. And saving during the middle years of your life to provide income throughout retirement, it really is a challenging endeavor.\u201d\n\nConversely, Doonan believes that a more streamlined network of retirement schemes across the country can help private-sector companies reduce employee turnover. In addition, Congress has already taken its own steps, passing laws like the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which alters federal retirement plan rules with the purpose of boosting access. According to Doonan, these revisions may encourage more employees to save in accounts similar to pensions.\n\nIn addition, retirees should monitor the equities market, which soared in 2023 and 2024, propelled by technology companies and optimism about AI-related advancements. According to FactSet statistics, the S&P 500 is predicted to expand by double digits this year, at a rate of 14.8%. This would outperform the trailing 10-year average of 8% profit growth. Furthermore, this strong performance may prove to be more significant than the Fed\u2019s interest rate forecast. Regarding this, Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, said the following:\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate 2025 is likely to be more volatile than the remarkably low volatility environment of 2024, the fundamentals remain supportive for both equities and fixed-income assets. And it\u2019s those fundamentals that matter more for the outlook than the exact number of cuts.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best retirement stocks, we used stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to find large companies with low beta values, a history of reliable dividend payments, and well-established businesses. These equities were then rated using hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nBeta Value: 0.58\n\nDividend Yield: 6.54%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 92\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a leading global pharmaceutical company that develops, produces, and sells biopharmaceutical medicines worldwide.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced full-year 2024 revenues of $63.6 billion, representing a 7% year-over-year operational rise; removing contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty, revenues increased 12% operationally.\n\nOn February 11, Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari increased Pfizer Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:PFE) price objective from $33 to $34, while keeping a Buy rating on the stock. The shift occurred following the release of Pfizer\u2019s abstract on mevrometostat (EZH2i) at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary conference. Tewari added that the new findings might have a positive impact on Pfizer\u2019s ongoing Phase 3 studies in both post-abiraterone and first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) circumstances.\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 3rd on our list of best retirement stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Megyn Kelly has sensationally claimed she was injured by the Pfizer Covid vaccine.\n\nOn the latest episode of her podcast, the conservative commentator said she developed an 'unspecified autoimmune condition' after getting two shots and a booster.\n\nShe told Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist with ties to RFK Jr, that doctors were unable to determine which specific disorder she has, but that they said it could be linked to the vaccine.\n\nThe 54-year-old told an audibly shocked Dr Malhotra: 'I asked the rheumatologist if it could be linked to the Pfizer vaccine and booster, and she said \"Yes, and you're not the only patient I have who's had this sequence of events.\"\n\n'I wish I hadn't done it [gotten vaccinated], but I did.' Kelly also revealed that thinking the Covid vaccine was safe was 'the number one thing I've been wrong about.'\n\nThe CDC still recommends the vaccines for children and adults, saying the protection against Covid still outweighs the tiny risk of side effects.\n\nIt comes after a bombshell Yale University study found mRNA Covid vaccines are linked to a previously unknown condition called 'post-vaccination syndrome' (PVS).\n\nThe small study found patients with PVS showed distinct biological changes to their immune systems. But t he Yale experts told DailyMail.com that the results are 'still a work in progress,' and it's unclear how common PVS is.\n\nMegyn Kelly, pictured here on her podcast, claims that she suffered an autoimmune injury from her Covid vaccine\n\nDr Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist being eyed for a top advisory role alongside RFK Jr, reacted to Kelly's vaccine injury with horror\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nExperts estimate the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines have saved millions of lives globally, including 3million in the US.\n\nThe risk of severe side effects is estimated to be around one in 50,000\n\nCovid is still killing about 300 Americans every week, CDC data shows.\n\nKelly did not specify her symptoms or the impact the diagnosis has had on her.\n\nBut the most common symptoms linked to the newly-identified PVS are brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus, heart palpitations and exercise intolerance, a feeling of exhaustion after limited exercise.\n\nIn these rare cases, the vaccine also appears to awaken a dormant virus known as Epstein\u2013Barr and interfere with people's immune systems in complicated ways still being studied.\n\nMeanwhile, people with PVS had high levels of coronavirus spike proteins in their blood, years after taking the shot, which could leave their bodies in a permanent state of inflammation.\n\nDr Malhotra - who has been accused of spreading misinformation for his claim that the Covid vaccine has killed scores of young people - told DailyMail.com following the interview: 'The fact that one of the United States' most popular public figures only just opened up about being vaccine-injured, feeling safe to discuss it with a doctor who understands the situation, suggests that many, perhaps millions of Americans are suffering in silence.'\n\nDr Malhotra revealed that he believes his autoimmune condition was also caused by the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nAbout two-and-a-half years after getting his second dose, Dr Malhotra was diagnosed with psoriasis, which causes red, scaly patches to form on the skin.\n\nThe condition, suffered by 7million Americans, is thought to be caused by an immune overreaction, resulting in an overgrowth of skin cells.\n\nPsoriasis causes Dr Malhotra's to break out into lumpy, itchy rashes, and he needs to regularly apply antibiotic ointments to keep it from flaring.\n\nDr Malhotra told DailyMail.com he believes his autoimmune condition psoriasis (pictured here) was caused by his Pfizer Covid vaccine\n\nDr Malhotra sought medical help from gastroenterologist Dr Sabine Hazan, whose research suggests Covid vaccines strip the body of the healthy bacterium Bifidobacterium.\n\nBifidobacterium is thought to boost immune cell production.\n\nDr Malhotra told DailyMail.com: 'She did a microbiome test on me and discovered I had zero Bifidobacterium, one of the most important gut bacteria for health.'\n\nHowever, while some case reports have detailed cases of psoriasis occurring after Covid vaccination, research is mixed, and the condition has never directly been linked to vaccines.\n\nResearch on vaccine side effects is still emerging, and CDC still recommends Covid vaccines and boosters, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised, as they could be more vulnerable to the disease.\n\nOnly two long-term side effects have been directly linked to the Covid vaccine: anaphylaxis and two types of heart damage called myocarditis and pericarditis.\n\nIn myocarditis, it's thought that the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium, the heart's muscle.\n\nThis same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis, which leads to inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart.\n\nBoth conditions have been linked to viruses like the common cold and hepatitis, as well as Covid.\n\nWhile most cases are mild, in rare instances, the conditions can damage the heart and make it difficult for it to pump blood, eventually leading to heart failure, heart attack, and stroke.\n\nIn the US, myocarditis and pericarditis are rare, with estimates ranging from one in 50,000 to one in 200,000 Americans.\n\nFederal data also shows the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself was far higher than that from a vaccine, so experts continued to recommend the vaccines.\n\nAutoimmune diseases have also been linked more consistently to long Covid than the vaccine, so if a person has had Covid, it can be difficult to determine if their side effects were from the virus or the vaccine.",

            "content": "Every drug approval is a monumental occasion worthy of celebration. But for SpringWorks Therapeutics, the approval of rare disease medicine Gomekli is doubly exhilarating. So much so, that a burst of confetti greets visitors to the company\u2019s website right now.\n\nThat\u2019s because Gomekli, known as mirdametinib up until February 11 when it was approved to treat patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF), defied greater odds than most drugs. Once discontinued by Pfizer and banished to gather dust in the pharma\u2019s intellectual property attic, the drug was rescued by the nonprofit patient advocacy group Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation, who convinced executives to give it new life.\n\nCourtesy SpringWorks Therapeutics\n\nGomekli\u2019s development is the story of everything going right, with the right people throwing everything they had into getting it approved so that patients with the rare tumor disorder could finally have a real treatment option. And it\u2019s one that executives, advocates and consultants say could be repeated over and over again, applied to \u201cevery rare disease under the sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without CTF,\u201d Jim Cassidy, SpringWorks\u2019 chief medical officer, told BioSpace.\n\nA New Way to Get Things Done\n\nThirteen years ago, after a career that included long stints at Johnson & Johnson, Annette Bakker went to the nonprofit sector. Frustrated with the slow pace of drug development, Bakker wanted to help fix the massive chasm between academia and industry. Academic institutions were churning out excellent science and models, while the industry had hugely promising drugs. But without a clear line between the two, progress was stalled and drug failures were all too common.\n\n\u201cThere is one main opportunity that I saw is that there is a lot of companies that are actually not developing drugs. Not because they\u2019re not good drugs and not because they can\u2019t be effective for patients; they are just being discontinued for commercial, marketing, strategic opportunities, and that is what pharmaceutical companies do,\u201d Bakker said in an interview.\n\nShe and CTF felt that a nonprofit could help facilitate the relationships, help bring patients for specific diseases to the companies. CTF, where Bakker is CEO, focuses on the genetic disease NF, which causes benign tumors to grow along the nervous system. The condition can lead to blindness, deafness, bone abnormalities, disfigurement, pain or even cancer. The tumors are not always easy to resect, leaving medication as the only option. Adults have never had an approved treatment option, according to Cassidy.\n\nCTF had funded early preclinical work on mirdametinib before Pfizer took it up, pushing the drug all the way to initial clinical evidence in a small population before cutting it. This caused a \u201cfuror\u201d at CTF, according to Cassidy, as the drug had begun to show great promise. The organization was not ready to give up, even if Pfizer\u2019s priorities had changed.\n\nBakker went to Pfizer\u2019s Laura Sullivan. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys, this drug is really doing something.\u2019\u201d But Pfizer explained that the company was bowing to selumetinib, a drug developed by Alexion, now part of AstraZeneca. It was eventually approved in April 2020 and is marketed as Koselugo, but only for pediatric patients. Adults were still left without an option.\n\nSullivan evidently thought mirdametinib had something too. She spun out with the drug and became president of SpringWorks. She\u2019s now the CEO of Pyxis Oncology, another Pfizer spinout.\n\n\u201cPfizer [was] open to the idea of essentially farming this out, spinning out something to develop this drug, even though they didn\u2019t want to develop it any further,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where SpringWorks come into it.\u201d\n\nBakker said that about 200 people were involved in getting the drug out of Pfizer. \u201cI always say it was a story of believers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need believers. We need to find champions in the company that say I\u2019m in because this requires, still, a lot of volunteer work.\u201d\n\nThe biotech was launched in September 2017, described as a way to advance investigational therapies for underserved patients. The company\u2019s \u201ccollaborative business model is designed to deliver both social and financial returns,\u201d in partnership with scientists, biopharma partners, patient groups, funders and philanthropists, according to a release announcing the launch. Pfizer supported the $103 million series A, which also included Bain Capital Life Sciences, Bain Capital Double Impact, OrbiMed and LifeArc.\n\n\u201cSpringWorks Therapeutics started as an idea about a new way to get things done with\u2014and for\u2014patients,\u201d said Pfizer\u2019s then CMO Freda Lewis-Hall. The company initially had four assets for four diseases, including NF, desmoid tumors, hereditary xerocytosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mirdametinib was one of them.\n\n\u201cIt was really kind of being able to present a great package to the investors, to the people that needed to put their money and their resources into this asset,\u201d Bakker explained. This required volunteers from Pfizer, to whom Bakker is grateful.\n\nCTF didn\u2019t lose interest when SpringWorks took over, either. Bakker says the group has been involved throughout the drug development process, helping SpringWorks plan a Phase IIb trial, find sites and investigators.\n\n\u201cThat, in itself, is a huge lift for us, and we were a very small, very young company at the time. Whether we\u2019d ever been able to do that on our own is an open question,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nThe study was just getting underway as COVID-19 hit. As the entire world essentially shut down, so did a lot of clinical research across the industry. SpringWorks suddenly saw a huge dent in recruitment efforts for the mirdametinib trial and they knew exactly where to turn. CTF rallied its advocates\u2014\u201cbeat the bushes,\u201d according to Cassidy\u2014to drum up interest and get patients enrolled.\n\nWhen the results came in for the mid-stage ReNeu trial, mirdametinib spurred improvements in pain and quality of life. Specifically, the drug led to an objective response rate of 41% in adults and 52% in children. The drug showed deep and durable tumor volume reductions of 41% in adults and 42% in children, with 80% of adults and 90% of children achieving a confirmed response of at least 12 months. Half of patients still had a response at 24 months.\n\nThese data ultimately underpinned the FDA approval, which SpringWorks received on February 11.\n\nThis is SpringWorks\u2019 second rare disease drug approval, after Ogsiveo, which was approved 18 months ago for desmoid tumors. Cassidy said it was also from the batch of Pfizer assets, and while it didn\u2019t take quite the same advocacy path as Gomekli, it was a discontinued asset at one point.\n\nCassidy said it\u2019s time to share with others how this process worked so effectively to get a rare disease drug approved. \u201cThis is a tried and tested way of developing drugs in those very small, rare indications.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following story is part one in a two part story looking at discontinued assets in biopharma.

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer recalled the stock market crash due to the coronavirus. The COVID stock crash in 2020 was one of the worst periods in market history after the Great Recession which saw the S&P, Dow Jones, and the NASDAQ 57%, 54%, and 56%. During the COVID selloff, the S&P lost 34% between February and March while the Dow bled 25% and the NASDAQ shed 28%.\n\nCramer recalled what he was doing just as COVID would start to devastate the markets. He remembered that he was at his birthday party and \"had a lot people at Manhattan.\" At the gathering, Cramer met with hedge fund billionaire David Tepper and the pair discussed an article in the Lancet medical journal which speculated how the virus \"could be like the biggest thing ever.\"\n\nHowever, while Cramer and Tepper wondered about the implications of the virus, his co-host David Faber wasn't too worried. Cramer recalled: \"And I remember David Faber, specifically saying that I was a . . . called me a crybaby or just an alarmist. But then the next day like the world closed. Not David's finest hour. But it was amazing. And it was just one of those things [that] just, happened.\"\n\nHowever, even as markets shed a third or a quarter of their value during the pandemic, the CNBC TV host shared that these losses rarely stick over the long term. After all, according to him, even though the 2008 stock market crash was much worse, the markets have made significant gains since then.\n\nCramer commented that \"people have to recognize that the declines are not necessarily the end of the world. And the future isn't necessarily bad while the past is good.\" He added that investors were irrational during the pandemic selloff as well. According to Cramer \"There were stocks that were bought, there were people who came on air, somewhat recklessly, I'm not going to mention the names. Who drove down stocks to the point where you got bargains you wouldn't believe.\" He recalled buying the shares of one of the most well-known coffee chains in the world for his Charitable Trust at \"fifty three.\" The price was a bargain, according to Cramer, and he remembered thinking \"wow, I mean, see you later.\"\n\nAnother development that Cramer commented on was the possibility of President Trump's policies leading to the US exporting more natural gas. Mentioning the natural gas industry in the US, President Trump, and his recent remarks about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the TV host shared:",

TAKE-HEED!\u201d.\n\nThreads Post | Archived Link\n\nSuch claims have also been recently posted and found on X, with various users discussing their authenticity.\n\nX Post | Archived Link\n\nGiven the claim\u2019s extensive dissemination and the considerable attention, it has received from the internet community, we believed it was necessary to perform a fact-check on the above subject.\n\nFact Check\n\nFact Crescendo has begun debunking the above claim by verifying it through reliable sources, including keyword searches and recent news, as well as Pfizer\u2019s clarification on the matter.\n\nA Google search for \u201cPfizer COVID-19 vaccine side effects\u201d led us to a study on common side effects of the vaccines which was conducted in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nThe study concluded that the most frequent adverse effects were burning at the injection site, fever, pain at the injection site, muscle pain, swelling, and joint pain, with more side effects occurring after the first dose than the second. Read the full article here and the archived link here.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly described the possible side effects of the Pfizer vaccine for all age groups. Below is the screenshot of the common side effects for 6 months to 3 years old and 4 years to 17 years old.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the following are the common side effects for the age groups of 18 years old and above.\n\nCDC Link | Achieved Link\n\nAre \u201cAdverse Events\u201d distinct from \u201cSide Effects\u201d?\n\nWe found that not all adverse events are side effects. A instruction published by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia explains adverse events are health problems that occur after vaccination, but they aren\u2019t necessarily caused by the vaccine.\n\nSide effects, on the other hand, are specific adverse events directly linked to the vaccine. While all side effects are adverse events, not all adverse events are caused by the vaccine itself. Read the full article here and the archived link here.\n\nResponded to Fact Crescendo\u2019s inquiry via email, Pfizer\u2019s Medical Information Service in Thailand referred us to a study of the effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d published by WHO. Read the full article here and the archived link here.\n\nBelow is the summary list of common adverse reactions summarized from \u201cUndesirable Effects\u201d published by WHO:\n\nFor Participants Aged 12 to 15:\n\nInjection site pain: > 90%\n\n> 90% Fatigue and headache: > 70%\n\n> 70% Myalgia and chills: > 40%\n\n> 40% Arthralgia and pyrexia: > 20%\n\nThese reactions were generally mild to moderate in intensity and typically resolved within a few days. Additionally, older participants reported slightly fewer reactogenicity events.\n\nFor Participants Aged 16 and Older:\n\nInjection site pain: > 80%\n\n> 80% Fatigue: > 60%\n\n> 60% Headache: > 50%\n\n> 50% Myalgia (muscle pain): > 40%\n\n> 40% Chills: > 30%\n\n> 30% Arthralgia (joint pain): > 20%\n\n> 20% Pyrexia (fever) and injection site swelling: > 10%\n\nUpon checking, we have seen The Pfizer document labels these medical conditions as \u201cadverse events\u201d rather than \u201cside effects.\u201d This distinction is important because adverse events refer to any health issues that happen after vaccination, regardless of whether the vaccine caused them.\n\nOn the other hand, side effects are specifically proven to be caused by the vaccine. By listing them as adverse events, Pfizer is noting health issues reported by recipients without confirming a direct link to the vaccine itself. This helps in transparent reporting and ongoing safety monitoring.\n\n(See the following screenshot captured from the Pfizer document)\n\nFollow Us and Stay Up to Date with Our Latest Fact Checks.\n\nFacebook | Twitter | Telegram | Google News | TikTok | WhatsApp\n\nConclusion\n\nFact Crescendo found that the claim, accompanied by the photo posted on social media, is misleading. Pfizer has not published a new list of COVID-19 vaccine side effects; adverse events are health problems reported after vaccination but not necessarily caused by it, whereas side effects are health issues proven to be caused by the vaccine.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPatrizia Cavazzoni, a former high-ranking Food and Drug Administration official who oversaw a large portion of the agency\u2019s drug review work, will join Pfizer as its next chief medical officer, the company announced Monday.\n\nCavazzoni led the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research from 2021 until her departure in mid-January. She was one of several top officials, including the agency\u2019s second-in-command, to leave ahead of the Trump administration taking office.\n\nAt Pfizer, she will lead the drugmaker\u2019s regulatory, pharmacovigilance, safety, epidemiology, and medical information and evidence generation. She\u2019ll report to Chris Boshoff, the company\u2019s recently promoted head of R&D and top scientist. Aida Habtezion, Pfizer\u2019s chief medical officer since 2021, is departing to \u201cpursue other opportunities,\u201d the company said.\n\nCavazzoni\u2019s appointment could resurface criticism leveled at the FDA for a \u201crevolving door\u201d between the agency and the companies it regulates. Past FDA Commissioners Robert Califf, Scott Gottlieb and Stephen Hahn have all taken roles in industry after their time leading the FDA. Gottlieb joined Pfizer\u2019s board of directors, a position he still holds.\n\nThe issue could receive sharper scrutiny as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., newly sworn in as the U.S. health secretary, has made rooting out \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d at agencies like the FDA a top priority. (There are rules, including \u201ccooling-off\u201d periods, governing how former FDA employees can interact with the agency if they go on to work in industry.)\n\nA physician, Cavazzoni previously worked in the pharmaceutical sector, holding roles at Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Sanofi, before joining the FDA in 2018.

            "content": "In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders, since the share price is down 43% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 38%.\n\nWhile the last three years has been tough for Pfizer shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring the three years that the share price fell, Pfizer's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 29% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 17% compound annual share price fall. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNYSE:PFE Earnings Per Share Growth February 25th 2025\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Pfizer's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Pfizer, it has a TSR of -34% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nPfizer shareholders are up 4.2% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 0.1% per year over five year. This suggests the company might be improving over time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Pfizer (2 are a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.",

            "content": "In a move that will raise eyebrows in Washington, Pfizer has hired the former director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Patricia Cavazzoni, as its new chief medical officer.\n\nCavazzoni \u2013 who resigned just ahead of Donald Trump's return to the presidency \u2013 is rejoining the company she left to take up the role at the federal agency in 2018. Still, the decision to make such a high-profile appointment will do little to staunch criticism by the Trump administration of the 'revolving door' between the pharma industry and the FDA, which some claim can lead to bias in public health decisions.\n\nA May 2024 report published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) highlighted that nine of the FDA\u2019s past 10 Commissioners went on to work for the drug industry or serve on the board of a drug company.\n\nRobert Califf, who held the job under President Obama, took a role at Verily Life Sciences before rejoining the agency under President Biden, while former Trump pick Scott Gottlieb is now on the board at Pfizer. And new Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has gone on record to say he intends to identify and block conflicts of interest at federal agencies.\n\nThe decision to appoint Cavazzoni has been sharply criticised by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Dr Robert Steinbrook, director of the organisation's health research group, said that the appointment is \"totally unsurprising\" and \"demonstrates that the revolving door between the FDA and the industries it regulates is alive and well and continues to undermine the FDA\u2019s credibility as a public health agency.\"\n\nPfizer said that Cavazzoni will lead the group's regulatory, pharmacovigilance, safety, epidemiology, and medical information and evidence generation, among other medical functions, and will report to R&D chief Chris Boshoff. She succeeds Aida Habtezion, who is leaving the company.\n\n\"Dr Cavazzoni is a world-class developer of medicines across a wide range of therapeutic modalities and has more than 25 years of experience in clinical development, pharmacovigilance, clinical operations, regulatory affairs, safety risk management, pharmacovigilance, epidemiology, and R&D strategy,\" said Pfizer in its statement on the appointment.\n\nVinay Prasad, a public health researcher at UCSF who has been pitching for a role in Kennedy's department, possibly as surgeon general, said in a blog post that Cavazzoni's move \"is the core rot in American regulation,\" and is behaviour that is \"abhorrent, and [\u2026] should be criminal.\"\n\nHe added: \"Mr Kennedy has vowed to stop this, and I welcome that. Until it happens, American medicine labours under a curse: we cannot trust our drug regulators to act in the public\u2019s interest. Instead, they too often are acting in their own.\"",

            "content": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) today announced a clinical trial collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to evaluate ivonescimab, a novel, investigational PD-1 / VEGF bispecific antibody, in combination with several of Pfizer\u2019s antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) across multiple solid tumor settings.\n\n\u201cRapidly developing novel mechanisms that go beyond what is currently available to patients and physicians is what we believe will make the most significant impact for those facing the greatest challenges from cancer today,\u201d noted Bob Duggan and Dr. Maky Zanganeh, Summit\u2019s Co-CEOs. \u201cAs we seek to accelerate the development of our potentially transformative ivonescimab across non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumor settings, this collaboration will allow us to quickly advance beyond our promising late-stage development plan to evaluate ivonescimab in combination with some of the most innovative ADCs from Pfizer.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the collaboration is to evaluate ivonescimab, in combination with several unique Pfizer ADCs across multiple solid tumor settings to accelerate the advancement of potentially landscape-changing combinations, which seek to improve the standards of care for patients facing serious unmet needs. Each study intends to evaluate ivonescimab plus one of Pfizer\u2019s vedotin ADCs in individual, distinct solid tumor settings to determine the safety profile and potential anti-tumor activity of the combinations.\n\n\"We are excited to partner with Summit Therapeutics to explore the clinical synergy of our therapies,\" said Megan O\u2019Meara, M.D., Head, Oncology Early Stage Development, Pfizer. \"Together, we are advancing the exploration of our ADCs in rational, differentiated combinations with a bispecific antibody designed to address the unique complexities of tumor biology. This collaboration represents the next wave of investigational targeted combinations with the potential to transform treatment options for people living with cancer.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Summit will provide ivonescimab for use in the proposed studies, and Pfizer will be responsible for conducting the operations of the studies. The studies will be overseen by both Summit and Pfizer. Both parties retain their respective rights to their products. The studies combining ivonescimab with Pfizer\u2019s vedotin ADCs are planned to begin in the middle of this year. Further details on the clinical trials will be announced at a later date.\n\nAbout Ivonescimab\n\nIvonescimab, known as SMT112 in Summit\u2019s license territories, North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Japan, and as AK112 in China and Australia, is a novel, potential first-in-class investigational bispecific antibody combining the effects of immunotherapy via a blockade of PD-1 with the anti-angiogenesis effects associated with blocking VEGF into a single molecule. Ivonescimab displays unique cooperative binding to each of its intended targets with multifold higher affinity when in the presence of both PD-1 and VEGF.\n\nThis could differentiate ivonescimab as there is potentially higher expression (presence) of both PD-1 and VEGF in tumor tissue and the tumor microenvironment (TME) as compared to normal tissue in the body. Ivonescimab\u2019s tetravalent structure (four binding sites) enables higher avidity (accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions) in the TME (Zhong, et al, SITC, 2023). This tetravalent structure, the intentional novel design of the molecule, and bringing these two targets into a single bispecific antibody with cooperative binding qualities have the potential to direct ivonescimab to the tumor tissue versus healthy tissue. The intent of this design, together with a half-life of 6 to 7 days (Zhong, et al, SITC, 2023), is to improve upon previously established efficacy thresholds, in addition to side effects and safety profiles associated with these targets.\n\nIvonescimab was engineered by Akeso Inc. (HKEX Code: 9926.HK) and is currently engaged in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Over 2,300 patients have been treated with ivonescimab in clinical studies globally.\n\nSummit has begun its clinical development of ivonescimab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), commencing enrollment in 2023 in two multi-regional Phase III clinical trials, HARMONi and HARMONi-3, and the Company has begun to activate clinical trial sites in the United States for HARMONi-7.\n\nHARMONi is a Phase III clinical trial which intends to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with a 3rd generation EGFR TKI (e.g., osimertinib). Enrollment in HARMONi was completed in the second-half of 2024, and top-line results are expected to be announced in the middle of this year.\n\nHARMONi-3 is a Phase III clinical trial which is designed to evaluate ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic NSCLC.\n\nHARMONi-7 is a Phase III clinical trial which is intended to evaluate ivonescimab monotherapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with first-line metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression.\n\nIn addition, Akeso has recently had positive read-outs in two single-region (China), randomized Phase III clinical trials for ivonescimab in NSCLC, HARMONi-A and HARMONi-2.\n\nHARMONi-A was a Phase III clinical trial which evaluated ivonescimab combined with chemotherapy compared to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated, locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with an EGFR TKI.\n\nHARMONi-2 is a Phase III clinical trial evaluating monotherapy ivonescimab against monotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have positive PD-L1 expression.\n\nIvonescimab is an investigational therapy that is not approved by any regulatory authority in Summit\u2019s license territories, including the United States and Europe. Ivonescimab was approved for marketing authorization in China in May 2024. Ivonescimab was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the HARMONi clinical trial setting.\n\nAbout Summit Therapeutics\n\nSummit Therapeutics Inc. is a biopharmaceutical oncology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of patient-, physician-, caregiver- and societal-friendly medicinal therapies intended to improve quality of life, increase potential duration of life, and resolve serious unmet medical needs.\n\nSummit was founded in 2003 and our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (symbol \"SMMT\").

The two companies will retain commercialization rights to their respective products, Summit said.\n\nAccording to Summit, the deal \u201cwill allow us to quickly advance beyond our promising late-stage development plan,\u201d which already includes multiple studies in lung cancer. The companies didn\u2019t provide specifics, but said the trials will begin in the middle of the year and aim to find \u201cpotentially landscape-changing combinations.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIvonescimab simultaneously binds two well-studied cancer drug targets called PD-1 and VEGF. Summit licensed the medicine from China-based Akeso in 2022 and, since then, has reported results showing the treatment bested Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda in a Phase 3 lung cancer trial.\n\nThe surprise results made drugs like ivonescimab, known as PD-1/VEGF inhibitors, among the most sought after in cancer research. Several drug companies, Merck & Co. among them, have since cut deals to acquire or license such drugs, even as important questions about their benefits have yet to be answered.\n\nSummit has a trio of late-stage trials underway in lung cancer, including one that tests ivonescimab and chemotherapy against the Keytruda-chemo combination that\u2019s standard treatment for most lung cancer cases. The company is exploring its potential elsewhere, too, and the deal announced Monday helps Summit do that while evaluating ivonescimab alongside \u201csome of the most innovative ADCs from Pfizer,\u201d said co-CEOs Bob Duggan and Maky Zanganeh, in a statement.\n\nFor Pfizer, the deal provides a window into a potential immunotherapy advance. The company largely missed out on the earlier wave of \u201ccheckpoint inhibitor\u201d drugs, first partnering and then abandoning a collaboration with Merck KGaA on Bavencio before turning to a newer prospect called sasanlimab. But it\u2019s invested heavily in other types of cancer drugs, most notably ADCs through its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. That investment gave the company the ADCs it\u2019s now using in the Summit deal.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration represents the next wave of investigational targeted combinations with the potential to transform treatment options for people living with cancer,\u201d said Pfizer oncology early stage development head Megan O\u2019Meara, in a statement.\n\nPfizer acquired three marketed ADCs \u2014 Adcetris, Padcev and Tivdak \u2014 when it acquired Seagen. But it also has some other ADCs in its cancer drug pipeline.\n\nShares in Summit fell by double digits in trading Monday.",

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 10.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nPfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.95 points to a change of -5.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.03 indicates a change of +2.7% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.",

            "content": "BridgeBio Pharma has received European approval for a drug that treats cardiomyopathy stemming from a rare metabolic condition, strengthening the biotech\u2019s position to take market share from the blockbuster Pfizer drug that is currently the standard treatment.\n\nThe European Commission granted marketing authorization to acoramidis, which BridgeBio developed as treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a disease in which a genetic mutation leads to abnormal versions of the liver protein transthyretin (TTR). The misfolded proteins can cause nerve and heart problems. BridgeBio\u2019s acoramidis, which will be commercialized in Europe as Beyonttra, is a small molecule designed to stabilize TTR to treat the cardiomyopathy caused by the disease. The biotech contends its drug is a better stabilizer than the drugs marketed by Pfizer. For 2024, Pfizer reported $3.3 billion in revenue from its Vyndaqel family of TTR stabilizers, a 36% increase compared to 2023.\n\nThe FDA approved the BridgeBio TTR drug this past November and it is marketed in the U.S. under the brand name Attruby. In a prescriptions update included in its report of fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, BridgeBio said that as of Feb. 17, 1,028 unique patient prescriptions for the drug have been written by 516 unique prescribers since the U.S. approval. That\u2019s an increase from what the company reported during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last month, which Leerink Partners said indicates a broadening prescriber base.\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nIn Europe, the BridgeBio drug will be commercialized by Bayer per terms of an agreement signed last year. BridgeBio is in line to receive milestone payments and royalties from sales. The first payment is $75 million for the European approval.\n\nHere\u2019s a recap of other recent regulatory developments:\n\nMore Rare Disease Drug Approvals\n\n\u2014The FDA approved Mirum Pharmaceuticals\u2019 drug chenodiol, brand name Ctexli, for treating rare lipid storage disease cerebrotendinous xathomatosis (CTX). This genetic metabolic disorder results in deficient levels of an enzyme important for breaking down fats. Chenodiol is a naturally occurring human bile acid. Under the brand name Chenodal, chenodiol has been marketed for treating gallstones, but it has been used off label as a treatment for CTX. The new FDA approval makes Ctexli the first FDA-approved treatment for CTX. Mirum acquired the drug from Travere Therapeutics in 2023.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\n\u2014The European Commission approved Livdelzi, a Gilead Sciences drug developed for the rare liver disease primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The conditional marketing authorization covers use of the daily pill in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid, an older drug that is the standard PBC treatment. The European decision for Livdelzi follows FDA approval of the drug last August. Livdelzi comes from Gilead\u2019s $4.3 billion acquisition of Cymabay Therapeutics last year.\n\n\u2014The FDA approved SpringWorks Therapeutics\u2019 drug Gomekli as a treatment for tumors caused by the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The approval covers treatment of these tumors in both adults and children. That\u2019s an advantage over AstraZeneca\u2019s Koselugo, which is only approved for treating pediatric NF1 patients.\n\n\u2014CSL\u2019s garadacimab received approvals in Europe and Japan for treating adults and adolescents age 12 and older who have hereditary angioedema (HAE). The rare disease leads to swelling attacks in tissue beneath the skin. This swelling can close off the airway, putting a patient at risk of death. CSL\u2019s drug, brand name Andembry, is an antibody engineered to inhibit activated Factor XII, a protein that starts the cascade of events leading to unpredictable HAE swelling attacks. Andembry is still under regulatory review in the U.S., Canada, and Switzerland.\n\n\u2014Evrysdi, a drug marketed by Roche for the rare disease spinal muscular atrophy, is now approved in a tablet formulation. The product, which was initially developed by PTC Therapeutics and later partnered with Roche, was first approved in 2020 as a liquid administered via an oral syringe or through a feeding tube. The liquid formulation must be refrigerated and kept away from light. The new Evrysdi tablet offers patients a simpler dosing option that can be stored at room temperature.\n\nCancer Drug Approvals\n\n\u2014 Merck\u2019s Welireg is now approved in Europe as a treatment for adults with von Hillel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors in the body that can become cancerous. The European Commission\u2019s conditional approval covers patients whose VHL is unsuitable for surgery and requires therapy for renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The commission\u2019s decision also covers the treatment of adults with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma that has progressed after two or more lines of therapy. Welireg is a once-daily pill designed to block HIF-2 alpha, inhibiting this protein\u2019s ability to contribute to cancer progression. The FDA approved Welireg in 2021.\n\n\u2014 The FDA approved Romvimza, an Ono Pharmaceutical drug for tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). The drug, which came to Ono via the 2024 acquisition of its developer, Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, offers more convenient dosing and a lower risk of liver toxicity compared to Turalio, a Daiichi Sankyo drug that was the first approved systemic therapy for TGCT.\n\n\u2014 Datroway, a TROP-2-targeting antibody drug conjugate (ADC) from partners AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, landed FDA approval for treating advanced and unresectable breast cancer that\u2019s classified as HR positive and HER2 negative. It will compete with Trodelvy, Gilead Sciences\u2019 TROP-2-targeting ADC, which is already approved in the same indication.\n\n\u2014 Axsome Therapeutics\u2019 Symbravo won FDA approval for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. The tablet pairs two compounds that target multiple pathways behind a migraine attack. Symbravo is made with proprietary Axsome technology that enables the drug to more quickly achieve maximum concentration in the blood and to maintain a long half-life. Symbravo\u2019s label carries a black box warning for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks. The approval marks a comeback for the drug, which received an FDA complete response letter in 2022 due to manufacturing issues.\n\n\u2014 Foundation Medicine received FDA approval for FoundationOne CDx as a companion diagnostic for the brain cancer drug Ojemda. The test detects the BRAF V600 mutation addressed by the drug, developed by Day One Biotherapeutics. The FDA approved Ojemda last April as a treatment for advanced cases of pediatric low-grade glioma.\n\n\u2014 Adcetris, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) developed by Pfizer subsidiary Seagen, added to its label the treatment of advanced cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The new approval covers use of the drug in combination with the cancer drugs Revlimid and Rituxan. The new FDA approval is based on Phase 3 results showing the Adcetris regimen led to a 37% reduction in risk of death compared to Revlimid, Rituxan, and a placebo.\n\nAdcetris was first approved in 2011 for Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The drug now has eight FDA approvals in cancer. Pfizer has rights to the drug in the U.S. and Canada; Takeda Pharmaceutical has rights to the product in the rest of the world.\n\n\u2014 Blockbuster AstraZeneca cancer drug Calquence, first approved in 2017 for treating advanced mantle cell lymphoma after at least one prior line of therapy, is now approved as a first-line treatment for this rare and aggressive blood cancer. The drug, a BTK inhibitor, is the first in its class approved as a first-line MCL treatment.\n\n\u2014 Amgen cancer drug Lumakras expanded its FDA approval to metastatic colorectal cancer that is positive for the KRAS G12c mutation and is also unresponsive or resistant to chemotherapy. The regulatory nod in this indication covers use of the daily pill in combination with Vectibix, an Amgen antibody drug approved for colorectal cancer. Lumakras was initially approved in 2022 as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer driven by the KRAS G12C mutation.\n\nApprovals in Immunology\n\n\u2014 Galderma drug Nemluvio received European Commission approval as a treatment for the inflammatory skin disorders atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis. The once-monthly injection is an antibody designed to block IL-31 signaling. The FDA approved Nemluvio for prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis last year.\n\n\u2014 Eli Lilly\u2019s Omvoh, a biologic drug first approved in 2023 as a treatment for ulcerative colitis, added moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease to its label. The drug is an antibody that targets IL-23p19, a protein that contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation. Regulatory submissions in Crohn\u2019s are currently under review in Europe and Japan. In ulcerative colitis, the drug is approved in 44 countries.\n\n\u2014 Palforzia, a peanut allergy immunotherapy marketed by Stallergenes Greer, expanded the product\u2019s approved uses in Europe to include the treatment of children ages 1 through 3. The initial approval for Palforzia covered children age 4 through 17. The new approval in Europe comes about six months after the therapy secured a similar regulatory decision from the FDA. Privately held Stallergenes Greer added Palforzia to its allergy products portfolio via a 2023 deal with Nestl\u00e9.\n\nApprovals for Neuro, Pain Meds\n\n\u2014 Supernus Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Onapgo, a drug/device combination product that continuously infuses the drug apomorphine to treat the \u201coff\u201d episodes experienced by Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. Onapgo joins a Supernus Parkinson\u2019s drug lineup that includes Apokyn, an injection pen product that administers apomorphine, and Gocovri, a capsule approved to treat dyskinesia and off time in Parkinson\u2019s patients.\n\n\u2014 Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 non-opioid drug Journavx won FDA approval as a first-in-class treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults. The twice-daily pill targets NaV1.8, a pathway in the peripheral nervous system. By stopping pain signals in the periphery before they reach the brain, drugs in this class are intended to avoid the addiction risks poised by opioids, which hit targets in the brain.\n\n\u2014The FDA approved Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Spravato as a monotherapy for adults with treatment-resistant depression. The nasal spray drug\u2019s initial approval in 2019 covered its use in combination with an oral antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults.\n\nVaccine Approvals\n\n\u2014 Bavarian Nordic received FDA approval for its virus-like particle chikungunya vaccine, which will be marketed under the brand name Vimkunya. The FDA nod covers use of the vaccine in those age 12 and older. That\u2019s a broader range than Valneva\u2019s Ixchiq, which became the first FDA-approved chikungunya vaccine in 2023. Ixchiq is indicated for use in those age 18 and older. Bavarian Nordic\u2019s new approval was accompanied by a tropical disease priority review voucher, which the company said it plans to sell.\n\n\u2014 A GSK vaccine covering five groups of bacteria that cause meningococcal disease is now FDA approved for use in those ages 10 through 25. The vaccine, brand name Penmenvy, combines components of two already available GSK meningococcal vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo. Penmenvy will now compete with Pfizer\u2019s Penbraya, which also covers five bacterial groups. Both vaccines are administered as two intramuscular injections given six months apart.\n\n\u2014 A Covid-19 vaccine developed by partners Arcturus Therapeutics and CSL is now approved in Europe. The vaccine, brand name Kostaive, employs self-amplifying RNA. Unlike traditional mRNA vaccines, self-amplifying RNA vaccines instruct the body to make more mRNA and protein to boost the immune response.\n\nKostaive was originally developed by Arcturus. In 2022, CSL paid $200 million up front to collaborate on the vaccine. Per deal terms, Arcturus is responsible for regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe as well as R&D of next-generation vaccine candidates. CSL subsidiary Seqirus takes the lead on all other R&D in Covid-19, influenza, and other fields.\n\nMore Regulatory Approvals\n\n\u2014 Izervay, a geographic atrophy drug marketed by Astellas Pharma, is now approved for longer dosing. The product\u2019s initial 2023 approval permitted the once-monthly eye injection to be administered for up to 12 months. The new approval removes the 12 month restriction. However, the Astellas product did not receive the FDA O.K. for every-other-month administration. That additional flexibility would have put it on par with Apellis Pharmaceuticals\u2019 geographic atrophy drug Syfovre, which is approved for monthly and every-other-month dosing.\n\n\u2014 Novo Nordisk drug Ozempic is now approved for treating chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. The blockbuster drug was initially approved for type 2 diabetes, which is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease. In the pivotal study supporting the latest regulatory nod, Ozempic led to a 24% reduction in kidney disease complications compared to a placebo.\n\n\u2014AbbVie\u2019s pairing of the antibiotics aztreonam and avibactam received FDA approval for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections, giving clinicians another tool to address antimicrobial resistance. The therapy, which will be marketed under the brand name Emblaveo, is indicated for use in combination with Flagyl, a Pfizer antibiotic. Emblaveo was developed in partnership with Pfizer. AbbVie has commercialization rights to the drug in the U.S and Canada; Pfizer is responsible for the antibiotic\u2019s commercialization in the rest of the world.\n\nClinical Holds and Regulatory Setbacks\n\n\u2014 The FDA sent Harmony Biosciences a refuse to file letter for pitolistant, a drug the biotech is seeking to commercialize as a treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in adults who have idiopathic hypersomnia. In a Phase 3 withdrawal study, the once-daily tablet did not achieve statistical significance compared to placebo. The biotech said a Phase 3 registrational study in idiopathic hypersomnia is on track to begin in the fourth quarter of this year. Pitolistant is already available as a treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy, marketed as Wakix in this indication.\n\n\u2014 Moderna\u2019s Phase 3 test of its two-season norovirus vaccine candidate, mRNA-1403, is under an FDA clinical hold. The company said the clinical trial halt is due to a single report of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve damage that can be a complication of vaccines. The adverse event is under investigation. The company does not expect the clinical hold will affect the trial readout timeline in the northern hemisphere, where the study is already fully enrolled. The timing of a data readout will depend on case accruals. Second season enrollment is being prepared in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\u2014 The FDA placed a clinical hold on Ebvallo, a treatment for advanced cases of Epstein-Barr virus positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. The hold came days after the FDA rejected the immunotherapy due to findings from an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility. The company said the Ebvallo clinical hold relates to the issues flagged in the complete response letter. Ebvallo, which is made by engineering T cells from healthy donors, was approved in Europe in 2022.\n\nPhoto: sinonimas, Getty Images",

            "content": "These two stocks are poised to crush the market thanks to their outsize growth prospects and dirt cheap valuations.\n\nBuying quality stocks when they're unpopular can be very rewarding.\n\nA good place to look for unpopular stocks these days is in the healthcare sector, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination and confirmation as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services have cooled investor sentiment in healthcare stocks. Kennedy is a vocal critic of the pharmaceutical industry, and many leading pharmaceutical stocks are trading well off their highs.\n\nI think leading pharmaceutical companies Pfizer (PFE 0.47%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO 1.66%) could be the best-performing value stocks over the next five years.\n\nOnly time will tell whether I'm right, but there's a compelling pitch for each stock.\n\nFrom pandemic hangover to oncology juggernaut\n\nPfizer was a big winner during the COVID-19 pandemic. It developed a vaccine (Comirnaty) and treatment (Paxlovid) for COVID-19 that totaled over $56 billion in sales in 2022, over half the company's total revenue that year. This marked a peak for Pfizer, which has seen its top and bottom lines collapse as those temporary sales dried up. However, the tide has started to turn. Pfizer's revenue and earnings began growing again in 2024.\n\nThe company has spent the past few years positioning itself for growth in oncology, including a blockbuster $43 billion acquisition of Seagen to bolster its oncology pipeline. Pfizer anticipates strong growth in oncology over the next five years. Management expects to double its patient base by 2030 and anticipates at least three new blockbusters (drugs with over $1 billion in annual sales). Oncology revenue increased 25% in 2024, so growth is already picking up steam.\n\nAnalysts estimate Pfizer will grow earnings by almost 14% annually over the next three to five years. So far, investors haven't noticed. The stock trades near its lowest price in over a decade, and the dividend yield (6.7% as of this writing) hasn't been this high since the financial crisis in 2007-2009. Pfizer's earnings easily cover the dividend, so this seems more like headline fears keeping the stock down than financial risks.\n\nAt its current price-to-earnings ratio, Pfizer's PEG ratio is only 0.6. Anything under 1 is considered cheap, and I frequently buy quality stocks with PEG ratios of 2 to 2.5. Pfizer is astoundingly cheap and offers double-digit earnings growth potential plus a massive dividend yield. Assuming Pfizer delivers as hoped, the stock could realistically double or better over the next five years.\n\nA weight loss sensation with more tricks up its sleeve\n\nNovo Nordisk's roots go back decades, as its expertise in insulin and diabetes propelled it to become one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. In recent years, GLP-1 agonists have taken society by storm. The weight loss drugs treat diabetes and obesity by suppressing appetite and slowing digestion. Novo Nordisk's Ozempic -- approved to treat diabetes -- is arguably the most popular; its name has become synonymous with GLP-1 agonists.\n\nManagement estimates Novo Nordisk has approximately 63% of the GLP-1 agonist market via Ozempic and Wegovy, a similar drug approved for treating obesity. It competes primarily with Eli Lilly, which owns an estimated 34% of the market. Research from Grand View Research estimates GLP-1 agonist sales in North America could triple from $41 billion last year to $126 billion in 2030, averaging 18% annualized growth over the next five years.\n\nNovo Nordisk is developing Amycretin, a pill-form GLP-1 agonist that could attract more patients than existing injectable products. Although the GLP-1 agonist opportunity is still nascent, Novo Nordisk has already established itself as a leader. Analysts estimate that these tailwinds will help Novo Nordisk grow earnings by an average of 24% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nYet, the stock is down almost 50% from its high. The stock's PEG ratio is just 0.8, signaling jaw-dropping value.\n\nWhy is the stock down? Well, I mentioned the pessimism across the healthcare sector. In addition, Novo Nordisk can't produce enough semaglutide (the base drug in Ozempic and Wegovy) to satisfy demand, leading to competition from compounding pharmacies selling generic versions through regulatory loopholes. The good news is that much of this is short-term noise that should quiet down as Novo Nordisk increases its production capacity. When sentiment improves, Novo Nordisk could roar back. A bargain valuation and rampant earnings growth could make for market-crushing investment returns through 2030.",

            "content": "In the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, we learned one thing: public health isn\u2019t just about science \u2013 it\u2019s also a political battleground. Enter House Bill 1531, a new piece of legislation that was advanced on Friday in the House Health Care and Wellness Committee with an 11-7 vote, split strictly along party lines.\n\nDemocrats, in control, pushed it forward, while Republicans lined up to oppose it. So, what\u2019s it really all about?\n\nAt its core, HB 1531 aims to establish a rule that any public health response to diseases must be based on \u201cthe best available science.\u201d The goal? To ensure that health policies, like vaccines and disease control, are rooted in solid, evidence-backed strategies. Sounds pretty straightforward, right? But, as with most things these days, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than it seems.\n\nThe pandemic\u2019s political side show\n\nDuring the pandemic, Former Washington Governor Jay Inslee didn\u2019t exactly ask for permission when he used his executive powers to push health mandates through the state\u2019s Department of Health. He said at the time he was making the tough calls to keep people safe, but not everyone saw it that way.\n\nFor some, it felt like the state was calling all the shots without listening to local concerns. It was a clash between the need for swift action and the desire for local control.\n\nThis is where HB 1531 comes in. The bill essentially says, \u201cLet\u2019s make sure public health decisions stay rooted in science and let\u2019s not let local policies get in the way of that.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Representative Dan Bronoske (D-Lakewood), told the committee he chairs, \u201cThis bill does not carry any mandates. What the bill does do is require that local health authorities base their response to communicable diseases on the best available science, on the safety and efficacy of evidence-based practices \u2013 full stop.\u201d\n\nIf any local rule or law contradicts these science-based measures, the bill declares them null and void. The idea is to make sure there\u2019s no room for political interference, but, of course, not everyone agrees with that.\n\nMore MyNW politics: Revised bill overhauling governor\u2019s emergency powers, weakened by democrats say republicans\n\nDemocrats defend science, Republicans defend local control\n\nRepublicans didn\u2019t just give a thumbs-down to the bill; they came ready to make changes. A total of 22 amendments were thrown into the mix, but all of them were shot down.\n\nThe amendments ranged from asking for more local control over health decisions to demanding clearer guidelines on what counts as \u201cbest available science.\u201d But with an 11-7 vote, the bill passed through the committee on a strict party-line vote, with Democrats saying yes and Republicans saying no.\n\nRepresentative Matt Marshall (R-Eatonville) argued that HB 1531 is a step too far, essentially giving power to unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\u201cThe concern here is that things have been politicized and that they will continue to be politicized. And do the people want unelected bureaucrats in the health departments telling us what to do?\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued there should be legislative oversight \u201cto make sure that we have appropriate responses.\u201d\n\nThe bill may sound great in theory \u2013 who doesn\u2019t want decisions based on science? \u2013 but the big worry is that it\u2019s another move to centralize power in the state health department, which may not always be using the \u2018best science,\u2019 leaving local governments with fewer options to respond to unique challenges.\n\n\u2018Betrayal\u2019: Ukrainian-Americans in Seattle slam Trump, prepare to protest\n\nThe future of HB 1531\n\nThe bill\u2019s not a done deal just yet. With the committee approval behind it, it\u2019s headed to the full House for more debate. There\u2019s still plenty of time for it to change, and it\u2019s clear this conversation isn\u2019t going to end anytime soon.\n\nMatt Markovich is the KIRO Newsradio political analyst.\n\nFollow @https://twitter.com/mattmarkovich",

            "content": "Chuck Hardwick, the Kentucky-born son of a Wonder Bread maintenance worker who became a significant force in New Jersey politics in the 1980s as the first Republican Assembly Speaker in twelve years and a candidate for governor, died on February 19. He was 83 and had battled Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) for the last year.\n\nHardwick\u2019s rise in New Jersey politics was paralleled by a hugely successful 40-year career as a top executive at Pfizer. As a member of the senior management team, he served as senior vice president of worldwide government and public affairs and as president of the Pfizer Foundation,\n\nDuring his fourteen years in the New Jersey Legislature, Hardwick was a conservative with clear streaks of compassion and humanitarianism. He advocated for lower taxes and streamlining government waste, advocated for laws that prevented strip searches for people charged with minor offenses, and sponsored a law that would provide adoptees with access to their birth parents\u2019 medical history. His friendship with Arnold Wexler led him to become an activist in support of programs to benefit people with gambling addictions.\n\nHe became Assembly Minority Leader in late 1984, after Dean Gallo (R-Parsippany) was elected to Congress, and became Speaker after Republicans, boosted by Gov. Tom Kean\u2019s 70% landslide re-election, picked up fourteen Assembly seats, including four in Hudson County.\n\nWith Kean term-limited in 1989, Hardwick sought the Republican nomination for governor. He finished third in a field of eight candidates. Rep. Jim Courter (R-Allamuchy) led Attorney General Cary Edwards, 29%-22%; Hardwick received 21%, finishing 2,921 votes behind Edwards.\n\nHardwick began his political career in 1974 as a candidate for councilman in Westfield\u2019s fourth ward. He came within 54 votes of ousting the incumbent, Democrat Lawrence Weiss, despite the Watergate landslide that year.\n\nHe ran for Union County Freeholder in 1976 in a race where four seats were up for grabs.\n\nUnion County Democrats backed Thomas Long and Harold Seymour for re-election, but initially denied party support to Everett Lattimore \u2013 a move they later overturned. They also backed Joseph Garrrubo, a former assemblyman appointed to fill a vacancy and seeking an unexpired term. Hardwick\u2019s running mates were Springfield Township Committeeman Bill Ruocco and Roselle Park Councilman Robert Morgan; against Garrbubo, the GOP ran Ed Weber, an Operating Engineers Local 825 business representative from Union Township.\n\nUnion County was in ticket-splitting mode in those days, giving President Gerald Ford a 12,000-vote plurality but also giving U.S. Senator Harrison Wiliams, a Plainfield native, a 53,000-vote win in the Senate race; Republican Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (R-Union) represented most of Union County and carried it by nearly 88,000 votes.\n\nLong was the top vote-getter in the freeholder race, outpolling Hardwick by roughly 8,000 votes; Seymour beat Hardwick by around 5,000. Weber defeated Garrbubo by approximately 500 votes after hammering him over his vote to establish a state income tax.\n\nUndeterred, Hardwick became a candidate for the Assembly in 1977 after Frank X. McDermott (R-Westfield) chose to give up his lower house seat and run for the State Senate. He told Republicans that he\u2019d probably just run for the Senate next if they didn\u2019t pick him.\n\nRunning with Assemblyman C. Louis Bassano (R-Union), Hardwick captured the second seat by more than 3,200 votes against Hillside Mayor Vincent Baldassano and former Cranford Mayor Daniel Mason. McDermott, who had been Senate President before losing to Democrat Alexander Menza (D-Hillside) in the 1973 Watergate landslide, was unsuccessful in his Senate bid; Democrat Anthony Russo (D-Union) defeated him by 990 votes, 51%-49%.\n\nA tireless worker, Hardwick was re-elected by wide margins six times.\n\nFollowing Gallo\u2019s move to Congress \u2013 he had unseated 11-term Rep. Joseph Minish (D-West Orange) \u2013 Hardwick defeated Robert Littell (R-Franklin) for the minority leader post. Littell joined the race after his running mate, Chuck Haytaian (R-Hackettstown), pulled out. Hardwick was the sole survivor of an Assembly GOP leadership purge one year earlier.\n\nHardwick had led a statewide campaign to take control of the Assembly in 1985 \u2013 personally playing a role in the recruitment of candidates \u2013 but the night before the vote to pick a Speaker, Assemblyman Walter Kavanaugh (R-Somerville) made a play for the post; Hardwick had the votes, and Kavanaugh was out of the race within a few hours. Haytaian became the Majority Leader and a strong Hardwick ally.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Hardwick carried Union County by a 48%-21% margin over Courter and finished second in Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Ocean, Salem, Somerset, Sussex, and Warren counties.\n\nAfter the 1989 primary, Assemblyman Peter Genova (R-Union) changed his mind about seeking re-election, and Hardwick decided to return to the Assembly. He was the top vote-getter in a hugely competitive district; Democrat Neil Cohen flipped the second seat, defeating former Westfield Mayor Ronald Frigerio by 3,587 votes.\n\nCharles Leighton Hardwick was born November 8, 1941, in Somerset, Kentucky. His mother died when he was five, and his father had suffered a workplace-related injury; as a teenager, Hardwick helped support his family. He married his high school sweetheart, Pat, when he was 17, before graduation day, and their daughter, Ginger, was born soon after that. He had two children by the time he was 20.\n\nHe attended Florida State University on a Wonder Bread scholarship, graduated in three years, and received his MBA before joining Pfizer as a pharmaceutical sales representative.\n\nA former president of the National Republican Legislators Association, Harwick moved to New York City and later to Florida. He and his wife, Sheilagh Mylott, had fostered a four-day-old child, Austin, and eventually adopted him; he is now 16. He is survived by his wife, three children, and three grandchildren.\n\nHardwick\u2019s death leaves just three living former Republican Assembly Speakers: Barry Parker (1971), Kean (1972-74), and and Jack Collins (1996-2002).",

Reports of a meeting between Pfizer's leader and an activist investor breathed life into the stock, which closed the day more than 3% higher in price. That gain well exceeded the 0.7% increase of the S&P 500 index.\n\nAn activist meeting is apparently imminent\n\nLate afternoon on Tuesday, the Financial Times (FT) published an article stating that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla plans to meet that activist investor, Starboard Value. Citing unnamed \"people familiar with the matter,\" the business newspaper wrote that Bourla is to engage in talks with Starboard, accompanied by at least one other member of Pfizer's board of directors.\n\nThat report came mere days after The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Starboard had taken a stake worth around $1 billion in the American pharmaceutical giant. That would give it a roughly 0.6% holding in the company. Although this is not a major stake, it is sufficient for Starboard to loudly and publicly advocate for change -- the typical method of operation for activist investors.\n\nAccording to the FT's sources, Starboard has created an \"extensive\" slide deck presentation on its ideas for modifications of strategy at Pfizer. However, it has yet to release it.\n\nPost-coronavirus fatigue\n\nWhile Pfizer is a powerful company, it hasn't managed to shake its reputation as something of an also-ran following its great success as the co-developer of the coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty (in partnership with German biotech BioNTech) earlier this decade. The company's post-pandemic fundamentals at times haven't been impressive; investors will be hoping that if a Pfizer/Starboard summit takes place, it produces good ideas for the former's approach going forward.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

I worked on this \u2018mRNA technology\u2019 for @pfizer as a formulation analytical scientist,\u201d Leslie asserted.\n\n\u201cYou and @realDonaldTrump and @RobertKennedyJr need to pull the mRNA vaccines off the market immediately.\n\n\u201cCrimes against humanity have been committed and ignoring this is a notice of liability of injury and harm to the masses.\n\n\u201cInjecting this poison into innocent children is an attack on God and it must end.\u201d\n\nLeslie followed up by sharing a link to a website that shows he\u2019s been working with James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s OMG to blow the whistle on Pfizer.\n\nIn addition, Leslie has provided a whistleblowing interview where he exposed Pfizer Vice President Nick Warne\u2019s role in \u201cgaming the system\u201d to get the \u201cvaccines\u201d approved for public use.\n\nLeslie says Pfizer \u201cgamed the FDA,\u201d and pulled a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d by getting \u201capproval\u201d for a TRIS buffer for its \u201ctoxic poison\u201d Covid mRNA injection.\n\nHowever, Leslie revealed that Pfizer was actually using a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in its supposed \u201cclinical trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cPfizer gamed the FDA through Vice President Nick Warne,\u201d Leslie told The Big Mig Show.\n\nHe notes that \u201cthere\u2019s even a YouTube video on October 26 of 2021, anyone can go look at\u201d that shows Warne saying Pfizer got approval for the TRIS buffer while using the PBS for a fake \u201cclinical trial.\u201d\n\nIn the video cited by Leslie, Warne admits that Pfizer changed the formula of its Covid \u201cvaccine\u201d after the clinical trials.\n\nWATCH:\n\nLeslie notes that he worked directly with Warne at Pfizer in research and development.\n\nWarne \u201cgoes on to explain that the TRIS buffer is the one that got approved for this emergency use authorization shot, and they did\u2026the clinical trials with the phosphate-buffered saline, the PBS buffer,\u201d Leslie revealed.\n\nA \u201cbuffer\u201d in this context is a solution that helps to maintain pH balance.\n\nIn this case, the pH balance of the contents of the Covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Leslie notes the difference between the two buffers \u201chas to do with storage temperature.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower notes that \u201cthe PBS could only be stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius, [while] the TRIS buffer could be stored at minus 80, as well as 2 and 8 degrees Celsius [35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit] as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the significance with this is\u2026it\u2019s the last step of the formulation, and Pfizer and the FDA wanted to make it seem like this isn\u2019t a big deal.\n\n\u201cBut this really is a big deal,\u201d Leslie adds.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it from a 40,000-foot step back.\n\n\u201cLike, you couldn\u2019t have just done the clinical trials the right way?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving a toxic poison bomb regardless, but you\u2019re gonna do this bait-and-switch\u2026buffer system switch, which is what they did.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nThis explosive admission comes after leading scientists from the world-renowned Yale University have just confirmed that Covid mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d cause vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (VAIDS).\n\nAs Slay News reported, a bombshell study conducted by researchers at Yale University School of Medicine found that mRNA injections alter human biology to create long-term spike protein production that increases over time.\n\nThe scientists warn that the Covid mRNA vaccines alter T cell immunophenotypes which triggers VAIDS \u2013 or \u201cvaccine-induced AIDS.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just made the shocking admission that Covid mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d are spiked with contaminations that triggered a global surge in cancers.\n\nThe federal agency made the admission after an FDA study confirmed that Pfizer\u2019s Covid mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d contains dangerous levels of excess DNA contamination.\n\nSource: slaynews.com\n\nShare\n\nRelated articles:",

Whether you're looking for a way to raise the stream of passive income your portfolio produces or you simply want to outperform benchmark averages, adding some dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio is a smart way forward.\n\nCompanies that commit to returning a portion of their earnings to shareholders behave differently than companies that don't have a dividend program. The differences aren't minor ones either. During the 50 years between 1973 and 2023, the dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 index produced a 9.17% average annual return, according to research from Hartford Funds. Non-dividend-paying stocks in the same index produced a paltry 4.27% average annual return over the same time frame.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAs I right this, Realty Income (NYSE: O), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Altria Group (NYSE: MO) offer an average dividend yield of 6.8%. These aren't the fastest-growing payouts you've ever seen but there's a good chance that all three businesses can continue raising distributions for at least another decade.\n\nRealty Income\n\nRealty Income is a net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that has been increasing its portfolio of commercial real estate since listing on the stock market in 1994. It's raised its monthly dividend payout every quarter of its publicly traded existence and, at recent prices, it offers a huge 5.8% dividend yield.\n\nRealty Income stock has been under pressure because, over the past five years, its dividend payout has increased by just 2.5% annually; earnings growth has been held back because interest rates shot higher in 2022 and 2023.\n\nRealty Income's dividend payout growth has been muted in recent years, but it could pick up the pace in the years ahead. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates four times in 2024 and further rate cuts are widely expected before the end of 2025.\n\nIn addition to potentially lower interest rates in the U.S., Realty Income has an attractive avenue for growth in Europe.\n\nPfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer have tumbled about 57% from a peak they set in 2021. The stock has been under pressure due to sales of COVID-19 products that declined sharply in recent years. Investors are also concerned about an upcoming patent cliff for Eliquis, a blood thinner Pfizer markets in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nAt its beaten-down price, Pfizer offers a huge 6.7% dividend yield. Earlier this year, Pfizer raised its dividend payout for the 16th consecutive year and further gains seem likely. The company reported total sales that rose by 7% last year. If we exclude declining sales of COVID-19 products, total revenue surged 12% year over year.\n\nThe first generic versions of Eliquis likely won't become available in the U.S. market until 2031. In the meantime, a slew of recently launched cancer treatments could more than offset upcoming Eliquis losses. For example, Pfizer announced this month that the Talapro-2 study proved that adding Talzenna to Xtandi improved prostate cancer patients' chance for long-term survival by 20% compared to Xtandi on its own.\n\nIn 2025, Pfizer expects adjusted earnings to come in between $2.80 and $3.00 per share. That's a lot more than it needs to meet a dividend commitment currently set at $1.72 per share. With a high yield upfront and growth drivers to push its needle forward, adding this stock to a diverse portfolio now and holding over the long run looks like a smart move.\n\nAltria Group\n\nCigarette smoking has been in decline for decades, but that hasn't stopped Altria Group from raising its dividend payout. Last August, the company that markets the Marlboro brand in the U.S. announced its 59th dividend increase in 55 years. At recent prices, the stock offers a juicy 7.7% yield and a pretty good chance for continued payout growth in the years ahead.\n\nTotal cigarettes sold in 2024 declined by 10.2%, but the powerful Marlboro brand allowed for rising prices that offset declining volume. Net of excise taxes, smokable product sales fell by just 0.8% year over year in 2024.\n\nWhile smokable product sales are declining slowly, sales of non-smokable products are driving growth for Altria Group. The company acquired the NJOY brand in 2023 and it's still one of just three e-cigarette brands authorized for sale in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nFourth-quarter NJOY consumables shipped grew 15.3% year over year. Thanks to price hikes on tobacco products and soaring NJOY sales, adjusted earnings grew 3.4% last year.\n\nManagement expects to repeat its well-understood playbook and raise adjusted earnings by 2% to 5% in 2025. This probably won't be the fastest-growing dividend payout in your portfolio, but growth at a pace that exceeds inflation seems likely. Adding some shares to a portfolio now to hold over the long run is probably the right move.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

While the finding raises concerns about potential transmission to humans, scientists emphasise that the virus currently poses a lower threat, according to a Reuters report.\n\nPublished in the journal Cell, the study highlights that the bat virus, named HKU5-CoV-2, shares a key feature with SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the furin cleavage site \u2014 which aids in cell entry via the ACE2 receptor. However, researchers noted that HKU5-CoV-2 does not infect human cells as efficiently as SARS-CoV-2.\n\nALSO READ Women are at higher risk of developing long covid as compared to men, new study shows\n\nLab experiments showed that the virus could infect human cells with high ACE2 levels, including models of human intestines and airways. The team also identified monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs that showed effectiveness against the bat virus in these tests.\n\nThe study, first reported by Bloomberg, had an immediate impact on financial markets, with shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers reacting to the news. Pfizer\u2019s stock rose 1.5%, Moderna jumped 5.3%, and Novavax gained about 1%, despite an overall market downturn.\n\nAddressing concerns about the possibility of another pandemic, Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, called the fears \u201coverblown.\u201d He pointed out that widespread immunity to SARS-related viruses in the population today reduces the risk compared to the pre-pandemic period in 2019.\n\nThe study also emphasised that HKU5-CoV-2 has significantly lower binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV-2 and lacks several adaptations necessary for efficient human transmission. Researchers concluded that while the virus warrants monitoring, the \u201crisk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.\u201d",

This new virus has not been observed in humans and has only been detected in a laboratory setting.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology is renowned for its research on coronaviruses, and some theories have suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic may have originated from this laboratory. According to the report, the new virus uses the same cell surface protein for entering human cells as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.\n\nChinese researchers working on this virus have expressed concerns that the similar transmission mechanism increases the likelihood of the virus eventually transferring to humans. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2, has a feature called the \u201cfurin cleavage site\u201d that aids in its entry into cells through the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, just like SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDuring an experiment in the laboratory, HKU5-CoV-2 infected human cells with high levels of the ACE2 receptor, as well as models of human gut and respiratory tract cells. Despite the similarities, researchers pointed out that the new virus does not enter human cells as easily as SARS-CoV-2, citing some limitations in its infection capabilities.\n\nFurther testing has led researchers to identify monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs that target this new bat virus strain. Following the discovery of this new coronavirus variant, shares in several vaccine companies, including Moderna, Novavax, BioNTech, and Pfizer, surged significantly.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the publication of this article in the journal Cell and the news of the new virus strain caused the stock values of COVID vaccine manufacturers to rise. Pfizer\u2019s stock increased by 1.5% on Friday, Moderna saw a 5.3% rise, and Novavax gained about 1% on a generally down market day.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns about the potential for another pandemic from this new virus have arisen, experts such as Dr. Michael Osterholm, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, have cautioned that these fears may be exaggerated. He noted that the population has significantly more immunity to viruses similar to SARS compared to 2019, which may reduce the risk of another widespread outbreak.",

No sales have been disclosed by Pfizer.\n\nPfizer intends to focus its resources on treatments it thinks \u201cwill have the greatest impact on patients,\u201d such as a new drug for hemophilia A called Hympavzi that was recently cleared, the spokesperson added.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nPfizer\u2019s decision to drop Beqvez essentially marks the company\u2019s exit from the field of virally delivered gene replacement treatments. The drugmaker backed away from early research in 2023 to focus its efforts on later-stage gene therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia A and hemophilia B.\n\nThose projects have now all been abandoned. Last July, Pfizer gave up developing the Duchenne therapy after disappointing data from Phase 3 testing, laying off some 150 employees in the process. Then, in January, it surprised partner Sangamo Therapeutics by handing back rights to the hemophilia A treatment, which was set to be submitted for regulatory approval.\n\nBeqvez remained, but Pfizer appears to have lost confidence in its sales potential. In explaining Pfizer\u2019s decision, the company spokesperson cited \u201cthe limited interest patients and their doctors have demonstrated in hemophilia gene therapies to date.\u201d\n\nTwo others are approved in the U.S.: Hemgenix, which is sold by CSL Behring for hemophilia B, and Roctavian, marketed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical for hemophilia A.\n\nSales of both have been slow. CSL hasn\u2019t broken out specific figures for Hemgenix, which carries a list price in the U.S. of $3.5 million. BioMarin reported $26 million in revenue for Roctavian, which it sells for $2.9 million. The company has limited sales to only the U.S., Italy and Germany, while ending most clinical development work as it focuses on other parts of its business.\n\nAll three therapies promise long-term control of bleeding by delivering functional copies of the genes mutated in people with the disease. Studies have proven them to be potent for at least several years, but hemophilia patients have other, effective treatments to choose from. And because of the way the therapies are built, patients may only be able to try one of the treatments, potentially incentivizing them to wait and see.\n\nPfizer said it will communicate its decision to the patients who are in the process of qualifying for Beqvez treatment. For anyone who was treated with the therapy in a clinical trial, Pfizer said it will continue to support the treatment sites in follow-up monitoring.\n\nPfizer has also informed Roche, which previously bought Spark, of its decision and is discussing the \u201cbest next steps\u201d for Beqvez.",

Image credit: Shutterstock/ ShU studio.\n\nPfizer will end the global commercialisation of its haemophilia gene therapy Beqvez (fidanacogene elaparvovec) amid low demand and interest.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson told Pharmaceutical Technology in a statement that the decision, which was first reported by Nikkei Asia on 20 February, was due to \u201climited interest patients and their doctors have demonstrated in haemophilia gene therapies to date\u201d.\n\nIndicated for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe haemophilia B, Beqvez was first approved by Health Canada in January 2024, and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) several months later. The European Commission approved the drug in July 2024, where it was previously known under the brand name Durveqtix.\n\nBeqvez was developed in partnership with the now Roche-owned Spark Therapeutics and is one of two gene therapies manufactured by Pfizer for the bleeding disorder. The US big pharma company also markets Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for the treatment of haemophilia A or B. Hympavzi, approved by the FDA in October 2024, will now be a focus of the company\u2019s gene therapy plans for this condition going forward.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to focus our efforts on and rededicate our time and resources to those treatments that we believe will have the greatest impact on patients, such as Hympavzi, a first-of-its-kind non-factor treatment option,\u201d the Pfizer spokesperson said.\n\nPfizer discontinuing Beqvez once again highlights the struggles pharma companies have in keeping cell and gene therapies profitable. Narrow target populations and scalability challenges mean sustained commercialisation of treatments is difficult. CSL has also reported slower-than-expected sales for Hemgenix, whilst BioMarin stopped investing further resources into haemophilia A gene therapy Roctavian focusing only on markets where it is reimbursed to make the drug profitable by the end of this year. Today [21 February], bluebird bio, a biotech that has two approved gene therapies in blood disorders, announced it will be acquired by two global investment firms to secure its future. This news came after the company had laid off 25% of its staff in 2024 after struggles to break even with cash flow.\n\nBeqvez works by providing patients with the necessary gene to produce factor IX (FIX), a protein that helps blood clot. Haemophilia B patients lack the FIX gene, meaning bleeds can start spontaneously and take longer to stop. Due to the condition being sex-linked, haemophilia B primarily affects males \u2013 around 33,000 men live with the disease in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Beqvez, administered as a one-time therapy, has demonstrated the ability to significantly decrease the number of bleeding episodes in a year.\n\nThe pharma industry turned its attention to Beqvez after Pfizer placed a hefty $3.5m price tag for the treatment. At the time, it became one of the two most expensive drugs in the world. Pfizer decided to match the price of CSL and uniQure\u2019s haemophilia B treatment Hemgenix, already at market after gaining FDA approval first in 2022, rather than undercutting its rivals.\n\nCell & Gene Therapy coverage on Pharmaceutical Technology is supported by Cytiva.\n\nEditorial content is independently produced and follows the highest standards of journalistic integrity.

At the end of 2024, the pharma walked away from its hemophilia A co-development pact with Sangamo Therapeutics forgiroctocogene fitelparvovec, designed to restore patients\u2019 ability to produce Factor VIII, a core clotting protein.\n\nPfizer did not explain at the time why it was abandoning Sangamo and its gene therapy, only noting that the move reflected the pharma\u2019s decision not to proceed with regulatory and commercial activities for giroctocogene fitelparvovec, Sangamo disclosed at the time.\n\nOutside of gene therapies, Pfizer seems to still see promise in hemophilia as a disease target. According to reporting from Reuters on Thursday, the pharma will continue to put money and time into Hympavzi, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that helps promote clotting, which the FDA in October 2024 cleared for hemophilia A and B in adults and adolescents. The drug is designed to be administered subcutaneously once per week.\n\nPfizer\u2019s move away from hemophilia gene therapies could be a sign of broader problems with the space. Roctavian, owned by BioMarin, became the industry\u2019s first-ever gene therapy approved for hemophilia A in June 2023\u2014only for the $2.9-million medicine to run into a largely unreceptive market. Following an underwhelming launch, the biotech in August 2024 rightsized its commercial efforts for Roctavian, focusing just on the U.S., German and Italian markets, where the gene therapy is approved and reimbursed.\n\nIn its most recent business report, covering the fourth quarter and full-year 2024, BioMarin reported $26 million in sales for Roctavian last year.\n\nElsewhere in the hemophilia space, Novo Nordisk earlier this month reported that its bispecific antibody Mim8 reduced bleeding events in pediatric patients. The pharma is preparing for regulatory submissions for Mim8 this year, which it will back with additional Phase III data underlining the antibody\u2019s efficacy in adults and adolescents. Like Hympavzi, Mim8 is not a one-time treatment; instead, it can be administered once per week, once every two weeks or once per month.",

Bleeds were eliminated in 60% of patients with fidanacogene elaparvovec as compared with 29% with prophylactic factor IX.\n\nThe withdrawal of fidanacogene elaparvovec leaves one gene therapy -- etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) -- approved for treatment of hemophilia B. It was approved in 2022 for adults who currently use factor IX prophylaxis therapy for blood clotting, those who have or have had life-threatening hemorrhage, and those who have repeated serious spontaneous bleeding episodes.\n\nMike Bassett is a staff writer focusing on oncology and hematology.

            "content": "Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been around for 175 years, but the company's revenue soared to its highest ever only in more recent times. Thanks to its coronavirus treatment and vaccine, the pharma giant reported more than $100 billion in revenue in 2022 at the peak of its pandemic success. Since that time, though, demand for these products has declined, and that's resulted in lower revenue and a drop in the Pfizer share price.\n\nRight now, as an investor, you may be wondering if you should take advantage of the stock's lower valuation and dive in or avoid this struggling stock. Before making any decisions, it's important to take a look at Pfizer's strategy and the company's prospects over time. Here are three things you need to know if you buy Pfizer today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA researcher works in a lab.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Coronavirus product growth shouldn't be a point of reference\n\nPfizer's revenue soared to a record level earlier in the pandemic, thanks to the company's market-leading vaccine and treatment. Those products continue to contribute to revenue, bringing in more than $5 billion each last year, for example. Though coronavirus products should continue to add to annual revenue, especially during flu season quarters later in the year, it's not realistic to expect the coronavirus products to deliver revenue today at the same levels as in earlier pandemic days.\n\nAll of this means that, when considering Pfizer's growth potential, the peak years of coronavirus sales shouldn't be the point of reference. Instead, it's a better idea to look at Pfizer's pre-pandemic sales and consider how the company could progress from that point in the years to come.\n\nWe can refer to full-year 2019 revenue of about $51 billion and the company's comments about potential revenue of more than $80 billion in non-COVID revenue by 2030. This represents an increase of about 55%. If Pfizer attains this goal, the stock could advance significantly over time.\n\n2. Pfizer is losing exclusivity on some major products -- but has planned for this moment\n\nA decline in coronavirus product revenue isn't Pfizer's only problem right now. The company also is set to lose exclusivity on certain blockbuster non-COVID-19 products, such as blood thinner Eliquis and breast cancer drug Ibrance. Pfizer even says this patent cliff represents $17 billion in lost sales from 2025 through 2030.\n\nHowever, Pfizer has been preparing for this headwind and aims to compensate and grow through the launch of new products and a recent move to reinforce its oncology business -- the purchase of cancer specialist Seagen. Pfizer's biggest launch period ever -- with 19 product releases over 18 months -- has set the stage for a new wave of growth. The company recently said one of its 2025 goals is to focus on research and development productivity and expects several catalysts this year, including at least four regulatory decisions and possibly nine phase 3 trial readouts.\n\nMeanwhile, the addition of Seagen's four commercialized drugs has significantly added to growth, with each product increasing revenue year over year. Also important to note, the company's Padcev, combined with antibody pembrolizumab, is the No. 1 prescribed first-line treatment in the U.S. for locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer. Late-stage studies could lead to an additional approval that would almost triple the potential U.S. patient group.\n\nThough Pfizer is set to lose on certain older products in the near term, the strategy to reinforce its pipeline and selection of commercialized drugs could help it score a win over the long term.\n\n3. The transformation won't happen overnight\n\nThe above two points are positive but will take time to fully boost Pfizer's growth. The pharma giant is still in the phase of realigning its costs following the declines in coronavirus product demand. Pfizer says it's on track to generate cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of this year as part of this ongoing plan.\n\nThe transformation may not happen overnight, and that means it may take Pfizer's stock a while to take off, too. Does this mean you should wait to buy Pfizer shares?\n\nNot necessarily. It's very difficult to time the market and get in on a stock at its very lowest price. That means it's important to buy when its valuation looks interesting, considering a company's future prospects. And today, trading at 8x forward earnings estimates (around its lowest in a year), Pfizer looks like a bargain buy for patient investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

If you meet these criteria, contact our Depo-Provera lawyers today at 800-553-8082 or contact us online.\n\nDepo Provera Lawsuit News and Updates for March 2025\n\nOur firm is committed to providing the latest news and updates on this new litigation. Here is what is happening right now:\n\nDirect Filing in the Depo Provera MDL\n\nMarch 14, 2025: Judge Rodgers issued Pretrial Order No. 10, allowing plaintiffs in the Depo Provera MDL 3140 to file their cases directly in the MDL rather than having to jump through the hoop of first filing in another federal district and waiting for transfer. This direct filing procedure is intended solely for pretrial coordination and consolidated discovery. Plaintiffs must identify their \u201cDesignated Forum\u201d\u2014the district where they would have filed initially their case\u2014ensuring that jurisdictional considerations remain intact. Additionally, Depo Provera attorneys admitted pro hac vice in other MDL cases may file directly without needing local counsel, reducing procedural hurdles.\n\nThis order significantly improves efficiency in the litigation by eliminating delays associated with case transfers, ensuring that all pretrial matters are handled uniformly in a single court. It also clarifies that direct filing does not waive Lexecon rights, meaning cases will still be remanded to their original districts for trial unless parties agree otherwise. Furthermore, defendants waive personal jurisdiction objections for pretrial proceedings, but they retain the right to challenge jurisdiction later, preserving their legal defenses. Importantly, direct filing does not alter choice of law principles, meaning statutes of limitations and other legal considerations will still be determined based on the plaintiff\u2019s original forum.\n\nThis streamlined approach is a standard practice in MDL class action lawsuits. Everyone wins, it is more efficient for plaintiffs, defendants, and the courts.\n\nLitigation Gets Moving: 10 Key Developments\n\nMarch 11, 2025:\n\nJudge Rodgers will demand that this litigation gets rolling and lawyers in the Depo Provera MDL are complying. Attorneys have already submitted a Joint Rule 26(f) Report outlining a proposed discovery plan and case management schedule. The report reflects significant progress in organizing the litigation, focusing on expediting discovery and ensuring a fair process for Plaintiffs alleging injuries from Depo-Provera, focusing, of course, on intracranial meningioma.\n\nThese are the top 10 areas of agreement:\n\nRule 26(f) Conference: The parties held a productive meeting on March 3, 2025, discussing critical issues such as discovery sequencing, document production, custodians, and ESI protocols. Plaintiffs provided early Rule 34 document requests to facilitate meaningful discovery discussions. Direct Filing and Service: The parties agreed to allow direct filing of cases into the MDL, which is a big deal for efficiency. Instead of Plaintiffs having to file in their home districts and then transfer their cases to the MDL (a slow and cumbersome process), they can now file directly into the centralized litigation. This streamlines the process and avoids unnecessary procedural delays. On the service of complaints, the parties decided to use BrownGreer\u2019s MDL Centrality platform, an electronic system that simplifies document management and tracking. This helps reduce delays that often occur with traditional methods of serving legal documents. In short, the system is designed to keep things moving quickly, which benefits Plaintiffs looking to push their cases forward without administrative bottlenecks. Pilot Case Schedule: The Pilot Cases will act as a testing ground for the litigation, setting a roadmap for how things will unfold in the broader MDL. The parties have agreed on key deadlines for: Amended complaints\n\nDiscovery\n\nExpert disclosures\n\nDispositive motions (motions that could potentially end the case before trial) A notable point of contention? Expert testimony and preemption. Plaintiffs argue that expert testimony is crucial to challenge Defendants\u2019 likely preemption defense (the argument that federal law prevents state-law claims). Defendants, unsurprisingly, claim expert testimony isn\u2019t necessary for this issue. This is a classic MDL battle\u2014Defendants want to shut the case down early using legal arguments, while Plaintiffs want a full evidentiary record to support their claims. Protective Orders and Confidentiality: The parties agreed on a confidentiality order to protect sensitive information, including provisions for phased privilege review and clawback protections under Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d). Threshold Proof of Use and Injury: Plaintiffs will complete a questionnaire to provide initial proof of Depo Provera use and meningioma injury. Defendants can challenge Plaintiffs who submit insufficient proof, but Plaintiffs have the right to fix issues before their cases are dismissed. This process is common in pharmaceutical MDLs. Defendants want to weed out weak claims early, while Plaintiffs push for flexibility to ensure legitimate cases are not thrown out over paperwork errors. This setup helps prevent frivolous claims and ensures that legitimate cases are not dismissed on technicalities. The fight over what constitutes \u201csufficient proof\u201d will likely be an issue in some cases but not many. Document Production and ESI Protocol: Defendants, particularly Pfizer, outlined their IT infrastructure and custodial data sources. Plaintiffs pushed for comprehensive document production, including non-custodial sources, and proposed an ESI protocol to ensure efficient and transparent discovery. The documents are really going to be key to finding out what Pfizer knew and when it knew it. Deposition Protocol: The parties agreed on a deposition schedule, with Plaintiffs securing 35 deposition days for Pfizer witnesses and additional days for other Defendants. Plaintiffs also ensured the right to videotape depositions and conduct remote depositions when necessary. Dismissal of Authorized Generic Distributors: Plaintiffs and Defendants Greenstone and Prasco discussed potential dismissal of these Defendants in cases where Plaintiffs did not use their products during the relevant periods. Science Day and Medical Monitoring: The parties agreed that a Science Day is unnecessary given the early focus on general causation discovery. Medical monitoring class actions will remain stayed (thankfully) pending resolution of common defenses. Special Master and CPA Appointment: The parties agreed to appoint Special Master David Herndon and CPA Randall Sansom to assist with case management and the Common Benefit Fund (how the MDL lawyers get paid for their work).\n\nWill things start happening quickly from here? No, if you are not used to the pace of mass torts. But compared to most MDLs, this litigation will likely proceed at a furious pace.\n\nAnother Unknown Depo Provera Side Effect?\n\nMarch 8, 2025: As lawsuits against Pfizer over Depo-Provera\u2019s link to meningioma brain tumors continue to grow, more evidence is emerging that the company may have downplayed other serious risks associated with its blockbuster birth control shot.\n\nA recently published case study highlights how a 21-year-old woman with no prior clotting history developed an extreme and life-threatening condition called Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens (PCD)\u2014a severe form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\u2014shortly after receiving a Depo-Provera injection. She suffered massive blood clots in her leg and lungs (pulmonary embolisms) and required multiple emergency procedures, including thrombectomy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and venoplasty. While Depo-Provera\u2019s label does include warnings about blood clots, those warnings are often less emphasized than those for estrogen-based contraceptives.\n\nThis case raises serious questions about whether Pfizer failed to fully disclose the scope of Depo-Provera\u2019s clotting risks, particularly for young women without traditional risk factors for thrombosis. Getting a DVT at age 21 certainly raises eyebrows. The connection between hormonal contraceptives and blood clot risks is well known, yet Depo-Provera has often been marketed as a safer alternative to combination birth control pills. However, research has suggested that progestin-only contraceptives\u2014including Depo-Provera\u2014may still increase the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly in women with underlying risk factors like obesity, smoking, or a genetic predisposition to clotting disorders.\n\nPfizer continued to sell Depo-Provera without adequately warning patients about the extent of these risks\u2014a pattern eerily similar to its handling of the drug\u2019s connection to intracranial tumors. If Pfizer failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the full scope of Depo-Provera\u2019s dangers, it would be yet another example of how the company prioritized profits over patient safety\u2014a concern that is central to the ongoing litigation.\n\nJudge Rodgers\u2019 Comment About Women Attorneys in Depo Shot Leadership Under Attack\n\nMarch 4, 2025: U.S. District Judge M. Casey Rodgers is facing a judicial misconduct complaint from the conservative group Article III Project after she issued an order emphasizing the need for female attorneys to be represented in leadership roles in the Depo-Provera multidistrict litigation. What is this about? Judge Rodgers stated in a February 23, 2025 order that \u201cfemales should be adequately represented within leadership.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs in this litigation are all women. This just makes sense, right? But according to Article III Project, this constitutes \u201cimpermissible bias and judicial misconduct,\u201d because it allegedly suggests that gender\u2014not merit\u2014should influence who leads the litigation. The group\u2019s complaint, submitted to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judicial conduct and disability review board, argues that Rodgers\u2019 remarks violate judicial impartiality and amount to improper favoritism.\n\nThis is nothing short of ridiculous. Rodgers\u2019 statement did not mandate female leadership, nor did it suggest that gender should be prioritized over qualifications\u2014it simply called for a balanced and diverse leadership team reflective of the plaintiffs involved in the litigation. Encouraging diversity in legal leadership is hardly controversial, and judges nationwide have been making similar efforts in multidistrict litigation. This complaint attempts to manufacture a scandal where none exists, attacking a judge for promoting inclusivity while ignoring the reality that legal leadership has long been dominated by men.\n\nDepo-Provera MDL Adds 8 Cases in First Month\n\nMarch 3, 2025: During its very first month of existence, 8 new cases were transferred into the Depo-Provera brain tumor class action MDL. There are now 78 total cases pending in the MDL. It will be very interesting to see how the monthly volume of new cases develops early in this litigation, which could have a large field of potential plaintiffs.\n\nFirst Depo Provera Case Management Order\n\nMarch 1, 2025: Judge Rodgers has issued Case Management Order No. 1, outlining the initial steps for organizing the proceedings. During a February 21, 2025, case management conference, the Court selected five pilot cases to guide the litigation\u2019s progress. The order mandates that all parties meet in person for a Rule 26 conference on March 3, 2025. The outcome of that meeting must be detailed in a Joint Rule 26 Report, which is due by March 7, 2025. A follow-up case management conference is scheduled for March 10, 2025, where the judge will discuss the Joint Rule 26 Report and next steps in the litigation. Additionally, the Court has invited submissions for a proposed Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers leadership slate, which must be filed by February 28, 2025. The judge will review the proposals before making a determination on leadership appointments.\n\nGet More Depo Provera Lawsuit Updates and News February 22, 2025: Another California Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, a Lawndale, California, woman alleges that her use of Depo-Provera caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. The plaintiff, who began receiving Depo-Provera injections in 2011, claims that she was never warned of the risks associated with the drug. According to the complaint, she developed severe headaches, dizziness, vision loss, hearing loss, poor coordination, and seizures, leading to the discovery of a meningioma in 2015. She subsequently underwent a craniotomy and six months of radiation therapy, suffering significant physical and financial hardship. This case was filed in California but will get transferred to the MDL in Florida. February 19, 2025: New Study Confirms Meningioma Risk A new study suggests that medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), the active ingredient in Depo-Provera, significantly increases the risk of meningioma, a type of brain tumor. Researchers analyzed medical records from 2006 to 2020, comparing women who used MPA with those who used a common oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel, EE-LNG). The results showed that women who used MPA for more than one year had a 3.55 times higher risk of developing meningiomas compared to EE-LNG users. This increased risk remained even for women who had used MPA for multiple years. The study controlled for factors like obesity, radiation exposure, and prior contraceptive use, reinforcing the association between MPA and meningiomas. The findings add to growing concerns about the safety of long-term MPA use, especially since meningiomas account for 40% of all brain tumors. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended adding a meningioma warning to the drug\u2019s label, but the U.S. FDA has yet to do so. This difference in regulatory action, as we talk more about below, raises questions about whether American patients are being adequately warned. Given these risks, women using Depo-Provera may want to consider alternative contraceptives and discuss their options with a healthcare provider. February 18, 2025: Magistrate Judge Hope T. Cannon Judge Cannon will be the magistrate judge in this litigation. This magistrate worked with Judge Rodgers in the 3M earplug litigation that recently settled. Judge Cannon was appointed as a United States Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Florida in 2019. February 17, 2025: Pretrial Order Judge Rodgers has issued Pretrial Order No. 4 to set up rules for handling all lawsuits related to Depo-Provera. This order ensures that all cases follow the same process and are managed efficiently. The court has created a master docket, which is like a central filing system where most legal documents will be submitted. If a filing applies to all cases, it will be labeled accordingly. If it only applies to some instances, it must be filed in both the master docket and the specific individual case docket assigned to that lawsuit. The order also adjusts the rules for out-of-state attorneys who want to represent plaintiffs in these cases. This is national litigation and most of the lawyers will not be barred in Florida. Typically, attorneys must provide a Certificate of Good Standing from their home state\u2019s bar association. Judge Rodgers has waived this requirement, which is commonplace in MDLs. Also, and this is a nice gesture, if an attorney has already paid a pro hac vice fee (which is the fee for a lawyer to appear in court without being licensed in that state) in another district for a Depo-Provera case, they do not have to pay it again in Florida. Attorneys who want to officially represent someone in the case must file a Notice of Appearance in each lawsuit they\u2019re handling. Those already licensed in Florida\u2019s Northern District don\u2019t need special approval, but they must still notify the court. Lastly, for serving legal documents (officially notifying defendants about the lawsuit), the court says the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure must be followed unless both sides agree on a different method. This order helps organize what is expected to be thousands of lawsuits about Depo-Provera. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are very amped up about this litigation, and we are excited to see it moving forward. February 10, 2025: How Many Depo Provera Plaintiffs? There was an estimate that came out today projecting the number of potential Depo-Provera meningioma cases, setting the projected range between 16,651 and 18,156 for progesterone receptor-positive cases, with a broader estimate spanning from 27,752 to 30,261 total cases within the 18-55 age demographic. This interesting projection operates on the premise that women who used Depo-Provera within this timeframe and were subsequently diagnosed with meningioma would have a more straightforward burden of proof compared to those who used the drug earlier in life and developed meningioma decades later. The estimate aims to be conservative by focusing on cases where the causal link may be more immediately evident based on existing scientific data. Of course, litigation success depends on more than just biological plausibility\u2014it requires clear and specific causation, which will be contested in court. Many cases will face challenges related to individual risk factors, gaps in medical documentation and proof of use, and alternative explanations for tumor development. Yet this estimate may also be too low. If the number of calls our law firm is getting from victims is any indication, it is indeed too low. We have been signing up new clients daily, even though we do not market other than provide information to victims online. So I wonder if this estimate fully accounts for delayed diagnoses or long-term users outside of the core demographic. February 8, 2025: Big Surprise \u2013 The MDL Will Be in Florida The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated more than 70 lawsuits alleging that Pfizer failed to warn patients and doctors about the risk of brain tumors associated with Depo-Provera, assigning the litigation to the Northern District of Florida under Judge M. Casey Rodgers. The decision comes after a jurisdictional debate, with Pfizer and generics maker Prasco advocating for New York, while most plaintiffs preferred California, where most of the lawsuits had been filed. A smaller group pushed for Florida, arguing that it was geographically neutral and not in the home jurisdiction of any defendants. We all expected the litigation to land in either New York or California. But the MDL Panel has a mind of its own. In its ruling, the JPML cited Judge Rodgers\u2019 extensive experience with large-scale MDLs, including the recent 3M earplug litigation, which led to a $6 billion settlement. The Panel is right about this. Judge Rodgers is widely recognized for her skill in handling complex litigation and measured approach to both plaintiffs and defendants. Her writing skills, organizational efficiency, and ability to manage large-scale cases have been praised in previous MDLs. The fact that she is nearing the conclusion of the massive 3M litigation likely made her an attractive choice, because she now presumably can oversee another major class action lawsuit. Plaintiffs and defendants are expected to get a fair shake with Judge Rodgers. February 5, 2025: Ohio Depo Shot Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday, an Ohio woman sued Pfizer alleging Depo-Provera caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. The plaintiff, a resident of Clinton County, Ohio, claims that she received Depo-Provera injections for contraception between 2008 and 2011, and again from 2022 through 2024, before being diagnosed with the tumor in November 2023. February 4, 2025: The European Double Standard Almost all women taking Depo-Provera in the U.S. had no idea what was happening in Europe, where similar progestogens have already been restricted or outright pulled from the market due to their link to brain tumors. In France, regulators removed three high-dose progestogens from shelves before the now-famous Roland study even dropped\u2014because, apparently, some countries do not need a neon sign flashing \u201cbrain tumors\u201d to take action. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and UK regulators updated Depo-Provera\u2019s label to warn about meningioma risks. January 30, 2025: JPML Hearing Is Today The JPML hearing was today. There will be an MDL. The question is where these federal lawsuits will be housed. During the hearing in Miami, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued that California is the most appropriate venue, as the majority of the over 70 Depo shot lawsuits are already filed there, and the state recognizes innovator liability\u2014allowing claims against the brand-name drug manufacturer even when plaintiffs took the generic version. They also noted that many affected women have undergone brain surgery and may face travel restrictions, making California a more accessible forum. Pfizer, as we have been telling you, really wants the litigation in New York where the company is headquartered. It argues that key witnesses and evidence are located there and that the litigation is not solely centered on California. One of the attorneys representing a generic drug manufacturer suggested that the early filings in California were a strategic move to influence venue selection. Pretending there is not some truth to this argument is silly. But that does not change the fact that California is a better venue for this litigation. The judges left few tea leaves\u2014some lawyers predicted New York, others predicted California. So we do not know where they will come down. We should know in the next few weeks their decision. January 29, 2025: Filing the Best Depo Provera Lawsuits First Attorneys are strategically filing the most compelling Depo-Provera lawsuits first, focusing on cases involving prolonged use, severe injuries, and well-documented medical histories. These lawsuits often center on women who received numerous injections over many years and subsequently developed multiple or large intracranial meningiomas, requiring invasive surgeries and long-term treatment. By prioritizing these high-impact birth control shot lawsuits, lawyers aim to highlight the serious risks associated with the birth control shot and the failure of Pfizer and other manufacturers to provide adequate warnings. These early lawsuits will likely shape the trajectory of the litigation, helping to establish liability and set the stage for future claims. January 28, 2025: Is It All About the Money? We discuss anticipated Depo-Provera settlement amounts in detail below. Some ask whether these cases are solely about the money victims may receive. The answer is both yes and no. These lawsuits serve a larger purpose: they help protect women by holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for their actions. But you must remember that in civil cases like these, financial compensation is the only form of justice available to victims. The time for sympathy or apologies from Pfizer and the other defendants has long passed. From our perspective, our mission is clear: to maximize the settlement compensation our clients deserve for their suffering. So, yes, in some ways, it is about the money\u2014but it is also about ensuring justice. January 21, 2025: New Depo Provera Class Action Lawsuit A new Depo-Provera class action lawsuit for medical monitoring has been filed to address potential long-term health risks associated with this birth control shot. This lawsuit differs from more traditional personal injury or wrongful death claims that our lawyers are involved with in that it seeks to establish a medical monitoring program rather than pursue compensation for injuries or deaths that have already occurred. This Depo-Provera meningioma class action focuses on creating a court-supervised medical monitoring program for individuals who used Depo-Provera for over a year and face an elevated risk of developing intracranial meningiomas, even though they have not yet been diagnosed with these brain tumors. It seeks proactive remedies, such as diagnostic screenings, early detection programs, and associated medical costs, rather than seeking damages for injuries already sustained. In contrast, personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits our lawyers are handling revolve around women who have already suffered specific harm, such as physical injuries, neurological complications, or fatalities linked to Depo-Provera usage. These cases aim to recover compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, and other damages directly related to the injuries or deaths caused by Depo-Provera. January 20, 2025: Pfizer\u2019s Claim in the MDL Pfizer claims that it sought to update Depo-Provera\u2019s label to warn of the risk of meningiomas, but the FDA blocked the proposed update due to insufficient evidence. Pfizer is setting up its preemption defense\u2014a legal argument asserting that federal regulatory decisions shield the company from liability under state law. Essentially, Pfizer argues that because the FDA allegedly overruled its attempt to warn, it cannot be held responsible for failing to include the warning. However, preemption defenses in pharmaceutical product liability cases are rarely successful. Courts often scrutinize such claims closely, requiring clear and compelling evidence that the FDA explicitly prohibited a manufacturer from issuing a stronger warning. Pfizer has not produced all the information to support its claim. So our guess is that when Pfizer starts producing documents, it will not come out as clean as it now suggests. This would be a double-edged sword for Pfizer. Pfizer\u2019s reliance on this defense may suggest an acknowledgment that Depo-Provera was linked to significant harm, such as brain tumors in women who used the product. Plaintiffs have more claims in this litigation than just failure to warn. January 16, 2025: How Does Depo Provera Cause Meningioma? Scientists believe that the link between Depo Provera and meningioma arises from its high levels of synthetic progestin, which mimics the progesterone. Meningiomas are known to express hormone receptors for both progesterone and estrogen. When exposed to elevated hormone levels, these receptors can stimulate tumor growth. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to high doses of progesterone can over-activate these receptors, creating a biological environment conducive to tumor development. In essence, each injection of Depo Provera acts like adding fuel to a fire, compounding the risk with every dose. The study that triggered this litigation shows a dose-response relationship: the more injections a woman receives, the higher her risk of developing a meningioma. This explains why cases involving just one injection are exceedingly rare. Many women got just one shot. But our lawyers are getting virtually no calls linking that level of exposure to a brain tumor. It is the cumulative effect of synthetic progestin exposure that makes long-term use particularly dangerous and underpins the growing wave of Depo birth control lawsuits. Many women who have used Depo Provera for over 15 years have reported symptoms consistent with meningioma diagnoses. While anecdotal, these accounts align closely with scientific research, which mirrors patterns observed in other hormone-sensitive conditions, such as breast and uterine cancers. Prolonged hormone exposure is a well-established risk factor for these diseases, and the parallels to Depo Provera\u2019s link to meningioma are difficult to ignore. From a legal perspective, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys do not need to establish the exact biological mechanism behind the association. We just need to prove the strong connection between Depo Provera and meningiomas. But jurors want to know: How does this happen? This litigation is just getting started, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are already poised to answer that question for jurors. January 12, 2025: New Lawsuit in Boston In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the District of Massachusetts, a Woburn woman initiated claims against several pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer Inc., Viatris Inc., Greenstone LLC, and Prasco LLC, over alleged injuries caused by Depo Provera. The plaintiff alleges that prolonged use of the medication, administered between 1996 and 2005, caused her to develop an intracranial meningioma. While there is a pending MDL motion, there is a good argument that plaintiffs\u2019 Depo Provera lawyers should wait until next month before filing any lawsuits outside of California (and right next to New York) because we are arguing the MDL should be there. Hopefully, MDL coordination will help everyone get on the same page. January 10, 2025: MDL Panel Hearing The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) hearing to consider centralizing the growing number of lawsuits under MDL No. 314 will be in Miami, Florida, on January 30, 2025, in the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. U.S. Courthouse. You can expect the Panel to approve the MDL. Even Pfizer agrees there needs to be an MDL to manage so many Depo Provera lawsuits. The remaining drama is whether the Depo shot meningioma lawsuits will be housed in New York or California, as we discuss more below. How will a Depo Provera class action lawsuit work? Again, it is not definitionally a class action lawsuit. The Depo Provera litigation is set to proceed as an MDL, or multidistrict litigation, which is the preferred approach for handling large-scale pharmaceutical cases involving numerous plaintiffs and complex claims. Unlike a class action lawsuit, where one representative litigates on behalf of the entire group, an MDL consolidates cases for pre-trial proceedings under one federal judge while allowing each plaintiff to retain their individual claim. This approach is particularly well-suited for Pfizer Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuits, where injuries like meningiomas linked to high-dose progestin vary significantly in severity and damages. January 8, 2025: Inoperable Brain Tumors Our attorneys are getting more calls from women with inoperable meningiomas than we expected. These tumors cannot be safely removed because of their proximity to critical brain structures. Positioned near vital areas like the optic nerves, brainstem, or major blood vessels, they make surgical intervention too dangerous. These will be strong claims because they can cause significant physical and emotional suffering. These women only have limited options, such as radiation therapy or long-term monitoring, for hopefully definitive relief. Women affected by these tumors frequently endure debilitating symptoms, including severe headaches, vision loss, memory problems, and other neurological impairments, adding to the ongoing challenges of living with this condition. January 3, 2025: New Depo Provera Brain Tumor Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in San Diego, California, a plaintiff alleges that the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, along with related entities Pharmacia & Upjohn and Pharmacia LLC, failed to warn about the significant health risks of Depo-Provera. The plaintiff, who received quarterly injections of Depo-Provera between 2009 and 2015, claims that Pfizer and related entities failed to warn her or her healthcare providers about the risks associated with long-term use of these injections. According to the complaint, the plaintiff began experiencing severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, and lethargy before a 2015 MRI revealed a meningioma. She underwent invasive brain surgery to remove the tumor, which resulted in ongoing medical challenges, including the need for regular monitoring and imaging. The lawsuit further claims that Pfizer and its predecessors knew or should have known for decades that medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), the active ingredient in Depo-Provera, was associated with an increased risk of developing meningiomas. Despite evidence from multiple studies and international regulatory actions, including labeling updates in the European Union and Canada, Pfizer allegedly failed to update U.S. labels or issue adequate warnings. The plaintiff contends that safer alternatives to Depo-Provera, such as a lower-dose version (Depo-SubQ Provera 104), were available but were not promoted or widely prescribed. She argues that had she been informed of the risks, she would have chosen alternative contraceptive methods. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for her physical, emotional, and economic losses, as well as for Pfizer\u2019s alleged negligence, failure to warn, and defective product design. January 1, 2025: Depo-Provera Litigation Gaining Traction The Depo-Provera litigation is picking up significant momentum as more plaintiffs come forward with claims that the birth control shot caused them to develop meningiomas. The increasing number of lawsuits suggests that the scientific evidence linking Depo-Provera to brain tumors is strong enough to sustain significant litigation. With multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceedings likely, attorneys expect a streamlined process that will allow these cases to move forward efficiently. Several factors are contributing to the rapid expansion of this litigation. First, more women are recognizing the connection between their long-term use of Depo-Provera and their brain tumor diagnoses. Second, regulatory actions in Europe\u2014where Depo-Provera now carries a warning for meningioma risk\u2014are increasing pressure on Pfizer to acknowledge these risks in the United States. Finally, expert testimony and epidemiological studies continue to reinforce the causal link between synthetic progestin exposure and tumor development, strengthening the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This growing litigation signals a significant challenge for Pfizer and its co-defendants, as the legal landscape for hormone-based contraceptive litigation continues to evolve. With a rising number of plaintiffs and mounting scientific evidence, the Depo-Provera lawsuits could develop into one of the most significant pharmaceutical mass tort cases of the decade. December 30, 2024: Pfizer Foreshadows Preemption Defense in JPML Response Pfizer recently filed a response to the MDL petition, which pushed for New York as the better venue for the Depo Provera brain tumor MDL. In that response, however, Pfizer\u2019s defense lawyers made a very deliberate point of laying out the outline of what will likely be an affirmative defense based on the federal preemption doctrine. The preemption defense is common in drug litigation. It basically involves the drug manufacturer arguing that they cannot be sued for failure to warn under state law, because changes to a drug warning label are governed by federal law and the FDA. Based on the long preamble to the JPML filing, Pfizer is going to argue that the failure to warn claims should be dismissed because they asked the FDA for authorization to put a warning about meningioma on the Depo Provera warning label, but the FDA \u201crejected\u201d that request. Preemption defenses are rarely successful in pharmaceutical injury litigation. December 7, 2024: New Lawsuit in Pennsylvania State Court As we have been saying, we expect a substantial Depo Provera docket in Philadelphia. On Thursday, a new Depo shot lawsuit was filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County. A Philadelphia resident alleges that prolonged use of the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera caused her to develop a debilitating meningioma. The plaintiff, who began these injections as a teenager, claims that the manufacturers, including Pfizer and several associated companies, failed to adequately warn of the risks linked to the synthetic hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate, the active ingredient in Depo-Provera. The plaintiff, who underwent multiple brain surgeries and suffers from ongoing physical and cognitive impairments, seeks compensatory and punitive damages for her injuries. The lawsuit also includes claims against healthcare providers affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System for their alleged failure to disclose safer contraceptive alternatives. December 2, 2024: California Woman Files New Depo Provera Lawsuit In a new lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. Central District of California, a Santa Clarita, California woman has brought claims against Pfizer, Viatris, Greenstone, Prasco, Pharmacia & Upjohn, and Pharmacia for serious injuries allegedly caused by the Depo shot. The plaintiff alleges that her long-term use of the drug, which contains a high dose of synthetic progestin, led to the development of two intracranial meningiomas\u2014tumors requiring invasive brain surgery. The lawsuit asserts that the defendants knew for decades about the risks of meningiomas associated with Depo Provera but failed to provide adequate warnings to physicians or patients in the United States, despite labels in the EU and Canada identifying these risks. The plaintiff claims she was administered approximately 76 injections over 19 years, which she believes substantially contributed to her injuries. Again, the Depo lawsuits you are seeing filed are the cases with long-term usage and this case is obviously no exception. She underwent complex surgical treatment to remove the tumors and continues to experience vision loss and other complications. The complaint highlights several studies dating back to the 1980s that documented the relationship between progestin-based drugs and meningiomas, alleging that the defendants failed to investigate these risks or alert the medical community. The plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages for negligence, failure to warn, and strict liability, among other claims, and argues that the defendants could have mitigated risks by promoting safer alternatives like the lower-dose Depo-SubQ Provera 104 formulation. November 30, 2024: Depo Provera Class Action MDL Sought in Northern California We have been talking about where the Pfizer Depo Provera class action lawsuit might be. The focus has been on northern or central California. A motion has been filed requesting the coordination of over 20 lawsuits related to the contraceptive Depo-Provera in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The motion, submitted to the MDL Panel, seeks to consolidate the cases under one judge in California, citing the high number of cases already filed in the state and the unique innovator liability laws that allow plaintiffs to sue the brand-name manufacturer, Pfizer, even if they used the generic version of the drug. The motion references 22 lawsuits, with 18 filed in California and six specifically in the Northern District. Other cases are pending, as we talk about below, in Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Nevada. The argument for consolidation also points to California as a key jurisdiction for the anticipated influx of thousands of cases, given the large number of women who have used Depo Provera and the recent study linking the drug to a 550% increased risk of intracranial meningiomas. November 25, 2024: ACOG Disappoints Last week, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) addressed the study indicating that Depo-Provera users may face a 5.5-fold increased risk of developing meningioma compared to non-users. Regrettably, ACOG\u2019s communication downplays this significant finding by presenting the risk as \u201cfive out of 10,000 women using medroxyprogesterone acetate may develop meningioma compared to one out of 10,000 women not using the medication.\u201d This framing minimizes the relative risk increase, potentially leading patients to underestimate the seriousness of the association. The study says you may be 5.5 times more likely to get a brain tumor. Why not just say that? Additionally, ACOG\u2019s characterization of meningiomas as \u201cbenign\u201d neglects the severe physical, emotional, and financial burdens that these tumors can impose. There is nothing benign about the hardships endured by women calling our law firm daily living with the consequences of these growths. Given the statistical significance of the study\u2019s findings, ACOG should provide clear and comprehensive information that honestly reflects the concern. ACOG does good work, but things like this leave them open to attacks that their primary purpose is preventing malpractice lawsuits and protecting their pharmaceutical friends. November 18, 2024: Why 150 Milligrams? Depo-Provera is administered at a 150 mg dose via intramuscular injection, delivering a potent and prolonged release of progestin into the bloodstream. But why exactly was this dosage chosen? The 150 mg figure seems arbitrary, especially considering that lower-dose alternatives, like Depo-SubQ Provera 104, have been shown to be effective. If contraception can be achieved at a lower dose, why did Pfizer stick with such a high amount? This raises critical questions that need to be addressed in pretrial discovery. Was this dose ever rigorously tested against lower doses in clinical trials to assess whether it was truly necessary? Or was the 150 mg dose simply a relic of early formulations that Pfizer never felt compelled to re-evaluate? Given the increasing number of lawsuits linking Depo-Provera to serious health risks, including brain tumors, it is crucial to determine whether this high dosage played a role in amplifying those risks. If there were safer alternatives, and Pfizer ignored them, that would be a significant piece of the liability puzzle in this litigation. November 14, 2024: Projected Number of Depo-Provera Lawsuits Depo Provera lawyers are trying to determine just how many possible lawsuits there could be. As we discuss in more detail below, this litigation was triggered by a study reporting that medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) increases the risk of meningioma by a statistically stunning 5.5 times. So let\u2019s walk through this. There are approximately 2-3 million prescriptions for Depo-Provera filled annually in the United States. The overall incidence of meningioma in the US is estimated to be around 9.5 per 100,000 people per year. If we assume that the increased risk applies uniformly to all users of Depo-Provera, then for every 100,000 Depo-Provera users, approximately 52.25 cases of meningioma could occur each year. This figure is derived by applying the 5.5-fold increase in risk to the baseline incidence rate (9.5 per 100,000). Is this calculation underestimating the real impact? Based on the number of victims already calling our attorneys to discuss filing a Depo-Provera compensation claim, this estimate might be low. Our lawyers just began speaking with affected individuals for over a month and we have nearly 100 signed claims. That is an unscientific way to look at it. Still, this much volume suggests that either the calculated number of cases underrepresents the reality, or a lot of women are now making the connection between their symptoms and Depo-Provera use. November 13, 2024: Pfizer\u2019s Post-Market Surveillance One of the central questions in this litigation will be whether Pfizer\u2019s internal safety monitoring systems were sufficient to detect and respond to early reports linking Depo Provera to meningiomas. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will closely scrutinize Pfizer\u2019s pharmacovigilance practices\u2014its post-market surveillance efforts\u2014to determine whether the company adequately identified and assessed brain tumor risks or whether it ignored red flags that warranted further investigation. As discovery progresses, Depo Provera lawyers will really be drilling down to analyze Pfizer\u2019s internal documents, communications, and adverse event reports. Did Pfizer entirely overlook the problem or, more likely, become aware of a potential link between Depo-Provera and meningiomas but fail to take appropriate action? It will be interesting to see whether Pfizer\u2019s monitoring mechanisms were designed to detect long-term risks associated with synthetic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate, the active ingredient in Depo Provera. I think we know what the answer will be. Bear in mind plaintiffs do not need to prove that Depo Provera should never have been brought to market or that the drug should be recalled. Liability will hinge on whether Pfizer either knew or should have known about a significant risk of meningiomas and failed to adequately warn physicians and patients. If evidence shows that Pfizer had sufficient data suggesting an increased brain tumor risk and still chose not to update its warning label or conduct further safety studies, it will be held accountable for failing to uphold its duty to ensure patient safety. November 12, 2024: Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 There will be a lot of focus in this litigation on Depo Sub-Q Provera 104. This is a lower-dose version of the popular Depo-Provera contraceptive injection, designed to be administered subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly. It contains 104 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, compared to the 150 mg dose in the traditional Depo-Provera, and is injected into the fatty layer just below the skin. Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 is seemingly much safer. It likely carries a significantly lower brain tumor risk. Meningioma is associated with high cumulative doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate over time. Depo Sub-Q Provera 104 delivers a reduced dose (104 mg rather than 150 mg), which not only provides effective contraception but also exposes users to lower levels of synthetic progestin per injection. Why wouldn\u2019t Pfizer push for the better product? The most logical explanation is profit-driven motives. The original Depo-Provera has been well-established in the contraceptive market for years, with a strong user base and widespread recognition. Introducing a new formulation might not have been seen as necessary to maintain market share. There were also risks. The product\u2019s lower dosage and more convenient subcutaneous administration offer patients advantages. But these same features may extend the time between necessary doses, reducing repeat purchases, which risks shrinking revenue per patient over time. Another fear may have been that the subcutaneous administration of Depo Sub-Q could require additional training for healthcare providers and patients. Ensuring proper usage and addressing potential concerns about self-administration may have posed logistical challenges that could impact sales. You can bet this was a focus on in-house discussions within Pfizer. Depo Provera lawyers will have a lot of questions about this when Pfizer corporate representatives are deposed and there will be a lot of internal documents that will flush this out. November 7, 2024: Questions You Have About Filing a Depo Provera Lawsuit A bit less formally, our lawyers answer the 12 most common questions women have about filing a Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuit. November 5, 2024: New Depo Provera Lawsuit Filed in California In a new Depo Provera lawsuit, a Fontana, California woman claims Depo-Provera caused her to develop a life-threatening brain tumor. She says that the companies responsible, including Pfizer, Viatris, and their affiliates, failed to disclose the risks despite decades of scientific evidence linking the drug to meningioma. According to the suit, the plaintiff used Depo-Provera injections from 1999 to 2018, after which she began to suffer neurological symptoms that led to the discovery of a sizeable intracranial meningioma requiring invasive surgery. Where should a Depo Provera MDL be located? This case was filed in the Northern District of California, which increasingly looks like the best option. If this is how it plays out, any Depo shot lawsuit filed in federal court in Texas, New York, Florida, or anywhere else in the country would be transferred for pretrial handling in California. October 31, 2024 \u2013 European Warning As we have talked about, Pfizer has implemented label changes for Depo-Provera in the European Union and the United Kingdom, along with potential updates in other regions. The added cautionary language under \u201cSpecial warnings and precautions for use\u201d in the EU label states: \u201cMeningioma: Meningiomas have been reported following long-term administration of progestogens, including medroxyprogesterone acetate. Depo-Provera should be discontinued if a meningioma is diagnosed. Caution is advised when recommending Depo-Provera to patients with a history of meningioma.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will, with good reason, continue to pound Pfizer over the head with this. The optics of warning there and not warning here are just awful. But the reality is this wording is vague and falls short of addressing the severity of the risk. The label merely suggests \u201ccaution\u201d in prescribing Depo-Provera to patients with a history of meningioma without any strong warnings about the drug\u2019s potential to cause these tumors, even in those without such a history. It advises discontinuation only after diagnosis, disregarding the likelihood of irreversible harm by that stage. Pfizer needs a stronger, more explicit warning on this product everywhere that provides a real warning of the risk of meningioma. If it chooses to give this watered-down warning in the U.S.\u2014and there will be a warning, eventually\u2014plaintiffs\u2019 Depo Provera lawyers will correctly view it as no warning at all. October 30, 2024: Depo Provera Design Defect Claim The core of every Depo Provera lawsuit is Pfizer\u2019s failure to warn. But there is also a strong strict liability design defect claim in this litigation. A strict liability design defect claim asserts that a product was inherently dangerous due to its design, making it unreasonably unsafe for consumers even if the manufacturer exercised care during production. In the Depo Provera litigation, the claim is that the drug\u2019s design\u2014particularly the high dose of progestin\u2014was unreasonably dangerous, posing a risk of serious health issues like intracranial meningioma. Could the product be made safer? Yes. Pfizer has already made the product safer. Depo-SubQ Provera 104 uses a lower dose and can be injected subcutaneously. Pfizer allegedly promoted the high-dose version, neglecting to warn the medical community and consumers about potential risks. So a key claim in every Depo Provera suit will be that Pfizer should have either promoted the subcutaneous option or redesigned the original formula to mitigate the risks. Moreover, Depo Provera lawyers will claim that Pfizer avoided marketing the safer alternative to maintain its market share and did not fully disclose these safety concerns. Thus, under strict liability for a design defect, the plaintiffs argue that Pfizer is responsible for the injuries caused by Depo Provera due to the inherent risks associated with its design. These strict liability design defect claims for Depo-Provera are especially compelling because the safer alternative is not a competitor\u2019s product. It came from Pfizer itself. Usually, proving that a safer design exists in a design defect case is tough. It often means comparing apples and oranges across different manufacturers. But here, Pfizer had already developed and received approval for Depo-SubQ Provera 104, a version with a lower dose that significantly reduces risks of severe side effects, like intracranial meningioma. This internal comparison within Pfizer\u2019s own lineup underscores the questions: why wasn\u2019t the safer alternative the standard choice made for the generic and how can Pfizer feign protection as a generic manufacturer? October 29, 2024: When to File for a Depo Provera Class Action? Why haven\u2019t lawyers filed for a Depo Provera class action lawsuit? The main reason lawyers have not filed for a Depo Provera class action\u2014more technically, as we discuss below, a multidistrict litigation (MDL)\u2014is mainly due to the current lack of \u201cnumerosity\u201d in active claims. Right now, there are only three Depo Provera lawsuits in federal court. For an MDL to be established, there must be a certain critical mass, or numerosity, of similar lawsuits filed nationwide. While more plaintiffs are sure to emerge, perhaps thousands, this is not necessarily enough to persuade the MDL Panel that decides these things. As we talk about below, our lawyers expect there will be a good number of Depo Provera brain tumor lawsuits filed in state court in Pennsylvania. October 27, 2024: Depo Provera Attorney Advertisement Underscore the High Hopes for Depo Provera Settlements If you are a woman between 18-55 and on Facebook, it is hard to imagine you have not seen an advertisement for Depo Provera lawsuits. (Our law firm does not advertise. Our clients are lawyer referrals, word-of-mouth, and this website.) As we discuss below, the average verdict or settlement payout in a meningioma lawsuit is $3 million. The possible number of lawsuits, the ability of Pfizer to pay settlement and jury awards, and the compensation successful cases may bring are attracting many attorneys to this litigation. October 21, 2024: When Will a Meningioma Warning Be Added? The absence of a meningioma warning on the U.S. label of Depo-Provera, despite its inclusion on European labels, raises real concerns regarding patient safety and transparency. In Europe, Pfizer has proactively updated Depo-Provera\u2019s label to reflect the potential risk of meningiomas, likely in response to emerging research and regulatory pressure. In the United States, the FDA has yet to mandate a similar warning\u2014and Pfizer has not sought one\u2014even though studies linking hormonal contraceptives to meningioma risk have been circulating for years, even before this new study. The optics are terrible for Pfizer. The FDA should require a warning on Depo Provera today. October 11, 2024: Two Shots or Four? Depo-Provera lawyers are debating the criteria for determining eligibility in meningioma lawsuits, specifically the number of injections required to establish a causal relationship. While evidence points to a dose-response relationship between Depo-Provera use and a heightened risk of meningioma, the exact threshold for this risk remains unsettled. Our law firm has set the criteria at two shots for two main reasons. First, the science does not definitively establish the minimum number of injections that could trigger meningioma development. With such uncertainty, it is safer to err on the side of allowing more women the opportunity to seek justice. More importantly, the pivotal study indicates a risk ratio of 5.5, translating to a 450% increase in risk\u2014an alarming figure that far exceeds typical risk increases in similar studies. Considering this elevated risk, if a woman developed meningioma after just two shots of Depo-Provera and lacks other significant risk factors\u2014such as radiation exposure or rare genetic conditions associated with meningioma\u2014it would be like handing a jury a jigsaw puzzle with only one piece missing. The conclusion they will almost certainly draw is that Depo-Provera is the missing piece causing the tumor. October 8, 2024: Depo Provera Lawsuit Statute of Limitations Many women contacting us are worried about the deadline for filing a Depo-Provera lawsuit. Lawyers are always concerned about the statute of limitations. But there should not be many statute of limitations issues in this case for women acting now. There are two primary reasons why the statute of limitations should not be a significant concern. The first reason is the discovery rule, which every state has, in varying forms. The discovery rule is a legal principle that delays the start of the statute of limitations until a plaintiff knows, or reasonably should know, about both the injury and its connection to the defendant\u2019s conduct. In the context of Depo-Provera meningioma lawsuits, women who developed brain tumors could not have reasonably suspected the link between their condition and Depo-Provera until recent scientific studies were published. Before these studies, neither the public nor the medical community widely recognized that Depo-Provera could be associated with brain tumors, making it unreasonable for plaintiffs to connect their diagnosis to the drug years earlier. The second reason is the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. We can convincingly argue that the defendants\u2014manufacturers, and marketers of the Depo shot\u2014willfully, intentionally, and deliberately concealed the known risks associated with the long-term use of Depo-Provera. By asserting that the defendants actively hid safety-related warnings, manipulated product labeling, and intentionally withheld crucial information regarding the dangers of intracranial meningiomas, fraudulent concealment allows the statute of limitations to be \u201ctolled\u201d or paused because the defendants\u2019 deceptive actions prevented the plaintiffs from knowing about their potential claims. October 6, 2024: Depo Provera Lawsuits in Philadelphia You are likely to see a large number of lawsuits from all over the country filed in state court in Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Why would a case in Texas, New York, or California be filed in Pennsylvania state court? The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas is known for its experienced judiciary in handling complex mass tort and product liability cases, making it an attractive venue for plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. The court\u2019s Complex Litigation Center (CLC) is widely regarded for its efficient management of large caseloads and has historically rendered significant verdicts and settlements in favor of plaintiffs. Why are plaintiffs from other jurisdictions allowed to file in Pennsylvania? One of the defendants in the litigation, Viatris Inc., has its headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which allows plaintiffs to sue all defendants in state court in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has procedural laws that provide some flexibility in consolidating cases, which can streamline litigation and make it more cost-effective for plaintiffs. Additionally, the state\u2019s rules on expert testimony are often considered more favorable to plaintiffs, making it easier to present scientific evidence that might be challenged under stricter standards in federal court (although that does not appear to be a concern in this litigation). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Philadelphia juries are often regarded as being particularly empathetic and fair to individuals who have suffered harm due to corporate negligence. Known for their willingness to hold large companies accountable, these juries tend to take a hard look at the impact on victims, making the city an attractive venue for plaintiffs seeking justice against powerful corporate defendants. Our lawyers have seen time and time again how this reputation can significantly influence the dynamics of litigation and settlement discussions. Pfizer and the other defendants may see the risk of facing a jury trial in Philadelphia as a compelling reason to make fair Depo Provera settlement offers. So, ultimately, what our attorneys think you will see is a Depo Provera federal class action-type lawsuit (an MDL) and mini-class actions in various state courts around the country. October 1, 2024: Lawyers Seek Compensation For Generic Depo-Provera Users Can you sue for failure to warn if you were taking generic Depo Provera? Usually, the answer to this question is no. But plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have an argument around this problem to seek compensation for victims who used a generic. The allegation is that Pfizer used its subsidiaries, Greenstone and Prasco, to market an \u201cauthorized generic\u201d version of the drug. This generic is chemically identical to the brand-name product but sold under a generic label. By doing so, Pfizer maintained market dominance and revenue while limiting liability for labeling and safety warnings, thus exposing consumers to the same risks without adequate disclosure. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will contend that even if an \u201cauthorized generic\u201d is marketed by a subsidiary, Pfizer still has a duty to ensure that all versions of the drug, branded or not, contain appropriate warnings about known risks, such as the increased risk of meningiomas. So these lawsuits will contend that Pfizer failed to include critical warnings about the risk of meningiomas on Depo Provera\u2019s label, and this omission extended to the authorized generics distributed by Greenstone and Prasco. It certainly follows that Pfizer should be liable for these failures because the authorized generic was essentially the same product under Pfizer\u2019s control. September 25, 2024: Will There Be a Depo Provera Class Action Lawsuit? Most likely, this litigation will be consolidated in an MDL. Why not a class action lawsuit? A Depo-Provera class action lawsuit would combine all plaintiffs into a single, unified case, with one trial or settlement covering everyone. Any compensation would be divided equally among participants, regardless of individual circumstances. That does not work because the injuries women have suffered are so different. An MDL works differently, allowing each plaintiff to retain their individual case, meaning their injuries and damages are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In an MDL, pretrial proceedings are consolidated to make the process more efficient, but the cases remain separate. Individual cases still proceed to trial if a global settlement is not reached. This structure just makes more sense in a case like this. In addition to federal MDLs, state MDLs can also be created when enough cases are filed within a single state court system. State MDLs follow a similar process by grouping related cases under one judge for pretrial proceedings, but they remain within the jurisdiction of state courts rather than federal ones. This can happen in the Depo Provera litigation in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, where some Depo Provera corporate defendants reside so they can be sued there. In large pharmaceutical litigations like Depo-Provera, it\u2019s common to see parallel MDLs at both the state and federal levels, each working toward a global resolution or individual trial outcomes. September 22, 2024: Why Pfizer Should Be Responsible for the Generics It Owns Many authorized generic manufacturers involved in the Depo-Provera litigation\u2014Greenstone, Viatris, and Prasco\u2014are directly or indirectly connected to Pfizer, giving the pharmaceutical giant significant control over how these generics are manufactured, marketed, and labeled. Greenstone was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer and operated under Pfizer\u2019s infrastructure, with its personnel reporting directly to Pfizer. Even after Greenstone was merged into Viatris through a spinoff in 2020, Pfizer retained a reported 57% ownership stake in Viatris, making it the majority stakeholder. Prasco, another authorized generic distributor, also relied heavily on Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing and product pipeline to market \u201cgeneric\u201d versions of Depo-Provera. Because Pfizer maintained control over these entities and their operations, it is reasonable to hold Pfizer responsible for any failures to warn associated with these products. Pfizer\u2019s influence extends beyond manufacturing. These generics did not simply replicate the original drug. They operated under Pfizer\u2019s direct oversight, using identical formulations and infrastructure. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers can effectively argue that because these companies acted as extensions of Pfizer\u2019s business, any failure to update the original Depo-Provera label with appropriate warnings about meningiomas also applies to the generics. Pfizer should not pretend it could not change the warning for the generics when it could change the warning for Depo Provera. It would be the height of insanity to let Pfizer shift liability to its subsidiaries or partners when it actively benefited from and de facto controlled their operations, creating a coordinated distribution network that profited handsomely from misleading labels across all product versions. April 25, 2024: Pfizer Releases Public Statement Addressing Links To Meningioma Brain Tumors The maker of Depo-Provera, Pfizer, released a public statement addressing the new BMJ study linking the birth control shot to meningioma brain tumors. Among other things, the statement from Pfizer indicated: \u201cWe are aware of this potential risk associated with long-term use of progestogens and, in collaboration with regulatory agencies, are in the process of updating product labels and patient information leaflets with appropriate wording.\u201d March 29, 2024: British Medical Journal Finds Link Between Prolonged Use Of Depo-Provera And Increased Risk Of Brain Tumors A study published in the British Medical Journal found that prolonged use of Depo-Provera causes a significant increase in the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors. The study found that women who used Depo-Provera were more than 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with meningiomas compared to women who never used the birth control shot. This study\u2019s findings will jumpstart the Depo-Provera litigation. This is unusually strong scientific evidence linking the drug to meningioma. The risk ratio of 5.5\u2014indicating that Depo-Provera users are more than five times as likely to develop meningiomas compared to non-users\u2014goes beyond what is typically seen in comparable studies.\n\nDepo Provera Lawsuit FAQs Is Depo-Provera the Next Mass Tort That Will Explode in 2025? Yes. The science linking Depo-Provera to meningioma is some of the strongest in pharmaceutical litigation. A BMJ study found that women using the birth control shot for over a year were 5.6 times more likely to develop a meningioma. This is a huge deal because a 5.6 times increased risk is not just a small red flag. It is a flashing siren. In mass tort cases, having such clear, statistically significant evidence linking a drug to a serious condition makes it much easier for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to prove their claims. It puts massive pressure on the defendants. Although things have slowed down a bit as 2025 progresses, our lawyers are still seeing an avalanche of new cases. With the Depo-Provera class action lawsuit (MDL actually) now set up with a judge who will put the pedal to the metal, this litigation will move fast. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are putting more energy into the Depo-Provera litigation right now than any other mass tort in the country. How Much Money Could a Depo-Provera Lawsuit Be Worth? It is still early, and there is a long way to go before we can confidently predict Depo-Provera settlement payouts. But based on what we know, we can give you our best assessment. Our attorneys estimate that individual settlements could range from $275,000 to over $1 million. The most severe cases\u2014those involving multiple surgeries, permanent disabilities, or life-altering complications\u2014could be worth even more. These are not minor injuries. We are talking about brain surgery, long-term cognitive issues, and a lifetime of medical monitoring. Pfizer has the resources to fight, but the scale and seriousness of these claims put this litigation in high-value mass tort territory. When all is said and done, we predict the key question will not be whether these cases will settle\u2014it will be when and how much. But we have some work to do first. We flush out the nuances of how our lawyers view Depo shot lawsuit settlement payouts below. How Do We Know Pfizer Knew About the Brain Tumor Risk? This is not a new problem. Studies linking Depo-Provera to meningioma go back to 1983, when researchers discovered that synthetic hormones could stimulate progesterone receptors in these tumors. That was a significant red flag\u2014if anyone had bothered to look. European regulators saw the warning signs and required Pfizer to add a meningioma warning. Canada followed suit. And in the United States? Still nothing. Pfizer knew the risks. The science was there. But instead of updating the warning label, it kept the information quiet and the sales rolling. Because, as history has shown, profits tend to win when profits and public safety go head-to-head. What\u2019s Happening in Court? Where Are These Cases Filed? The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated more than 80 cases into an MDL in the Northern District of Florida under Judge Casey Rodgers. Expect thousands more cases to follow. Meanwhile, Philadelphia state courts may also see a significant number of claims. Who Qualifies for a Depo-Provera Lawsuit? If you received at least two injections of Depo-Provera and were later diagnosed with a meningioma brain tumor, our lawyers think you may have a viable claim. The strongest claims involve long-term users (5 or more years). But even women with shorter exposure may be eligible. How Many Depo-Provera Lawsuits Are Expected? Current estimates suggest there could be between 16,000 and 18,000 cases involving women diagnosed with progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas. But that number may only be the beginning. When you account for delayed diagnoses and cases that have not yet been connected to Depo-Provera, the actual total could be far higher. Of course, not all of these women will make a claim.) We are seeing this firsthand. The volume of calls our law firm receives makes it hard to believe this will remain a limited tort. The number of affected women\u2014and the severity of their injuries\u2014suggests this litigation will grow exponentially. How Can I File a Depo-Provera Lawsuit? 800-553-8082 or If you or a loved one developed a meningioma brain tumor after using Depo-Provera, you may be entitled to significant financial compensation.

Often called the birth control shot, it is an injectable form of contraception for women. It is administered by injection (in the arm or butt) every three months and provides a highly effective, long-lasting option without the need for daily attention, as long as it is taken on schedule.\n\nPfizer has made a fortune from Depo Provera. A recent National Health Statistics Report from December 2023 indicates that nearly 24.5% of all sexually experienced women in the United States used Depo-Provera at some point between 2015 and 2019.\n\nDepo-Provera\u2019s journey to approval as a contraceptive involved decades of regulatory challenges and controversy. Initially developed by Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in the 1950s, Depo-Provera\u2014depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)\u2014was intended as an injectable treatment for endometrial and renal cancers.\n\nDepo-Provera\u2019s effectiveness as a contraceptive stems from its use of a high-dose synthetic hormone (progestin) that suppresses ovulation for extended periods. In 1967, Upjohn applied to the FDA to market the drug as a contraceptive, but the FDA rejected the application, citing concerns about potential cancer risks\u2014a decision that foreshadowed the current brain tumor litigation. Undeterred, Upjohn submitted two additional applications in 1978 and 1983, both of which were also rejected due to ongoing safety concerns.\n\nBefore receiving FDA approval in the United States, Upjohn successfully introduced Depo Provera as a contraceptive in international markets, gaining approval in France as early as 1969. In the U.S., the drug sparked intense debate as data on its long-term effects continued to surface. After years of additional studies and increasing global acceptance, the FDA approved Depo Provera as a contraceptive in 1992.\n\nControversy persisted, especially around potential links to bone density loss and increased risks of certain cancers and neurological conditions, such as meningiomas. Upjohn merged with Swedish company Pharmacia in 1995, and Pfizer ultimately acquired Pharmacia & Upjohn in 2002, inheriting the regulatory responsibilities and liabilities associated with Depo-Provera.\n\nAlthough Depo-Provera has been available in generic form for many years, most generic versions of Depo-Provera are actually still manufactured by Pfizer and then sold as generics by various companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Depo Provera Works\n\nDepo-Provera contains a special type of synthetic hormone called progestin. This hormone prevents pregnancy by blocking the release of eggs during ovulation and thickening cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. It also thickens the mucus lining of the cervix, which helps keep out sperm.\n\nWhen administered consistently, Depo-Provera is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is why it is so wildly popular. Although primarily designed and approved as a contraceptive, it is also commonly prescribed for managing other gynecological conditions. For instance, Depo-Provera is frequently used to alleviate symptoms associated with endometriosis, providing patients relief from pain and discomfort.\n\nStudy Links Depo-Provera to Brain Tumors\n\nIn March 2024, a significant new scientific study was released, which found a clear link between the use of Depo-Provera and the development of a specific type of brain tumor called a meningioma. The new study was published in the renowned British Medical Journal.\n\nThe study investigated the relationship between the use of certain hormone medications, known as progestogens, and the risk of developing a type of brain tumor called meningioma. The research focused on a variety of progestogens, analyzing data from the French National Health Data System, which included women who had undergone surgery for meningioma in France.\n\nThe study included 108,366 women, with 18,061 women who had undergone surgery for meningioma. So this is a big study.\n\nThe findings were significant in a few areas:\n\nLong-term use (defined as more than one year) of specific progestogens, including medrogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and promegestone, was linked to an increased risk of developing meningiomas.\n\nConversely, the study found no increased risk associated with other hormonal treatments such as progesterone, dydrogesterone, and some types of hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs).\n\nOur lawyers review many studies in drug litigations. One of the big numbers is the odds ratio. The odds ratio represents the likelihood of developing a condition among users compared to non-users. For example, an odds ratio of 2 would mean that users are approximately twice as likely to develop the condition.\n\nIn this case, the study looked at medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which is Depo-Provera. For MPA, nine cases exposed out of 18,061 total cases (0.05%) vs. 11 controls exposed out of 90,305 total controls (0.01%). That is a stunning odds ratio of 5.55. You rarely see a tort claim where there is a study as strong as this one.\n\nPrevious Studies Put Pfizer on Notice of a Problem\n\nThis was not the first study that suggested a risk of meningioma. In 1983\u2014that\u2019s right, 1983\u2014a study published in the European Journal of Cancer & Clinical Oncology identified the presence of a high concentration of progesterone receptors in human meningioma cells. This study focused on the relationship between progesterone and meningioma growth by examining the concentration of hormone receptors, specifically progesterone receptors, in meningioma cells. The research demonstrated that meningioma cells possess a greater density of progesterone receptors compared to estrogen receptors.\n\nThe key finding of this study was that meningioma cells contained a higher density of progesterone receptors compared to estrogen receptors. This suggested that meningiomas, which are typically slow-growing brain tumors, could be influenced by progesterone levels. So more than 40 years ago, we had a biological explanation for how hormone-based drugs like Depo-Provera (which contains synthetic progesterone) might accelerate the growth of these tumors.\n\nThis was not lost on the authors. The researchers concluded that the high presence of progesterone receptors suggests that progesterone, rather than estrogen, might be a key driver in the growth of these tumors. So the study helps demonstrate that prolonged use of progesterone-based drugs like Depo Provera may significantly increase the risk of meningiomas should have been a concern as far back as 1983.\n\nIn 1991, a study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery explored the effects of mifepristone, an anti-progesterone agent, on meningiomas. Mifepristone competes with progesterone for binding to progesterone receptors, thereby inhibiting the action of progesterone on tumor cells.\n\nThe research found that mifepristone was effective in reducing the growth of meningiomas, which are brain tumors known to express a high density of progesterone receptors. By blocking progesterone from binding to its receptors, mifepristone hindered the hormone\u2019s ability to stimulate tumor growth. This discovery provided compelling evidence that progesterone plays a central role in promoting the growth of meningiomas, especially in tumors sensitive to hormonal changes.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings had significant clinical implications that should have sounded an alarm if anyone cared enough to pay attention. The research demonstrated that hormone-blocking treatments could serve as a viable therapeutic option for managing meningiomas. It was not just a theory\u2014it was a breakthrough that could have fundamentally altered how these tumors were treated. This research highlighted the potential of anti-progesterone therapies like mifepristone to regress tumor growth, particularly in cases where progesterone was a contributing factor.\n\nSo if blocking progesterone could significantly reduce tumor growth, why were pharmaceutical companies not prioritizing thinking about what would happen if you increased progesterone? It seems pretty obvious synthetic progesterone found in Depo-Provera might stimulate meningioma development. This finding supports the argument\u2014as does this 1990 study\u2014that Depo Provera could cause or exacerbate meningiomas, strengthening the causation claim in these lawsuits.\n\nMeningioma Brain Tumors\n\nA meningioma is a type of brain tumor that develops in the protective membranes that cover the brain. Meningiomas are the most common type of brain tumor, accounting for 40% of all reported tumors in the brain.\n\nMost meningiomas are non-cancerous, but a certain percentage can be cancerous. Meningiomas are usually slow-growing tumors and may exist in the brain for many years without symptoms before being diagnosed.\n\nMeningiomas are categorized into three different grades:\n\nGrade I : A totally non-cancerous meningioma that grows very slowly, accounting for 8 out of 10 cases.\n\n: A totally non-cancerous meningioma that grows very slowly, accounting for 8 out of 10 cases. Grade II : Non-cancerous but more rapidly growing, making treatment more difficult. Grade II meningiomas are atypical tumors that include subtypes like atypical, clear cell, and chordoid meningiomas, each exhibiting cellular changes that increase recurrence risk and may require both surgery and radiation for treatment. These are only about 15% of meningiomas but over 25% of the calls our lawyers have received so far have been Grade II meningioma brain tumors.\n\n: Non-cancerous but more rapidly growing, making treatment more difficult. Grade II meningiomas are atypical tumors that include subtypes like atypical, clear cell, and chordoid meningiomas, each exhibiting cellular changes that increase recurrence risk and may require both surgery and radiation for treatment. These are only about 15% of meningiomas but over 25% of the calls our lawyers have received so far have been Grade II meningioma brain tumors. Grade III: Malignant (cancerous) tumors that grow fast and aggressively, comprising less than 2% of cases.\n\nUsually, meningiomas are first spotted with an MRI scan and may be found by accident, especially in patients who do not show symptoms. For these patients, doctors sometimes choose to keep an eye on the tumor instead of operating right away. But if surgery is needed, doctors aim to remove the whole tumor and part of the surrounding area to prevent it from coming back. Surgery is the best treatment for spinal meningiomas and usually has good outcomes with a low risk of the tumor coming back. Advances in imaging and surgical techniques have, thankfully, made the process safer and more effective.\n\nTreatment for a symptomatic intracranial meningioma usually involves a highly invasive brain surgery known as a craniotomy, where a portion of the skull is removed to access the brain and meninges. Due to the tumor\u2019s sensitive location, complete removal may be risky and technically challenging, often necessitating additional treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Key risk factors include the presence of superficial meningiomas, moderate to severe peritumoral edema, involvement of critical peritumoral veins, and WHO grade II-III meningiomas.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the likelihood of patients experiencing postoperative anxiety and depression, often leading to an increased use of sedatives and antidepressants during recovery. Additionally, surgery for intracranial meningioma may trigger seizures, necessitating epilepsy medications (which often come with their own risks). Meningiomas that are associated with the use of progesterone-based contraceptives typically occur at the skull base, making their removal more complex and heightening the risk of complications.\n\nGiven the complexity and severity of the treatment, as well as the potential for long-term neurological complications, we expect high settlement payouts for claims like this if this litigation is as successful as we expect. But we think, as we discuss further below, all three grades are strong personal injury claims.\n\nDepo-Provera Product Liability Lawsuits\n\nPharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, are legally obligated to ensure that their products are reasonably safe for consumers and to provide clear and accurate warnings about potential risks associated with their use. This duty falls under what is known as \u201cstrict liability\u201d for failure to warn. It means that even if the drug itself is not inherently defective, a manufacturer can still be held liable if they fail to adequately disclose serious side effects or risks that are reasonably foreseeable.\n\nIf a drug manufacturer fails to meet this responsibility, they can be held accountable for any harm their product causes. Patients and healthcare providers rely on the safety information provided by manufacturers when making decisions about medication use. A critical component of any drug\u2019s safety profile is the warning label, which must include all known or reasonably knowable risks. This information helps doctors make informed decisions so patients can make an informed choice based on the benefits and potential dangers of a drug.\n\nIn the case of Depo-Provera, the link between the drug and meningiomas was not listed as a potential risk or side effect in the drug\u2019s warning label, at least not in the United States. Depo shot lawsuits will argue that Pfizer knew or should have known of the risks so its failure to update its warning label to reflect this potential danger makes a failure to warn claim.\n\nIf Pfizer had disclosed the increased risk of meningioma associated with their product, what would have been the outcome? Simply put: fewer sales for Pfizer. Many patients\u2014arguably most\u2014would opt for alternative contraceptive methods, and healthcare providers would have exercised greater caution in prescribing the drug, especially for long-term use. There are so many birth control options. Transparency about these risks could have significantly altered the decision-making process for both patients and physicians, ultimately leading to different and apparently safer choices.\n\nWho Is Eligible to File a Depo Provera Lawsuit?\n\nOur law firm is looking to bring a Depo-Provera lawsuit for women who received at least two injections of the Depo-Provera birth control shot and were subsequently diagnosed with a meningioma (or other type of brain tumor). These are our firm\u2019s minimum eligibility criteria. We talk about our thinking on this eligibility criteria in our October 11 update above.\n\nWomen who used the Depo-Provera birth control shot for more extended periods will likely have stronger claims than those who used it only a few times. There is a dose-response relationship. But it is believed that receiving the shot at least twice is sufficient to establish a viable claim.\n\nSo far, we have had a few cases with a limited number of Depo injections. Most women calling our law office because they have a brain tumor have used the drug for an extended period.\n\nWhy Pfizer May Face Significant Liability in Depo-Provera Lawsuits\n\nPfizer\u2019s potential liability in Depo-Provera lawsuits stems, as we have been saying, from the fact that it failed to adequately warn consumers about the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors.\n\nBy law, drug manufacturers are supposed to provide clear warnings about any risks tied to their products. But when it comes to Depo-Provera, Pfizer left out the risk of meningiomas on the warning label, despite growing evidence linking long-term use of the shot to this serious condition. Patients need to trust that they\u2019re getting the full picture when making decisions about their health.\n\nThe link between progesterone and meningiomas has been recognized or should have been recognized for decades\u2014especially by pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, which is responsible for conducting FDA-mandated post-market surveillance to monitor their products for potential safety concerns.\n\nThis failure to warn could expose Pfizer to significant financial liability in product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs will argue in Depo Provera meningioma lawsuits that if they had been informed about the tumor risk, they could have made a more informed decision about using the contraceptive. It is a pretty easy argument to make. So by never acting to update the label, it may be very easy to paint Pfizer as prioritizing profit over safety. If this argument lands with a jury, it will influence both jury perceptions and potential settlement amounts in the Depo shot litigation.\n\nYou have to remember how serious the injuries \u2013 and the fear of the injuries \u2013 are in this litigation. Ultimately, there are so many birth control options. Why pick the one that could cause you a brain tumor? Our lawyers believe this litigation will be different from other birth control lawsuit settlements exactly because the injury is both terrifying.\n\nDepo-Provera Brain Tumor Lawsuit Settlement Amounts\n\nAny projection of settlement amounts for Depo Provera lawsuits should begin with some caveats. It is very early in this litigation to provide an accurate estimate of the potential settlement compensation for Depo-Provera brain tumor cases. At this point, we still do not yet know if the scientific evidence will be admissible. But our lawyers can still make an educated guess based on various assumptions and based on settlement payouts in similar tort cases involving comparable facts and injuries.\n\nDepo-Provera Settlement Predictions\n\nIf the evidence supporting causation holds up in court, our lawyers estimate that Depo-Provera brain tumor cases involving significant complications could result in settlement payouts ranging from $275,000 to $500,000. This range reflects the varying degrees of severity associated with meningiomas, which can significantly impact the level of compensation awarded to plaintiffs.\n\nThe difference in symptoms, prognosis, and treatment options between a Grade I (non-cancerous) meningioma and a malignant Grade III meningioma is very significant. A Grade III meningioma is potentially life-threatening and very serious, while Grade I meningiomas are much less damaging and usually not life-threatening.\n\nHow many cases will fall in each of these categories? At this point, we have no idea. But our attorneys firmly believe that Grade III depo shot cases will have meaningful compensation. The trial value of those brain cancer lawsuits\u2014the average settlement\u2014could be in the tens of millions. If there is a global settlement, you will not see average payouts go that high\u2026but these will be significant cases and some of them could settle for well over $1 million if this litigation plays out like we think it might.\n\nKeep something else in mind. The defendant is Pfizer. That company is worth over $150 billion. It is flush with COVID profits and can pay global settlements in the billions without breaking much of a sweat. This is a big deal. Our attorneys are involved with several mass tort lawsuits now in which the question of how much the defendant can really afford to pay creeps into the conversation. We do not have this problem with Depo-Provera lawsuits against Pfizer.\n\nOther Meningioma Lawsuits Give Us More Information on Settlement Compensation\n\nA study of meningioma lawsuits provides insight into how lawyers and juries assess the severity of these injuries. The average payout for plaintiffs in these cases was over $3 million, with neurosurgery-related claims resulting in the highest settlements.\n\nSo, not to belabor the point, if lawyers like us can do their jobs and establish what appears to be a strong link between Depo-Provera and meningiomas, the potential damages awarded could also be substantial.\n\nHow Would a Depo-Provera Settlement Potentially Take Shape? What would a Depo Provera settlement look like? Yes, it is early to talk about settlement. We just filed for an MDL in the last week. But women signing up for a Depo Provera lawsuit want to know that they are getting into and what they will likely be required to do to get to a settlement. This litigation is almost certainly heading toward an MDL (multidistrict litigation), likely in both federal and state courts. Think of an MDL as a way to bundle individual cases under one roof\u2014kind of like a class action, but with each case still standing on its own. In an MDL, pretrial proceedings like discovery and motions are consolidated to speed things up and reduce redundancy. Lawyers test the waters with bellwether trials, early test cases that help set the tone for settlement negotiations. There will be an MDL. What we do not know at the time of this writing (February 2025) is whether the federal MDL will be in New York or California. If these trials go really badly for Pfizer\u2014and with the scientific evidence in these cases, that is a strong possibility\u2014the company will likely settle before there is even a first trial. If history is any guide, most plaintiffs in the Depo Provera MDL will not need to show up in court. For most, it is submitting medical records and paperwork mainly done by the lawyers. Settlement payouts will probably be tiered, meaning those with confirmed meningiomas requiring surgery will get the largest settlement compensation. Who Are the Possible Defendants in a Depo Shot Lawsuit? These are the key defendants in a Depo Provera meningioma lawsuit: Pfizer Inc. : The primary defendant, holding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Depo-Provera and the entity responsible for the drug\u2019s labeling and safety information. Pfizer has maintained control over Depo-Provera\u2019s production and labeling since acquiring Pharmacia & Upjohn in 2002. There is no question Pfizer is the target defendant. It has deep, deep pockets \u2013 especially now, as we talk about above, with all of the Covid vaccine cash it is sitting on \u2013 and it is the most responsible defendant.\n\n: The primary defendant, holding the New Drug Application (NDA) for Depo-Provera and the entity responsible for the drug\u2019s labeling and safety information.

Proof Needed for a Depo Provera Lawsuit Individuals who qualify for a Depo-Provera brain tumor lawsuit will eventually need to prove two key facts to support their claim: (1) that they used the Depo-Provera birth control shot, and (2) they were diagnosed with meningioma or another type of brain tumor. Use of Depo-Provera can be proven with medical records such as records from the prescribing doctor. Insurance billing records can also be used to prove that the plaintiff used the birth control shot. Plaintiffs can also use medical records to prove that they have been diagnosed with a meningioma. Your Depo Provera attorney will help you put all of this together. Our job is to gather and present this evidence effectively, ensuring the strongest possible case. This involves conducting a thorough investigation, consulting medical experts, and identifying any gaps in the proof. Depo Provera Statute of Limitations In this litigation, plaintiffs should generally have more time than you might think to file a Depo Provera lawsuit. In most states, claims over ten years old will still be able to get around any concerns the statute of limitations. Why? The discovery rule and equitable tolling will play a key role. The statute of limitations is the legal deadline by which a lawsuit must be filed. In product liability cases like those involving Depo Provera, the deadline generally begins when the injury occurs. However, many plaintiffs only discover the link between their symptoms and the drug after the initial injury, often due to delayed effects or lack of information about risks. Which is exactly what we have in the Depo shot litigation. Discovery Rule The discovery rule starts the time period for the statute of limitations when the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered both the injury and its possible cause. In Depo Provera cases, plaintiffs will argue that they could not reasonably connect their use of the drug to meningioma until Pfizer puts a warning on the product, which still has not happened. Equitable Tolling of the Statute of Limitations In addition to the discovery rule, equitable tolling can extend the time to file a lawsuit if a defendant\u2019s misconduct or concealment delayed the plaintiff\u2019s awareness of the cause of their injury. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits against Pfizer for Depo Provera will rely on equitable tolling by arguing that the company intentionally withheld information about the risks associated with the drug. Plaintiffs allege that Pfizer: Willfully withheld warnings and safety instructions from the public and healthcare providers regarding the potential dangers of long-term Depo Provera use, specifically the risk of intracranial meningiomas.\n\nActively misrepresented Depo Provera as safe for its intended use, distributing labeling and promotional materials that downplayed or omitted safety risks, particularly regarding long-term use. So plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys will invoke equitable tolling based on Pfizer\u2019s alleged actions, arguing that any statute of limitations should be paused due to deliberate concealment of material safety information, including knowledge from studies on progestin\u2019s effect on meningiomas. Regulations like 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.80(e) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) require drug manufacturers to disclose risks and update warnings. Our lawsuits claim Pfizer failed to do so, contributing to delayed awareness among both patients and doctors. Estoppel Finally, due to Pfizer\u2019s alleged intentional concealment of risks, plaintiffs may argue that Pfizer is estopped from using the statute of limitations as a defense. Plaintiffs contend that Pfizer\u2019s omissions and misrepresentations about Depo Provera\u2019s risks misled them and the medical community, preventing timely discovery of the connection between Depo Provera and meningioma. In essence, this legal doctrine allows victims\u2019 lawyers to argue that Pfizer\u2019s conduct invalidates any attempt to dismiss their claims based on statutory deadlines.\n\nContact Us About a Depo Provera Lawsuit\n\nIf you used Depo-Provera and were subsequently diagnosed with a meningioma or other type of brain tumor, contact our national product liability lawyers today at 800-553-8082 or contact us online.",

Pincus Co. first reported the transaction.\n\nThe $140M was a final payment to acquire the property, on top of unspecified additional payments Werner had previously made to the Kayden family, according to a source familiar with the transaction.\n\nWerner and his partner, Nathan Berman's Metro Loft Management, already seized control of 219 and 235 E. 42nd St. and have moved forward with transforming the two-building office campus into approximately 1,600 rental units, the largest planned conversion in the city.\n\nIn 2018, Werner bought the leasehold for 235 E. 42nd St. from Pfizer in a $228M deal that was part of a partnership with life sciences developer Alexandria Real Estate Equities. They also acquired 219 E 42nd St., the smaller building next door, for $142M, according to public records. Pfizer occupied both buildings but agreed to a five-year leaseback.\n\nWerner extended the ground lease in 2021 with the Kayden family at 235 E. 42nd for 60 years in a transaction that was valued at $425M.\n\nAs Pfizer\u2019s lease was expiring, it chose to relocate to Tishman Speyer\u2019s The Spiral office building at 66 Hudson Blvd. In 2023, ARE told investors that it planned a 350K SF conversion into life sciences uses.\n\nLast year, the REIT abandoned those plans and sold 219 E. 42nd St. to Werner for $60M.

On the one hand, technologies like mRNA have offered breakthroughs for tackling infectious diseases. But at the same time, market uptake and sales growth for several new shots have been sluggish in the last year.\n\nNow, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine critic, sworn in as the new head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, drugmakers are also facing fresh regulatory uncertainty.\n\nRecent earnings reports from the space\u2019s top players underscore this challenging environment.\n\nBut while drugmakers face issues like increased vaccine skepticism, they\u2019re also keeping the R&D wheels turning and gearing up for potential wins in 2025. Here\u2019s what end-of-year reports from some of the largest vaccine makers reveal about the industry\u2019s shifting winds.\n\nThe challenging RSV and flu landscape\n\nVaccination rates are falling broadly across disease areas.\n\nAmong young children, the divide in vaccination rates has fallen along political lines, with kindergartners from states where President Trump won the popular vote showing higher rates of vaccine exemptions, The New York Times reported in January.\n\nFlu vaccination rates for the 2024-2025 season are also well below those from the previous three years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The trend is happening while the U.S. faces its worst flu seasons since 2009, with at least 29 million illnesses, according to the CDC.\n\nYet, not every company has been hit by the downturn in flu shots. Sanofi, the largest influenza vaccine maker, reported that global sales for its flu jab were slightly down for the year, although 2024 was a particularly strong year for comparison, CEO Paul Hudson said during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nSanofi\u2019s vaccine portfolio was also buoyed by uptake in what\u2019s become a complex market for RSV.\n\nOverall, the company\u2019s vaccine sales rose 13.5% during the year, mostly driven by European sales of Beyfortus, its RSV antibody approved for babies.\n\nThe new shot is among a swath of new RSV drugs that have debuted over the past few years, including a handful approved in the U.S. since 2023. But the breakthrough hasn\u2019t led to runaway sales for drugmakers amid the declining vaccination trend.\n\nGSK\u2019s Arexvy, which became the first RSV vaccine approved in 2023 and protects older adults, reached about $734 million in sales in 2024, down 52% from the previous year, according to the company\u2019s year-end earnings report.\n\nGSK placed some of the blame on the CDC after the agency\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices changed its recommendations on who should get vaccinated against RSV last year, potentially reducing the patient population.\n\nStill, the pharma company was bullish on Arexvy\u2019s future, with revaccination and age cohort expansion expected down the road.\n\n\u201cWe really are in the foothills of this vaccine,\u201d said Emma Walmsley, CEO of GSK, during the fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nIn addition, Arexvy dominated the RSV space in 2024, holding onto about 58% of market share for the year, said Luke Miels, GSK\u2019s chief commercial officer.\n\n\u201cI think we are happy with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key point is to preserve value and position ourselves for the future, when we do think ACIP ultimately will move to expand this population.\u201d\n\nGSK is aiming to hold onto its market control over Pfizer, which also saw sales of its RSV vaccine for older adults, Abrysvo, decline last year. In fact, Abrysvo sales plummeted 62% year over year in the fourth quarter alone. But Pfizer executives also noted during the company\u2019s year-end earnings call that the drug notched a 13% increase in market share during the year.\n\nModerna launched its RSV vaccine mResvia last year, marking the biopharma\u2019s second approved product. However, full-year sales were just $25 million. The vaccine is the third RSV shot approved for older adults, and like Pfizer and GSK, the company is bullish on its prospects.\n\n\u201cWhile early RSV sales were limited, we see long-term opportunity to expand our presence in this market both in the U.S. and internationally,\u201d CFO Jamey Mock said during the earnings call this month.\n\nRegulatory upheaval\n\nNow at the helm of HHS, Kennedy has wide-ranging ability to interfere with standardized vaccine polices, such as changing the role of ACIP, which advises the CDC on the use of vaccines.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about Kennedy\u2019s leadership position during the earnings call and noted he was looking forward to working on areas of agreement, such as chronic disease.\n\n\u201cThe president introduced me to him, and we had dinner all three together, and we tried to understand his view,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I expect that we will agree on everything on vaccines? I don't know. But I think probably \u2026 he will have a way more tempered view on how to interact with the vaccines. I think there are a lot of opportunities that probably outweigh the risks that we have with the radical change that\u2026 we are seeing now with the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nModerna CEO Stephane Bancel also offered some insight into how the company views the administration\u2019s new leadership during the year-end earnings call.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the new team as they get confirmed by the Senate,\u201d Bancel said. \u201cVaccines are a very important piece of keeping people healthy, and we look forward to having those discussions as people get confirmed.\u201d\n\nVaccine developments in the coming year\n\nLooking ahead, drugmakers are intent on expanding their RSV base and are still funnelingR&D dollars into new vaccines.\n\nModerna is on the cusp of potentially snagging approvals for three new vaccines this year, including its next-gen COVID vaccine, an RSV jab for high-risk adults between 18-59 and a flu-COVID combo shot for people 50 and older.\n\nWith upcoming PDUFA dates in May and June for the new COVID and RSV shots, the biopharma has a lot on the line over the next several months. Moderna is also in a pivotal phase 3 study for a cytomegalovirus vaccine candidate and a two-season pivotal phase 3 study for a norovirus vaccine.\n\nElsewhere, Sanofi reported it moved forward with six new vaccine studies during the fourth quarter of 2024, including a phase 3 study for a candidate in pneumococcal in children. And GSK noted its pipeline includes plans to expand its shingles vaccine label during the first half of 2025.",

            "content": "Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been around for 175 years, but the company's revenue soared to its highest ever only in more recent times. Thanks to its coronavirus treatment and vaccine, the pharma giant reported more than $100 billion in revenue in 2022 at the peak of its pandemic success. Since that time, though, demand for these products has declined, and that's resulted in lower revenue and a drop in the Pfizer share price.\n\nRight now, as an investor, you may be wondering if you should take advantage of the stock's lower valuation and dive in or avoid this struggling stock. Before making any decisions, it's important to take a look at Pfizer's strategy and the company's prospects over time. Here are three things you need to know if you buy Pfizer today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Coronavirus product growth shouldn't be a point of reference\n\nPfizer's revenue soared to a record level earlier in the pandemic, thanks to the company's market-leading vaccine and treatment. Those products continue to contribute to revenue, bringing in more than $5 billion each last year, for example. Though coronavirus products should continue to add to annual revenue, especially during flu season quarters later in the year, it's not realistic to expect the coronavirus products to deliver revenue today at the same levels as in earlier pandemic days.\n\nAll of this means that, when considering Pfizer's growth potential, the peak years of coronavirus sales shouldn't be the point of reference. Instead, it's a better idea to look at Pfizer's pre-pandemic sales and consider how the company could progress from that point in the years to come.\n\nWe can refer to full-year 2019 revenue of about $51 billion and the company's comments about potential revenue of more than $80 billion in non-COVID revenue by 2030. This represents an increase of about 55%. If Pfizer attains this goal, the stock could advance significantly over time.\n\n2. Pfizer is losing exclusivity on some major products -- but has planned for this moment\n\nA decline in coronavirus product revenue isn't Pfizer's only problem right now. The company also is set to lose exclusivity on certain blockbuster non-COVID-19 products, such as blood thinner Eliquis and breast cancer drug Ibrance. Pfizer even says this patent cliff represents $17 billion in lost sales from 2025 through 2030.\n\nHowever, Pfizer has been preparing for this headwind and aims to compensate and grow through the launch of new products and a recent move to reinforce its oncology business -- the purchase of cancer specialist Seagen. Pfizer's biggest launch period ever -- with 19 product releases over 18 months -- has set the stage for a new wave of growth. The company recently said one of its 2025 goals is to focus on research and development productivity and expects several catalysts this year, including at least four regulatory decisions and possibly nine phase 3 trial readouts.",

Results found the maximum plasma concentration in patients dosed with TAH3311 was equivalent to Eliquis, which is approved in the US and Europe.\n\nTaho Pharmaceuticals now plans to use these results to push ahead with a new drug application (NDA) and a marketing authorisation application (MAA) before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nThe company\u2019s dissolvable strips are primarily aimed at stroke patients for whom swallowing tablets can be difficult. Research conducted by the World Stroke Organization (WSO) found that there are more than 12.2 million new strokes each year. Globally, one in four people aged over 25 will have a stroke in their lifetime.\n\nOf those patients, some are liable to develop a condition known as dysphagia, which can prevent a patient from swallowing medications. Typically, in this case, medication is administered by crushing a tablet into water, leading to dosing inaccuracies.\n\nTaho Pharmaceuticals CEO Howard Lee said: \u201cThis pivotal study underscores our commitment to patient-centric innovation. TAH3311 is especially valuable for stroke patients, the elderly, children or others who have swallowing difficulties and require anticoagulant therapy twice daily. We believe this novel formulation can improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia caused by choking when swallowing medication with water.\u201d\n\nMarket research from GlobalData estimates that in 2024 sales of Eliquis brought in more than $13.3bn, with that figure on track to drop to estimated sales of $858m by the end of 2030.\n\nThe first generic versions of apixaban were approved by the FDA in 2019, however, these will not be available for sale until 2028, which is when GlobalData\u2019s sales forecast for Eliquis starts to drop.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nElsewhere in the field of stroke care, increasing levels and intensity of heat waves have been linked with higher occurrences of ischaemic stroke (IS). Meanwhile, Basking Biosciences has dosed the first subject in the Phase II RAISE clinical trial of its lead candidate, BB-031, in patients with acute IS.",

These agents play a critical role in preventing clot degradation in areas prone to fibrinolysis, such as the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and female reproductive tract. The demand for antifibrinolytic drugs is particularly strong in hospitals and clinics, where most surgeries occur. As the number of surgical procedures increases globally, the need for these medications to manage bleeding effectively is expected to drive market growth.\n\nThe global antifibrinolytic drug market is anticipated to expand due to several factors, including a rise in bleeding disorders, an increase in trauma and surgical incidents, technological advancements, and a growing elderly population. These factors create a heightened demand for antifibrinolytic medications to manage bleeding episodes, control blood loss in trauma situations, and improve treatment efficacy and safety. The aging population is especially vulnerable to bleeding disorders and their complications, further increasing the need for these drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Drivers of the Global Antifibrinolytic Drug Market:\n\nSurge in Surgical Procedures: The increasing number of surgeries worldwide is a primary driver of market growth. Antifibrinolytic drugs are crucial during various surgical operations, including cardiovascular and dental procedures, as they help minimize bleeding.\n\nRise in Road Traffic Accidents: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 1.35 million fatalities occur annually due to road traffic accidents. Given that these drugs prevent clot lysis and mitigate blood loss, their demand is significantly influenced by the rising incidence of road injuries.\n\nManagement of Menorrhagia: The growing use of antifibrinolytic drugs among women to control heavy menstrual flow contributes to market expansion.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Innovations in drug formulations and delivery mechanisms enhance treatment effectiveness and safety.\n\nGeographical Insights:",

The posts have shared a report with the logo of the US House of Representatives with a link that is directed to the official website.As per the review given by users on X, \"Post claims that Pfizer revealed a list of Covid-19 side effects, referencing the US House of Reps document as the source. Upon reviewing the referenced document, there is no list of side effects contained within it.\"While many users are quick to challenge this review, the fact is that Pfizer had released a list of adverse events in 2022, not the side effects of the vaccine.While the terms adverse events and side effects are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings in medical and pharmaceutical contexts.A side effect is a known, expected reaction that occurs with a drug, treatment, or medical intervention. It may be mild or severe, but it is generally listed in drug information because it has been observed in clinical trials. For example, drowsiness from an antihistamine is a side effect because it is a predictable reaction.An adverse event (AE), however, refers to any undesirable medical occurrence that happens during the use of a drug or treatment, regardless of whether it is directly caused by it. Adverse events can be unexpected, severe, or even life-threatening and may require medical attention. For example, a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine is an adverse event because it is not a common or intended effect.In 2022, Pfizer had submitted a nine-page report of adverse events as part of its Biological License Application (BLA) to the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA). It compiled data from 63 countries such as the U.S., UK, Italy, Germany and France received between Dec. 1, 2020 and Feb. 28, 2021 \u2013 and includes nine pages of \u201cadverse events of special interest\u201d.\"An accumulation of adverse event reports (AERs) does not necessarily indicate that a particular AE was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor(s) such as past medical history or concomitant medication,\" the Pfizer has said in its report.",

            "content": "Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been around for 175 years, but the company's revenue soared to its highest ever only in more recent times. Thanks to its coronavirus treatment and vaccine, the pharma giant reported more than $100 billion in revenue in 2022 at the peak of its pandemic success. Since that time, though, demand for these products has declined, and that's resulted in lower revenue and a drop in the Pfizer share price.\n\nRight now, as an investor, you may be wondering if you should take advantage of the stock's lower valuation and dive in or avoid this struggling stock. Before making any decisions, it's important to take a look at Pfizer's strategy and the company's prospects over time. Here are three things you need to know if you buy Pfizer today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA researcher works in a lab.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Coronavirus product growth shouldn't be a point of reference\n\nPfizer's revenue soared to a record level earlier in the pandemic, thanks to the company's market-leading vaccine and treatment. Those products continue to contribute to revenue, bringing in more than $5 billion each last year, for example. Though coronavirus products should continue to add to annual revenue, especially during flu season quarters later in the year, it's not realistic to expect the coronavirus products to deliver revenue today at the same levels as in earlier pandemic days.\n\nAll of this means that, when considering Pfizer's growth potential, the peak years of coronavirus sales shouldn't be the point of reference. Instead, it's a better idea to look at Pfizer's pre-pandemic sales and consider how the company could progress from that point in the years to come.\n\nWe can refer to full-year 2019 revenue of about $51 billion and the company's comments about potential revenue of more than $80 billion in non-COVID revenue by 2030. This represents an increase of about 55%. If Pfizer attains this goal, the stock could advance significantly over time.\n\n2. Pfizer is losing exclusivity on some major products -- but has planned for this moment\n\nA decline in coronavirus product revenue isn't Pfizer's only problem right now. The company also is set to lose exclusivity on certain blockbuster non-COVID-19 products, such as blood thinner Eliquis and breast cancer drug Ibrance. Pfizer even says this patent cliff represents $17 billion in lost sales from 2025 through 2030.\n\nHowever, Pfizer has been preparing for this headwind and aims to compensate and grow through the launch of new products and a recent move to reinforce its oncology business -- the purchase of cancer specialist Seagen. Pfizer's biggest launch period ever -- with 19 product releases over 18 months -- has set the stage for a new wave of growth. The company recently said one of its 2025 goals is to focus on research and development productivity and expects several catalysts this year, including at least four regulatory decisions and possibly nine phase 3 trial readouts.\n\nMeanwhile, the addition of Seagen's four commercialized drugs has significantly added to growth, with each product increasing revenue year over year. Also important to note, the company's Padcev, combined with antibody pembrolizumab, is the No. 1 prescribed first-line treatment in the U.S. for locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer. Late-stage studies could lead to an additional approval that would almost triple the potential U.S. patient group.\n\nThough Pfizer is set to lose on certain older products in the near term, the strategy to reinforce its pipeline and selection of commercialized drugs could help it score a win over the long term.\n\n3. The transformation won't happen overnight\n\nThe above two points are positive but will take time to fully boost Pfizer's growth. The pharma giant is still in the phase of realigning its costs following the declines in coronavirus product demand. Pfizer says it's on track to generate cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of this year as part of this ongoing plan.\n\nThe transformation may not happen overnight, and that means it may take Pfizer's stock a while to take off, too. Does this mean you should wait to buy Pfizer shares?\n\nNot necessarily. It's very difficult to time the market and get in on a stock at its very lowest price. That means it's important to buy when its valuation looks interesting, considering a company's future prospects. And today, trading at 8x forward earnings estimates (around its lowest in a year), Pfizer looks like a bargain buy for patient investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NYSE:PFE) stands against other best drug stocks to buy now.\n\nIs China the Next Big Thing in the Pharmaceutical Industry?\n\nLarge American pharmaceutical companies are showing a distinct trend never seen before: they are increasingly looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. The surge in China deals is materializing when US policymakers and President Donald Trump are pursuing protectionist policies in technology, such as semiconductors and AI.\n\nVarious reasons are being attributed to this trend. Experts believe that Chinese companies are developing more effective molecules than ever before, that too in large quantities. They are in a position to begin testing these molecules on human subjects quicker and at a lower price than the US. Buyers have devised a business model allowing them to essentially import the medicines through licensing deals, according to CNBC. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.\n\nDespite varying opinions among experts, there is an industry-wide consensus that this unique trend is here to stay. How this trend might affect the US biotech sector remains unclear at the moment. While some people believe it could potentially ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at low price, others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. Either way, this trend is anticipated to metamorphose the landscape of the American biopharma sector. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Does the Future of the Pharmaceutical Sector Look Like?\n\nEY believes the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity in 2025 compared to 2024, especially if interest rates remain low. Although the industry may see an increase in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, smaller strategic deals are expected to persist throughout the year. The policy environment in the US is undergoing changes due to political impacts on business, such as re-regulation, lower corporate taxes, continued drug pricing reforms, and the possibility of higher tariffs. Other factors that may affect the biotech and pharmaceutical industries include changes in leadership within health agencies and immigration.",

            "content": "Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has had a rough month with its share price down 2.9%. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. In this article, we decided to focus on Pfizer's ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:\n\n8.7% = US$8.1b \u00f7 US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.09 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nPfizer's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Pfizer's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 19%. For this reason, Pfizer's five year net income decline of 3.1% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared Pfizer's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 1.8% over the last few years.\n\nNYSE:PFE Past Earnings Growth February 16th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Pfizer is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.",

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

            "content": "Pharmaceutical Executive: Due to recent political turbulence, many companies feel like they are facing uncertain regulatory environments. How can they strategize for that?\n\nJames Foster: We're, relatively speaking, a small firm, so we're able to stay nimble. As a result of that, we can move with the punches, so to speak. But I think a lot of from an executive perspective, and the way that we have to look at things is you have to strategize around particular events potentially occurring.\n\nThis tariff event, if we want to talk about that specifically, is something that we've strategized over the past few years. As a result of that, we have various means and methods in order to work around that particular eventuality. Again, to use the tariff example, we've discussed the possibility of setting up specific operations in the US, or moving more of our supply chain to the US as a result of what's occurring at this point in time and what might occur in the future. That's just one of a number of different scenarios that we've planned out as a result of around the world, geopolitically or otherwise.\n\nI think any good executive would have Action Plan A, B and C and would act accordingly based off of those. If you don't have that, given how unstable things potentially can be, it's going to be difficult. As a relatively small firm, we have a nimbleness within that environment. That gives us a slight advantage because our supply chains aren't set in stone in particular regions or jurisdictions. That allows us to roll with the punches alongside what's happening geopolitically.\n\nPE: How has the recent technological boom impacted launch strategies?\n\nFoster: I think it's assisting. You could be talking about a vast range of different things, but if you want to just pick AI, it's really assisting. It's something that we've integrated in a lot of our systems.\n\nChat GPT just recently brought out a new feature called deep research. These tools are really fantastic for businesses like ours. In the case of deep research, which we're integrating at this point in time, we would take days, weeks, or even months, producing research reports for what it is we're doing in our back end. As a result of AI, we're getting huge assistance on just the nuts and bolts of what we try to do from a research perspective. We can generate incredibly detailed research reports, which are very accurate, in a matter of minutes. For us, that is absolutely huge, and it's true across the whole of our industry.\n\nPE: How can companies planning for a global launch choose which market to focus on first?\n\nFoster: I preface my answer by saying that every business is different. You have industrial inertia depending on what it is you're doing. In the example of diagnostics, which is our business, it might be the fact that you have a lab in a particular jurisdiction, and therefore it just makes business sense to start in that jurisdiction.\n\nOn the other hand, depending on what it is you're really doing, you'd have to look at your total addressable market and look at the big picture. That's what we've been doing for our particular business. A great deal of it goes into the US, so a lot of what we've been doing and attempting to do is work through the various workflows in order to enter the US.",

            "content": "The Defense Department has told the military services to reach out once again to service members who were forced out or voluntarily left the military because they refused to get the COVID vaccine and see if they want to reenlist.\n\nThe directive reflects the executive order signed by President Donald Trump a week after he took office, and it says that all service members who opt to return to the military will have to reenlist for at least two years.\n\nAccording to a memo released on X, Darin Selnick, who is working as the defense undersecretary for personnel, said the vaccine mandate was an \u201cunfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden\u201d on service members. It directs the services to set up a program to contact troops and begin doing so in two months.\n\nAt least 8,200 troops were forced out of the military in 2021 for refusing to obey a lawful order when they declined to get the vaccine. The military services sent out notices in 2023 to all troops discharged over the vaccine, advising them they could return to the military, but just 113 have reenlisted. Defense officials said at the time that many troops appeared to use the vaccine mandate as a way to get out of their service obligations quickly and easily.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many more may now be interested, since this new offer will allow eligible troops to come in at their previous rank and give them back pay, benefits and bonuses, as long as they meet all requirements for the reinstatement. Officials have not provided any cost estimates.\n\nTo return, all would have to meet weight, fitness, medical and other requirements, and they could be refused if they now have a criminal record or other disqualifying factor. Officers would have to get recommissioned, which is a simple appointment process.\n\nThe memo directs the services to \u201cbroadly apply waiver authorities to permit maximum eligibility, as appropriate.\u201d And, in a highly unusual move, only very senior civilian leaders confirmed by the Senate will have the authority to reject a waiver request.\n\nIn addition, any recommendation to reject a service member\u2019s request for reinstatement must be sent to the secretary of that service, and that authority cannot be delegated to anyone else. Traditionally waivers or other similar decisions are made at much lower levels.\n\nThe services will have 30 days to identify those who were forced out \u201csolely\u201d for refusing the vaccine order, and within 60 days must begin a program to contact them.\n\nOnce service members receive the estimate of back pay and other compensation, they will have 60 days to decide whether to return to the military. The offer is only good for one year from the date of the memo, which was Feb. 7. It wasn\u2019t posted publicly until late Thursday afternoon.\n\nService members must go through screening through the Boards for Correction of Military/Naval Records process. The memo directs the boards to move swiftly and give priority to COVID-related applications.\n\nTroops who left the service voluntarily to avoid the vaccine may also seek reinstatement but must submit a written statement saying they left for that reason. They will not receive back pay, but will have to commit to a two-year reenlistment.\n\nAccording to the services, 3,748 Marines were discharged, and 25 opted to re-enlist since the 2023 offer went out; 1,903 Army soldiers were discharged, and 73 returned; 1,878 sailors were discharged and two returned; 671 airmen were discharged and 13 returned.\n\nThe Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy force prepared to defend the nation.\n\nThe Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023.",

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) stock is trading sideways with expectations for a sales and earnings slowdown in the first quarter, and a double-digit decline for Covid pill Paxlovid.\n\nFor the first quarter, which ends this month, analysts expect the Big Pharma stalwart to report $1.22 billion in sales of oral Covid treatment. But sales would fall nearly 40% year over year. That would come alongside $358 million in sales of the BioNTech (BNTX)-partnered Covid vaccine, Comirnaty. Sales would inched ahead just 1%.\n\nAlso, on a bearish note, Pfizer and its partner, Arvinas (ARVN), reported mixed results for their breast cancer treatment, a drug that degrades the cancer-tied hormone estrogen. While Arvinas stock plummeted almost 53%, Pfizer stock lost more than 2%.\n\nOn a more promising note, Pfizer's drugs Talzenna and Xtandi improved the median overall survival rate in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by almost nine months. In patients with a specific genetic mutation the combination extended overall survival by 14 months. Overall survival is how long patients live before dying of any cause.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration also approved a combination using Pfizer's Padcev for a form of lymphoma. Plus, Padcev on top of Merck's (MRK) Keytruda showed promise as a treatment in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.\n\nBut there are moving pieces in 2025 that could challenge Pfizer stock. The Senate confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is a well-known vaccine skeptic. Pfizer is also facing off with an activist investor called Starboard Value.\n\nFurther, Pfizer's efforts to develop a weight-loss drug have been straddled with numerous setbacks.\n\nSo, is Pfizer stock a sell today?\n\nPfizer Stock Fundamentals\n\nIn the December quarter, Pfizer's sales jumped 21% to $17.76 billion. Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales, total revenue rose a more moderate 11%. Pfizer also earned an adjusted 63 cents per share, rocking from a year-earlier gain of 10 cents.\n\nBoth measures beat expectations.\n\nSales of blood thinner Eliquis, heart drug Vyndaqel and cancer treatment Padcev topped forecasts, Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in a report. This helped offset weaker sales of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine Abrysvo after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices changed its recommendations for RSV shots.\n\n\"This was a good quarter that did not offer any surprises, which we view as a positive and hopefully helps investors focus beyond Covid-19 products,\" Boylan said in a client note.\n\nFor the first quarter, analysts project earnings of 71 cents per share on $14.47 billion in sales. Earnings would tumbled more than 13% as sales fall almost 3%.\n\nPfizer also reiterated its guidance for $61 billion to $64 billion in sales this year.\n\nObesity Treatments In Focus\n\nInvestors have zeroed in on Pfizer's efforts in obesity treatment. That drug, called danuglipron, is a once-daily pill that mimics the action of GLP-1, a hormone tied to satiety and blood sugar markers.\n\nPfizer is also testing a second GLP-1 drug and, in its third-quarter earnings, outlined plans to study a drug that blocks the activity of the GIP receptor. This differs from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), which have drugs that mimic both GLP-1 and GIPR.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) is the closest competitor with a drug that mimics GLP-1 and blocks GIPR. But Amgen is testing a monthly shot, while Pfizer's approach would be a daily pill.\n\nThe field for oral weight-loss drugs is becoming increasingly crowded. Roche (RHHBY), Viking, Structure Therapeutics (GPCR) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are in this space. Merck (MRK), on Dec. 18, announced a deal worth up to $2.01 billion to license an experimental weight-loss drug from China's Hansoh Pharma.\n\nPfizer Stock And The Starboard Fight\n\nStarboard says Pfizer has lost between $20 billion and $60 billion in market value over the last five years.\n\nThe investor argues Pfizer's research and development, as well as returns on that R&D, have contributed to its downfall. Starboard also says Pfizer has made poor capital allocation decisions and its forecasting/budgeting have left something to be desired.\n\nEarly in the battle, the investor said it reached out to Ian Read and Frank D'Amelio as part of its due diligence. Read is the former chief executive, while D'Amelio was the company's chief financial officer.\n\nRead and D'Amelio shared Starboard's concerns, the investor said in a letter to the board on Oct. 10. But the duo have since flipped their stance, saying they are \"fully supportive\" of Albert Bourla, the sitting CEO. Read handpicked Bourla as his successor. Starboard, though, says it believes Pfizer pressured Read and D'Amelio into changing their tune on Pfizer's trajectory.\n\nOn Nov. 20, Pfizer named its oncology chief, Chris Boshoff, to its chief scientific officer role. The current CSO, Mikael Dolsten, announced his departure in July. Jeff Jonas, of Gabelli Funds, says Starboard likely would have preferred an outside hire.\n\nBut the deadline to nominate members to the board passed by in late January without a word from Starboard.\n\nTechnical Analysis: PFE Stock Is Below Its 50-Day Line\n\nPfizer stock is now trading below its 200-day moving average and 50-day line.\n\n(Related: Keep tabs on chart patterns by visiting IBD's MarketSurge.)\n\nPfizer stock has an IBD Digital Composite Rating of 82 out of a best-possible 99. The CR is a measure of a stock's fundamental and technical measures. Shares also have a Relative Strength Rating of 40, a measure of 12-month performance.\n\nIs PFE Stock A Sell?\n\nPfizer stock isn't a sell today. Shares triggered a sell rule when they fell below their 50-day line on March 11. A break above that line would be promising, but not enough to classify Pfizer stock a buy. Shares also aren't forming a base for investors to watch.\n\nPfizer still has to prove its fundamental and technical merit. And it will have to do that while facing off with Starboard and Kennedy as the HHS secretary.\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy and watch, check out IBD Stock Lists.

Patients were split into two cohorts split between patients selected, or not, for HRR gene mutations.\n\nIn the group without selected mutations, the Talzenna and Xtandi arm saw a median OS of 45.8 months compared with 37 months in the arm treated with Xtandi and placebo. In the group of selected patients with HRR-mutated mCRPC, the combination therapy saw OS of 45.1 months against the placebo arm\u2019s 31.1 months, equating to a 38% reduction in the risk of death and a 14-month gain over the SoC.\n\nThe trial specifically recruited 1,035 unique patients with mCRPC who had not received new life-prolonging systemic treatments, across 184 international sites.\n\nPfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer Roger Dansey said: \u201cSince its approval, Talzenna in combination with Xtandi has redefined the standard of care for those living with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC.\n\n\u201cThis latest data from Talapro-2 is extremely compelling, demonstrating that the combination significantly extended overall survival, in patients selected and unselected for HRR gene alterations, potentially shifting the treatment paradigm for all men living with mCRPC.\n\n\u201cAlthough definitive conclusions cannot be drawn across studies, these results appear to represent the longest median OS reported in a randomised, controlled Phase III trial in mCRPC.\u201d\n\nResearch by GlobalData found that Talzenna brought in $138m in sales for Pfizer in 2024 and is estimated to generate $929m by the end of 2030. Xtandi brought in $7.9bn last year, yet sales are expected to drop to $1.7bn by the end of the decade.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Clinical Trials Arena.\n\nElsewhere in the field of prostate cancer care, Exact Sciences has shared results from a trial of its Oncodetect test, which is designed to identify the last remaining cells post-cancer treatment.

            "content": "Investing in a top healthcare company whose share price has been tanking in recent years could present a huge opportunity for investors, especially when that company has been bolstering its growth prospects via acquisitions and expansion of its pipeline. And if that stock trades at a cheap valuation and pays a high dividend, it would seem like a no-brainer buy today.\n\nIf that were the case, however, shares of Pfizer (PFE 0.47%) would be taking off. Instead, investors are growing more apprehensive of the stock, not less; this already cheap stock is down a few percentage points this year.\n\nAre the concerns about the business valid, and could Pfizer be in trouble, or could this be a great opportunity to buy a potentially mispriced and undervalued healthcare stock?\n\nPfizer's financials haven't been bad\n\nPfizer isn't generating the massive growth it was in previous years, as COVID-related revenue has been diminishing. But the business itself is still generating good organic growth, and there's reason to be optimistic about its core operations moving forward.\n\nLast week, the company reported its year-end numbers for 2024, which weren't all that bad. While sales of its COVID vaccine, Comirnaty, declined by 52% to $5.4 billion for the full year, the company's top line still rose by 7%. Pfizer's specialty care segment generated 11% growth, and its oncology business, which got a boost from its acquisition of Seagen, expanded at a rate of 25%. Even its primary care business, which includes Comirnaty, only declined by 2% year over year, despite the significant decline in COVID-related revenue.\n\nInvestors looking ahead are concerned that in the future, as the company loses patent protection on key drugs, including Eliquis and Vyndaqel, that its financials will deteriorate further. That said, this is a risk that is common for successful pharma companies -- patents don't last forever. By focusing on acquisitions and investing into its pipeline, Pfizer has been making moves in recent years to put itself in a much better position in the long run and offset declines in revenue.\n\nPfizer is trading at a considerable discount\n\nUnfortunately, investors aren't convinced, as is evident through Pfizer's beaten-down share price. In just three years, Pfizer's stock has lost half of its value. Today, many investors see it primarily as a vaccine or COVID stock. Concerns are rising that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who many people see as being against vaccines and taking a tough stance on healthcare, could become the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which has given investors even more of a reason to be bearish on the stock.\n\nBut government positions change over time and with each administration. And predicting what policies a government may enact is difficult, if not impossible. Changes can take time, and if you're investing over a period of five-plus years, then who's in charge of HHS during an administration may not prove to be a long-term issue. While it may weigh on the stock in the short term due to investor sentiment, an unfavorable government appointment is not necessarily going to cripple a top healthcare business such as Pfizer.\n\nAll this negativity, however, does open up an opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount. Despite being a top company in the healthcare industry, investors are treating Pfizer as a highly risky business to invest in, and that could be a huge mistake.\n\nCurrently, Pfizer's stock is trading at just 18 times trailing earnings. And based on analyst projections, it's at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of less than 9. There's a significant discount here, as the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at more than 18 times its future profits.\n\nIs Pfizer stock a good contrarian buy right now?\n\nPfizer's stock performance doesn't appear to be aligning with how the business is doing, which can be a sign that the markets are mispricing it. For investors, this can be an opportune time to consider adding shares of Pfizer to your portfolio.\n\nThe important thing to consider is the long-term trajectory of the business, not policy changes in government that may prove to be temporary. Investors appear to be bracing for the worst when it comes to Pfizer and overlooking the long-term potential that it has, especially with its acquisition of Seagen to grow its oncology business in the years ahead.\n\nIt may be a bumpy ride for Pfizer short term, but this can make for an excellent investment to hang on to for the long haul. And its high-yielding dividend, which pays 6.6%, can give investors plenty of incentive to be patient.",

These indications include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma.\n\nTo qualify for Acetris, patients should not be eligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or CAR T therapy, as per Wednesday\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cMore than 3,500 patients in the U.S. with this aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma experience treatment failure or relapse after two prior lines of therapy\u201d each year, Pfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer Roger Dansey said in a statement.\n\nAdcetris\u2019 expansion into this indication underlines its role \u201cas an existing standard of care with overall survival improvement shown for certain types of lymphomas,\u201d Dansey continued, adding that the antibody-drug conjugate can now provide patients and physicians with an alternative to CAR T therapies and chemotherapy for LBCL treatment.\n\nPfizer established the efficacy and safety of Adcetris in DLBCL via the Phase III ECHELON-3 study, which found that Adcetris plus lenalidomide and ritxumab lowered the risk of death by 37% versus placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. The drug also led to improvements in overall response rate and progression-free survival.\n\nWednesday\u2019s label expansion brings Adcetris\u2019 total number of indications up to eight. The antibody-drug conjugate is also approved for various types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nPfizer has been on a winning streak in cancer recently.

            "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study of TALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib), an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) compared to placebo plus XTANDI in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with or without homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. The TALAPRO-2 results will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary (ASCO GU) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco and featured in the ASCO GU official Press Program.\n\nThe TALAPRO-2 study evaluated two sets of patients, unselected (cohort 1) and selected for HRR gene-mutations (cohort 2). Overall survival was a prespecified, alpha-protected key secondary endpoint. After more than four years of median follow-up (52.5 months), the median OS in cohort 1 was 45.8 months with TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI, and 37.0 months with XTANDI and placebo (Hazard Ratio [HR] of 0.80; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.66-0.96; p=0.015), representing a 20% reduction in the risk of death. This represents a nearly 9-month gain in median OS versus standard of care XTANDI. Data from cohort 1 will be presented today at ASCO GU in an oral presentation (Abstract LBA18) by Dr. Neeraj Agarwal, global lead investigator for TALAPRO-2.\n\nIn Cohort 2, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS was observed in patients with HRR-mutated mCRPC. At a median follow-up of 44.2 months, the median OS was 45.1 months with TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI, and 31.1 months with XTANDI and placebo (HR of 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81; p=0.0005), a 38% reduction in the risk of death. This result represents a 14-month gain in median OS versus standard of care XTANDI in a patient population with a historically poor prognosis. The OS improvement in the HRR-mutated population was observed in patients in both BRCA and non-BRCA gene alterations. Dr. Karim Fizazi, Institut Gustave Roussy, University of Paris-Saclay will share data from Cohort 2 at ASCO GU today (Abstract LBA141).\n\n\u201cSince its approval, TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI has redefined the standard of care for those living with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC. These latest data from TALAPRO-2 are extremely compelling, demonstrating that the combination significantly extended overall survival, in patients selected and unselected for HRR gene alterations, potentially shifting the treatment paradigm for all men living with mCRPC,\u201d said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cAlthough definitive conclusions cannot be drawn across studies, these results appear to represent the longest median overall survival reported in a randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial in mCRPC. We look forward to continuing to work with global authorities to potentially update the TALZENNA label with these results.\u201d\n\n\u201cTALAPRO-2 is the first study demonstrating a significant and clinically meaningful survival benefit using a combination of PARP and androgen receptor inhibitors in mCRPC,\u201d said Neeraj Agarwal, M.D., FASCO, Professor and Presidential Endowed Chair of Cancer Research at Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, and global lead investigator for TALAPRO-2. \u201cSurvival rates in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer are poor due to the advanced and aggressive stage of the disease. Today\u2019s results demonstrate the potential for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI to be a practice-changing treatment to help improve patient survival in mCRPC.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the final analysis, updated radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) and other secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated maintained clinical benefit in both cohorts and were consistent with the primary analyses previously reported and published in The Lancet and Nature Medicine.\n\nIn addition to the FDA, these data have been shared with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global health authorities to support potential updates of the approved labels for TALZENNA.\n\nThe safety profile of TALZENNA plus XTANDI was generally consistent with the known safety profile of each medicine. The most common all-cause adverse events in the TALZENNA group (\u226530% of patients) were anemia, neutropenia, and fatigue, and the most common (\u226510% of patients) grade 3\u20134 adverse events were anemia (49%) and neutropenia (19.3%). Adverse events were generally manageable with dose modification and supportive care.\n\nAbout Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of cancer death among men worldwide, with an estimated 1.4 million new cases diagnosed in 2022.1 In the U.S., it is the most common cancer in men.2 mCRPC is a cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland and has progressed despite medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone. Approximately 10\u201320% of prostate cancer patients develop mCRPC within 5\u22127 years of diagnosis.3 Between 1.2\u20132.1% of all prostate cancer cases globally are mCRPC.4\n\nAbout TALAPRO-2\n\nThe Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 1,035 unique patients with mCRPC who had not received new life-prolonging systemic treatments after documentation of mCRPC at sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The study included two patient cohorts: unselected (n=805, of whom 169 had HRR mutations and 636 did not) and those with HRR gene mutations (n=399, including 169 patients from Cohort 1 and 230 subsequently enrolled to comprise Cohort 2). Patients with castrate testosterone levels were randomized to receive TALZENNA 0.5 mg/day plus XTANDI 160mg/day, or placebo plus XTANDI 160mg/day.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the trial was rPFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to first objective evidence of radiographic progression by blinded independent central review (BICR), or death, whichever occurred first, in both Cohort 1 (unselected) and Cohort 2 (those with HRRm). Secondary endpoints included OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to cytotoxic chemotherapy and PFS2.\n\nFor more information on the TALAPRO-2 trial (NCT03395197), go to www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nAbout TALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib)\n\nTALZENNA is an oral inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which plays a role in DNA damage repair. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TALZENNA blocks PARP enzyme activity and traps PARP at the site of DNA damage, leading to decreased cancer cell growth and cancer cell death.\n\nTALZENNA was initially approved in the U.S., EU, and multiple other regions as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n\nTALZENNA in combination with XTANDI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC in June 2023. The combination was also approved by the European Commission in January 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. TALZENNA is the first and only PARP inhibitor licensed in the European Union for use with XTANDI for patients with mCRPC, with or without gene mutations. TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI is now approved in more than 40 countries globally for patients with mCRPC, indications vary by country.\n\nTALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib) Indication in the U.S.\n\nTALZENNA is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for:\n\nHRR gene-mutated mCRPC:\n\nIn combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nBreast Cancer:\n\nAs a single agent, for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA.\n\nTALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib) Important Safety Information\n\nWARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS\n\nMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 0.4% (3 out of 788) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA as a single agent in clinical studies. In TALAPRO-2, MDS/AML occurred in 2 out of 511 (0.4%) patients treated with TALZENNA and enzalutamide and in 0 out of 517 (0%) patients treated with placebo and enzalutamide. The durations of TALZENNA treatment in these five patients prior to developing MDS/AML were 0.3, 1, 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Most of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy.\n\nDo not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If counts do not recover within 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA.\n\nMyelosuppression consisting of anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA. In TALAPRO-2, Grade \u22653 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 45%, 18%, and 8% of patients receiving TALZENNA and enzalutamide. Overall, 39% of patients (199/511) required a red blood cell transfusion, including 22% (111/511) who required multiple transfusions. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 7%, 3%, and 0.4% of patients.\n\nWithhold TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days, discontinue TALZENNA and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for 4 months after receiving the last dose.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nIn TALAPRO-2, serious adverse reactions reported in >2% of patients included anemia (9%) and fracture (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients, including pneumonia, COVID infection, and sepsis (1 patient each).\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%, all Grades), including laboratory abnormalities, for patients in the TALAPRO-2 study who received TALZENNA in combination with enzalutamide vs patients receiving placebo with enzalutamide were hemoglobin decreased (79% vs 34%), neutrophils decreased (60% vs 18%), lymphocytes decreased (58% vs 36%), fatigue (49% vs 40%), platelets decreased (45% vs 8%), calcium decreased (25% vs 11%), nausea (21% vs 17%), decreased appetite (20% vs 14%), sodium decreased (22% vs 20%), phosphate decreased (17% vs 13%), fractures (14% vs 10%), magnesium decreased (14% vs 12%), dizziness (13% vs 9%), bilirubin increased (11% vs 7%), potassium decreased (11% vs 7%), and dysgeusia (10% vs 4.5%).\n\nClinically relevant adverse reactions in <10% of patients who received TALZENNA with enzalutamide included abdominal pain (9%), vomiting (9%), alopecia (7%), dyspepsia (4%), venous thromboembolism (3%) and stomatitis (2%).\n\nBased on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n\nCoadministration with P-gp inhibitors The effect of coadministration of P-gp inhibitors on talazoparib exposure when TALZENNA is taken in combination with enzalutamide has not been studied. Monitor patients for increased adverse reactions and modify the dosage as recommended for adverse reactions when TALZENNA is coadministered with a P-gp inhibitor.\n\nCoadministration with BCRP inhibitors Monitor patients for increased adverse reactions and modify the dosage as recommended for adverse reactions when TALZENNA is coadministered with a BCRP inhibitor. Coadministration of TALZENNA with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions.\n\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\nRenal Impairment The recommended dosage of TALZENNA for patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 - 59 mL/min) is 0.35 mg taken orally once daily in combination with enzalutamide. The recommended dosage of TALZENNA for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 - 29 mL/min) is 0.25 mg taken orally once daily in combination with enzalutamide. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment. TALZENNA has not been studied in patients requiring hemodialysis.\n\nPlease see full U.S. Prescribing Information and Patient Information for TALZENNA \u00ae (talazoparib) at www.TALZENNA.com.\n\nAbout XTANDI \u00ae (enzalutamide) and Important Safety Information\n\nXTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor.

Up to 70% of LBCL patients have advanced disease at diagnosis, and more than 3,500 patients a year fail two prior lines of therapy and require third-line treatment.\n\nAdcetris belongs to a relatively new class of cancer drugs that combine the selectivity of antibodies with the cell-killing properties of chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents. Unlike chemotherapy, which works by attacking lots of different cells as well as the cancer, ADCs are designed to target and kill tumour cells while sparing healthy ones.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision to approve Adcetris for its eighth indication was based on positive results from the late-stage ECHELON-3 study, in which Adcetris plus lenalidomide and rituximab reduced patients\u2019 risk of death by 37% compared to placebo in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab.\n\nThe overall survival benefit was consistent across levels of CD30 expression, Pfizer said, adding that positive outcomes were also observed in key secondary endpoints, including progression-free survival and overall response rate.\n\nPfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer, Roger Dansey, said: \u201c[This] approval further reinforces the important role of Adcetris as an existing standard of care with overall survival improvement shown for certain types of lymphomas, and now allows physicians to have an option beyond chemotherapy or CAR-Ts for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL.\u201d\n\nPfizer holds commercialisation rights to Adcetris in the US and Canada, while Takeda is responsible for the drug\u2019s commercialisation in the rest of the world.",

And if that stock trades at a cheap valuation and pays a high dividend, it would seem like a no-brainer buy today.\n\nIf that were the case, however, shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) would be taking off. Instead, investors are growing more apprehensive of the stock, not less; this already cheap stock is down a few percentage points this year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nAre the concerns about the business valid, and could Pfizer be in trouble, or could this be a great opportunity to buy a potentially mispriced and undervalued healthcare stock?\n\nPfizer's financials haven't been bad\n\nPfizer isn't generating the massive growth it was in previous years, as COVID-related revenue has been diminishing. But the business itself is still generating good organic growth, and there's reason to be optimistic about its core operations moving forward.\n\nLast week, the company reported its year-end numbers for 2024, which weren't all that bad. While sales of its COVID vaccine, Comirnaty, declined by 52% to $5.4 billion for the full year, the company's top line still rose by 7%. Pfizer's specialty care segment generated 11% growth, and its oncology business, which got a boost from its acquisition of Seagen, expanded at a rate of 25%. Even its primary care business, which includes Comirnaty, only declined by 2% year over year, despite the significant decline in COVID-related revenue.\n\nInvestors looking ahead are concerned that in the future, as the company loses patent protection on key drugs, including Eliquis and Vyndaqel, that its financials will deteriorate further. That said, this is a risk that is common for successful pharma companies -- patents don't last forever. By focusing on acquisitions and investing into its pipeline, Pfizer has been making moves in recent years to put itself in a much better position in the long run and offset declines in revenue.\n\nPfizer is trading at a considerable discount\n\nUnfortunately, investors aren't convinced, as is evident through Pfizer's beaten-down share price. In just three years, Pfizer's stock has lost half of its value. Today, many investors see it primarily as a vaccine or COVID stock. Concerns are rising that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who many people see as being against vaccines and taking a tough stance on healthcare, could become the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which has given investors even more of a reason to be bearish on the stock.\n\nBut government positions change over time and with each administration. And predicting what policies a government may enact is difficult, if not impossible. Changes can take time, and if you're investing over a period of five-plus years, then who's in charge of HHS during an administration may not prove to be a long-term issue. While it may weigh on the stock in the short term due to investor sentiment, an unfavorable government appointment is not necessarily going to cripple a top healthcare business such as Pfizer.\n\nAll this negativity, however, does open up an opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount. Despite being a top company in the healthcare industry, investors are treating Pfizer as a highly risky business to invest in, and that could be a huge mistake.\n\nCurrently, Pfizer's stock is trading at just 18 times trailing earnings. And based on analyst projections, it's at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of less than 9. There's a significant discount here, as the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund trades at more than 18 times its future profits.\n\nIs Pfizer stock a good contrarian buy right now?\n\nPfizer's stock performance doesn't appear to be aligning with how the business is doing, which can be a sign that the markets are mispricing it. For investors, this can be an opportune time to consider adding shares of Pfizer to your portfolio.\n\nThe important thing to consider is the long-term trajectory of the business, not policy changes in government that may prove to be temporary. Investors appear to be bracing for the worst when it comes to Pfizer and overlooking the long-term potential that it has, especially with its acquisition of Seagen to grow its oncology business in the years ahead.\n\nIt may be a bumpy ride for Pfizer short term, but this can make for an excellent investment to hang on to for the long haul. And its high-yielding dividend, which pays 6.6%, can give investors plenty of incentive to be patient.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Pfizer wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for ADCETRIS \u00ae (brentuximab vedotin) in combination with lenalidomide and a rituximab product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified (NOS), DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy who are not eligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.\n\nMilestone represents the eighth FDA-approved indication for ADCETRIS, reinforcing its use as a standard of care for certain lymphomas\n\nECHELON-3 is the first Phase 3 trial to demonstrate OS advantage over lenalidomide and rituximab plus placebo for patients with at least 2 prior lines of therapy with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL)\n\nApproval is based on positive data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-3 trial, which demonstrated ADCETRIS regimen reduced the risk of death by 37%, a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), compared to lenalidomide and rituximab plus placebo\n\nStory Continues\n\nLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), that affects immune cells called B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial to the body's immune system. DLBCL is the most common, aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of the disease. More than 25,000 cases of DLBCL are diagnosed each year in the United States, accounting for more than 25% of all lymphoma cases. Up to 40% of patients relapse or have refractory disease after frontline treatment, and more than 3,500 patients a year fail two prior lines of therapy and require third-line therapy. Despite recent treatment advances including bispecifics and CAR-T therapy, there remains a high unmet need for patients who are not eligible for these treatments or whose disease returns following treatment with these therapies.\n\nThe ECHELON-3 study showed that the ADCETRIS combination reduced patients\u2019 risk of death by 37% compared to placebo in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.445-0.891] p=0.0085). The OS benefit was consistent across levels of CD30 expression. Positive outcomes were also observed in key secondary endpoints, including overall response rate (ORR)\u200b and progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nThe safety profile of ADCETRIS in ECHELON-3 was consistent with its known safety profile as presented in the U.S. prescribing information. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) Grade 3 or higher for the ADCETRIS versus placebo arms were: neutropenia (43% vs 28%), thrombocytopenia (25% vs 19%) and anemia (22% vs 21%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy was infrequent and low grade for each arm with Grade 3 events of 4% vs 0%.\n\nDetailed data from ECHELON-3 were published in JCO Oncology Practice on January 7, 2025 and presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n\nAbout ECHELON-3\n\nECHELON-3 is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating ADCETRIS plus lenalidomide and rituximab versus lenalidomide and rituximab plus placebo in adult patients with relapsed/refractory or transformed DLBCL, regardless of CD30 expression, who have received two or more prior lines of therapy and are ineligible for stem cell transplant (HSCT) or CAR-T therapy. The study also includes patients with hard-to-treat subtypes with poorer outcomes including double hit/triple hit lymphoma and patients with transformed disease. Patients may be ineligible to receive either HSCT or CAR-T therapy due to co-morbidities or financial, geographic, insurance, manufacturing issues. In this global study, 230 patients were randomized across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The primary endpoint is OS in the intent to treat population, with key secondary endpoints of PFS and ORR as assessed by investigator. Other secondary endpoints include complete response rate, duration of response, safety and tolerability.\n\nAbout Large B-cell Lymphoma\n\nLBCL accounts for about 1/3 of cases of NHL, a type of cancer that starts in the lymphocytes and affects immune cells called B lymphocytes. LBCL occurs most often in older people, with a median age of 67 at diagnosis. About 60-70% of people have advanced-stage disease when diagnosed, and up to 40% have disease that relapses or becomes refractory to initial therapy, and more than 3,500 patients a year fail two prior lines of therapy and require third-line therapy.\n\nDLBCL is the most common and aggressive type of LBCL and is difficult to treat. More than 25,000 cases of DLBCL are diagnosed each year in the United States, accounting for more than 25% of all lymphoma cases. DLBCL can develop spontaneously or as a result of diseases such as chronic lymphocytic lymphoma/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or marginal zone lymphoma.\n\nAbout ADCETRIS\n\nMore than 55,000 patients have been treated with ADCETRIS in the U.S. since its first U.S. approval in 2011, and more than 140,000 patients have been treated with ADCETRIS globally.\n\nADCETRIS is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a CD30-directed monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), utilizing Pfizer's proprietary technology. The ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-positive tumor cells.\n\nADCETRIS is approved in eight indications in the U.S.:\n\nAdult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) NOS, DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy who are not eligible for auto-HSCT or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, in combination with lenalidomide and a rituximab product (2025)\n\nAdult patients with previously untreated Stage III/IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (2018)\n\nPediatric patients 2 years and older with previously untreated high risk cHL in combination with doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone and cyclophosphamide (2022)\n\nAdult patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation (2015)\n\nAdult patients with cHL after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates (2011)\n\nAdult patients with previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (2018)\n\nAdult patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. (2011)\n\nAdult patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) after prior systemic therapy (2017)\n\nPfizer and Takeda jointly develop ADCETRIS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Pfizer has U.S. and Canadian commercialization rights, and Takeda has rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. Pfizer and Takeda are funding joint development costs for ADCETRIS on a 50:50 basis, except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs.\n\nADCETRIS\u00ae (brentuximab vedotin) for injection U.S. Important Safety Information\n\nBOXED WARNING\n\nPROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY (PML): JC virus infection resulting in PML, and death can occur in ADCETRIS-treated patients.\n\nCONTRAINDICATION\n\nContraindicated with concomitant bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity (e.g., interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation).\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nPeripheral neuropathy (PN): ADCETRIS causes PN that is predominantly sensory. Cases of motor PN have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced PN is cumulative. Monitor for symptoms such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening PN may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\nAnaphylaxis and infusion reactions: Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If an IRR occurs, interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical management. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Premedicate patients with a prior IRR before subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.\n\nHematologic toxicities: Fatal and serious cases of febrile neutropenia have been reported with ADCETRIS. Prolonged (\u22651 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS.\n\nAdminister G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1 for adult patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated Stage III/IV cHL or previously untreated PTCL or relapsed or refractory LBCL and pediatric patients who receive ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated high risk cHL.\n\nMonitor complete blood counts prior to each ADCETRIS dose. Monitor more frequently for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent doses.\n\nSerious infections and opportunistic infections: Infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Closely monitor patients during treatment for infections.\n\nTumor lysis syndrome: Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures.\n\nIncreased toxicity in the presence of severe renal impairment: The frequency of \u2265Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment. Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nIncreased toxicity in the presence of moderate or severe hepatic impairment: The frequency of \u2265Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n\nHepatotoxicity: Fatal and serious cases have occurred in ADCETRIS-treated patients. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin, and occurred after the first ADCETRIS dose or rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients with new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.\n\nPML: Fatal cases of JC virus infection resulting in PML have been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider PML diagnosis in patients with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed.\n\nPulmonary toxicity: Fatal and serious events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.\n\nSerious dermatologic reactions: Fatal and serious cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) complications: Fatal and serious cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported. Other fatal and serious GI complications include perforation, hemorrhage, erosion, ulcer, intestinal obstruction, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus. Lymphoma with pre-existing GI involvement may increase the risk of perforation. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, perform a prompt diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately.\n\nHyperglycemia: Serious cases, such as new-onset hyperglycemia, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis (including fatal outcomes) have been reported with ADCETRIS. Hyperglycemia occurred more frequently in patients with high body mass index or diabetes. Monitor serum glucose and if hyperglycemia develops, administer anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated.\n\nEmbryo-fetal toxicity: Based on the mechanism of action and animal studies, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of this potential risk, and to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for 2 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during ADCETRIS treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of ADCETRIS.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in adult patients are peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, mucositis, abdominal pain, and rash. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u226520%) in adult patients are decreased neutrophils, increased creatinine, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, increased glucose, increased ALT, and increased AST.\n\nThe most common Grade \u22653 adverse reactions (\u22655%) in combination with AVEPC in pediatric patients were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and infection.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n\nConcomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential to affect the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Closely monitor adverse reactions.\n\nUSE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS\n\nLactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended during ADCETRIS treatment.\n\nPlease see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING, for ADCETRIS here.

            "content": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and President Donald Trump go way back to the days of Operation Warp Speed. So, as the new president lays out his priorities in the first few weeks of his second term, the pharma CEO expressed confidence that they can still work together.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed across pharma company earnings calls this month as the fourth quarter reporting period wears on. Bourla was among the CEOs asked to speak to the new administration\u2019s many policies affecting the industry, particularly as Robert F. Kennedy Jr .\u2019s controversial nomination to run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was cleared to head to the full Senate during Pfizer\u2019s Feb. 4 call.\n\n\u201cI have a very long-lasting relationship with the President that was cemented during Operation Warp Speed when we developed the vaccine for COVID, and I know that the President is very proud of what he was able to accomplish, and he has made public statements on that,\u201d Bourla said on the call.\n\nBourla also referenced a dinner where Trump introduced him to RFK Jr., and the Pfizer chief \u201ctried to understand his views.\u201d Bourla said he focused not on where they disagreed, but on where they can agree, on initiatives like chronic diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In subsequent meetings with RFK Jr., Bourla said he spotted opportunity for collaboration.\n\n\u201cDo I expect that we will agree on everything on vaccines? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Bourla said. Given all of the statements made by RFK Jr. and the administration, Bourla said he believes he will have \u201ca way more tempered view on how to interact with the vaccines.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically about RFK Jr.\u2019s statements on removing vaccine liability protections that shield companies from injury claims for their products, Bourla said any changes would need to go through Congress.\n\nIf RFK Jr. does make any moves in this area, \u201cI think that he won\u2019t find in front of him the industry, he will find in front him the total medical community and the total scientific community and payers, that they don\u2019t want to see a reduction in vaccination because that\u2019s a very cost-effective way of controlling healthcare costs,\u201d Bourla said. Moreover, the Trump administration does not want to see another health crisis, he added.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner on his company\u2019s earnings call pledged to work with Trump and RFK Jr., particularly on ensuring the FDA \u201chas what it needs to fulfill its mission.\u201d\n\nIRA and Tariffs\n\nOne policy the industry has been outspoken against is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed and signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022, which included provisions to start negotiations of drug prices under Medicare. Trump has begun chipping away at some portions of the IRA\u2019s wider mandates but has yet to clarify his intentions on the drug pricing issues.\n\nAfter going through the first round of price negotiations, Boerner said he has notes for the new administration. BMS has been candid in its criticism of the law, even joining a lawsuit along with peers AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson to challenge its constitutionality.\n\n\u201cWe see the need to have a number of fixes that will avoid some of the more damaging aspects of the law and some of the more perverse incentives,\u201d Boerner said, adding that addressing the bill and the spillover impact are some of the key things BMS will be focused on.\n\nRegardless of how the law evolves, Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said the U.S. will always be the top market for new medicines.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the U.S. . . . will remain absolutely vital for an innovative company and R&D-driven company like Takeda,\u201d Weber told investors on a January 30 earnings call. \u201cIt\u2019s a country where new innovative medicines have the fastest launch, and this is where we have the highest level of innovation recognition and reward for innovation. It\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nPharma leaders were also peppered with questions about Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, which would levy steep fees on imports of certain materials and products to the U.S. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and pharmaceuticals could be subject to those fees, although the true breadth remains unclear. Several companies pointed to a fast-moving situation, with plenty of unknowns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to comment on something that is not real today,\u201d Sanofi CFO Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roger said during the company\u2019s earnings call. But he admitted that Sanofi has significant exposure to the U.S., with 25% of products the company markets worldwide coming within the region.\n\nWeber admitted the tariffs could have an impact on Takeda\u2019s business as well. \u201cAt Takeda, we have a manufacturing network focused on U.S., Europe, Singapore and Japan. It\u2019s a global network which was built on the premise of free trade,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are more forces against free trade, we\u2019ll have to adapt over time.\u201d\n\nAt Merck, CFO Caroline Litchfield said the New Jersey pharma has global operations with limited exposure to China, Canada and Mexico, which have been the key targets of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs.\n\nEisai, another Japanese pharma, also faced these questions, with executives simply saying they are engaging with their staff on the ground in Washington, D.C. to learn more.\n\nOn the biotech side, leaders have been more outspoken, especially after the Trump administration moved to slash funding to universities, medical centers and other institutions for medical research. On Monday, a U.S. judge blocked the move before the cuts could take effect.",

It is specifically for patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation or auto-HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy.\n\nThe FDA approval is supported by Phase 3 ECHELON-3 study data, which showed a significant improvement in overall survival or OS for relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients treated with ADCETRIS plus lenalidomide and rituximab. The study included heavily pre-treated patients, including those previously treated with CAR-T therapy, and demonstrated a survival benefit regardless of CD30 expression.\n\nLBCL, a type of NHL, affects B lymphocytes, key immune cells. DLBCL is its most common and aggressive form, with over 25,000 U.S. cases yearly. Up to 40% relapse or become refractory, and 3,500+ need third-line therapy.

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of -22% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.1%. This estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.03 indicates a change of +2.7% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.24 billion and $62.76 billion estimates indicate -0.6% and -0.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPfizer reported revenues of $17.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.52%. The EPS surprise was +31.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

            "content": "This essay originally appeared in Fortune.\n\nWith relevance to current life science companies, the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, often labelled \u201cthe father of modern medicine,\u201d advised almost 3,000 years ago \u201chealing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.\u201d That counsel rings especially true for a pair of ostensibly beleaguered drugmakers, Pfizer and Merck, both of whose stocks have been battered this week despite reporting strong earnings, continuing a prolonged stretch of share underperformance for both companies even with paradoxically good revenues \u200c\n\nThese two iconic pharmaceutical firms have good company as virtually the entire pharmaceutical industry outside of the weight drug titans, GLP-1 companies, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are trading at near-record low valuations. But while they face different and unique challenges, both Pfizer and Merck stand out for the extent to which the investment community may be uniquely underappreciating their prescription for future success. For both drugmakers, investors seem to be addicted to bad news, but some good news could be exactly the antidote the doctor ordered.\u200c\n\nPfizer\u2019s pharma pipeline is underappreciated outside the labs\n\nWith yet another quarter where Pfizer handily beat consensus earnings expectations, it\u2019s even more clear that CEO Albert Bourla is already well on his way toward getting Pfizer back on track\u2014as we presciently wrote in Fortune last year. Not only is Bourla delivering on his cost-cutting pledges, but he is driving renewed sales stability and even impressive sales growth, with Pfizer apparently seizing COVID-19 vaccine market share from rivals such as Moderna.\u200c\n\nThat Pfizer\u2019s turnaround is already well underway is reflected by the fact that activist investor Starboard Value, led by Jeffrey Smith, wisely chose not to nominate any dissident directors to Pfizer\u2019s board ahead of this year\u2019s annual meeting, an apparent vote of confidence that the company is on the right track and apparently satisfied with their constructive, mutually respectful, fruitful engagement with Bourla\u2014for now at least.\u200c\n\nBut Starboard\u2019s decision to \u201cpass\u201d is also a tacit acknowledgment that when it comes to pharma, there are no quick, overnight fixes; and as reflected by Pfizer\u2019s stagnant stock price, current sales matter far less than pipeline excitement in driving drug stock performance. That is because drugmakers have a unique business model where they are only able to maintain the patents on their drugs for around 10-20 years before the patents expire and other companies are able to sell generic versions of the drug, known as loss of exclusivity (LoE); and thus must constantly seek out new, promising drug candidates to replace lost revenues as patents roll off the books continually, and develop those drugs through capital-intensive R&D over the span of years if not decades.\u200c\n\nWith some ~$17 billion in revenues scheduled to roll off Pfizer\u2019s books over the next five years from LoEs, the investment community is understandably laser focused on Pfizer\u2019s pipeline\u2014and admittedly, while the company has already refocused its pipeline to prioritize higher return investments, Pfizer could be much more aggressive in communicating how its pipeline is already poised for tremendous success. While Pfizer management should be commended for opting for a cautious, conservative \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver\u201d approach after being burned before, at the same time, many investors and analysts are ludicrously ascribing zero value to some of Pfizer\u2019s most promising drug candidates, amidst widespread uncertainty and misplaced anxiety.\u200c\n\nHere are some key facts when it comes to Pfizer\u2019s drug pipeline, which the company ought to be shouting from the mountaintops at every opportunity and conveying clearly with quantifiable return on invested capital metrics, not only technical scientific data.\u200c\n\nFirst, the financial returns on Pfizer\u2019s $43 billion Seagen deal have already exceeded the most optimistic internal estimates, with several oncology drugs poised to become blockbusters. Thanks to the Seagen deal paired with technological advances in drug discovery resulting from AI, Pfizer is poised to become the world\u2019s greatest oncology company, on the forefront of solving previously unsolvable cancers representing hundreds of billions in potential revenues.\u200c\n\nSecond, the returns on invested capital from Pfizer\u2019s $11 billion Biohaven transaction have also already exceeded the most optimistic internal estimates, with Nurtec sales growing exponentially en route to blockbuster status, after some initial challenges which are now firmly history.\u200c\n\nThird, many investors still fail to appreciate the full potential of Pfizer\u2019s oral GLP-1 drug candidate, danuglipron, which is on the verge of advancing to Phase 3 studies and is well positioned to become the second oral GLP-1 drug to market, years ahead of competitors\u2014and with the potential oral GLP-1 market dwarfing even the existing injectable GLP-1 market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Fourth, contrary to the myth that Pfizer can\u2019t do R&D and business development, Pfizer\u2019s return on invested capital across its homegrown drugs is near the top of its peer group, and management could be more proactive in quantifying that\u2014along with its strong capital allocation track record\u2014for skittish investors.\u200c\n\nOf course, there are some cynics who take a \u201cshow-me\u201d attitude, and fortunately for those cynics, a catalyst-rich 2025 will provide no shortage of potential sparkplugs, including the release of key GLP-1 danuglipron data in just a few weeks\u2019 time on top of four regulatory decisions, nine Phase 3 readouts, and 13 pivotal program starts. But in the meantime, it won\u2019t hurt Pfizer to sell the story a bit more to anxious investors, and it doesn\u2019t take overpromising or idle speculation to do so. The facts, and just the facts, are enough, and plenty compelling. Sometimes, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis quipped, \u201csunlight is the best disinfectant.\u201d\u200c\n\nMerck\u2019s keys to the future beyond Keytruda\n\nMerck\u2019s challenges are different from Pfizer\u2019s, yet not without some parallels. Similar to Pfizer, the company handily beat consensus earnings expectations this week, yet its stock plummeted 10% on the news that Merck is halting shipments to China of its cancer-preventing Gardasil vaccine while rescinding and lowering guidance.\u200c\n\nWhile Merck\u2019s candor and honesty in pulling Chinese sales of Gardasil off the table is commendable, what was lost amidst the market sell-off is the fact that all Gardasil sales around the world represents merely ~10% of Merck\u2019s revenues, a tiny fraction compared to Merck\u2019s blockbuster Keytruda powerhouse, which represents approximately half of all of Merck\u2019s sales\u2014not to mention that Gardasil sales remain strong around the rest of the world ex-China.\u200c\n\nSimply put, Keytruda is the far more important growth driver, and the story there is much more exciting. The continued soaring success of Keytruda speaks to the triumphant legacy of Merck\u2019s former CEO, the legendary Ken Frazier, who delivered countless blockbusters during his tenure at the top from which Merck continues to reap billions, ranging from Keytruda to Gardasil to Bridion to Lynparza to Lenvima. But with Keytruda facing a LoE in 2028, Frazier\u2019s successor Robert Davis has quietly but triumphantly developed an easier-to-use version of Keytruda 2. The new-and-improved version can be given through a simple needle rather than requiring an intravenous infusion, shortening the time required to administer it from 30 minutes to three minutes, and is poised to capture at least 40% the existing Keytruda market if not more\u2014meaning the Keytruda expiry in 2028 may not be the Armageddon it appears to be.\u200c\n\nEven beyond Keytruda, Davis has diversified Merck\u2019s pipeline by tripling over the last three years the number of drug candidates in late-phase development, which represents over $50 billion in potential revenues. Merck can still grow its pipeline even more through M&A, particularly in the GLP-1 space, thanks to $14 billion cash on hand and a nearly entirely de-levered balance sheet with less than 1x debt.\u200c\n\nDepressing investor value with RFK\u2019s distressing science values\n\nOf course, both Pfizer and Merck stocks have been hurt by the elephant in the room\u2014the impending confirmation of controversial Health & Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who many believe favors superstition over science.\u200c\n\nWhile some speculate that RFK Jr.\u2019s most fervent anti-vaccine instincts will be curtailed, his beliefs on vaccines are not only dangerous economically\u201469% of Trump-friendly major CEOs told us privately that they believe RFK\u2019s anti-vax instincts could pose a threat to public health and the American economy\u2014but also dangerous for public health, since the pharmaceutical industry, and vaccines, have played a leading role in improving public health and have been key drivers of extending the average lifespan of American citizens to record levels over the past few decades. In 1900, average global life expectancy was just 32 years; thanks to advances in medicine, today the average life expectancy is 72 years, and still rising, with seven previously deadly diseases near eradication, ranging from scourges such as smallpox to measles to polio.\u200c\n\nThe facts are powerful when it comes to vaccines\u2019 proven benefits. Should RFK Jr. actually try curtailing access to vaccines, he will be confronting a torrent of opposition from across civil society. Far from playing a pernicious role, drugmakers actually play a heroic role in investing in life-saving research, with trillions spent on life sciences R&D every year to advance new drug discoveries.\u200c\n\nThat R&D takes place not only at big pharma companies\u2014household names such as Pfizer and Merck\u2014but also at smaller, less well-known but no less heroic biosciences startups, such as Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s Roivant Sciences, which has brought many drugs to market tackling everything from autoimmune diseases to inflammation to dermatology. Another one is Vlad Coric\u2019s Biohaven, which is a pioneer in migraine treatment and neurological disorders.\u200c\n\nEven RFK Jr.\u2019s boss, President Donald Trump, has directed ire toward not the drugmakers, but rather the middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). As President Trump declared, \u201cwe have a thing called a \u2018middleman\u2019\u2026that makes more money than the drug companies, and they don\u2019t do anything except they\u2019re middlemen. We are going to knock out the middleman.\u201d\u200c\n\n\n\nClearly, despite the battering Pfizer and Merck have taken from investors, there is more good news than meets the eye. As Jim Cramer said on CNBC today, \u201cI am mystified\u2026[they] are doing everything they promised and more\u2026and that\u2019s why you buy!\u201d While investors might be addicted to bad news, an antidote is in order in all the underappreciated good news hiding in plain sight, as Pfizer and Merck fulfill their prescriptions for success.\u200c",

            "content": "Investors looking for ways to pump up their passive income streams might want to turn their heads toward the pharmaceutical industry. At recent prices, you can buy shares of Merck (MRK -0.15%) that offer a yield above 3%, and shares of Pfizer (PFE 0.47%) offer a yield above 6%.\n\nWhich of these two high-yield dividend payers is best for your portfolio? Let's weigh their strong points against some of the challenges they face, to see which stock is a better buy now.\n\nThe case for Merck\n\nShares of Merck have fallen about 34% from a peak they reached last year. The stock is under pressure because its lead drug, a cancer immunotherapy called Keytruda, is expected to lose patent-protected market exclusivity in the U.S. and Chinese markets in 2028.\n\nPatent protections regarding Keytruda in Europe are expected to expire in 2031, and incoming biosimilar competition could leave an enormous gap to fill. Fourth-quarter sales of Keytruda grew 19% year over year to an annualized $31.3 billion. That's a little over half of Merck's total revenue stream.\n\nNow that Merck stock has been beaten down, it offers a higher yield than we usually see from the well-established pharmaceutical giant. At recent prices, the stock offers a 3.7% yield.\n\nLast March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Winrevair, a treatment for adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Fourth-quarter Winrevair sales climbed to an annualized $800 million and could go a long way toward offsetting upcoming Keytruda losses. Analyst estimates suggest Winrevair sales could reach $4 billion by 2029.\n\nBiologic drugs like Keytruda typically lose around 50% of sales within the first couple of years following a loss of patent-protected exclusivity. Annual Keytruda sales already exceed $31 billion, so Merck will need at least a few more Winrevair-sized drug launches to offset the upcoming losses. Behind Winrevair, though, there isn't much in Merck's pipeline to get excited about.\n\nBehind Winrevair, the most promising clinical-stage program in Merck's pipeline is a cholesterol drug tentatively named MK-0616. The company started a 17,000-patient phase 3 program to test MK-0616 in 2023, and initial results could be ready soon.\n\nMK-0616 is an oral PCSK9 inhibitor that greatly boosts the liver's ability to absorb low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Repatha, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor from Amgen, grew sales by 36% last year to $2.2 billion. Even if Merck's orally available option goes on to dominate the PCSK9 space, the company needs several more blockbuster drug launches before investors can comfortably expect a continuation of its dividend-payout raising streak after Keytruda loses market exclusivity.\n\nThe case for Pfizer\n\nShares of Pfizer are down by more than half from an all-time high the stock set in 2021. Fortunately for income-seeking investors, its dividend payout is moving in the right direction.\n\nLast December, Pfizer raised its payout for the 16th consecutive year to $0.43 per share. At recent prices, it offers a juicy 6.7% yield.\n\nOften, stocks offering ultrahigh yields of more than four times the market average are on the edge of a dividend cut. This doesn't appear to be the case at Pfizer. The pharmaceutical giant expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $2.80 and $3.00 per share this year. That's more than it needs to meet a dividend commitment it recently raised to $1.72 per share.\n\nSales of Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment and vaccine are down a long way from their peak, but the worst is over. Combined sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty fell by 11% to a combined $11.1 billion in 2024.\n\nEliquis, a blood thinner marketed in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, is Pfizer's largest revenue stream at the moment. It could begin competing with generic versions in the U.S. market in 2028, but the gap it leaves won't be too difficult to fill. Eliquis is responsible for only about 10.3% of Pfizer's total revenue stream.\n\nPfizer has several recently launched treatments in position to offset upcoming Eliquis losses. For example, Padcev, a new cancer treatment, racked up an annualized $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and could climb much higher. The FDA approved it to treat frontline bladder cancer patients in 2023, which is expected to push annual sales past $8 billion by 2030.\n\nThe better buy now\n\nCompared to Merck, Pfizer's upcoming patent cliffs will be relatively easy to manage. While Pfizer seems likely to continue its dividend-raising streak through the coming decade, the future of Merck's payout is much less certain.\n\nIf these two stocks offered identical yields, Pfizer would still be the better buy. With a much higher yield that seems likely to continue rising for at least another decade, Pfizer is clearly the better dividend stock to buy now.",

The drug is indicated for use even if those infections are caused by so-called gram-negative bacteria, like E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.\n\nGram-negative bacterial infections are difficult to control and seen as a public health threat because of their ability to thwart available treatment. The World Health Organization notes antimicrobial resistance is making infections harder to treat and medical procedures riskier. One estimate holds that antibiotic resistance could lead to more than 39 million deaths globally by 2050.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe FDA has long prioritized and incentivized research into new antibiotics. And though drugmakers still struggle to sell them due to well-established financial challenges, there have been a series of drug approvals in recent years.\n\nEmblaveo has two components. One is the antibiotic aztreonam and the other is avibactam, which helps aztreonam fight bacteria that can resist treatment. Its approval was supported by data from a Phase 3 study testing the combination against the antibiotic meropenem in complicated intra-abdominal infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Study results published in The Lancet in February showed Emblaveo led to similar cure rates. Mortality rates were also similar between study groups.\n\nAccording to AbbVie, Emblaveo is the first combination therapy of its kind approved for use against these types of tough-to-treat infections. The drug was cleared last year in Europe for people with multidrug-resistant infections and limited treatment options.\n\nAbbvie holds drug rights in the U.S. and Canada, while Pfizer owns commercialization rights elsewhere.\n\nThe drug is expected to be available in the U.S. by the third quarter.",

The deal was secured by Von der Leyen after her text offensive, as she later told the New York Times in a flattering interview. It was a much-needed win for the commission president, who had faced accusations of mishandling the vaccine rollout earlier in the pandemic.\n\nAs an investigative reporter, I filed an access request under the EU\u2019s freedom of information law to the messages shared between von der Leyen and Bourla. These messages, if we had them, might provide important insights into how the controversial life-saving vaccines deal came together. They might also help to answer questions such as why the EU became Pfizer\u2019s single biggest customer but reportedly paid a much steeper price for this batch of vaccines compared with the first tranche of Covid shots it had bought.\n\nThere is a bigger principle at stake here, too: EU citizens have a right to know what was being negotiated on their behalf during a public health emergency. Did the contract involve too many doses of the vaccine bought at a fixed price, with no scope for a review as the pandemic developed? Did millions of expensive jabs go to waste because of the terms that Bourla secured from a panic-buying Von der Leyen?\n\nBut the commission refused the request to share the messages, claiming that the texts were \u201cby [their] nature short-lived\u201d and were not covered by the EU\u2019s freedom of information law. The commission\u2019s secrecy around its communications is so fiercely guarded that it is now defending its refusal to make the texts available in the EU court.\n\nAs things stand, any potentially controversial exchanges between EU officials and outside interests, including corporate lobbyists and authoritarian governments, can simply be moved to text or WhatsApp to dodge public scrutiny. To date, no text messages have been stored in the commission\u2019s archives. They are unavailable for scrutiny not only in the present, but are also lost to posterity.\n\nAfter the commission\u2019s ruling on my request, the New York Times and its former Brussels bureau chief Matina Stevis-Gridneff, who had first reported on the personal diplomacy between Von der Leyen and Bourla, filed a lawsuit to uncover the secret messages.\n\nThe EU executive\u2019s legal team claimed in court that the texts were not \u201csubstantive\u201d and therefore did not qualify as documents subject to disclosure under the EU\u2019s freedom of information law. At the same time, under questioning by the judges, commission officials admitted they had never actually seen the messages but relied on assurances from Von der Leyen\u2019s staff about their lack of substance. No wonder one exasperated judge called the commission\u2019s testimony \u201cbizarre\u201d.\n\nThe commission\u2019s disregard for transparency in this case is no accident. The EU agreed a fund worth \u20ac723bn (\u00a3600bn) of public money to revive the EU economy after the pandemic. The recovery and resilience facility, unprecedented in EU history, was supposed to finance investments in digital technologies and climate action over six years through grants and loans. But the commission and EU governments have refused to reveal all the beneficiaries to date. When my colleagues at Follow the Money, an investigative media outlet, asked for a breakdown, they reluctantly released the top 100 recipients in each country but left billions in spending unaccounted for.\n\nThe secrecy may have provided a cover for suspected cases of abuse. Greek authorities are probing allegations of fraud linked to \u20ac2.5bn from the post-Covid recovery fund, while Italian police on behalf of EU prosecutors are investigating another potential fraud case worth \u20ac600m.\n\nRequests for information about the spending from other high-profile EU funds have also been denied or delayed for years without explanation.\n\nThe EU\u2019s administrative culture \u2013 taking its cue from the powerful bureaucracies of its founding members Germany and France \u2013 has always been secretive. But under Von der Leyen, things have become worse. Crucial documents are being held back for political reasons by \u201cpowerful consiglieri\u201d in Von der Leyen\u2019s cabinet, the outgoing European ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, has claimed.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Von der Leyen portrays herself as a defender against authoritarian forces and, with rightwing parties gaining ground in last year\u2019s European parliament elections, has vowed to strengthen the rule of law in the EU.\n\nHowever, her reluctance to have the public interfere with her personal communication completely undermines that promise. When her executive appears to flout the rule of law and conducts its most important business in secret, it empowers those who prefer strongman politics to democratic accountability. In the long run, limiting transparency will make it easier for authoritarian leaders such as Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who have rolled back the rule of law and shroud their own governing in secrecy, to claim that the EU does not have a leg to stand on.\n\nThe case before the EU court, which is expected to be decided later this year, could put a limit on Von der Leyen\u2019s secrecy. But other, more forceful measures are needed to fulfil the promise of transparency in the EU\u2019s founding treaties and its charter of fundamental rights. Pressure for more openness must come from the media, civil society organisations and the European parliament.\n\nA complete culture change is needed. EU governments call the shots: they need to remind the EU executive that maintaining public trust means allowing people to understand how key decisions that affect their lives are made, even if such transparency makes governing \u2013 and texting \u2013 more complicated.\n\nAlexander Fanta is a journalist at the investigative news outlet Follow the Money",

            "content": "Most Super Bowl viewers expect to see ads for beer, snacks, and trucks. And Sunday\u2019s game delivered on all the usual commercial fronts.\n\nBut in 2025, a somewhat more surprising trend emerged: pharmaceutical advertisers went big for the Big Game.\n\nNovartis shelled out millions for its first Super Bowl ad, which playfully shined a spotlight on our culture\u2019s obsession with breasts\u2014all to say, with the help of actor Hailee Steinfeld and cancer survivor Wanda Sykes, that we should pay more attention to breast cancer prevention through proactive screenings. The spot was lauded by creative professionals, who said it broke the mold of traditional, buttoned-up healthcare advertising.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer aired a moving spot about a young boy beating cancer, set to LL Cool J\u2019s triumphant \u201cKnock You Out.\u201d\n\nThe biotech giant made its Super Bowl debut last year with an animated retelling of the history of innovation in medical science, spooled out against the backdrop of Queen\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now.\u201d\n\nPfizer was the sole healthcare brand in the Super Bowl last year\u2014an appearance that some credit for sparking an accelerating trend.\n\n\u201cLast year Pfizer entered the game for the first time with their triumphant homage to scientists,\u201d said Ryan Lehr, co-CCO of creative agency Deutsch. Now, he said, \u201cit only makes sense that we are seeing others in the healthcare and pharma space throw their hat into the ring.\u201d\n\nBut this year\u2019s Pfizer ad was met with mixed reactions from consumers frustrated with the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nPfizer\u2019s cancer drug commercial was beautiful, but their breast cancer drug Ibrance costs $10k per month and their prostate cancer drug Xtandi costs $22k per month. Beautiful commercials don\u2019t change the fact that 42% of cancer patients exhaust their life savings in 2 years. \u2014 Melanie D'Arrigo (@DarrigoMelanie) February 10, 2025\n\nPfizer wasn\u2019t the only pharma brand to generate backlash for its Super Bowl LIX push.\n\nDuring the third quarter of the game, direct-to-consumer telehealth brand Hims & Hers shined a spotlight on America\u2019s obesity crisis, advocating for greater access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The provider took aim at a healthcare system it claims keeps people \u201csick and stuck\u201d by restricting access to effective treatments.\n\nBut the ad, which was originally unveiled on YouTube late last month, incurred swift blowback.\n\nPharma industry trade group the Partnership for Safe Medicines urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban the ad from airing, arguing that it misleads consumers by promoting a lower-cost, compounded version of Ozempic without proper disclosures.\n\nNot long after, Senators Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Roger Marshall (R-KS) also petitioned the FDA, writing in a joint letter: \u201cNowhere in this promotion is there any side-effect disclosure, risk, or safety information, as would be typically required in a pharmaceutical advertisement.\u201d\n\nHims & Hers responded with a statement alleging that industry groups are criticizing the ad in an effort to stifle competition and \u201ccancel an advertisement that directly calls out how they are part of a system that fails to prioritize the health of Americans.\u201d\n\nA new direction\n\nDespite the controversies, the Novartis, Pfizer, and Hims & Hers spots all represent a welcome evolution for a category that\u2019s rarely been seen as a leader in commercial creativity.\n\n\u201cPharma ads used to feel more like clinical PSAs\u2014safe and focused on facts,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, Global CCO at FCB. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s a clear shift toward bold ideas designed to make a transformational impact. [Brands are] leaning into creative storytelling and human connections.\u201d\n\nOrd\u00f3\u00f1ez likens the trend to the tonal shift in insurance advertising over the past decade, \u201cwhere brands moved from being overly serious to telling relatable stories.\u201d He added: \u201cPharma is finally embracing creativity, which is a major step forward for the category.\u201d\n\nRegional healthcare organizations also took advantage of the opportunity to capture consumer attention around the Big Game. Local market buys included an ad from NYU Langone, a New York healthcare system, as well as Charleston-based university hospital MUSC Health.\n\nPlus, some brands seized on the opportunity to activate around the Super Bowl hype sans TV ads.\n\nHealth clinic SynergenX and hormone care chain Low T Center, for example, collaborated on a Super Bowl play designed to raise awareness about men\u2019s testosterone health. As part of the initiative, former pro athletes including ex-Houston Oilers linebacker Al Smith and left tackle Brad Hopkins spoke in interviews in New Orleans about how testosterone replacement therapy has helped them stay strong and healthy post-career.\n\nHealth and pharma brands are increasingly seeing the value of Big Game adjacency. \u201cHealth issues like cancer, access to treatment, and affordability are more relevant than ever,\u201d Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez said, and \u201cthe Super Bowl offers the world\u2019s biggest platform to create awareness, spark conversations, and impact culture.\u201d",

            "content": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books, the Philadelphia Eagles are champions and medical marketers want to know how the pharma and health ads performed on the biggest stage.\n\nThere were a number of health brands that advertised during the big game, namely Pfizer, Novartis and Hims & Hers \u2014 in addition to Bayer, Cetaphil, Power to the Patients, WeightWatchers and UK Healthcare.\n\nThe former trio of brands all advertised nationally during the Super Bowl, taking different approaches to their creative and generating different reactions from viewers.\n\nIf there was any throughline between the three commercials, it was marketing designed to engage with patients, make them more proactive with their health and meet them on a personal level.\n\nIn a note released Monday morning, EDO said health-curious ads that ran during the big game drove \u201cmassive engagement\u201d among consumers.\n\nLaura Grover, SVP and head of client solutions at EDO, said consumer priorities may be evolving, but audiences continue to gravitate toward practicality and real-world utility over novelty.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Super Bowl made that clear \u2014 practical tech outperformed generative AI, health-conscious messaging resonated more than ever,\u201d she said. \u201cThese trends reinforce that brands can win in the Big Game when they align with real consumer value while taking bold, strategic positions. The Super Bowl isn\u2019t just a branding exercise \u2014 it\u2019s one of the most powerful advertising moments of the year to move the needle on business performance.\u201d\n\nPfizer led the way\n\nMost considered Pfizer\u2019s 60-second ad \u201cKnock Out\u201d \u2014 which featured a dream sequence of a pediatric cancer patient shadowboxing set to LL Cool J\u2019s \u201cMama Said Knock You Out\u201d \u2014 to be the winner of the night.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked the Pfizer ad 10th overall, with an ad meter rating of 3.336.\n\n\u201cPfizer\u2019s Super Bowl spot brought the fight against cancer to the national stage, with Michael Buffer lending his signature catchphrase while LL Cool J\u2019s \u2018Mama Said Knock You Out\u2019 set the tone,\u201d according to the Ad Meter description. \u201cIn the end, the 60-second commercial struck a chord with fans and highlighted a storytelling trend for many of the night\u2019s top ads.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, iSpot.tv named Pfizer\u2019s ad as the top spot by likeability, scoring 19% above the norm.\n\nThe company noted that the drugmaker\u2019s commercial led the way among all Super Bowl ads, not just pharma. According to iSpot, this is particularly notable since pharma TV ads generally don\u2019t score very well with audiences as viewers tend to dislike them.\n\nAdditionally, iSpot\u2019s analysis found that viewers considered the message of triumphing over cancer to be the single best thing about Pfizer\u2019s ad \u2014 cited by 41% of surveyed viewers. The top viewer emotion/reaction was corporate responsibility.\n\nU.K.-based ad agency DAIVID said Pfizer had a strong, positive message with its ad and scored high with intense positive emotions. The commercial was also a top performer with spikes in positive emotions of \u201chope,\u201d \u201cadmiration,\u201d \u201cwarmth,\u201d \u201cgratitude\u201d and \u201cinspiration.\u201d\n\nDAIVID\u2019s survey respondents ranked Pfizer\u2019s ad in the top five in terms of being emotionally engaging.\n\nMeanwhile, EDO ranked Pfizer\u2019s ad 58th and said it had 0.55x as much engagement as the median Super Bowl ad.\n\nKantar noted that Pfizer\u2019s ad ranked in the 66th percentile for impact, the 79th percent for power and the 81st percentile for enjoyment.\n\nHims & Hers\u2019 polarizing response\n\nPerhaps the most controversial ad to run during the Super Bowl was Hims & Hers\u2019 \u201cSick of the System\u201d \u2014 which promoted the telehealth company\u2019s compounded GLP-1 offerings.\n\nThe 60-second spot debuted a week prior to running during the Big Game and received a polarized response from medical marketers, viewers and even lawmakers.\n\nDays before kickoff, two senators asked the Food and Drug Administration to review the ad, saying it ran the risk of \u201cmisleading patients by omitting safety or side effect information.\u201d\n\nThough EDO said Hims & Hers\u2019 spot was the fifth highest-performing ad overall, delivering 7.7x as much engagement as the median ad, the broader response was mixed.\n\nDAIVID said the commercial, which features Childish Gambino\u2019s \u201cThis is America\u201d and a voiceover bluntly critiquing the pharma industry and societal views on obesity, as \u201cthe most pushy\u201d ad.\n\nThe agency said the commercial overindexed on intense negative emotions of \u201cshame,\u201d \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cguilt\u201d as viewers had a lukewarm reaction to the ad.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked \u201cSick of the System\u201d 49th overall, with an ad meter rating of 2.51.\n\nOn the other hand, Kantar said Hims & Hers ranked in the 77th percentile for impact, the 88th percent for power and the 86th percentile for enjoyment.\n\nMeanwhile, iSpot.tv said the message of the ad was the single best thing about it, with 31% of viewers citing it as a top performer for Hims & Hers.\n\nNovartis finishes in the middle\n\nNovartis took perhaps the biggest swing of the night with its breast cancer awareness ad.\n\nUnlike Pfizer and Hims & Hers, Novartis debuted \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d at the Super Bowl after releasing two 15-second teasers featuring Wanda Sykes and Hailee Steinfeld in the week leading up to the game.\n\nThat was probably for good reason given that the commercial starts with numerous shots of women\u2019s breasts in all manner of clothing.\n\nThe provocative beginning then transitions into a focus on breast health, how common breast cancer is among American women and how they can get screened to take proactive care of their bodies.\n\nUltimately, the unorthodox pharma ad paid off \u2014 depending on who you ask.\n\nThe USA Today Ad Meter ranked \u201cYour Attention, Please\u201d #16 overall, with an ad meter rating of 3.22 out of 5.\n\nMore than 40% of viewers surveyed by iSpot said the message of Novartis\u2019 ad was the single best thing about it.\n\nMeanwhile, EDO placed it 31st overall with 1.2x as much engagement as the median Super Bowl ad.\n\nKantar said Novartis ranked in the 62nd percentile for impact, the 80th percent for power and the 88th percentile for enjoyment.",

            "content": "The past three years have been difficult for Pfizer (PFE 0.47%). The pharmaceutical giant's financial results worsened substantially as its coronavirus-related tailwind came to a screeching halt. Investors responded by sending the stock down significantly. Pfizer has lost about 50% of its market value in the past three years. If the stock can bounce back and deliver excellent returns over the long run, initiating a position today might be a great idea. Are there good reasons to think Pfizer has what it takes to recover? Let's find out.\n\nBetter financials are barely helping\n\nPfizer's top line moved in the wrong direction for several quarters. That's not surprising. The company generated mouthwatering sales from Paxlovid, its COVID-19 treatment, and especially Comirnaty, its vaccine for the disease, in 2021 and 2022. Once the worst of the pandemic started receding, combined revenue from both products fell off a cliff. However, the drugmaker has improved significantly over the past year. In 2024, Pfizer's total revenue increased by a respectable 7% year over year to $63.6 billion. The company's adjusted earnings per share jumped by 69% year over year to $3.11.\n\nDespite Pfizer managing to stop the bleeding on the top and bottom lines, its stock still isn't performing well. Why? First, some of the company's revenue last year was due to acquisitions, so it wasn't all organic growth. Second, Pfizer will face significant patent cliffs by the end of the decade. Anticoagulant Eliquis, the rights of which Pfizer shares with Bristol Myers Squibb, remains one of the company's biggest growth drivers, but it will run out of patent exclusivity by 2029.\n\nThough that is still some years away, developing therapies to replace those running out of protection takes time. Investors apparently don't think any of Pfizer's newer products or pipeline candidates can replace the more than $7 billion in annual sales Eliquis generates. Since the market is forward-looking, Pfizer's stock continues to struggle in anticipation of that headwind.\n\nPatience will be required\n\nLooking at things in context, Pfizer still looks like a strong long-term bet. Here are three reasons why. First, the company's success in the COVID-19 market strengthened its business. Pfizer would be facing the Eliquis (and other) patent cliff problem even if it were not for its coronavirus-related success. However, the company's decision to enter that market and its leadership in that space allowed it to become the first biopharma company to generate $100 billion in annual sales.\n\nIt helped fund mergers and acquisitions and replenish its lineup and pipeline. That brings us to our second point: Pfizer's incredibly deep pipeline. Maybe it does not have a single product in its portfolio that will generate over $7 billion in annual sales, but the company is making a push in key markets that should yield tangible results. Pfizer aims to become a leader in the oncology market following its blockbuster acquisition of cancer specialist Seagen.\n\nThis smaller, cancer-focused drugmaker was already developing an impressive number of products for its size. With the backing of the much larger Pfizer, that innovative wheel should spin even faster. As Pfizer's CEO Albert Bourla said about the acquisition of Seagen, \"We are not buying the golden eggs. We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs.\"\n\nFinally, Pfizer is a solid dividend stock. The company's forward yield is about 6.5%, and despite its issues in the past few years, it has continued to increase its dividend. Pfizer's cash payout ratio of 193% looks unsustainable. It's a result of its recent acquisition-related spending sprees. But the company should be fine. It delivered its predicted net cost savings of $4 billion last year and plans for another $4.5 billion this year. Pfizer's management is dedicated to dividend growth. Investors have nothing to worry about on this front.\n\nIt might take a while for Pfizer to fully recover as it develops and commercializes new products in various areas, but in the meantime, the company will maintain its dividend program. Investors with a long time horizon should still consider the pharmaceutical giant.",

As Pfizer points out, 40% of Americans will develop the disease in their lifetime. I\u2019m sure you, like many of us, have felt the sharp, shadowy figure of the C word in your life at some point and in some way.\n\nSo I admire Pfizer\u2019s approach to its second Super Bowl, bringing the resilience and the motivation. Cancer ads, in general, have evolved from spreading fear to raising hope, (yeah, go figure, try not to totally freak out your TAM).\n\nThis ad is jubilant, it\u2019s triumphant, and we\u2019re cheering along. It flexes to a more heartwarming tone towards the end, as the bravado is stripped back and a family\u2019s fear and vulnerability are on display. The montage of pictures from the boy\u2019s cancer treatment is a powerful and sobering contrast to the fantasy victory we\u2019ve just been shown.\n\nWhat I would like to see more of, and this is a criticism of most cancer ads, is detail.

(NYSE:PFE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pfizer.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nNYSE:PFE Ownership Breakdown February 9th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pfizer?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Pfizer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pfizer's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNYSE:PFE Earnings and Revenue Growth February 9th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Pfizer. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.1% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",

(Biohaven), a subsidiary owned by pharmaceutical company Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer). Pfizer has agreed to pay $59,746,277.54, plus interest, to resolve allegations that Biohaven knowingly submitted or caused false claims to be submitted to Medicaid and other federal health care programs by paying kickbacks, including cash, lavish meals, and honoraria payments, to health care providers to induce them to prescribe Nurtec ODT (Nurtec), a prescription medication for the treatment of migraine headaches. As part of the settlement, the State of Michigan will receive $155,930.53 in restitution and other recoveries.\n\n\u201cMichigan taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to bear the cost of fraudulent corporate practices that prioritize profits over patient health care,\u201d Nessel said. \u201cMy office remains committed to working with federal partners and attorneys general across the county to hold companies accountable for their misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe settlement resolves allegations that between March 1, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2022, Biohaven paid kickbacks to providers to present at speaker programs designed to promote Nurtec to Medicaid and other federal health care beneficiaries, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a- 7b(b). Some providers were allegedly paid tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes exceeding $100,000, for these programs.\n\nIn numerous instances, speaker events were allegedly attended by the providers\u2019 spouses, family members, and friends, who had no educational need to attend. Also, certain providers allegedly attended multiple programs on the same topic, and received expensive meals and drinks paid for by Biohaven, without obtaining any meaningful educational benefit.\n\nThe case was initiated by a whistleblower, a former employee of Biohaven, who will receive a portion of the settlement. A National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (NAMFCU) Team investigated the allegations in conjunction with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in New York. The NAMFCU Team included representatives from the Offices of the Attorneys General for the states of Florida, New York, California, and Virginia.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Health Care Fraud Division (HCFD) handled this case for the Department. The HCFD is the federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for Michigan, and it receives 75 per cent of its funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under a grant award totaling $5,703,460.00 for the fiscal year 2025. The remaining 25 per cent, totaling $1,901,152.00, is funded by the State of Michigan.\n\n*************************",

As for production, the agency Reset led the way, with support from post-production agencies The Den Editorial, BaconX, and Harbor Picture Company.\n\nThe soundtrack for the commercial is LL Cool J\u2019s 1990 hit song Mama Said Knock You Out.\n\nThe musical choice was intentional as the rapper and his wife, Simone Smith, a cancer survivor, partner with the drugmaker to share their care journey throughout the year and highlight the importance of early detection.\n\nOn Thursday, the rapper posted a teaser video on Instagram, announcing himself as a #PfizerPartner who is \u201cjust getting loose\u201d for the big game.\n\n\u201cKnock Out\u201d represents a continuation of Pfizer\u2019s marketing efforts around cancer and the broader mission to build out its oncology focus following the $43 billion acquisition of cancer biotech Seagen in 2023.\n\nOn the regulatory front this year, a Pfizer spokesperson said the company anticipates three regulatory decisions in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, seven Phase 3 readouts, and 12 potential pivotal program starts for different types of cancer.\n\nAt last year\u2019s game, Pfizer unveiled Here\u2019s to Science, a national ad campaign centered around its vision for the future of oncology\u2014all set to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now\u201d by Queen.\n\nThe animated commercial celebrated the 175th anniversary of the company as well as the legacy of science and medicine.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson said its first Super Bowl ad was a success, leading to a rise in consumer trust in the brand from 49% to 71%. Citing data from YouGov, Pfizer saw its audience's brand perception increase 19% after it aired the ad.\n\nWhile Kantar data posited that the Pfizer ad was one of the lowest-performing ads to air during Super Bowl LVIII, data from EDO indicated that Pfizer\u2019s ad ranked 97th out of the 280 Super Bowl ads that ran between 2020 and 2024\u2014registering 1.6x as much engagement as the median ad during that period.\n\nNotably, the ad\u2019s call to visit PfizerForAll calls attention to new features the drugmaker has added to the platform.\n\nThe DTC offering includes the American Cancer Society\u2019s CancerRisk360 tool, which builds on the longstanding relationship between the two healthcare organisations. It also includes a section with information related to atrial fibrillation.\n\nPfizerForAll, which received almost 10 million pageviews in the final four months of 2024, also has an AI-powered digital platform called Health Answers by Pfizer that debuted this week.\n\nThe innovation provides patients with personalised responses to health and wellness questions, summarised from trusted independent sources.\n\nThis story first appeared on Campaign's sister publication MM+M.",

It has played a pivotal role in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths related to COVID-19, following extensive clinical trials that demonstrated its safety and efficacy. The vaccine continues to be a central component of global public health strategies to combat the pandemic.\n\nCLAIM\n\nPfizer releases new list of its COVID-19 vaccine side effects in 2025.\n\nTHE FINDINGS\n\nFindings by The FactCheckHub show that the claim is FALSE!\n\nA Google search using the keywords \u201cPfizer Covid 19 vaccine side effects\u201d showed that the list of so-called side effects originates from a Pfizer document from 2021 that was made public in 2022.\n\nPfizer submitted the document to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021, detailing adverse events reported during the first three months following the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020.\n\nIt is very important to note the distinction between \u201cadverse events\u201d and \u201cside effects.\u201d\n\nAccording to numerous health journals, adverse events refer to any health issues reported after vaccination; however, they are not necessarily caused by the vaccine itself. A side effect, by contrast, is a complication directly attributable to the vaccine.\n\nThe document clearly states in its disclaimer that the reported adverse events \u201cdo not necessarily indicate that a particular AE (adverse event) was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor(s).\u201d\n\nThe data in the report were aggregated from multiple international vaccine safety databases, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Yellow Card system.\n\nAnother report by Reuters clarified that these adverse events were collected from such national reporting systems.\n\nAdditionally, this claim regarding the list of side effects of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine has been scrutinized and debunked by reputable organizations around the world such as Politifact, Reuters and Science Feedback before it reached Nigerian audience recently.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nThe claim that Pfizer releases new list of its COVID-19 vaccine side effects in 2025 is FALSE; Pfizer\u2019s 2021 document only recorded reported adverse events during the early phase of the vaccine\u2019s emergency use\u2014not confirmed side effects.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against other declining dividend stocks.\n\nThe dividend season is here, and the big announcements are rolling in!\n\nThe overall market atmosphere has been moderately negative since the new tariffs from the US. Soon after he entered the Oval Office, President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on imported goods from Canada and Mexico. Chinese products, meanwhile, are left tackling an even higher tariff of 60 percent.\n\nAs a result, on Monday this week, the broader market noted a sharp decline of 0.76 percent, while the Nasdaq reported the same trajectory but at 1.20 percent.\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors have consistently shown interest in dividend stocks, particularly those from companies that have steadily increased their payouts, making them popular among income-focused investors. Analysts have long tracked the performance of Dividend Aristocrats, both historically and in recent times.\n\nIn a January 2019 blog post titled \u201cDividend Growth Strategies and Downside Protection,\u201d Phillip Brzenk, Global Head of Multi-Asset Indexes, examined how dividend growth strategies perform, especially during market downturns. He noted that since the end of 1989, there have been six calendar years where the broader market delivered negative returns. Interestingly, during each of those years, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader equity benchmark by an average margin of 13.28%. In addition, in three of those challenging years, they still managed to generate positive total returns. Brzenk further pointed out that when analyzed on a monthly basis, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the market 53% of the time, with an average outperformance of 0.16%.\n\nAs noted earlier, dividend growth stocks have outperformed the broader market. From its launch in 2005 through September 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats Index delivered a total return of 10.35%, exceeding the broader market\u2019s 9.54% return over the same period. Moreover, these stocks experienced lower volatility, measured at 15.35%, compared to the market\u2019s 16.31%. This suggests that their prices tend to be more stable, making them less susceptible to sharp fluctuations and highlighting their overall resilience.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn the list of underwhelming performers we will be looking into today, the dividend companies with a minimum of $1 billion in market capitalization alone are considered. Then we checked the returns of these stocks and selected 10 stocks that fell on February 6, 2024. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields, as of February 6. We also hedge fund sentiment for each stock, as of Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024.",

The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each.

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

Nearly 41% of Americans will receive a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime, and it still ranks as the second leading cause of death in the country.1,2 At Pfizer, we\u2019re fighting to change those numbers with numbers of our own:\n\n8 : the number of cancer breakthrough medicines we\u2019re aiming to deliver by 2030\n\n: the number of cancer breakthrough medicines we\u2019re aiming to deliver by 2030 40 : the percent share of Pfizer\u2019s research and development budget put towards cancer research\n\n: the percent share of Pfizer\u2019s research and development budget put towards cancer research 2X: the number of patients expected to receive a Pfizer cancer medicine by 2030 compared to today3\n\nOne of our most exciting areas of research are antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs specifically target cancer cells to deliver cancer-killing drugs directly to tumors, limiting damage to healthy cells and potentially limiting side-effects for patients. Pfizer is accelerating the next wave of ADC development so that more patients may have access to these breakthrough drugs, which may help improve outcomes.\n\nTo truly advance in our fight against cancer, we understand that it takes more than just breakthrough medicines. It also requires greater awareness of cancer prevention and early detection, which is why we need everyone to get in the ring with us.\n\nOn Sunday, we\u2019ll be highlighting the fight against cancer in our new ad that will air during the big NFL broadcast. Debuting during one of the biggest television events of the year, the ad spotlights Pfizer\u2019s commitment to developing cancer breakthroughs and aims to inspire the public to join us. The millions watching the Big Game will see the galvanizing spot, which is sure to help us make this fight even bigger; in just 60 seconds, we can ask more than 120 million people to unite with Pfizer and make an even bigger impact.\n\nAwareness is the first step. Millions of Americans are at an increased risk of developing cancer without even knowing it. Understanding their risk factors gives people the knowledge to take action and detect cancer early, when it's most treatable. We\u2019re working with our partners at the American Cancer Society (ACS) to make this easier than ever.\n\nEnter PfizerForAll.com, our platform dedicated to making healthcare a more seamless experience. This hub will now offer access to American Cancer Society CancerRisk360\u2122, an assessment tool that empowers people to join the fight against cancer, right where they are.\n\nDeveloped by the American Cancer Society, the questionnaire makes it simple for people to learn more about their cancer risk factors, considering family history, lifestyle habits, environmental exposures, and medical conditions. The assessment will then guide users to a personalized set of recommendations and insights about prevention, early detection, and lifestyle changes.\n\nIn addition to the American Cancer Society CancerRisk360\u2122 assessment, PfizerForAll also contains health questionnaires for atrial fibrillation (AFib), migraine, and vaccines eligibility.\n\nMaking the American Cancer Society CancerRisk360\u2122 assessment easily accessible through PfizerForAll is part of Pfizer\u2019s ongoing commitment to fighting cancer. Our fight has already resulted in game-changing developments in cancer care, but we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019re working to ensure that more people who have cancer will have access to breakthrough treatments, and that fewer people ever face a cancer diagnosis at all.\n\nCancer doesn\u2019t fight fair, but if we work together, we can fight back and one day deliver its final blow.\n\n[1] Cancer Statistics.

            "content": "For the second consecutive year, Pfizer is advertising at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe pharma giant announced Friday morning that it is doubling down on its fight against cancer with a 60-second ad set to air during the first quarter of the game.\n\nPfizer is airing an ad titled \u201cKnock Out,\u201d which features a dream sequence of a pediatric cancer patient shadowboxing and running through a throng of cheering supporters before being reunited with his family at home.\n\nThe ad concludes with text underscoring Pfizer\u2019s goal to bring eight cancer breakthrough therapies to market by 2030 and encourages viewers to visit PfizerForAll, its direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform that launched in late August.\n\nThe spot was created in collaboration by Publicis Groupe \u2013 Le Truc, Leo NY, Collective, Pfizer and others. As for production, the agency Reset led the way along with support from post-production agencies The Den Editorial, BaconX and Harbor Picture Company.\n\nThe soundtrack for the commercial is LL Cool J\u2019s 1990 hit song Mama Said Knock You Out.\n\nThe musical choice was intentional as the rapper and his wife, Simone Smith, a cancer survivor, are partnering with the drugmaker to share their care journey throughout the year and highlight the importance of early detection.\n\nOn Thursday, the rapper posted a teaser video on Instagram, announcing himself as a #PfizerPartner who is \u201cjust getting loose\u201d for the big game.\n\n\u201cKnock Out\u201d represents a continuation of Pfizer\u2019s marketing efforts around cancer and the broader mission to build out its oncology focus following the $43 billion acquisition of cancer biotech Seagen in 2023.\n\nOn the regulatory front this year, a Pfizer spokesperson said the company anticipates three regulatory decisions in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as seven Phase 3 readouts and 12 potential pivotal program starts for different types of cancer.\n\nAt last year\u2019s game, Pfizer unveiled the Here\u2019s to Science, a national ad campaign centered around its vision for the future of oncology \u2014 all set to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now\u201d by Queen.\n\nThe animated commercial celebrated the 175th anniversary of the company as well as the legacy of science and medicine.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson said its first Super Bowl ad was a success that led to consumer trust of the brand to a rise from 49% to 71%. Citing data from YouGov, Pfizer saw its audience brand perception increase 19% after it aired the ad.\n\nWhile Kantar data posited that the Pfizer ad was one of the lowest-performing ads to air during Super Bowl LVIII, data from EDO indicated that Pfizer\u2019s ad ranked 97th out of the 280 Super Bowl ads that ran between 2020 to 2024 \u2014 registering 1.6x as much engagement as the median ad during that period.\n\nNotably, the ad\u2019s call to visit PfizerForAll calls attention to new features the drugmaker has added to the platform.\n\nThe DTC offering includes American Cancer Society\u2019s CancerRisk360 tool, building on the longstanding relationship between the two healthcare organizations, as well as a section with information related to atrial fibrillation.\n\nPfizerForAll, which received almost 10 million pageviews in the final four months of 2024, also has an AI-powered digital platform called Health Answers by Pfizer that debuted this week.\n\nThe innovation provides patients with personalized responses to health and wellness questions, summarized from trusted independent sources.",

Eventually, he makes it to his own house, where his family is waiting for him. Back in regular clothes, they embrace, and we see snapshots of various stages during his cancer treatment. \u201cPfizer is fighting for 8 cancer breakthroughs by 2030\u201d spans the screen, highlighting the brand\u2019s ambition.\n\n\u201cThe ad symbolizes the broader human experience of fighting cancer, representing the hope, strength, resilience, and determination that anyone facing cancer, regardless of age, can embody,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nDespite the legacy of the 175-year-plus brand, 2024 was its Super Bowl ad debut. The spot, set to Queen\u2019s classic Don\u2019t Stop Me Now, also riffs on the power of music in creative and also aimed to bring a more hopeful note to fighting the disease, which approximately 40% of Americans will develop in their lifetimes, (per Pfizer).\n\nIn June 2024, Pfizer\u2019s first global CMO, Drew Panayiotou, left the role after less than two years. Pfizer vet Susan Rienow, who\u2019s been with the firm for over two decades and led U.K. vaccines during the pandemic, succeeded Panayiotou.\n\nBeyond using LL Cool J\u2019s music, Pfizer has teamed up with the rapper and his wife, Simone Smith, to share their personal experiences with cancer and emphasize the importance of early detection. Smith was diagnosed with stage 3 chondrosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in 2004. She is now cancer-free and has been for 20 years. LL Cool J will be dropping a teaser before Super Bowl Sunday, according to the brand.\n\nThe ad was created by Publicis Groupe, specifically, agencies Le Truc, Leo NY, and Collective, Pfizer, and others. Post-production agencies include The Den Editorial, BaconX, and Harbor Picture Company.\n\nThis week, Pfizer reported full-year 2024 revenues were $63.6 billion, representing 7% year-over-year operational growth.\n\nThis article was updated to reflect that Simone Smith has been cancer-free for 20 years.",

After that, he struts through the hospital hallways to the triumphant beat of LL\u2019s iconic 1991 hit as doctors and nurses applaud.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe celebration continues on the streets, where crowds of people gather to cheer on the young champion on every step to his final destination: home, where his mom tearfully wraps him in a big hug.\n\n\u201cHey cancer,\u201d reads onscreen text at one point. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna knock you out.\u201d\n\nAfter showing photos of the little boy\u2019s difficult treatment journey, the ad then displays a call to action with more bits of text. \u201cPfizer is fighting for eight cancer breakthroughs by 2030,\u201d it reads. \u201cJoin the fight at PfizerForAll.com.\u201d\n\nThe spot is set to air during the Super Bowl broadcast during a commercial break as the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday (Feb. 9).

SpringWorks Therapeutics also has rights to four clinical-stage experimental therapies from Pfizer.\n\n\u201cSpringWorks Therapeutics will pursue the development of medicines across therapeutic areas, focused on diseases where there is an urgent need and the potential for the greatest impact for patients,\u201d said Lara S. Sullivan, M.D., MBA, Founder and President of SpringWorks Therapeutics and a former Vice President at Pfizer. \u201cWe initially have rights to four very promising experimental therapies and, over time, plan to expand our pipeline by partnering with other life science companies and academic institutions who share in our mission.\u201d\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics was originally conceived by Pfizer as an innovative way to advance investigational therapies that may hold significant promise for underserved patients. SpringWorks Therapeutics\u2019 collaborative business model is designed to deliver both social and financial returns via partnerships with a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, biopharmaceutical partners, patient groups, funders and philanthropists. Pfizer\u2019s contribution consists of both equity capital and royalty- and milestone-bearing licenses to experimental therapies.\n\n\u201cPfizer sees SpringWorks Therapeutics as a groundbreaking new model for collaboration to deliver on the promise of medical research and development, so that more people have the potential to overcome disease. We hope that our investment in SpringWorks Therapeutics will, over time, enable us to realize even more value for patients and society,\u201d said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., DFAPA, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer. \u201cSpringWorks Therapeutics started as an idea about a new way to get things done with\u2014and for\u2014patients, it\u2019s been a tremendous team effort, and we and our partners are excited to see it become a reality.\u201d\n\nPromising Pipeline with Four Clinical-Stage Experimental Therapies\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics is focused on underserved patient populations where there is great medical need. The company plans to move forward potential programs for four diseases, all of which currently have no cure. SpringWorks Therapeutics plans to expand its pipeline by partnering with other life science companies and academic institutions who share in the company\u2019s mission.\n\nDESMOID TUMOR\n\nA desmoid tumor is a rare, non-metastatic tumor of connective tissue cells, which can cause severe morbidity, pain and loss of function in children and adults. Desmoid tumors can show up in almost any part of the body, and desmoids that are faster growing or located near vital organs can cause life-threatening problems. Approximately 900-1,200 people are diagnosed with desmoid tumors each year in the U.S.1 Currently available treatments include unapproved medical therapy, radiation therapy, thermal ablation and surgery, which can be dangerous, costly and offer limited effectiveness. SpringWorks Therapeutics is planning to initiate a Phase 3 program to establish safety and efficacy of nirogacestat (PF-03084014), its gamma-secretase inhibitor, and will work collaboratively with the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation to enable the needs of the patient community to be addressed.\n\nNEUROFIBROMATOSIS\n\nNeurofibromatosis (NF) refers to three genetic disorders\u2014NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis\u2014which cause tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body and can lead to blindness, deafness, disfigurement, cancer, bone abnormalities, learning disabilities and severe pain. NF1 affects one in 3,000 individuals and usually is diagnosed in childhood when symptoms begin to appear.2MEK inhibitors have shown encouraging activity in reducing tumor size in clinical Phase 1-2 studies in patients with plexiform neurofibromatosis, one of the many manifestations of NF1. SpringWorks Therapeutics is planning to initiate a Phase 3 program to establish safety and efficacy of its MEK 1/2 inhibitor (PD-0325901) in the NF1 population and will work collaboratively with the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation to enable the needs of the patient community to be addressed.\n\nHEREDITARY XEROCYTOSIS\n\nHereditary xerocytosis (HX) is a genetic disorder in which red blood cells become dehydrated due to loss of potassium and cell water. The fragility of the dehydrated red cells can lead to a ranging severity of anemia and can cause complications including jaundice, fatigue, splenomegaly and gallstones. In some cases, it will lead to severe anemia that requires frequent blood transfusions. HX affects an estimated one in 10,000 people, and symptoms begin shortly after birth.3 There is no approved therapy for this disease. Senicapoc (PF-05416266) has demonstrated a good safety/tolerability profile in previous Phase 1-3 studies in other indications. SpringWorks Therapeutics plans to assess the potential activity of senicapoc in hereditary xerocytosis.\n\nPOST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that some people develop after experiencing traumatic or life-threatening events, serious injury or sexual violence. PTSD involves the persistent re-experiencing of the traumatic event, which results in avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, as well as negative feelings and heightened anxiety-like symptoms. PTSD is often seen in military veterans, first responders, rape and battery victims, and abused children. Around 8.6 million people in the U.S. between the ages of 18-64 have been diagnosed with the disease.4 Over 200,000 veterans in the U.S. live with PTSD, which is currently treated with antidepressants such as SSRIs and trauma-focused psychotherapy; however, the disease can result in suicide even with treatment. SpringWorks Therapeutics\u2019 FAAH inhibitor (PF-0445784) has demonstrated a good safety/tolerability profile in previous Phase 1 studies. The effectiveness of PF-0445784 in PTSD is to be determined. Cohen Veterans Bioscience (CVB) and SpringWorks Therapeutics plan to assess patient populations that could benefit from this mechanism.\n\nExperienced Leadership Team\n\nSpringWorks Therapeutics is led by a preeminent team of industry veterans, including:\n\nDaniel S. Lynch, Executive Chairman, who has over 25 years of industry experience serving in management and board positions for a number of top-tier biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nLara S.

            "content": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nPfizer on Wednesday named a longtime Novartis executive the leader of an oncology division it is leaning on to win back the support of investors in the years ahead.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant said Jeffrey Legos, who has been leading Novartis\u2019 hematology and oncology drug development since 2015, will become its new chief oncology officer. In that role, Legos will report to Chris Boshoff, who was formerly Pfizer\u2019s cancer drug chief but stepped in as head of R&D last year when Mikael Dolston retired.\n\nLegos will replace interim chief oncology officer and one-time Seagen R&D leader Roger Dansey, who joined Pfizer after it acquired Seagen in 2023 and will retire after Legos takes over.\n\nLegos has more than two decades of experience developing cancer drugs in various roles at GSK and, since 2015, Novartis. Through those positions, he\u2019s played a part in over 40 regulatory approvals of drugs and companion diagnostics, Pfizer said. At Novartis, those approvals included the radiopharmaceutical Pluvicto and the breast cancer drug Kisqali, both of which are among the company\u2019s fastest-growing medicines.\n\nAt Pfizer, Legos looks to ignite investor interest in a cancer drug portfolio the company is counting on to boost sales in the coming years. Fast-fading sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and treatment Paxlovid, as well as missteps in some recent acquisitions, have led to cost cuts, a flagging stock price and a challenge from an activist investor. Multiple top-selling drugs, including Xtandi and Eliquis, will lose patent protection this decade, too. While investors have focused their attention on Pfizer\u2019s obesity drug research, the company has insisted that its cancer drugs \u2014 many of which were acquired in a $43 billion buyout of Seagen in 2023 \u2014 can help pick up the slack.\n\nThat portfolio accounted for about a quarter of Pfizer\u2019s roughly $64 billion in revenue last year and had four medicines \u2014 led by the breast cancer drug Ibrance \u2014 that eclipsed $1 billion in sales. Pfizer has claimed its pipeline could produce eight more so-called blockbusters by 2030, both by growing sales of marketed medicines and succeeding with others in testing.\n\nOn a quarterly earnings call earlier this week, CEO Albert Bourla pointed to a pair of breast cancer drugs in late-stage testing, among them a type of protein-degrading therapy it\u2019s co-developing with biotechnology company Arvinas. One antibody-drug conjugate it inherited from Seagen is in a Phase 3 trial in lung cancer, while a second ADC aimed at a popular immunotherapy target, PD-L1, will join it this year, he said.\n\nBourla also claimed Pfizer\u2019s multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio is poised to become a \u201cmega blockbuster.\u201d The drug generated more than $130 million in sales in its first year despite only being available for a \u201cvery niche indication,\u201d Bourla said. The company has four ongoing Phase 3 studies that could help broaden use. But it\u2019s already battling for market share with a similar therapy from Johnson & Johnson, and could potentially face additional competition from Regeneron.\n\n\u201cThis product will become a very big oncology product for Pfizer,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nSales growth of Padcev, another Seagen drug, is also a key part of Pfizer\u2019s plan. Study results expected this year in a type of bladder cancer could \u201cnearly triple\u201d the number of patients eligible for treatment, he added.\n\nPadcev earned about $1.6 billion in sales for Pfizer last year.\n\nPfizer shares have lost about half their value since peaking near $60 apiece in 2021.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla has revealed that he recently dined with health secretary nominee and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 and vaccine talk was apparently not on the menu.\n\nThe $150 billion company CEO revealed the pair conversed over a meal after being introduced by President Trump, as revealed in an earnings call Tuesday, heard by Business Insider.\n\nWhile the exact date of the meeting was not disclosed, Bourla said he and the health secretary nominee chatted civilly, conversing on topics they agreed on rather than straying to more divisive topics like \u201cvaccines\u201d.\n\nRFK Jr. previously spouted the false claim that \u201cautism comes from vaccines\u201d on numerous occasions \u2013 and has staunchly denied being anti-vax ever since, particulary since being nominated to a position in Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, insisting his children are vaccinated.\n\nOther theories peddled by the former presidential candidate include that human-made chemicals in water systems could \u2018turn\u2019 children gay or transgender and that HIV does not derive from AIDS, as per CNN.\n\nBourla insisted that vaccine-related discussion was not on the cards, and instead, the pair stuck to what they agreed on: \u201cAnd those are things in chronic diseases, in cardiovascular diseases, and more importantly, in cancer, which is something that is very, very high in the mind of the president.\n\nopen image in gallery Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has revealed that he recently dined with vaccine skeptic Robert F.

The company\u2019s quarterly results showed a solid revenue performance, particularly due to strong sales of COVID-related products and Eliquis. However, these positives were offset by declines in other areas, such as the Abrysvo vaccine, due to reduced vaccination rates in the U.S. Furthermore, Pfizer\u2019s long-term growth appears uncertain due to looming patent expirations and increased competition, which contributes to a cautious outlook.\n\nAdditionally, while Pfizer\u2019s current price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield provide some support for its stock price, the company\u2019s overall growth prospects remain below average compared to its peers. The lack of significant new developments in its product pipeline, aside from the anticipated danuglipron readout, further underscores the Hold rating. The potential for mergers and acquisitions in the obesity sector was noted but not confirmed, adding an element of uncertainty to the company\u2019s future earnings trajectory.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, UBS also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $29.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

These stories showcase resilience, courage and the human spirit, reminding us of the need to continue advancing oncology care for everyone.\n\nStories of Hope and Strength Vasileia Pfizer Digital, based in Europe At 37 years old, Vasileia received a breast cancer diagnosis that turned her life upside down. With two daughters aged five and seven, even counting on the simple joy of reading them bedtime stories felt uncertain. \u201cAfter my diagnosis, I stopped reading to them\u2014not because I needed time for myself, but because I thought I was preparing them to live life without me,\" said Vasileia, who is on the Pfizer Digital team. \"Time passed, and I\u2019m still here because of the incredible people who supported me and the treatments available today. If I could go back, I\u2019d climb into bed, hug my daughters tightly, and read every story they wanted.\" Cancer taught Vasileia to treasure every moment and live life with intention. It was also the \u201cwhy\u201d behind her decision to join Pfizer in 2021.\n\nKelly Pfizer Retail Pharmacy, based in the U.S. Kelly\u2019s journey began with a persistent cough in 2022. Multiple tests revealed nothing, but Kelly advocated for herself and sought a CT scan. The results only took minutes but turned her life upside down: Kelly had stage 4 ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer. \u201cI started therapy and only eight months later I heard the news that everyone hopes to hear: I had no evidence of active disease,\u201d reflected Kelly, who works in the Retail Pharmacy team. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, but I have learned to seize the day, because anyone with lungs can get lung cancer.\u201d\n\nGuy Pfizer Global Policy & Public Affairs, based in the Middle East For Guy, the diagnosis of splenic lymphoma came with no warning signs. His experience taught him that while he couldn\u2019t control the diagnosis, he could choose how to navigate it. \u201cHow we deal with a challenge to our wellness is, to a large extent, a choice. You can\u2019t control what happens to you, only how you react,\u201d shared Guy, on Pfizer\u2019s Global Policy & Public Affairs team. \u201cMy choice was to be thankful for the early detection. The time to assess and prepare is longer. The diagnosis is more accurate. The clinical outcomes are better.\u201d Now in remission, Guy emphasizes the importance of having a strong support system: \u201cIt takes a village, and you are not alone.\u201d\n\nRenewing our Work Against Cancer\n\nAt Pfizer, nothing is more urgent, or more personal, than our goal to outdo cancer. These stories demonstrate how cancer impacts each of us differently. They also unite us in a shared ambition: a future where people with cancer live better and longer lives. This vision shapes everything we do and keeps people living with cancer at the center of our work.\n\nThis commitment goes beyond accelerating the development of life-changing medicines. It extends to supporting patients throughout their entire journey\u2014whether through programs like This Is Living With Cancer, which offers resources and support services to help individuals, and their loved ones navigate the challenges of diagnosis and treatment, or through tackling inequalities in care.\n\nWe are working to ensure that every person, no matter who they are or where they\u2019re from, has access to the support they need. This means breaking down barriers, addressing systemic inequities, and meeting people where they are to provide solutions tailored to their unique circumstances.\n\nAs we recognize World Cancer Day on February 4, we reaffirm our mission to advance the science, the care and the support systems that empower people living with cancer to thrive.

            "content": "As Pfizer beat analyst expectations for 2024 with revenue of $63.6 billion, all eyes turned to the pipeline and the pharma\u2019s obesity strategy for future growth.\n\nAnalysts have been eagerly awaiting news on Pfizer\u2019s next-gen GLP-1 weight loss candidate danuglipron, which has a dose-optimization study expected to read out in the first quarter of the year. The earnings release passed without that data, with newly minted Chief Scientific Officer Chris Boshoff declining to speculate on whether the asset could be on the chopping block if it doesn\u2019t meet expectations.\n\nBoshoff did say that actual weight loss numbers will be a secondary endpoint. The focus of this readout will be on pharmacokinetics and nailing down a once-daily dose for the oral candidate. While the data may include weight loss, Boshoff cautioned that it\u2019s a small trial and the numbers may not be reliable.\n\nWithout news still to come about that asset\u2019s potential, analysts wondered if Pfizer might be looking to some deals or partnerships to build out a more robust obesity pipeline. Andrew Baum, chief strategy and innovation officer, agreed that \u201cobesity is heterogeneous and [will] likely require a set of tools encompassing both different modalities and different delivery devices in order to manage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese assets do exist. Some are scattered. Some have portfolios,\u201d Baum said. \u201cBut you could imagine that, of course, we are looking at all the opportunities and trying to understand what delivers the most value to patients and obviously to Pfizer shareholders.\u201d\n\nAs for business development more broadly, Pfizer could also follow its peers to China for potential new assets, according to Baum. \u201cIt has not escaped our attention, of course, the innovation from China across multiple therapeutic areas.\u201d\n\nThe region previously was a leader in oncology but now that innovation has opened up. Baum said Pfizer continues to have \u201cvery fruitful discussions\u201d regarding a potential deal in China.\n\nCEO Albert Bourla said that the company will be strategic in any dealmaking. Over 2024, business development activity was restricted as planned as the company worked to absorb Seagen, which the pharma company bought in 2023 for $43 billion. CFO Dave Denton said the company will look for deals in the ballpark of $10 billion to $15 billion.\n\n\u201cEverything we do will be due for a strategic lens of building around our core competencies, or building competences in the areas that maybe we have not been in previously,\u201d Baum said of potential dealmaking.\n\nStrong Footing\n\nThe New York pharma reported the 7% increase in revenue for the full year and earnings per share of $1.41, according to a fourth quarter earnings release issued Tuesday morning. For the fourth quarter, the company saw revenue of $17.8 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase. The beat was driven by strong performance across Pfizer\u2019s commercial operations, particularly from the COVID franchise which has proven to be a \u201cpredictable and durable\u201d contributor to earnings, according to Bourla.\n\nR&D expenses increased 8% as Pfizer funneled more money into developing candidates from theSeagen acquisition. The change was offset by a decrease in spending on the vaccine program and the cost alignment program. Pfizer kicked off about a dozen clinical trials in 2024, including eight key Phase III studies, according to Bourla.\n\nPfizer also reorganized its R&D leadership last year, welcoming Boshoff in November 2024 to replace Mikael Dolsten, who led the R&D organization through the COVID-19 pandemic. Boshoff had previously served as Pfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer.\n\n\u201cThe good news with Chris is that he knew really the Pfizer organization, and I\u2019m very impressed with the speed and thoughtfulness that he\u2019s deploying his changes already,\u201d Bourla said. In his short time in the role, Boshoff has selected a number of new leaders for the R&D organization and aided in efforts to refocus the pipeline.\n\nBoshoff said that the changes have allowed for more efficient handoff of candidates between early to late-stage development. Bourla said that Pfizer has a higher success rate of molecules, hitting about 17% compared to the industry average of 10\u201311%. The company has also been faster, moving assets to the market in five to six years compared to eight for the industry average. But Pfizer could have done better actually choosing the molecules to focus the R&D organization on, according to the CEO.\n\n\u201cSo historically, when you look back, there\u2019s no shortage of first in class breakthrough molecules that we\u2019ve successfully shepherded through development,\u201d said Baum. \u201cHowever, some of those really have not delivered in terms of financial revenues and therefore to shareholders.

            "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 and reaffirmed its 2025 financial guidance(5) provided on December 17, 2024.\n\nThe fourth-quarter 2024 earnings presentation and accompanying prepared remarks from management as well as the quarterly update to Pfizer\u2019s R&D pipeline can be found at www.pfizer.com.\n\nEXECUTIVE COMMENTARY\n\nDr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201c2024 was a strong year of execution and performance for Pfizer in which we met or exceeded our strategic and financial commitments, strengthened our company and, most importantly, reached millions of patients with our medicines and vaccines. We made great progress with commercial execution and achieved growth across our product portfolio for full-year 2024, including $3.4 billion in revenue from our legacy Seagen portfolio, as well as robust growth from the Vyndaqel family, Eliquis, Xtandi, Nurtec, and several other products across all categories.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for what\u2019s ahead and confident that we will enhance shareholder value as we sharpen our focus to improve the productivity of our R&D pipeline and advance the clear strategic priorities guiding our company in 2025.\u201d\n\nDavid Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, stated: \u201cWe are pleased with the 12% operational revenue growth of Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID products in full-year 2024, demonstrating our continued focus on commercial execution. We successfully delivered on our $4 billion net cost savings target from our ongoing cost realignment program, and, as captured in our 2025 financial guidance, we have increased our overall savings target to approximately $4.5 billion by the end of this year. In addition, we remain on track to deliver $1.5 billion of net cost savings from the first phase of our Manufacturing Optimization Program by the end of 2027, with initial savings expected in the latter part of 2025. We remain confident in our ability to return to pre-pandemic operating margins in the coming years.\u201d\n\nOVERALL RESULTS\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Pfizer reclassified royalty income (substantially all of which is related to our Biopharma segment) from Other (income)/deductions\u2013\u2013net to revenues and began presenting Royalty revenues as a separate line item within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior-period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\n\nSome amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates(6).\n\nResults for fourth quarter and full year 2024 and 2023(7) are summarized below.\n\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) Fourth-Quarter Full-Year 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Revenues $ 17,763 $ 14,570 22% $ 63,627 $ 59,553 7% Reported(2) Net Income/(Loss) 410 (3,369) * 8,031 2,119 * Reported(2) Diluted EPS/(LPS) 0.07 (0.60) * 1.41 0.37 * Adjusted(3) Income 3,592 593 * 17,716 10,501 69% Adjusted(3) Diluted EPS 0.63 0.10 * 3.11 1.84 69% * Indicates calculation not meaningful or results are greater than 100%.

As of February 4, 2025, Pfizer\u2019s remaining share repurchase authorization is $3.3 billion. Current financial guidance does not anticipate any share repurchases in 2025. Pfizer expects to sufficiently de-lever its balance sheet by the end of 2025 in order to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy. This includes the flexibility to deploy capital towards potential value-creating business development transactions and the potential to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 5,703 million were used to calculate Reported(2) and Adjusted(3) diluted EPS. For the fourth quarter of 2023, basic weighted-average shares outstanding of 5,647 million were used to calculate Reported(2) LPS and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of 5,692 million were used to calculate Adjusted(3) diluted EPS.\n\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2024 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2023)\n\nFourth-quarter 2024 revenues totaled $17.8 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion, or 22%, compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting an operational increase of $3.1 billion, or 21%, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal(8) of $3.5 billion recorded in fourth-quarter 2023 and, to a lesser extent, growth contributions in fourth-quarter 2024 from the legacy Seagen portfolio, the Vyndaqel family, higher Paxlovid sales year-over-year (when excluding the $3.5 billion revenue reversal(8)), higher sales in several other products across all categories, and a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $62 million (or less than 1%); partially offset by a $2.0 billion decline in Comirnaty(1) revenues. Excluding contributions from Paxlovid and Comirnaty(1), fourth-quarter 2024 revenues totaled $13.7 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 11%, operationally compared with the prior-year quarter.\n\nFourth-quarter 2024 Comirnaty(1) revenues of $3.4 billion decreased $2.0 billion, or 38%, operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by fewer COVID-19 vaccinations globally as well as lower contracted doses.\n\nFourth-quarter 2024 Paxlovid revenues of $727 million increased $3.9 billion operationally compared with $(3.1) billion of revenues recorded in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by the transition to traditional commercial market sales in the U.S. including a one-time, non-cash revenue reversal(8) of $3.5 billion recorded in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nExcluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, fourth-quarter 2024 operational revenue growth was driven primarily by:\n\nGlobal revenues of $915 million from legacy Seagen compared with $132 million of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 following the completion of the acquisition in mid-December 2023;\n\nVyndaqel family (Vyndaqel, Vyndamax, Vynmac) globally, up 60% operationally, driven largely by strong demand with continuing uptake in patient diagnosis, primarily in the U.S. and international developed markets, as well as increased affordability in the U.S.;\n\nEliquis globally, up 13% operationally, driven primarily by continued oral anti-coagulant adoption and market share gains in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S. and certain markets in Europe, partially offset by declines due to loss of patent-based exclusivity and generic competition in certain international markets;\n\nNurtec ODT/Vydura globally, up 39% operationally, driven primarily by strong demand in the U.S. and, to a much lesser extent, recent launches in international markets, partially offset by lower net price in the U.S. due to unfavorable changes in channel mix; and\n\nXtandi, up 24% operationally, driven primarily by strong demand due to uptake of the non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) indication following approval in the fourth quarter of 2023 and increased affordability in the U.S.;\n\npartially offset primarily by lower revenues for:\n\nAbrysvo globally, down 62% operationally, driven primarily by a significant reduction in vaccination rates in the U.S. for the older adult indication as a result of a narrowing market opportunity given the current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), partially offset by improved market share for the adult indication and strong demand for the maternal indication (launched in December 2023) as well as launch uptake for both indications in certain international markets;\n\nXeljanz globally, down 29% operationally, driven primarily by lower demand globally resulting from ongoing shifts in prescribing patterns related to label changes, as well as lower net price in the U.S. and the impact of regulatory exclusivity expiry in Canada; and\n\nOncology biosimilars globally, down 35% operationally, driven primarily by supply constraints in certain products, as well as both lower demand and lower net price in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in certain international markets.\n\nGAAP Reported(2) Statement of Operations Highlights\n\nSELECTED REPORTED(2) COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\n($ in millions) Fourth-Quarter Full-Year 2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change Total Oper.

Included in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net(2) are total non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $2.9 billion that were taken in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to changes in development plans and updated long-range commercial forecasts.\n\nPfizer\u2019s effective tax rate on Reported(2) income for the fourth quarter of 2024 is primarily due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a tax benefit related to the Transition Tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nAdjusted(3) Statement of Operations Highlights\n\nSELECTED ADJUSTED(3) COSTS AND EXPENSES\n\n($ in millions) Fourth-Quarter Full-Year 2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change Total Oper.

Excluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, revenues for the full-year grew 12% operationally.\n\nThe operational revenue growth compared to the prior year was driven primarily by significantly higher global revenues for Paxlovid largely due to one-time items(8) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in 2024, the addition of legacy Seagen revenues in full-year 2024 following the acquisition in December 2023, and continued growth from the Vyndaqel family; partially offset by significantly lower revenues for Comirnaty(1).\n\nRECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS (Since October 29, 2024)\n\nProduct Developments\n\nProduct/Project Recent Development Link Braftovi (encorafenib) February 2025. Announced positive topline results from the progression-free survival (PFS) analysis of the Phase 3 BREAKWATER study of Braftovi in combination with cetuximab (marketed as Erbitux\u00ae(9)) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) harboring a BRAF V600E mutation. The trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, one of its dual primary endpoints, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Further, the Braftovi combination regimen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint in the trial. At the time of the objective response rate (ORR) analysis, the safety profile of Braftovi in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 continued to be consistent with the known safety profile of each respective agent. No new safety signals were identified. These results will be shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support potential conversion to full approval. Full Release December 2024. Announced the FDA granted accelerated approval to Braftovi in combination with cetuximab (marketed as Erbitux\u00ae(9)) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) for the treatment of patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Approval was based on a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in response rate and durability of response in treatment-na\u00efve patients treated with Braftovi in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit. Data from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial was recently presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium (ASCO GI) and were simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Full Release\n\n&\n\nFull Release Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) November 2024. Announced the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Hympavzi for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in adults and adolescents 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg with severe hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII [FVIII] deficiency, FVIII <1%) without FVIII inhibitors, or severe hemophilia B (congenital factor IX [FIX] deficiency, FIX <1%) without FIX inhibitors. Full Release Ibrance (palbociclib) December 2024. Pfizer and Alliance Foundation Trials, LLC presented results from the Phase 3 PATINA trial demonstrating that the addition of Ibrance to current standard-of-care first-line maintenance therapy (following induction chemotherapy) resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS by investigator assessment in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The safety and tolerability of Ibrance in the PATINA study was consistent with its known safety profile in HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) MBC; no new safety signals were identified. Full Release Expand\n\nPipeline Developments\n\nA comprehensive update of Pfizer\u2019s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer\u2019s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.\n\nProduct/Project Recent Development Link sasanlimab January 2025. Announced positive topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 CREST trial evaluating sasanlimab, an investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) as induction therapy with or without maintenance in patients with BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The study met its primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) by investigator assessment, demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement with sasanlimab in combination with BCG (induction and maintenance) as compared to BCG alone (induction and maintenance). The overall safety profile of sasanlimab in combination with BCG was generally consistent with the known profile of BCG and data reported from clinical trials with sasanlimab. The profile of sasanlimab was also generally consistent with the reported safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors. Full Release vepdegestrant December 2024. Arvinas, Inc. and Pfizer presented preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1b portion of the TACTIVE-U sub-study of vepdegestrant in combination with abemaciclib among patients with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer at the 2024 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Vepdegestrant in combination with abemaciclib demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor with safety and tolerability of the combination generally consistent with the profile of abemaciclib and what has been observed in other clinical trials of vepdegestrant; no significant drug-drug interactions were observed between vepdegestrant and abemaciclib. The findings support the ongoing Phase 2 portion of the study, which is evaluating full dose abemaciclib 150 mg twice daily (BID) in combination with vepdegestrant 200 mg once daily (QD) in post-CDK4/6 advanced breast cancer.

(2) Revenues is defined as revenues in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reported net income/(loss) and its components are defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and its components in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) and reported diluted loss per share (LPS) are defined as diluted EPS or LPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP. (3) Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS are defined as U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information for the fourth quarter and full-year 2024 and 2023 in the press release at the hyperlink above. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) and its components and diluted EPS/(LPS)(2). See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Pfizer\u2019s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of the press release located at the hyperlink above for a definition of each component of Adjusted income as well as other relevant information. (4) Approximately $4.5 billion of overall net cost savings from Pfizer\u2019s ongoing cost realignment program are expected to be achieved by the end of 2025. The net cost savings are calculated versus the midpoint of Pfizer\u2019s 2023 SI&A and R&D expense guidance provided on August 1, 2023. (5) Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of unusual gains and losses, certain acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses from equity securities, actuarial gains and losses from pension and postretirement plan remeasurements, potential future asset impairments and pending litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period. Financial guidance for full-year 2025 reflects the following: Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2024. An anticipated unfavorable revenue impact of approximately $0.6 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost patent or regulatory protection or that are anticipated to lose patent or regulatory protection. Exchange rates assumed are actual rates at mid-January 2025. Guidance for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 5.74 billion shares, and assumes no share repurchases in 2025. (6) References to operational variances in this press release pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer\u2019s business, they are not within Pfizer\u2019s control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, Pfizer believes presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate Pfizer\u2019s results.

Analysts believe it bodes poorly for vaccine makers. But Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said he doesn't think so, in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn fact, he said that RFK's views on vaccines are not as radical as publicly perceived.\n\nAnd he isn't the only one to have had closed-door meetings with RFK and left with the same conclusion. Bourla said that he met with Kennedy and President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago prior to Trump taking office. Trump brought up the topic of vaccines.\n\n\"Mr. Kennedy had very modest views. So, he tempered his views on vaccines, at least in our discussions, very much. If he will do things to try and undermine the capability of vaccines, I think the medical community, the payers ... will all oppose him,\" Bourla told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat has already been the case. Kennedy became a controversial Trump pick last year when he was first nominated for the position of HHS secretary, spurring opposition campaigns from doctor and science groups alike. Despite his past actions against the medical and science communities, including lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, Bourla and others who have had closed-door discussions with RFK and Trump are swayed to back him. That includes Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who voted to support RFK's nomination after several meetings, despite having concerns as a physician with 30 years' experience and a clear understanding of the value of vaccines.\n\nBut the hazards of rescinding childhood vaccine recommendations appear to be a key reason why RFK may be publicly trying to establish a more moderate tone.\n\nTrump \"doesn't want another health crisis in one of his terms,\" Bourla said.\n\nThat was evident during the confirmation hearings in both the Senate Finance as well as Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committees, where RFK claimed he would support the childhood vaccine schedule.\n\nBut he also declined numerous opportunities to declare vaccines safe and effective and denounce the claim that vaccines cause autism \u2014 despite ample evidence to the contrary. When asked by Sen. Bernie Sanders if the COVID-19 vaccine saved millions of lives, RFK said he didn't know.\n\n\"I don't know, we don't have a good surveillance system, unfortunately. I don't think anybody can say that. If you show me the science that says that...\" Kennedy replied, before being cut off by Sanders' retort that he should know the science himself, since he's applying for the job.",

            "content": "OAKLAND \u2014Attorney General Bonta today annnounced a nationwide settlement against Pfizer-owned Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company for submitting false claims to the Medicaid program and other government healthcare programs. The settlement addresses claims that Biohaven participated in a kickback scheme from 2020 to 2022, where they provided cash and extravagant gifts to healthcare providers in return for prescribing their medication, Nurtec. As part of today's settlement, Pfizer has agreed to pay, on behalf of Biohaven, a total of nearly $60 million to resolve federal and state violations, most of which resulted in losses to the federal Medicare program. The State of California will receive $413,776 for its share of losses to California\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cThe best interests of patients must always come first,\u201d said Attorney General Bonta. \u201cIt is up to us, along with our state and federal partners, to keep violations like those alleged against Biohaven in check. Today\u2019s settlement returns critical funding to our communities and programs like Medicaid that keep them healthy.\u201d\n\nPfizer has agreed to pay $59,746,277, plus interest, on behalf of Biohaven to resolve allegations that Biohaven engaged in unlawful kickback practices to encourage providers to prescribe Nurtec, a prescription medication designed for the treatment of migraine headaches, to patients who use Medicaid for insurance. That payment will be shared by the federal government and several states, including California. The claims assert that kickbacks were provided to healthcare professionals in the form of cash payments, lavish meals, and honoraria, thereby breaching the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\nThe California Department of Justice\u2019s DMFEA protects Californians by investigating and prosecuting those who defraud the Medi-Cal program as well as those who commit elder abuse. These settlements are made possible only through the coordination and collaboration of governmental agencies, as well as the critical help from whistleblowers who report incidences of abuse or Medi-Cal fraud at oag.ca.gov/dmfea/reporting.\n\nThe Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse receives 75 percent of its funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under a grant award totaling $69,244,976 for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2025. The remaining 25 percent is funded by the State of California. FY 2025 is from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n\nA copy of the settlement can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

BRAF mutations occur in about 10% of people with colorectal cancer, and the V600E is the most common among them.\n\nA regimen of Braftovi and Mektovi is already approved in skin and lung cancers. In colorectal tumors, the drug is used in advanced disease with a drug called cetuximab. Those two are prescribed alongside chemotherapy in the frontline setting under the speedy clearance issued in December.\n\nPfizer acquired Braftovi and Mektovi in an $11.4 billion buyout of Array BioPharma in 2019. At the time, the two drugs were only cleared for melanoma. Pfizer broadened use to other tumors afterward, but they still only generate modest revenue compared to other cancer drugs in the company\u2019s portfolio. The new results revealed on Monday could boost those numbers, though, as Pfizer claimed, without revealing specific details, that Braftovi helped delay tumor progression and extend the lives of colorectal cancer patients.\n\nSince the Array deal, Pfizer has shifted away from targeted small-molecule drugs for cancer and towards biologics. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as those acquired in a $43 billion deal for Seagen, are a focus and part of a plan to have biologics account for 65% of its oncology revenue by 2030 compared to only 6% in 2023.\n\nPatents for two of Pfizer\u2019s biggest sellers in cancer, Xtandi and Ibrance, expire in 2027.",

Overall survival, a key secondary outcome, was also significantly and clinically better in the Braftovi arm.\n\nIn BREAKWATER, Pfizer combined Braftovi, an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets the BRAF gene, with the EGFR blocker cetuximab and the chemotherapy regimen known as mFOLFOX-6. Comparators, meanwhile, were given chemotherapy with or without the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab. To be eligible for enrollment, colorectal cancer patients had to be treatment-naive, have metastatic disease and harbor a V600E mutation in BRAF. More than 800 participants were ultimately enrolled into the study.\n\nIn January, Pfizer revealed in a presentation at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium that Braftovi aced its other primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR). The Braftovi combo resulted in a 60.9% ORR versus 40% in control counterparts\u2014a treatment difference that was statistically significant.\n\nAccording to the company, these findings from BREAKWATER will help build its case to \u201cpotentially support full approval for Braftovi in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6\u201d in this indication.\n\nRoger Dansey, Pfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer, said that the pharma is \u201cextremely pleased\u201d with BREAKWATER\u2019s results, noting that they point to Braftovi\u2019s \u201cpotential to be practice-changing for this patient population.\u201d Aside from taking these data to health authorities, the pharma also promised to present them at an upcoming medical congress.\n\nMonday\u2019s Braftovi readout continues Pfizer\u2019s recent winning streak in cancer. Last month, the company reported that its subcutaneous PD-1 blocker sasanlimab, when given with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin immunotherapy, results in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in event-free survival in certain patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The pharma at the time noted that it plans to file a regulatory submission for sasanlimab in this indication.\n\nMeanwhile, in December 2024, Pfizer\u2019s Ibrance notched a late-stage victory when it extended PFS by over 50% in patients with first-line HR+, HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. The CDK4/6 inhibitor was being tested as a first-line maintenance treatment in combination with anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy.",

Credit: Shutterstock / NMK-Studio.\n\nPfizer\u2019s metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) combination therapy has met one of the primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival (PFS) in a Phase III trial, further supporting a full approval.\n\nThe company\u2019s active-controlled, open-label BREAKWATER trial (NCT05217446) evaluating a combination of Pfizer\u2019s Braftovi (encorafenib), Eli Lilly\u2019s Erbitux (cetuximab) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) met one of its dual primary endpoints, improving PFS.\n\nThe trial investigated the combination in mCRC patients living with a BRAF V600E mutation who are treatment-naive.\n\nThe top-line data also saw statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS). Additionally, the company has added that no new safety signals have been observed.\n\nIn December 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to the combination therapy of Braftovi, Erbitux and mFOLFOX6. Although it is waiting on full analysis of the final results, Pfizer intends to present its findings in a meeting with the FDA to support full approval.\n\nSpeaking ahead of World Cancer Day on 4 February, Pfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer Roger Dansey said: \u201cWe are extremely pleased with the clinically meaningful PFS and OS results from the BREAKWATER study, which have the potential to be practice-changing for this patient population that has historically had limited treatment options and poor outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe Braftovi regimen is emerging as a new standard of care as the first targeted therapy approved for use as early as first-line for patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation.\u201d\n\nThe multi-centre BREAKWATER trial is also the first trial to be launched under the regulatory body\u2019s Project FrontRunner, an initiative aimed at encouraging sponsors to seek approval for drugs for patients in an earlier stage of clinical treatment. This is as opposed to seeking approval for treatments designed for patients who have already undergone several therapies or treatment options.\n\nIn the BREAKWATER trial patients were randomised to receive either 300mg of Braftovi and Erbitux alone or in combination with mFOLFOX6. The active control group received mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI (Folinic acid, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan), or CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) with or without bevacizumab.\n\nA BRAF mutation is a form of cancer in which the BRAF gene begins to cause certain cells to continue dividing without ever receiving a signal to stop. The V600E variant is one of the more common forms of BRAF mutation with the name defining the location and nature of the condition. While some BRAF mutations are susceptible to different forms of targeted therapy, other BRAF mutations are not.\n\nElsewhere in the treatment of mCRC, Tizona Therapeutics has expanded its ongoing Phase Ib clinical trial of TTX-080, a novel antibody targeting human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), in patients with the condition. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson has reported a 49% overall response rate in a colorectal cancer study with RYBREVANT.",

            "content": "A Pfizer drug recently awarded accelerated FDA approval in colorectal cancer now has additional data showing it met key goals in its pivotal study, results that could support an application seeking full approval as a treatment for patients whose disease harbors a particular genetic signature.\n\nWithout releasing specific figures, Pfizer said Monday that treatment with its drug, Braftovi, led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival, one of two main goals of the study. On overall survival, a secondary goal, Pfizer said the results were also statistically significant and clinically meaningful. The pharmaceutical giant said more detailed results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.\n\nBraftovi is a small molecule inhibitor of proteins with the BRAF V600E mutation, which can lead to activation of signaling pathways that drive certain cancers, including colorectal cancer. The drug was first approved in 2018 as a treatment for advanced cases of melanoma. It has since been approved as a second-line colorectal cancer therapy and for treating advanced cases of non-small cell lung cancer. Pfizer added Braftovi to its portfolio via the 2019 acquisition of its developer, Array Biopharma, in an $11.4 billion deal. For its approved uses, the drug accounted for $437 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024, a 26% increase compared to the same period in the prior year, according to Pfizer financial reports. Colorectal cancer represents an opportunity to expand the product\u2019s reach.\n\nIn late December, Braftovi received accelerated FDA approval as a first-line treatment for colorectal cancer driven by the BRAF V600E mutation. That mutation must be detected by a companion diagnostic. The approval covers use of the Pfizer drug alongside Eli Lilly\u2019s Erbitux and the chemotherapy regimen known as FOLFOX, both of which are standard treatments for colorectal cancer. The speedy regulatory nod was based on the objective response rate, which was the other main goal of the clinical trial, named BREAKWATER. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium meeting last week, Pfizer presented trial results showing a 61% objective response rate for the Braftovi regimen compared to 40% for chemotherapy. The results were also published in Nature Medicine.\n\nAt the time of the objective response analysis, the safety profile of Braftovi in combination with standard colorectal cancer treatments continued to be consistent with the known safety profile of each respective therapy, Pfizer said. The most common adverse reactions observed in the colorectal cancer study included peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea. With the data on the study\u2019s other goals in hand, Pfizer said it plans to discuss with the FDA the potential for full approval of Braftovi in metastatic colorectal cancer. The company also plans to discuss the data with other regulatory agencies around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased with the clinically meaningful progression-free survival and overall survival results from the BREAKWATER study, which have the potential to be practice changing for this patient population that has historically had limited treatment options and poor outcomes,\u201d Roger Dansey, Pfizer\u2019s chief oncology officer, said in a prepared statement.\n\nPhoto by Getty Images",

This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO.\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nDraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish DraftKings CEO on March Madness, AI, and the future of sports gambling\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to cost \u2014 a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads\u2019 big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate \u2014 a measurement of new cases of a disease over time.\n\n\u201cThe Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,\u201d said Grover. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuper Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should\u2019ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999\u20132019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses.\n\nFor drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. \u201cThe Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,\u201d said Grover. \u201cPeople are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year\u2019s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast.\n\nPfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company\u2019s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. \u2014 \u2014 like the actual second when it aired,\u201d Grover explained. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.\u201d\n\nPfizer Big Game Commercial 2024 \u2013 Here\u2019s to Science\n\nFor this year\u2019s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments \u2014 including an off-brand version of Wegovy.\n\nNovartis (NVS) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,\u201d said Grover.",

Over time, many investors have turned to dividends as a financial cushion for uncertain periods. According to a recent report by J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, dividend stocks are typically priced lower compared to the broader market. Moreover, high-quality dividend stocks tend to be less volatile, experiencing about 80% of the market\u2019s overall fluctuations. This suggests that they offer a more stable investment option while potentially being available at a more attractive valuation.\n\nAlso read: 7 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Invest in\n\nThis trend has drawn the attention of income-focused investors, leading to an increase in dividend income as a key component of personal earnings. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividend income has grown from 2.68% in Q4 1980 to 7.88% in Q2 2024, highlighting its increasing role as a source of income. The report also pointed out that since 1936, dividends have contributed to more than a third of overall equity returns, with capital gains making up the remainder.\n\nThe dividend growth approach has proven effective for long-term investors, as these stocks have delivered solid returns over time. When adjusted for inflation, dividend growth has outpaced rising prices, reinforcing their appeal. A report by WisdomTree noted that from 1957 to 2023, dividends increased at an average annual rate of 5.7%, exceeding inflation by more than 2%. The report also highlighted that dividend reductions were rare, occurring in only six of the past 64 years, and only once dropping more than 5%. In contrast, stock prices declined in 18 of those years, with the steepest drop exceeding 40% and an average decline of over 11%. Stock prices also showed more than twice the volatility of dividend cash flows, as short-term fluctuations are often driven by market sentiment, while long-term value is supported by stable cash flows.\n\nOver the years, US companies have consistently raised or maintained their dividend payouts, reflecting investor preferences. According to J.P. Morgan\u2019s Outlook 2025 report, US profit margins remain strong, hitting all-time highs. In this decade, companies in the broader market have returned nearly 75% of their annual earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, compared to just 50% in the 2000s. While concerns about the concentration of the index in major tech firms persist, the report forecasts positive earnings growth across every sector in the broader market for 2025, a trend not seen since 2018.\n\nTech stocks, traditionally associated with growth, are increasingly becoming dividend payers in response to investor demand. Just a few years ago, the idea of major tech companies offering dividends seemed unlikely. However, the pool of potential dividend stocks is expanding, attracting significant capital that has been sitting in money market instruments to hedge against interest rate risks. Here are some remarks from Dividend Research Analyst Juan Pablo Albornoz told S&P Global Market Intelligence:\n\n\u201cProviding a dividend is a way for these profitable tech companies to prove to the market and their shareholder base that they can provide sustained regular shareholder return on a regular and predictable basis.\u201d\n\nThis approach benefits investors who can now combine investments in both growth and income-generating stocks.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener to find dividend stocks with share prices below $30 as of the close of January 30. From the initial list, we selected 12 companies with dividend yields above 4% and a history of regular dividend payments, indicating sustainable dividends. The stocks are ranked according to their share prices. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nShare Price as of the Close of January 30: $26.91\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical company that mainly manufactures, markets, and sells related products worldwide. The company gained substantial investor interest in 2020 by becoming the first to introduce a COVID-19 vaccine in the US, ahead of Moderna. In addition to its vaccine, the company offers a broad range of treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancer, migraines, and other conditions. Analysts have indicated that its growth potential may be undervalued. Pfizer has made significant investments in research and development, along with strategic acquisitions, strengthening its portfolio with key products such as the RSV vaccine Abrysvo, the migraine treatment Nurtec ODT, and cancer therapies Adcetris and Padcev.\n\nUsing profits generated during the pandemic, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) acquired Seagen for $43 billion in late 2023 to bolster its oncology pipeline. It is expected to continue pursuing acquisitions of promising pharmaceutical companies to further expand its portfolio. This strategy appears to be yielding positive results, as management forecasts earnings growth of 10% to 18% for 2025. Analysts also project the company\u2019s earnings to increase at an annual rate of around 14% over the next three to five years.\n\nIn December 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) declared a 2.4% hike in its quarterly dividend to $0.43 per share. Through this increase, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 15 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of January 30, the stock has a dividend yield of 6.42%.\n\nAs of Q3 2024, 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), down from 84 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $3 billion. With nearly 17 million shares, Two Sigma Advisors was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOverall PFE ranks 11th on our list of the best dividend stocks under $30. While we acknowledge the potential for PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine.

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other long term low risk stocks.\n\nAs the DeepSeek craze ignites a sell-off in the tech sector, investors are weighing the implications of the downturn in the long term. This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the \"Lagnificent 7\" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThere are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration. Strategies may include diversifying portfolios, focusing on undervalued sectors, and closely monitoring economic indicators to navigate the evolving landscape.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

The settlement came after the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 10 reversed a judge's decision to dismiss the case and gave Do No Harm a new shot at establishing that it had the necessary legal standing to pursue the litigation.\n\n\"While Pfizer would like to quietly sweep their unlawful discrimination under the rug, their settlement acknowledges what we said all along: racially discriminatory programs are unlawful and will not go unchallenged,\" Stanley Goldfarb, Do No Harm's chair, said in a statement.\n\nPfizer in a statement said it was pleased Do No Harm had decided to voluntarily dismiss the case, which the company said had no merit.\n\nThe New York-based company changed the program's criteria in February 2023 but continued to fight the case, and on Friday said it remained \"proud of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.\" Several other companies including Walmart and McDonald's have recently backed away from diversity practices following pressure from conservative activists. An executive order signed by Republican President Donald Trump following his return to office sought to eradicate workforce DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) initiatives in the federal government and the private sector.\n\nVirginia-based Do No Harm is a non-profit organization that has said it counts doctors, medical students and others as members and aims \"to protect healthcare from radical, divisive and discriminatory ideologies.\" Goldfarb is white.\n\nThe group sued Pfizer over the company's Breakthrough Fellowship Program, which the company launched in 2021, arguing the program discriminated against white and Asian-American applicants in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. The lawsuit was filed a month before the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in cases in which its 6-3 conservative majority would later in June 2023 declare unlawful race-conscious student admissions policies used by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.",

            "content": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV , is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can cause severe illness, particularly in infants and older adults. You can protect against severe RSV with immunization. CDC, working with FDA and other federal agencies, monitors RSV immunizations using several safety systems .\n\nCDC recommends that all people ages 75 years and older and people ages 60 to 74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease receive a single dose of RSV vaccine . 1\n\nFDA has approved three vaccines to protect older adults against severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV.\n\nRSV immunizations may be given at the same time as other routine immunizations for older adults, pregnant women, young children, and infants to protect against severe RSV.\n\nSevere allergic reactions following vaccination are rare but can be life threatening. If someone has symptoms of a severe allergic reaction \u2014 which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness \u2014 call 911 immediately.\n\nVaccines and monoclonal antibody products, like any medical product, can have side effects. Most common side effects reported after RSV immunization are usually mild or moderate.\n\nA closer look at the safety data\n\nFact Both clinical trial and post-licensure (after FDA approval) data have shown RSV immunizations protect people at increased risk for severe RSV disease when used according to the approved guidelines and recommendations. CDC and FDA continue to monitor the safety of RSV immunizations and will share findings with the public as they become available.234156789\n\nFor older adults\n\nClinical trial safety data\n\nIn clinical trials assessing the safety of RSV vaccines in adults ages 60 years and older, the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo (control, or unvaccinated) group.\n\nAmong adults ages 60 years and older receiving GSK (Arexvy) and Pfizer (Abrysvo) RSV vaccines, a small number of people developed serious neurologic conditions (conditions related to the brain, spinal cord and nerves throughout the body), such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), within 42 days after vaccination. Given the small number, it was unclear if the vaccines caused these events or if they occurred due to chance.\n\nIn clinical trials among adults ages 60 years and older receiving the Moderna RSV vaccine (mResvia), there were no reported cases of GBS within 42 days after vaccination.5\n\nPost-licensure safety data\n\nFact Based on available data, ACIP and CDC continue to conclude that the benefits of RSV vaccination, by reducing RSV-associated hospitalizations and deaths, outweigh the potential risk for GBS among adults 75 and older and among adults 60 to 74 years old at increased risk of severe RSV disease.\n\nDuring the October 2024 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting, FDA presented updated post-licensure safety monitoring data on GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccines from a partnership between FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nData included a large study population and focused on confirmed GBS cases identified in medical claims data and verified following medical record review. Results suggested an increased risk of GBS after RSV vaccination with both GSK and Pfizer RSV vaccines. Results showed that the GSK RSV vaccine had a statistically significant association with GBS, while the Pfizer RSV vaccine had a similar, but not statistically significant, association. In the analysis, fewer doses of Pfizer RSV vaccine were administered compared to GSK RSV vaccine. For both vaccines, FDA estimated the risk of GBS to be on the order of 10 excess cases per 1 million vaccinated adults 60 or older.6\n\nThese findings have limitations. Many factors may affect the results, including potential misclassification of GBS cases in the analysis. Additional analyses on the risk of GBS after RSV vaccination are underway, and findings will be shared as data become available16.\n\nFDA licensed the Moderna RSV vaccine (mResvia) in May 2024. Because of its recent introduction, post-licensure safety data are not yet available for this vaccine, which is currently being monitored in V-safe and VAERS.\n\nCDC and FDA continue to monitor and communicate about the safety of older adult RSV vaccination to ensure the benefits of vaccination outweigh possible risks, including GBS.\n\nFor infants and young children\n\nClinical trial safety data\n\nNo safety concerns were observed during the clinical trials for infants and young children who received the nirsevimab passive immunization. The occurrence of SAEs was not elevated in infants receiving nirsevimab compared with those receiving placebo.3\n\nPost-licensure safety data\n\nIn February 2024, FDA updated the nirsevimab package insert to share that cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, fast breathing) have been reported post-licensure.\n\nAs of the October 2024 ACIP meeting, no new safety information that would affect the overall benefit or risk of nirsevimab has been identified.\n\nFor pregnant women\n\nClinical trial safety data\n\nIn clinical trials assessing the safety of Pfizer RSV vaccine (Abrysvo) in pregnant women at 24 through 36 weeks' gestation, SAEs in pregnant women and infants were balanced between the vaccinated and placebo groups.\n\nClinical trials identified an increase in the number of preterm births (births occurring before the infant has fully developed in the mother's womb) among pregnant women who received the vaccine. Though this was not a statistically significant increase, FDA approved Pfizer RSV vaccine for pregnant women at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation to avoid the potential risk for preterm birth at less than 32 weeks' gestation.\n\nA non-statistically significant increase in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was also observed during 24 through 36 weeks' gestation. It is not clear if this is a true safety problem related to RSV vaccination or if this occurred for reasons unrelated to vaccination.2\n\nPost-licensure safety data\n\nFact The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) judged the benefits of maternal Pfizer RSV (Abrysvo) vaccination at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation to outweigh potential risks.4\n\nPost-licensure safety data from VAERS, V-safe, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) for the first season of use of Pfizer RSV vaccine for pregnant women are consistent with clinical trial safety data.\n\nPreliminary findings from a VSD study for the first season of use of Pfizer RSV vaccine for pregnant women found that RSV vaccination during 32 through 36 weeks\u2019 gestation was not associated with an increased risk of preterm birth or babies being born small for their gestational age (SGA).9\n\nAdditional studies are being conducted to look more closely at the potential risk for high blood pressure issues in mothers, including pre-eclampsia, and preterm birth. 2479\n\nCDC and FDA continue to monitor and communicate about the safety of maternal RSV vaccination to ensure the benefits of vaccination outweigh possible risks.",

Thanks to new year\u2019s resolutions, many of us feel overwhelmed with suggestions for self-improvement, and while they may not all last, taking care of yourself should always be a top priority.\n\nNew Year, new you, and we\u2019re here to help remind you of some aspects of your health that you may be overlooking. Like your thyroid, which is something you may have heard about, but may not know much about. You\u2019re in luck, because January is Thyroid Awareness Month, and Pfizer is here to, well, make you more aware of it.\n\nThe thyroid is a gland, shaped like a butterfly, that wraps around the windpipe in your neck and the health of a thyroid can mean the difference between a strong heart and a weak heart, between energy and fatigue. The thyroid affects everything from digestion to breathing to energy levels, fairly significant activities, and while your thyroid may not be something you think about all the time, keeping it healthy is key to helping keep yourself healthy.\n\nWhen the thyroid is healthy, it produces the right amount of hormones to properly regulate body processes. When it produces too many or too few hormones, however, then those processes can tilt off balance and cause side effects or disorders.1\n\nMany thyroid disorders are caused by things beyond our control, including autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease) or family history. Pregnancy can also create or exacerbate thyroid problems. In some cases, however, thyroid disorders are caused by lifestyle factors within our control.\n\nHere are two important steps you can take to help maintain good thyroid health \u2013 and they just may sync up with your new year\u2019s resolutions!\n\nEat a healthy diet: Eating a nutritious, balanced diet can help your thyroid function well. This should include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and it should limit sugars, processed foods, and starches. This diet includes plenty of dietary fiber, which aids digestion and minimizes saturated fats, which contribute to heart disease. Be careful not to consume too much iodine\u2014either through supplements or through very iodine-rich foods, such as seaweed or kelp2\u2014which can contribute to thyroid disorders.3\n\nGet regular exercise: Physical activity can support healthy metabolism and immune function, which support healthy thyroid levels.4 People with a thyroid disorder should check with a doctor before beginning an exercise regimen. For example, people with hyperthyroidism who have an elevated heart rate and body temperature may need medical guidance before a sudden return to exercise.5\n\nLearn more about conditions that may be affected by thyroid dysfunction:\n\n[1] National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.

These are company-sponsored events where a health care provider makes a speech or presentation to other providers about a drug on behalf of the company. Biohaven developed, distributed, marketed, and sold the drug Nurtec ODT, a quick-dissolve tablet used to treat and prevent migraines.\n\nBiohaven allegedly selected health care providers to participate as speakers with the intent to induce those providers to prescribe Nurtec. These selected speakers received remuneration in the form of speaker honoraria and expensive meals at high end restaurants. The government also alleged that certain attendees attended multiple speaker programs on the same topics, and that individuals, such as a speaker\u2019s spouse, family, or friends, attended these speaker programs. In all, the government alleged that these speaker programs had limited educational value and only served to improperly promote the use of Nurtec.\n\nThe government investigation initiated because of whistleblower allegations made by a former sales representative, Patricia Frattasio. Under the qui tam provisions of the FCA, whistleblowers can initiate actions on of behalf of the United States and receive a portion of the recovery.\n\nPfizer\u2019s settlement demonstrates the importance of mergers and acquisitions diligence in the health care industry. Notably, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Biohaven in October 2022 and promptly terminated the speaker programs. Such remedial action may factor into resolving the government\u2019s investigation with favorable terms.\n\nThe US Department of Justice\u2019s press release is available here.\n\nSackler Family Agrees to End Control of Purdue Pharma and to Pay $7.4 Billion for Role in Opioid Epidemic\n\nA bipartisan coalition of 15 states announced a $7.4 billion settlement in principle with the Sackler family and their company, Purdue Pharma Inc.\n\nAccording to the Office of the New York State Attorney General (NY AG), as part of the settlement, the Sacklers agreed to end their control of the company and their ability to sell opioids in the United States. Purdue invented, manufactured, and aggressively marketed opioid products, which the NY AG states contributed to the increase in addiction and overdose deaths across the United States.\n\nThe Sackler family will pay $6.5 billion of the settlement over the course of 15 years, including $1.5 billion upon approval of the settlement. Purdue Pharma will be responsible for paying $900 million of the settlement. The funds will go directly to communities across the country to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs.\n\nNew York, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Connecticut, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia led negotiations with the Sackler family. This coalition will seek approval from the remaining states and municipalities that have sued the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma before seeking approval from the bankruptcy and state courts overseeing this suit.\n\nThe NY AG\u2019s press release is available here.\n\nFourth Circuit Affirms Broad Interpretation of AKS in Co-Pay Assistance Case\n\nOn January 23, the Fourth Circuit ruled against Pharmaceutical Coalition for Patient Access (PCPA), a charity backed by pharmaceutical manufacturers, when it affirmed an advisory opinion from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The advisory opinion, AO 22-19, opined that PCPA\u2019s proposed program that would help Medicare Part D patients cover the costs of co-pays for cancer drugs would constitute a quid pro quo and violate the AKS.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit held that PCPA\u2019s proposed program would meet the statutory meaning of \u201cinducement\u201d and \u201cremuneration\u201d under the AKS. PCPA argued that because it acted as a charity, it provided a societal good and could not \u201cinduce\u201d unlawful behavior because the AKS does not criminalize positive behavior. PCPA also argued that it did not pay any \u201cremuneration\u201d under the AKS by paying drug co-pays because those payments were not for a corrupt purpose. The Fourth Circuit disagreed, finding that its proposed program to offer subsidies to support the purchase of federally reimbursable health care goods would influence patients towards purchasing the drugs of the companies that backed PCPA.\n\nPCPA also argued that there would be no quid pro quo under its charitable program because it would act as the intermediary between the patients utilizing the assistance program and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. In other words, PCPA\u2019s copay assistance program would not affect the medical decision-making and counsel between prescriber and patient because it was \u201cagnostic\u201d about the choice of drug and would help any needy patient. But the Fourth Circuit stated that the payments \u2014 the pharmaceuticals\u2019 contributions to PCPA \u2014 did not need to be tied to specific official acts if the payments were made with the intent to secure a specific type of specific act, i.e., a patient being able to fill his prescription for their drug.\n\nIn all, the decision does not disturb HHS-OIG\u2019s stance that chartable organization\u2019s subsidies for copays for government health care recipients could constitute a violation of the AKS and FCA.\n\nThe appeal is Pharmaceutical Coalition for Patient Access v. United States of America, et al., Case Number 24-1230, (4th Cir. Jan. 23, 2025).\n\nNorth Carolina Drug Testing Lab Settles FCA Allegations for $850,000\n\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Labs and its owner, Paul Fribush, agreed to pay $850,000 to resolve allegations it violated the FCA by billing for medically unnecessary urine drug screening tests.\n\nAccording to the government, from January 2018 to January 2022, Substance Abuse Treatment Labs submitted false claims for the highest level of urine drug testing to North Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program. According to Acting US Attorney for the Middle District of Carolina Randall Galyon, the lab submitted the allegedly false claims \u201cdespite clear signs that the tests were not medically necessary.\u201d\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of North Carolina\u2019s press release is available here.\n\nFormer New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez Sentenced to 11 Years in Prison\n\nOn January 29, US District Court Judge Sidney Stein of the Southern District of New York sentenced former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez to 11 years in prison. Judge Stein further ordered that Sen. Menendez forfeit all proceeds of his crime but did not impose a fine.\n\nLast summer, after a nine-week-long trial, a jury found Sen. Menendez guilty on all 16 counts he faced, including extortion, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, acting as a foreign agent, honest services fraud, and bribery, among others. Sen. Menendez is the first US Senator to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent.\n\nAt trial, the government presented evidence that Sen. Menendez accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes (including in the form of gold bars and cash) in exchange for pressuring a US Department of Agriculture senior official, benefitting the government of Egypt and government of Qatar, and interfering in a federal criminal prosecution brought by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey, among other things.\n\nJudge Stein remarked that the evidence at trial was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and deemed Sen. Menendez to be a \u201ccorrupt politician.\u201d He speculated as to what led Sen. Menendez to engage in such conduct \u2014 suggesting greed and hubris \u2014 and ultimately found \u201cthe public cannot be led to the belief that [Menendez] can get away with bribery, fraud and betrayal.\u201d\n\nSen. Menendez, who use to chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resigned from Congress in August after the guilty verdict. He has maintained his innocence and called the case a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d after his sentencing. He plans to appeal his conviction to the Second Circuit and his counsel requested he remain out on bond pending appeal, which Judge Stein granted.\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York\u2019s press release is available here.",

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned +1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of +380% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.96 points to a change of +60.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.93 indicates a change of -0.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

Cash, expensive meals and drinks were paid for in exchange for providers prescribing Biohaven's product Nurtec for Medicaid and other federal healthcare beneficiaries. The drug is used to treat migraine headaches.\n\nThe investigation found that Biohaven paid the kickbacks to providers as compensation for presenting at speaking events with the goal of getting doctors to prescribe the drug. Biohaven paid some providers tens of thousands of dollars, and sometimes more than $100,000, Weiser said. People with no reason to attend the events, like speaker's family members, also benefited from the kickbacks.\n\nA whistleblower Patricia Frattasio \u2014 a former employee of Biohaven \u2014 tipped off investigators.

These grants included support for ACS\u2019s Hope Lodges, which offer patients and caregivers a free place to stay while undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nPfizer has served as a long-time member and sponsor of several ACS Roundtables, including the Breast, Cervical, Lung and Prostate Cancer Roundtables. ACS Roundtables are national coalitions of organizations dedicated to a shared vision of giving all people a fair and just opportunity to prevent and survive cancer.\n\nPfizer has supported ACS\u2019s initiative focused on raising awareness of and increasing access to biomarker testing in the United States.\n\nPfizer was a founding sponsor of the ACS Get Screened program, which worked to increase cancer screening rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, and our executive leadership served on ACS\u2019s National Screening Consortium.\n\n\u201cWith 1 in 3 people facing a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, it is critical that we continue to work to ensure more equitable access to screenings, timely diagnosis and care \u2013 particularly in communities that are disproportionately impacted by cancer, but continue to be underserved,\u201d said Angela Riemer, Vice President, VP & Head, US Business Policy & Public Affairs, Pfizer. \u201cOur work with American Cancer Society is critical to advancing our shared mission and is making a real impact in these communities, and we look forward to many more years of collaboration.\u201d",

He highlighted that, despite two months of processing the election results, there\u2019s still a lack of clarity about what the priorities will be and what Congress might actually pass. Cramer also brought up several important questions about President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on various issues.\n\n\u201cIs president-elect Trump serious about large widespread tariffs or is the tough talk just a negotiating tactic? How serious is Trump about mass deportations? Which, if enacted, would likely have an impact on\u2026 the labor market.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 12 Stocks Amidst The DeepSeek AI Selloff and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently\n\nAnother major question Cramer raised was about deregulation, how much benefit will companies truly see from it, and how quickly? In terms of corporate taxes, Cramer also noted that the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act seems likely, but he questioned whether Trump might push even further, potentially altering the tax landscape in a more significant way. Perhaps one of the most pressing questions Cramer raised concerned the bond market and its tolerance for large U.S. government budget deficits.\n\n\u201cAnd considering that last question, here's a doozy: Will the bond market continue to tolerate big budget deficits from the US government?\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that some argue the bond market has already begun to take a more stringent stance on national debt, evident in the rising treasury yields over recent months. Still, Cramer left it at that, suggesting the situation remains uncertain.\n\n\u201cDifficult to answer because as we learned last time, I mean, Donald Trump is not a predictable president, great for cable news ratings, but sometimes frustrating when you're in the business of making predictions. Hmm, maybe a higher cash position than normal could beckon.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on January 7 and 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.",

A former student gifted $50 million to Northfield Mount Hermon, a prep school in Massachusetts, school officials announced last Thursday. Northfield Mount Hermon\n\nIn the fall of 1951, a football game changed John Mitchell\u2019s life forever.\n\nMitchell \u2014 a 13-year-old, 5-foot-three, 117-pound freshman \u2014 was the manager of the football team at Mount Hermon School for Boys in Northfield, Massachusetts.\n\nAs manager, Mitchell\u2019s job was to make sure that all the equipment the team needed for its first away game of the season at Choate was loaded onto the team\u2019s bus.\n\nBut upon arrival at the game, as Mitchell unpacked and set up the equipment, he realized that he forgot all of the footballs.\n\nThe coach, Axel B. Forsland \u2014 who students called \u201cThe Axe\u201d due to his notoriously intimidating nature \u2014 demanded that Mitchell borrow some balls from the opposing team.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMitchell managed to transport seven balls in a single trip, giving them to his team\u2019s players for warmups. Mount Hermon won the game against Choate that day.\n\nDecades later, Mitchell became the President of Pfizer Global Manufacturing, where he oversaw operations for Pfizer\u2019s healthcare products.\n\n\u201cI learned more from my mistakes, that day and after, than I ever learned in any classroom at Mount Hermon or Yale or NYU Business School,\u201d Mitchell reportedly told his friend. \u201cPlan thoroughly, review your plans before implementing them, refine them, consult with others and then stick to the plans, following up to assure that all is Right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMitchell, 83, died on Sept. 3, 2022.\n\nLast Thursday, Mitchell\u2019s former school, now called Northfield Mount Hermon, announced a $50 million bequest from the devoted alum.\n\nThe largest gift in the school\u2019s history will go toward student scholarships and support for faculty and staff, Head of School Brian Hargrove told Boston.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly humbling when you think about somebody\u2019s devotion to a school and their willingness to consider how they can really change the arc of a place through their philanthropy and service,\u201d Hargrove said.\n\nThe school, initially founded in 1879 as two institutions, aimed to provide schooling to young people who had limited financial resources to access an education. Mount Hermon\u2019s first graduating class included a formerly enslaved student and international students from China, Sweden, England, Ireland, Canada, and Japan.\n\nJohn Mitchell. Northfield Mount Hermon\n\nLiving in an unheated house on Cape Cod, Mitchell was granted a scholarship to attend Mount Hermon School for Boys, where he became the valedictorian of his class, his obituary says. In lieu of flowers, the obituary asked for donations to Mount Hermon in his memory.\n\nToday, about 40% of the student body receives aid money, according to the school, and over the past five years, Hargrove said Mount Hermon has increased financial aid by almost 50%.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDespite Mitchell\u2019s donations and work serving on the school\u2019s Board of Trustees, at his request, no building bears his name. Hargrove described Mitchell as an \u201cexacting person\u201d when reflecting on his work supporting the school.\n\n\u201cHe was a very precise person, he was very generous,\u201d Hargrove said. \u201cHe could also be really particular in terms of the ways that we delivered our mission.\u201d\n\nDarik Velez, a science teacher at Mount Hermon, said the gift serves as a reminder of the impact that the school has on its students.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s someone at the end of their life, appreciating this portion of it and remembering it and saying that left a mark,\u201d Velez, who has taught at Mount Hermon for four years, told Boston.com. \u201cEvery day, I hope that my students are getting the most important elements from their time here, from their time in my classroom.\u201d\n\nVelez, who lives in an on campus dorm with his family, also works as a coach for the girls\u2019 volleyball team.\n\n\u201cThe idea that [John Mitchell] would be talking to friends\u2026about his football coach, about his time here,\u201d Velez said. \u201cThat gives me hope.\u201d\n\nLindsay Shachnow Lindsay Shachnow covers general assignment news for Boston.com, reporting on breaking news, crime, and politics across New England.",

( PFE ), founded in 1849 and headquartered in New York City, is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies dedicated to developing and delivering innovative medicines and vaccines. With a market cap of $151.6 billion , Pfizer serves millions of patients globally, addressing a wide range of therapeutic areas and advancing healthcare through cutting-edge research and development.\n\nShares of Pfizer have significantly underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. PFE stock has dropped 3.1% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 22.6% . In 2025, shares of PFE gained marginally, compared to SPX's 2.7% gain on a YTD basis.\n\nZooming in, PFE has also lagged behind the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF\u2019s ( XPH ) 7.9% returns over the past 52 weeks and a 6.7% YTD gain.\n\nPfizer is underperforming the broader index and its peers due to declining COVID-19 product sales, pricing pressures, and increased competition in key markets. Additionally, concerns over patent expirations, regulatory uncertainties, and slower-than-expected growth in new drug launches have weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Pfizer's stock declined 1.4% following its Q3 earnings report. The company posted an adjusted EPS of $1.06, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.78. Revenue surged 31% year over year to $17.7 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $15.19 billion. Additionally, Pfizer raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $61.0 to $64.0 billion and increased its adjusted diluted EPS forecast to a range of $2.75 to $2.95.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, which ended in December, analysts expect PFE's EPS to grow 59.8% year-over-year to $2.94. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in all of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 24 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 11 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, 12 \u201cHolds,\u201d and one \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d\n\nThe configuration has been almost stable over the past months.\n\nOn Jan. 28, Citigroup Inc ( C ) analyst Geoff Meacham reduced Pfizer's price target from $30 to $29 while maintaining a \u201c Neutral \u201d rating on the stock.\n\nThe mean price target of $31.29 represents a premium of just 17.5% to PFE's current levels. The Street-high price target of $45 implies a potential upside of 69% from the current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "Here at Pfizer, we have a long history of innovation. Over our 176 years (and counting), our doctors and scientists have been at the forefront of some of the most impactful developments in the healthcare field. We aren\u2019t leaving the business of making breakthroughs for our patients anytime soon, but we know that no one is better equipped to manage their own healthcare than our patients themselves.\n\nSo, as we make our way into 2025, we want to make sure you\u2019re doing what you can to ensure a healthy, and happy new year. We hope that you make 2025 the year that you embrace a proactive approach to health, and to help you get started, we've put together a quick list of simple steps you can take to prioritize your health in 2025 \u2013 and beyond.\n\nBy prioritizing your health with these five steps, you can feel better, help prevent disease, and identify conditions early, when they can be most effectively treated.\n\n1. Get a medical checkup.\n\nGetting a regular health checkup with your primary care provider can keep you aware of emerging health conditions and educate you with information you need to stay well. Routine health checks have been shown to recognize chronic diseases early, allowing for more timely and effective treatment.1 Talk with your healthcare provider about which exams and screenings are right for you this year.\n\n2. Make sure you\u2019re current on vaccines.\n\nAre you up to date on your vaccines? At the least, all adults should be current on their flu vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, and Tdap (tetanus, diptheria, and whooping cough) or Td (tetanus, diptheria) vaccine2. Some adults may need additional vaccines, due to age, pregnancy, health conditions, or travel plans. Talk with your healthcare provider about which vaccines you\u2019re due to receive.\n\n3. Protect your mental health.\n\nIf you\u2019re at risk for a mental health disorder, ask your primary care provider for a screening. They may refer you to a mental health provider, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or counselor, for care or additional tests. There are many effective treatments, and a screening is the first step to connect you to the care needed to begin healing.\n\nCaregivers should pay special attention to their mental health, through self-care and, if needed, mental healthcare. While their focus is often on someone else, caregivers are prone to chronic stress and depression. This affects a large group of people, as one in five adults in the U.S. cares for a relative or friend with a chronic health condition or disability.3\n\n4. Get cancer screenings when they\u2019re recommended.\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman over 40, it\u2019s probably time for a mammogram. Have you celebrated your 45th birthday? Get ready for a colonoscopy. Are you \u2014 or were you \u2014 a long-time smoker? Consider a lung cancer screening.4\n\nTalk with your doctor about which cancer screenings you may need this year; any risk factors you have may affect the standard recommendations. Detecting cancer early will give you the best chance at an effective treatment, or maybe even a cure.\n\n5. Embrace a healthy lifestyle.\n\nSome of the most effective preventive medicine happens at home.

            "content": "Photo: Willie B Thomas/Getty Images\n\nPfizer, on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company, has agreed to pay close to $60 million to resolve kickback allegations involving payment to providers.\n\nPrior to Pfizer's acquisition of the company, Biohaven knowingly caused the submission of false claims to Medicare and other federal healthcare programs by paying providers to induce them to write prescriptions of Biohaven's drug Nurtec ODT, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nNurtec ODT is used to treat and prevent migraines in adults.\n\nThe claims resolved are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability, the DOJ said.\n\nThe DOJ contends the alleged payment to providers persisted until October 2022, when Pfizer acquired Biohaven.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nThe allegations were brought by whistleblower Patricia Frattasio, a former Biohaven sales representative, who will receive approximately $8.4 million as her share of the $59,746,277 federal recovery of the case, according to the DOJ.\n\nApproximately $50.2 million of the settlement is the federal portion of the recovery, and about $9.5 million constitutes a recovery for state Medicaid programs.\n\nThe settlement announced Friday resolves allegations that from March 1, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2022, Biohaven paid improper remuneration, including in the form of speaker honoraria and meals at high-end restaurants, to healthcare professionals in order to induce them to prescribe the migraine medication Nurtec ODT in violation of the anti-kickback statute.\n\nThe United States alleged that Biohaven selected certain healthcare providers to be part of the Nurtec speaker bureau and provided them paid speaking opportunities with the intent that the speaker honoraria and meals would induce them to prescribe the drug, the DOJ said.\n\nThe DOJ further alleged that certain prescribers who attended multiple programs on the same topic received no educational benefit from attending repeat programs, and that certain Biohaven speaker programs were attended by individuals with no educational need to attend, such as the speakers' spouses, family members, or friends or colleagues from the speakers' own medical practice.\n\nThe United States contends that the conduct persisted until October 2022, when Pfizer bought Biohaven and terminated the Nurtec speaker programs.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nThe anti\u2011kickback statute prohibits offering or paying anything of value to induce the referral of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and other federal healthcare programs. The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers' judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.\n\nThe resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department's Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York.\n\nON THE RECORD\n\n\"Patients deserve to know that their doctor is prescribing medications based on their doctor's medical judgment, and not as a result of financial incentives from pharmaceutical companies,\" said U.S. Attorney Trini E. Ross for the Western District of New York. \"This settlement reflects our commitment to hold those who violate the laws accountable, regardless of their status or prestige.\"\n\nEmail the writer: SMorse@himss.org",

The debt is being secured by the fee interest in the building.\n\nNorthwind\u2019s most recent debt fund originated the loan, which was arranged on the borrower\u2019s behalf by a Newmark team including Adam Spies and Jordan Roeschlaub.\n\nThis is the second time Northwind provided debt for the project; over the summer, the firm provided $75 million to the same joint venture at 219 East 42nd Street, which is part of the firms\u2019 development plans.\n\nAlmost a year ago, Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft reached a deal to convert the former Pfizer headquarters into approximately 1,500 rental units, which would represent the largest office-to-resi conversion in New York City.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nBerman agreed to buy a minority stake in the buildings from David Werner, who had bought the interests in the property five years earlier when Pfizer relocated to Tishman Speyer\u2019s Spiral.\n\nWerner owns the leasehold on the larger of the two buildings, the 33-story 235 East 42nd Street, after buying it for $407 million.

Beyond East 42nd Street, the developer is working on a 1,300-unit conversion at 25 Water Street in the Financial District, one of the city\u2019s biggest office-to-resi conversions in the works.\n\nNorthwind is carving out its own lane in the conversion space.

(NYSE: PFE) will present the latest results from its leading genitourinary (GU) portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary (ASCO GU) Cancers Symposium taking place February 13-15 in San Francisco, California. Data from more than 20 company-sponsored, investigator-sponsored, and collaborative research abstracts, including five oral presentations, highlight advancements in developing new standards of care within prostate and bladder cancer across the company\u2019s core scientific modalities, including small molecules and antibody-drug conjugates.\n\n\u201cOur long-standing commitment to the genitourinary cancer community has been foundational in our mission to transform the treatment landscapes for patients with bladder and prostate cancers,\u201d said Karin Tollefson, Chief Oncology Medical Officer, Pfizer. \u201cOur strong presence at this year\u2019s ASCO GU highlights the longer-term impacts of our approved leading medicines for patients in their respective indications. We are also looking forward to sharing updates from our rapidly growing pipeline of novel targets and combination approaches, which have the potential to help address the diverse needs of patients across various stages of disease.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s GU portfolio includes seven approved medicines across bladder, prostate, and kidney cancers, as well as a growing late-stage pipeline of scientific modalities and combination approaches. Key Pfizer presentations at ASCO GU include the detailed overall survival (OS) results from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial with TALZENNA\u00ae (talazoparib) plus XTANDI\u00ae (enzalutamide) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which will be featured in ASCO GU\u2019s official Press Program. In addition, updated analysis from the Phase 3 global EV-302 study of PADCEV\u00ae (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) in combination with pembrolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) will be presented, highlighting the long-term efficacy benefits of the combination.\n\nFrom the pipeline, the first randomized progression-free survival (PFS) data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study for mevrometostat plus XTANDI reinforce the potential of this investigational combination for patients with mCRPC. Additional pipeline presentations include updated data and real-world evidence for different types of bladder cancer, supporting the development of two potential transformative treatments, disitamab vedotin, an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), and sasanlimab, an investigational subcutaneous PD-1 blocker.\n\nKey ASCO GU Presentations\n\nProstate Cancer\n\nTALZENNA plus XTANDI: Oral and poster presentations from the pivotal Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial of TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI will provide detailed results on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS in all-comers (cohort 1) as well as in those patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (cohort 2), compared to XTANDI alone. TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI has been approved for use in over 35 countries globally for patients with certain types of mCRPC*. The OS results will be shared with global health authorities to potentially update the TALZENNA label.\n\nOral and poster presentations from the pivotal Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 trial of TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI will provide detailed results on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS in all-comers (cohort 1) as well as in those patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (cohort 2), compared to XTANDI alone.

XTANDI: Six abstracts continue to underscore the benefit of XTANDI across its approved indications, including two posters highlighting follow-up analysis from the EMBARK trial of XTANDI in combination with leuprolide in patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high-risk for metastasis.\n\nSix abstracts continue to underscore the benefit of XTANDI across its approved indications, including two posters highlighting follow-up analysis from the EMBARK trial of XTANDI in combination with leuprolide in patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high-risk for metastasis. Mevrometostat: The first randomized PFS results from the ongoing Phase 1 dose-expansion study examine the potential of mevrometostat (PF-06821497), an investigational selective inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), in combination with XTANDI in patients with mCRPC, compared to XTANDI alone.

            "content": "Activist investor Starboard Value held off on nominating a director to Pfizer\u2019s board, missing its Jan. 25 deadline, according to reporting from Bloomberg on Monday, which cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe pharma is expected to convene its shareholders in April, when they will vote on nominated directors for the company. BioSpace has reached out for Pfizer for comment and will update this space as needed.\n\nDespite missing its deadline for this year\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Starboard will still be able to continue its challenge to Pfizer through nominations for 2026 if it is unable to reach an arrangement with the pharma, Bloomberg noted.\n\nMonday\u2019s news is the latest development in the ongoing tussle between Pfizer and Starboard. In October 2024, the activist investor carved out a $1 billion stake in the pharma, noting at the time that it had lost faith in the company\u2019s current leadership, especially CEO Albert Bourla, who the firm said has forgone the company\u2019s usual disciplined spending patterns.\n\nInitially, Starboard had gotten former Pfizer executives\u2014ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D\u2019Amelio\u2014onboard, though both walked back their involvement, announcing just days later that they were no longer involved in Starboard\u2019s campaign.\n\nIn a presentation in October 2024, Starboard outlined its problems with Pfizer, stating that while the company was able to generate big value for its shareholders during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has largely failed to capitalize on this market leverage.\n\nIn particular, Pfizer has failed to realize the multi-blockbuster potential of its pipeline, Starboard claimed, pointing to what it characterized as several missed opportunities such as cancer therapy Bavencio\u2014which Pfizer ultimately divested to former partner Merck KGaA\u2014and the JAK1 asset Cibinqo, which the firm projects to fall \u201cwell short\u201d of its blockbuster target by 2030.\n\nStarboard also claimed that Pfizer seems to have \u201csignificantly overpaid\u201d for several of its big-ticket acquisitions, which since 2022 have reached nearly $70 billion. These deals include the $43 billion buyout of Seagen and $5.4 billion for Global Blood Therapeutics. Citing Wall Street Research estimates, Starboard argued that the pharma will miss its 2030 M&A sales target by $7 billion.\n\nThe GBT acquisition was particularly problematic for Starboard, which flagged Pfizer\u2019s later decision to pull the sickle cell disease therapy Oxbryta\u2014the centerpiece of the GBT agreement\u2014after new evidence pointed to an excess risk of death and complications.\n\nDespite these stumbles, analysts have largely taken Pfizer\u2019s side, with BMO Capital Markets writing in October 2024 that Starboard\u2019s takeover \u201ccould do little to change the story near term\u201d and suggesting in a different note that solving the pharma\u2019s predicament will take more than a \u201cquick fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cManagement appears to actually be undertaking many of the corrective actions to right the ship,\u201d the BMO analysts continued. \u201cChange takes time, and replacing the CEO (while satisfying to some) is unlikely to fix the story and immediately re-rate shares.\u201d",

A few of the key factors that are driving the growth of this market are sedentary lifestyles increasing, improvements in healthcare system, and a growing prevalence of thrombotic diseases.\n\n\n\nThere are anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin, and new oral medications like rivaroxaban and apixaban. These have been widely applied in patients with atrial fibrillation, a clinical condition that predisposes a patient to stroke. Other commonly applied areas include hip or knee replacements. They are very useful also in the management of patients with pulmonary embolism, DVT, and other thrombotic disorders. Even though effective, anticoagulants tend to bleed if the management is inadequate. Regular blood tests along with the dosages may need to be adjusted to ensure their safe usage.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers of the Anticoagulants Market\n\nIncreasing Prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases\n\n\n\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death across the globe. Every year, approximately 17.9 million people die from this disease. The key driver for the anticoagulant market is the growing trend of cardiovascular diseases, which include heart attacks, strokes, and atrial fibrillation. These diseases are usually characterized by inappropriate blood clotting; therefore, anticoagulants are crucial in maintaining and preventing further complications.\n\nThe rising population age and unhealthful lifestyle habits, such as a poor diet and lack of physical activity, also contribute to these issues. The number of patients under anticoagulation therapy is on the rise, and thereby, the demand for anticoagulants also increases. In 2022, 702,880 people died from heart disease, and such deaths accounted for 1 in every 5 deaths.\n\n\n\nInnovation in Anticoagulant Drugs\n\n\n\nNewer drugs have been developed due to technology, which proved more potent than the drugs previously discovered. Unlike traditional anticoagulants like warfarin, newer oral formulations like rivaroxaban and apixaban have the benefits of fewer dietary restrictions, lower monitoring, and fewer complications caused by bleeding. These innovations facilitate improved patient compliance and outcomes, increasing the adoption of anticoagulants in hospital and outpatient settings.\n\nThe ongoing development of newer, more targeted, and user-friendly forms of anticoagulant treatments supports the overall growth of the market by offering more variety in the management of thrombotic disorders. Three new coagulation tests for Factor Xa inhibitors launched by Roche in February 2024 are part of its contribution to enhancing clinical decisions in prescribing direct oral anticoagulants to avert stroke.\n\n\n\nBetter Health Care Facilities and Enlightenment\n\n\n\nImproved health facilities worldwide open up treatment for those suffering from chronic conditions, such as people requiring anticoagulation. Increasing awareness regarding thrombotic diseases, and better diagnostics and treatment options, are encouraging more patients to undergo preventive and therapeutic anticoagulant care.\n\nFurther, efforts by the healthcare department to educate patients pertaining to the risk of blood clots and the early intervention for the same also contribute towards rising demand for the anticoagulants. Improved access to healthcare in developing markets is also expanding the anticoagulants market worldwide.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 120 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $41.31 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $89.5 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.9% Regions Covered Global\n\nCompany Analysis: Overviews, Key Personnel, Recent Developments & Strategies, Product Portfolio, Financial Insights\n\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals Inc\n\nAspen Holdings\n\nBayer AG\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Company Limited\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd\n\nGlaxoSmithKline plc\n\nJohnson & Johnson Private Limited\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\nSanofi\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) closed the latest trading day at $26.75, indicating a -0.41% change from the previous session's end. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.92%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.31%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.03%.\n\nShares of the drugmaker have appreciated by 1.67% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Medical sector's gain of 3.83% and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 0.81%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Pfizer will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 4, 2025. In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $0.48 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 380%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $17.5 billion, indicating a 22.8% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 1.38% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Pfizer currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Pfizer's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.32. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.04, so one might conclude that Pfizer is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nAlso, we should mention that PFE has a PEG ratio of 0.66. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.37.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 195, finds itself in the bottom 23% echelons of all 250+ industries.",

The settlement resolves allegations brought forward by a whistleblower in a qui tam lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the government, Biohaven \u201cpaid improper remuneration, including in the form of speaker honoraria and meals at high end restaurants, to health care professionals to induce them to prescribe the migraine medication Nurtec ODT in violation of the anti-kickback statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiohaven selected certain health care providers to be part of the Nurtec speaker bureau and provided them paid speaking opportunities with the intent that the speaker honoraria and meals would induce them to prescribe Nurtec ODT,\u201d the DOJ alleges.\n\n\u201cThrough this settlement and others, the government has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that drug companies do not use kickbacks to influence physician prescribing,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cThe department will use every tool at its disposal to prevent pharmaceutical manufacturers from undermining the objectivity of treatment decisions by health care providers.\u201d\n\nThe allegations were brought forward in a qui tam lawsuit filed by Patrica Frattasio, a former sales representative at Biohaven. Under the False Claims Act\u2019s qui tam provisions, individuals may file lawsuits alleging government contracting fraud on behalf of the United States. In successful qui tam cases, whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 15 and 30% of the settlement or judgment. Frattasio is set to receive approximately $8.4 million.\n\nDuring FY 2024, settlements and judgments under the False Claims Act exceeded $2.9 billion and over $2.4 billion of the recoveries stemmed from qui tam whistleblower lawsuits. Furthermore, according to the government, a record 979 qui tam lawsuits were filed in FY 2024.\n\nHowever, in September 2024, a district judge in Florida ruled that the False Claims Act\u2019s qui tam provisions were unconstitutional. The U.S. federal government is urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reverse that decision, stating in a brief that \u201cother than the district court here, every court to have addressed the constitutionality of the False Claims Act\u2019s qui tam provisions has upheld them.\u201d\n\nWhistleblower advocates have warned of dire consequences should the district court ruling stand and have also outlined why it is inconsistent with prior case precedent and misinterprets the qui tam provisions.\n\nThe claims asserted in this case are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nPfizer Agrees to Pay Nearly 60M to Resolve False Claims Allegations Relating to Improper Physician Payments by Subsidiary\n\nMore False Claims Act News",

            "content": "Pfizer has agreed to pay more than $59.7 million to resolve cases regarding an alleged kickback scheme surrounding Biohaven Pharma and its migraine drug Nurtec ODT, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Friday.\n\nIn its press release, the DOJ accused Biohaven of \u201cknowingly\u201d causing the submission of false claims to Medicare and other federal programs \u201cby paying kickbacks to health care providers to induce prescriptions of\u201d Nurtec ODT.\n\nBiohaven ran its scheme from March 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, during which time it paid \u201cimproper remuneration\u201d to healthcare professionals, including speaker honoraria and meals at high-end restaurants, according to the DOJ. Biohaven\u2019s speakers, the department said, were given paid speaking opportunities \u201cwith the intent that the speaker honoraria and meals would induce them to prescribe Nurtec ODT.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the DOJ\u2019s suit claimed that many prescribers attended multiple programs but \u201creceived no educational benefit from attending repeat programs.\u201d Certain Biohaven programs also involved participants \u201cwith no educational need to attend,\u201d including family, friends and colleagues of speakers.\n\nOf note, the DOJ contends that this program persisted until October 2022, when Pfizer closed its $11.6 billion acquisition of Biohaven.\n\nKickback allegations against Biohaven had been made public prior to Pfizer\u2019s acquisition announcement in May 2022. In August 2021, former Biohaven employee Patricia Frattasio filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the biotech, alleging that it had violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\nBiohaven, according to Frattasio, induced \u201cothers to submit fraudulent bills to the Government by knowingly providing remuneration in the form of improper speaker program honoraria; ad hoc kickbacks; electronic health record software cost assistance; and copay cards.\u201d The suit alleged that these \u201cquid quo pro arrangements \u2026 involve the provision of financial benefits in return for referrals of business, which result in reimbursement from federal and state health care programs.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s settlement agreement will also resolve Frattasio\u2019s whistleblower suit and will give the former Biohaven employee around $8.4 million as her share of the federal recovery.\n\n\u201cPatients deserve to know that their doctor is prescribing medications based on their doctor\u2019s medical judgment, and not as a result of financial incentives from pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Trini Ross, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, said in the Friday announcement.\n\nPfizer\u2019s acquisition of Biohaven has been fruitful for the pharma. In March 2023, the FDA approved the nasal spray Zavzpret\u2014which the biotech had originally been developing\u2014for the acute treatment of migraine. In its third-quarter 2024 report, Pfizer disclosed that Nurtec ODT had earned $337 million in that quarter, representing 45% year-on-year growth.",

The board will hold its annual meeting in April.\n\nThe news took some pressure off Pfizer stock, which rose 3% to 26.86. Starboard took a $1 billion stake in Pfizer last year. The activist investor claims Pfizer hasn't delivered on its investment in research and development. Starboard also argued that Pfizer has made poor capital allocation decisions and has badly forecast and budgeted.\n\nStill, Pfizer stock has fallen 56.5% from its peak above 60 in late 2021. Shares are now trapped between their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, according to MarketSurge.\n\nPfizer Stock: Bourla Faces Off With Critics\n\nThe pressure is on for Chief Executive Albert Bourla who has faced significant criticism from Starboard.\n\nDuring the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this month, Bourla acknowledged he was dissatisfied with Pfizer's performance in 2023. The company missed sales expectations in three out of four quarters as sales of Covid products pulled back markedly.\n\nBourla said he laid out five priorities to turn things around. The goals involved bolstering the pipeline, turning around commercial performance, maximizing new products and reducing costs.\n\n\"I'm very pleased that all the goals that we had set in all five priorities were achieved and exceeded in most of the cases,\" Bourla said.\n\nBut Pfizer stock has been relatively unmoved since the annual conference, the biggest in the industry. Shares have a poor Relative Strength Rating of 24, according to IBD Digital. The 1-99 score measures a stock's 12-month performance against all other stocks. Pfizer stock also has a middle Composite Rating of 50, putting its technical and fundamental performance in the middle of all stocks.\n\nFollow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @IBD_AGatlin.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nAkero Therapeutics Stock Doubles \u2014 Pulling 89bio Higher \u2014 On Positive MASH Study\n\nNovo Nordisk Surges As Next-Gen Obesity Drug Outperforms\n\nIBD Stock Of The Day: See How To Find, Track And Buy The Best Stocks\n\nGet Timely Buy & Sell Alerts With IBD Leaderboard\n\nFind Today's Best Growth Stocks To Watch With IBD 50",

Image credit: Shutterstock/Molly Woodward.\n\nPfizer has agreed to pay $59.7m to resolve illegal payments to healthcare professionals made by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, a biopharma it acquired over two years ago.\n\nThe charges allege that Biohaven submitted false claims to Medicare and other federal healthcare programmes by paying kickbacks to doctors so they would preferentially prescribe the company\u2019s migraine drug Nurtec ODT (rimegepant). A kickback is a negotiated bribe in the form of an illegal payment intended as compensation for preferential treatment.\n\nThe fraudulent activities occurred between March 2020 and September 2022, predating Pfizer\u2019s involvement with Biohaven. The civil settlement came via a False Claims Act lawsuit filed by Patrica Frattasio, a former sales representative of Biohaven and whistleblower on the case concerning the company\u2019s kickback payments. The False Claims Act is a law that enables whistleblowers and private individuals to sue on behalf of the government in fraud cases. Frattasio will receive $8.4m for her role in the settlement, whilst $50.2m and $9.2m represent federal recovery and Medicaid programme recoveries, respectively.\n\n\u201cPatients deserve to know that their doctor is prescribing medications based on their doctor\u2019s medical judgment, and not as a result of financial incentives from pharmaceutical companies,\u201d said US Attorney Trini E. Ross for the Western District of New York.\n\nThe government added that some prescribers on Biohaven\u2019s payment schemes attended repeat programmes, gaining no further educational benefit. Spouses, family members, and friends were also present at speaking events and meals, taking advantage of Biohaven\u2019s kickbacks.\n\nBy settling, Pfizer has resolved the allegations whilst not admitting wrongdoing. The government asserted that Biohaven\u2019s fraud stopped in October 2022, when Pfizer acquired the company and terminated the Nurtec speaker programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to put this legacy matter behind us, so that we can continue to focus on the needs of patients,\u201d Pfizer said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nPfizer paid $11.6bn to buy Biohaven, largely on the financial performance of Nurtec ODT. The drug went on to generate global sales of $928m in sales in 2023. Known as Vydura in Europe, Nurtec ODT is forecast to see global annual sales of $2.2bn by 2030 according to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Centre.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nPfizer is not the only big pharma to settle kickback claims in the US recently. Teva Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay $450m over claims it used charities to boost sales of the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) in October 2024.",

The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers\u2019 judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.\n\nThe civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Patrica Frattasio, a former sales representative at Biohaven. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery. The qui tam case is captioned U.S. ex rel. Patricia Frattasio v. Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., No. 6:21-CV-06539 (W.D.N.Y.).

The trial is underway for OS and progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nOutcomes of PFS are anticipated this year.\n\nThe BREAKWATER trial\u2019s safety profile for the combination was consistent with expectations, showing no new safety signals.\n\nSerious treatment-emergent adverse events were slightly higher in the BRAFTOVI group than in the control group.\n\nPfizer chief oncology officer Roger Dansey said: \u201cThese results of this first analysis were the basis for the first approval of a targeted therapy regimen for use in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.\n\n\u201cWe are highly encouraged by these response results, which are indicative of the clinically meaningful benefit of BRAFTOVI in reducing tumour size or having no detectable cancer, along with the promising interim analysis of overall survival.\u201d\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to the combination regimen last month, under Project FrontRunner.\n\nDiscussions with other regulatory authorities are ongoing to support potential future licence applications for the regimen.\n\nEarlier this month, the company\u2019s CREST trial assessing sasanlimab with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), as induction treatment with or without maintenance in individuals with BCG-naive, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, met its primary endpoint.",

While not all dividend stocks are the same, finding great companies that can stand the test of time can enable you to magnify your returns through market ups and downs.\n\nHere are two such dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio right now if you have $500 cash to put to work.\n\n1. Pfizer: 6.6%\n\nPfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been through a rough time in the last few years. The vestiges of its peak pandemic success have fallen into the background, and investors have witnessed a return to normality with the business' growth. Shares are down slightly from the start of 2025. In fact, the stock is trading close to the price it was at a decade ago.\n\nThe tepid share price performance this stock has delivered has helped push its dividend yield up to a robust 6.6%. For context, the average S&P 500 stock pays a dividend of around 1.5%. Pfizer is a long-standing dividend payer, and has increased its dividend every single year for 16 years at this point. Growth was definitely bound to normalize and even experience volatility once sales of Comirnaty (its blockbuster COVID-19 vaccine) and oral antiviral drug waned.\n\nLet's take a look at where Pfizer is currently as a business. In the first nine months of 2024, the company reported revenue of around $46 billion, a moderate 2% increase from one year ago. It also generated net income of $7.6 billion in that time frame, a notable 39% year-over-year increase. On a quarterly basis, third-quarter revenue totaled just shy of $18 billion, up 31% from the year-ago period. That top line was up 14% year over year, even if you exclude COVID-19 product revenue.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that even with those COVID-19 products taken out of the picture, Pfizer is notably eclipsing its pre-pandemic growth rates. In Q3 2019, Pfizer reported that revenue was actually down 3% from the prior-year period, with total revenue of about $13 billion.\n\nPfizer is only in the early stages of experiencing the financial rewards of the acquisitions it made using the cash and profits from its blockbuster products during the pandemic's height. These included cancer biotech Seagen, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (known for its migraine treatment Nurtec), sickle cell disease drugmaker Global Blood Therapeutics, and Arena Pharmaceuticals, which develops drugs for various inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders.\n\nPfizer anticipates that the effect of these and other acquisitions will enable the company to bring numerous blockbuster drugs to market, significantly amplifying revenue and profits by the early 2030s. Long-standing members of Pfizer's portfolio, like the Vyndaqel family of drugs, Eliquis, and Xtandi, saw revenue growth of 63%, 9%, and 28%, respectively, in Q3 2024. Newer additions to Pfizer's portfolio, like Nurtec, witnessed 45% operational growth in the three-month period.",

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

They tested the technology in mice.\n\nThe researchers found that even at extremely low doses, LNPs carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA reached vital organs. It reached heart tissue and caused cellular or tissue changes.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 mRNA injection LNPs systemically circulate and are taken up into vital organ systems resulting in body-wide toxic Spike protein production,\u201d epidemiologist and McCullough Foundation administrator Nicolas Hulscher wrote on Substack.\n\nAccording to Children\u2019s Health Defense Senior Scientist Karl Jablonowski, the common misconception early in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout was that the LNP \u201cstays in the muscle cells.\u201d\n\nThis idea was perpetuated by major publications, like Science and Open Forum Infectious Diseases \u2014 a journal funded in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Pfizer \u2014 even though Pfizer\u2019s own study showed that after just 8 hours, a mere 22% of the initially injected LNPs remain at the site of injection, 18% migrated to the liver and 1% migrated to the spleen.\n\n\u201cThis paper is an excellent example of how false that statement was, finding intramuscularly injected LNPs in the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, head, and \u2018all analyzed lymph nodes,\u2019\u201d Jablonowski said.\n\nResearch should have been done before mass vaccination, not after\n\nAccording to the study, there are over 30 new drugs \u2014 including genome editing tools, mRNA and protein drugs \u2014 approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat disease.\n\nHowever, drug developers face a major challenge in the clinical application of these tools \u2014 how to ensure that the drugs reach only the cells they are targeting.\n\nTo target specific cells, the drugs use \u201cnanocarriers\u201d \u2014 tiny particles that can carry a drug throughout the body \u2014 selected for their differential abilities to target particular cell types. There are several different types of nanocarriers, including liposomes, viral vectors and LNPs, which were used in the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nNanocarriers are designed with a coating to make them stable and help them reach their target cells. However, when they are introduced into the body, they change in ways that make their intended functionality more unpredictable.\n\nJablonowski said this change happens because proteins bind to the nanoparticles and affect where they will go and how they interact. \u201cThis interaction with environmental proteins is inescapable and one source of critical uncertainty,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes LNPs a risky gene therapy tool typically used only by people who are \u201cfighting for their lives and willing to accept potential adverse effects that come from LNPs hitting the wrong target,\u201d Jablonowski said. \u201cA healthy person wouldn\u2019t be likely to take that serious risk for a small possible benefit.\u201d\n\nThe researchers set out to develop a technology, called \u201cSingle Cell Precision Nanocarrier Identification,\u201d designed to map and quantify where nanocarriers injected into a mouse ended up.\n\nTheir technology uses machine learning to analyze image data \u2014 making it possible to precisely quantify where the nanoparticles go at the organ, tissue and single-cell level across the entire body.\n\nThey specifically designed it to measure the low doses of the medications that are usually present in vaccines. Then they tested it on several different new types of drugs and were able to successfully identify where the nanoparticles went across a mouse\u2019s entire body.\n\nAfter an LNP containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA was injected into the muscle, the researchers detected the mRNA and spike protein in the mice\u2019s liver, spleen, lungs, heart, head and kidneys.\n\nTheir findings have \u201cdirect implications for clinical translation\u201d of the drugs, they said.\n\n\u201cOur finding of changes in the expression of immune and vascular proteins in heart tissue after LNP spike mRNA delivery aligns with reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in a subset of individuals who received mRNA vaccines,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAs of Dec. 27, 2024, 27,357 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis had been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the U.S., with 20,846 cases attributed to Pfizer, 5,952 cases to Moderna and 482 cases to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe major limitation of the Single Cell Precision Nanocarrier Identification technology is that it cannot be used in living subjects. That means there is still no way to effectively track where LNPs go in living humans.\n\n\u201cThis technology cannot provide the dynamic and longitudinal information that live animal methods, such as PET or bioluminescence imaging, offer,\u201d Jablonowski said.\n\nSign Up for Free\n\nThe study\u2019s authors said further research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans and whether the molecular changes they found across the mice\u2019s bodies are linked to clinical symptoms.\n\nCommenting on the authors\u2019 statement that the likely similar effects on humans should be explored in future work, Jablonowski said:\n\n\u201cEvery vaccine regulatory body in the world that approved LNPs for mass distribution should feel the pang of their complacent hastiness, as that yet undone \u2018future work\u2019 needed to be done well before approval. \u201cThe U.S. has a decade-long approval process for vaccines. Of all of those that have been approved so far, none are actually safe, but the process does eliminate some of the more egregious ones. Not yet 5 years since inception, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine platform is looking more like an egregious one.\u201d\n\nHulscher agreed, writing \u201cBiodistribution studies should have been performed BEFORE mass \u2018vaccination\u2019 of the entire world\u2019s population.\u201d He called for the \u201cinvasive gene therapy injections\u201d to be pulled from the market immediately.\n\nRelated articles in The Defender:",

Arlene Foster, Michelle O\u2019Neill, Jeremy Farrar, Robin Swann, Humza Yousef, Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson, Mark Drakeford, Social Media companies YouTube, Google, TikTok, META & Twitter.\n\nBy deliberately narrowing the scope of an inquiry they\u2019ve removed the publics understanding of why they were so heavily censored, yes it was partly about removing vaccine hesitancy but blocking the sharing of very real harms seen and felt by so many proved horrendous for so many more to come over the following year from AstraZeneca and not only it\u2019s changed name to Vaxzevria but from the harms posed by all the vaccines.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the very real harms suffered by the public which so many have refused on many occasions to even engage let alone acknowledge existing from Hancock to Whitty, they all played down risks in Covid so they\u2019d be seen as rare to remove vaccine hesitancy.\n\nMany of those appearing even openly admitted their part in calling for or backing censorship campaigns to \u201cprotect the public\u201d from misinformation and disinformation that was \u201crisking lives\u201d, the goal being to \u201cprotect granny\u201d afterall.\n\nAnd what of us now, it\u2019s such a cruel hellscape we\u2019ve found ourselves thrust into with once strong fit bodies and perfectly functioning minds now so horribly broken and no one in \u201chealthcare\u201d offering us the help we desperately need even 4 years on from the toxic vaccine campaign waged by AstraZeneca and indemnified from prosecution by the government, \u201cthey won\u2019t make any money from providing it\u201d stated Hancock \u201cso it\u2019s only right we do this.\u201d\n\nThis Inquiry hasn\u2019t been designed with fairness in mind to those cruelly affected whether vaccine injured & bereaved, those loved ones murdered by lethal protocols or other harms inflicted by lockdown kerbs.\n\nBlame is clear from far away but indemnity clauses are in place with guided questions designed to restrict the needed answers further, but in the question will our solicitors get us justice finally after it\u2019s concluded is another matter and you have to have hope that they\u2019ve still beyond every obstacle thrown at this that they will. \u202a\n\nThe deceitful actions of a trusted government put the safety of millions in the U.K. in the completely immoral and un-impartial hands of a medicines regulator. \u202c\n\n\u202aSwearing allegiance to a company paying funding of around 80% should\u2019ve been the biggest safety signal ever yet it proved how blind they all were to signs of major harms being committed by their assured products. \u202c\n\nLies seem to be part of their remit in the Inquiry, we know that indemnification from prosecution has been offered to all who require it it now appears after Matt Hancock openly referred to it at the end of module 3, with guided questions also they\u2019re protecting everyone concerned from seeming to act without impartiality.\n\nImagine the depths of evil to firstly construct the plan Howard but then to build such an army of minions willing or otherwise to push such an Orwellian agenda, it\u2019s from the stuff of nightmares but the powers that have brought us to this point but still without a clear way of getting justice were certainly in it for the long haul with many paths to protect them\n\nBearing in mind the first record death from the covid vaccines was Jan 26th 2021 it\u2019s a timely reminder that this is exactly the sort of horror that the Covid inquiry was meant to finally look into but why narrow the margins of investigation to further protect those already with indemnity from prosecution instead of highlighting the British publics already valid causes for concern?\n\nIt\u2019s been a complete failure by \u201chealthcare\u201d to ensure the safety of its public and act on concerns to offer the help they need afterwards, we need a government prepared to take the tough steps needed to restore trust if we are ever to believe them again.",

            "content": "The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will pay nearly $60 million to resolve charges that a company it acquired paid kickbacks so that physicians would prescribe a specific migraine drug to patients, thereby defrauding Medicare and other federal health care programs.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Friday that Biohaven paid improper remuneration, including in the form of speaker honoraria and meals at high-end restaurants, to healthcare professionals to induce them to prescribe the migraine medication Nurtec ODT more often in violation of the anti-kickback statute.\n\nThe scheme took place from March 1, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2022. Pfizer bought Biohaven in October 2022.\n\nPFIZER'S PAXLOVID FAILS AS 15-DAY TREATMENT FOR LONG COVID, STUDY FINDS\n\nProsecutors said that certain prescribers who attended multiple speaker programs on the same topic received no educational benefit from attending repeat programs and that certain Biohaven speaker programs were attended by individuals with no educational need to attend, such as the speakers\u2019 spouses, family members, or friends, or colleagues from the speakers\u2019 own medical practice.\n\nPfizer ended the Nurtec speaker programs after paying $11.5 billion to buy Biohaven.\n\n\"Patients deserve to know that their doctor is prescribing medications based on their doctor\u2019s medical judgment, and not as a result of financial incentives from pharmaceutical companies,\" U.S. Attorney Trini E. Ross for the Western District of New York said. \"This settlement reflects our commitment to hold those who violate the laws accountable, regardless of their status or prestige.\"\n\nPFIZER ADVANCES ONCE-DAILY WEIGHT-LOSS PILL IN ONGOING STUDY\n\nPfizer did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.\n\n\"We are pleased to put this legacy matter behind us, so that we can continue to focus on the needs of patients,\" the New York-based drugmaker said in a statement.\n\nNurtec ODT, also known as Rimegepant, was approved for treating acute migraine in February 2020 and its approval was extended to preventing episodic migraine in June 2021. The drug was promoted by singer Lady Gaga in 2023, who said in a social media post that she had suffered with migraines since childhood and said she wished she had found the drug sooner.\n\nThe civil settlement resolves an August 2021 lawsuit filed in the Rochester, New York federal court by Patricia Frattasio, a former Biohaven neuroscience sales specialist.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nShe will receive about $8.4 million from the settlement. About $41.8 million will go to the federal government and $9.5 million will go to state Medicaid programs.\n\nThe False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the government and share in recoveries.\n\nMeanwhile, anti\u2011kickback statute prohibits offering or paying anything of value to induce the referral of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and other federal health care programs. The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers\u2019 judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.",

            "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive results from the Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial evaluating BRAFTOVI\u00ae (encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab (marketed as ERBITUX\u00ae) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation. At the time of this analysis, the BRAFTOVI combination regimen demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (60.9% vs 40.0%, odds ratio =2.443, p=0.0008). These results will be presented today in an oral presentation (Abstract 16) at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium (ASCO GI) and were simultaneously published in Nature Medicine.\n\n\u201cDespite the high unmet need in this patient population, prior to the recent encorafenib combination regimen approval, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies indicated for people with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer,\u201d said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Professor and Deputy Chair of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-principal investigator of the BREAKWATER trial. \u201cThese data from the BREAKWATER study show the potential for this targeted treatment regimen to become the new standard of care for people with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, for whom long-term disease control is critical.\u201d\n\nThe estimated median duration of response as assessed by BICR was 13.9 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 8.5-not estimable [NE]) with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 and 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.7-12.7) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Of patients on BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, 22.4% (n=15) had a response lasting 12 months or longer, compared to 11.4% (n=5) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. The median time to response as assessed by BICR was 7.1 weeks (range 5.7-53.7) with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 and 7.3 weeks (range 5.4-48.0) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.\n\nOverall survival (OS) data were immature at the time of this analysis but demonstrated a promising trend in favor of BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 compared to patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Median OS with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab with chemotherapy was not estimable (95% CI: 19.8-NE) and 14.6 months (95% CI: 13.4-NE) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.318-0.691). The BREAKWATER trial is ongoing for OS and progression-free survival (PFS), with PFS results expected in 2025.\n\n\u201cThese results of this first analysis were the basis for the first approval of a targeted therapy regimen for use in the first-line setting for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation,\u201d said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cWe are highly encouraged by these response results, which are indicative of the clinically meaningful benefit of BRAFTOVI in reducing tumor size or having no detectable cancer, along with the promising interim analysis of overall survival. We look forward to additional read-outs from the BREAKWATER trial this year.\u201d\n\nThe safety profile of BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 in the BREAKWATER trial was consistent with the known safety profile of each respective agent. No new safety signals were identified. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 37.7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 compared to 34.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.\n\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC in December 2024. The approval was among the first in the industry to be conducted under the FDA\u2019s Project FrontRunner, which seeks to support the development and approval of new cancer drugs for advanced or metastatic disease. The BREAKWATER data are also being discussed with other regulatory authorities around the world to support potential future additional license applications for the BRAFTOVI combination regimen in this indication.\n\nPfizer is continuing its commitment to help non-scientists understand the latest findings with the development of abstract plain language summaries (APLS) for company-sponsored research being presented, which are written in non-technical language. Those interested in learning more can visit www.Pfizer.com/apls to access the summaries.\n\nAbout BREAKWATER\n\nBREAKWATER is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial of BRAFTOVI with cetuximab, alone or in combination with mFOLFOX6 in participants with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (discontinued after randomization of 158 patients), BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n=236) or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX each with or without bevacizumab (control-arm) (n=243). The dual primary endpoints are ORR, which was met at the time of analysis, and PFS as assessed by BICR. OS is a key secondary endpoint.\n\nAbout Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\n\nCRC is the third most common type of cancer in the world, with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses in 2022.1 It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.2 Overall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women.2 In the U.S. alone, an estimated 154,270 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2025, and approximately 53,000 are estimated to die from the disease each year.3 For 20% of those diagnosed with CRC, the disease has metastasized, or spread, making it harder to treat, and up to 50% of patients with localized disease eventually develop metastases.4\n\nBRAF mutations are estimated to occur in 8-12% of people with mCRC and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.5 The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common BRAF mutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation is more than double that of patients with no known mutation present.5,6 Despite the high unmet need in BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC, prior to December 20, 2024, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies specifically indicated for people with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC.7,8\n\nAbout BRAFTOVI\u00ae (encorafenib)\n\nBRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E. Inappropriate activation of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) has been shown to occur in certain cancers, including CRC.\n\nPfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Israel and Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in all other countries, including Europe and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea).\n\nINDICATION AND USAGE\n\nBRAFTOVI\u00ae (encorafenib) is indicated, in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).\n\nBRAFTOVI is also indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.\n\nLimitations of Use: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF CRC.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nRefer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for recommended dosing and additional safety information.\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nNew Primary Malignancies: New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur. In BEACON CRC (previously treated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC) skin papilloma was reported in 2.6%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment.\n\nTumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation using an FDA-approved test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.\n\nCardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\n\nHepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity can occur. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\n\nHemorrhage: In BEACON CRC (previously treated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%). In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\n\nUveitis: Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\n\nQT Prolongation: BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC), an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 3.6% (8/222) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms.\n\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity: BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\n\nRisks Associated with Combination Treatment: BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information.\n\nLactation: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\n\nInfertility: Advise males of reproductive potential that BRAFTOVI may impair fertility.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nBREAKWATER Trial (previously untreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC)\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6.

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

            "content": "WHAT IF the vaccine you received had not been in a clinical trial? For millions of people worldwide, this is precisely what happened when they unknowingly received a covid vaccine manufactured using a process where the end product had never been trialled in humans. This manufacturing shift resulted in significantly higher rates of adverse reactions \u2013 13 times more in some cases \u2013 representing a regulatory failure with profound implications for public trust and safety. Yet, the UK Covid-19 Inquiry tasked with investigating these critical decisions has avoided addressing this issue, which lies at the heart of the controversy on regulatory failure.\n\nImagine a chef perfecting a recipe in a small kitchen, only to mass-produce it in a factory using different ingredients and techniques. In December 2020, the UK\u2019s drug regulator, MHRA, gave a temporary authorisation to a mass-manufactured vaccine (Process 2 or P2) without requiring human trial data. Available safety and efficacy data were based solely on Process 1 (P1), the small-scale clinical trial method. MHRA relied on lab-based\u2018comparability\u2019 studies to justify the switch, but these assessments failed to account for potential risks posed by even minor manufacturing changes.\n\nThis article delves into how the critical manufacturing switch occurred, why it went largely unchallenged, and implications for public health, safety, and regulatory accountability.\n\nCrucial difference between P1 and P2\n\nEven small changes in manufacturing can significantly affect a final product\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Pfizer/BioNTech gave the public a different product to the one tested in clinical trials; it was a \u2018bait and switch\u2019. The industry uses the phrase \u2018the process is the product\u2019 because of wide variation in the end product can result from small changes in the manufacturing process.\n\nProcess 1 (P1) was used to produce vaccine administered in clinical trials. This small-scale, lab-controlled method relied on purified materials to create DNA and mRNA, ensuring minimal risk of contamination. MHRA relied on safety and efficacy data exclusively from P1-manufactured vaccines.\n\nProcess 2 (P2) by contrast, was designed for large-scale vaccine production. This method involved growing DNA templates in vats of E. coli bacteria \u2013 a faster but riskier approach that can introduce contaminants such as bacterial DNA fragments and endotoxins, substances that can trigger a vast range of pathology.\n\nWhen mass manufactured batches were first given to humans, on 8th December 2020 in the UK, MHRA had seen no trial data of these products. The data they had seen analysed in the regulatory submission was up to the cutoff on 14th November 2020 and there was no data on P2. MHRA authorised a P2 batch (EJ0553), on December 2, 2020, based solely on laboratory-based \u2018comparability assessments\u2019 between P1 and P2; there was no human testing. MHRA justified making this decision based only on these comparability studies, by claiming there had been \u2018full-scale validation\u2019 of the manufacturing process, but this was focused entirely on quality and quantity of RNA.\n\nMHRA also failed to ensure that the public was informed of this massive unknown and the potential risks involved. Informed consent would have been possible if there had been more honesty about uncertainties. Instead, the public was subjected to a barrage of \u2018safe and effective\u2019, including from the regulator themselves \u2013 the MHRA itself sets the terms for the advertising and promotion of medicines and effectively prohibited any caveats on the \u2018safe and effective\u2019 mantra.\n\nAvoiding the Hard Questions\n\nOn January 22, Dr June Raine, the then CEO of MHRA, was questioned under oath about MHRA\u2019s testing of covid vaccines. The convoluted way the question was phrased allowed for an evasive response. It is no wonder the inquiry failed to properly discuss this issue, as it would expose a monumental failing on the part of the regulator.\n\nThe question that should have been asked is, \u2018Was the product given to the public manufactured using the same process as the product given in the trial?\u2019 The answer to that would have been \u2018no\u2019.\n\nInstead, Raine was asked about the difference between batches tested by MHRA and batches given to the public. MHRA did do limited testing of batches from the mass manufacturing process, but that is not the issue which is that there was no clinical trial of the P2 product used for the vaccination of the public!\n\nThe question, at 25:35 minutes:\n\n\u2018Some have suggested that the batches, which were delivered to the United Kingdom for use amongst its population, [\u2026] were batches that were produced by a different manufacturing process [\u2026] as had been tested by the MHRA. So, bluntly, the suggestion has been made [that] you tested and authorised and certified a certain number of vaccines made by manufacturing process A, and then the manufacturers actually delivered vaccines to the British population produced as a result of a different manufacturing process, and one, by inference, which had not been tested.\u2019\n\nRaine replied,\u2018My understanding is that the manufacturing process would have been the same.\u2019\n\nNote that that Hugo Keith KC deliberately refers to process A and B to distinguish the manufacturing of different batches. This was a further obfuscation as Pfizer/BioNTech always refer to the clinical trial manufacturing as Process 1 and the mass production as Process 2.\n\nWhen Ruth O\u2019Rafferty of Scottish Vaccine Injury Group was questioned earlier in the week, her attempts to raise the issues (at 32:37 minutes) were quickly shut down with a claim that there was no time to discuss these topics in such detail. The failure to address these issues is because what happened is nothing like what should have happened. The regulator was relying on evidence that was entirely inadequate to demonstrate a sound safety case for the vaccines.\n\nWhat should have happened\n\nMHRA should have insisted on comprehensive data showing that conclusions drawn about P1 were comparable to P2 based on what happened in humans. For the purposes of this article, we shall leave aside the fact that the harm from P1 was not fully disclosed to MHRA and, even then, the risk of a serious adverse event of special interest (which were conditions identified in advance as being worth watching for) was 1 in 800 for Pfizer and Moderna combined and 1 in 990 for Pfizer.\n\nPfizer did set out a plan for a direct comparison between Process 1 and Process 2 products, but said it should be \u2018post-approval\u2019because of the\u2018urgency of the current pandemic\u2019. Pfizer\u2019s clinical trial aimed to compare P2 in 250 participants per lot. However, this comparison was abandoned on February 9, 2021. Only 252 people were given P2 as their first and second dose. Despite this, P2 products with known manufacturing differences were distributed to millions worldwide.\n\nIn September 2022, the trial was terminated. Pfizer said that\u2018given the number now administered worldwide, the originally planned comparison of manufacturing processes is no longer warranted.\u2019 The trial records say that the FDA and EMA agreed to early completion of this trial having \u2018removed the objective to describe the safety and immunogenicity of prophylactic BNT162b2 [\u2026] produced by manufacturing \u201cProcess 1\u201d or \u201cProcess 2\u201d because of the volume of BNT162b2 now distributed and administered globally using manufacturing \u201cProcess 2,\u201d making this comparison unwarranted\u2019.MHRA have stated , \u2018this process comparison was not conducted as part of the formal documentation within the protocol amendment.\u2019\n\nResults comparing the 252 given P2 against those given P1 doses have never been disclosed. However, even without a control group, differences between Process 2 lots were stark, with the EU processing plant having twice as many adverse reactions as USA sites, 10.4 per cent vs 5.5 per cent.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of Adverse Events by Manufacturing Site for Process 2 (P2) Vaccines (mostly given as dose 3), December 2020\u2013March 2021\n\nThis figure shows percentage of adverse events reported among individuals who received P2 vaccines, broken down by manufacturing site. The EU manufacturing site showed a significantly higher adverse reaction rate (10.4 per cent) compared to the USA site (5.5 per cent), illustrating inconsistencies in vaccine quality across production facilities.\n\nDecember 2020 to March 2021\n\nThe first batch given in UK was EJ0553. On November 27, 2020, Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) said of the first two batches (which had been rejected by the MHRA labs*), \u2018it is not currently feasible to compare these two batches to those given to subjects in clinical trials.\u2019 That evening, these dud duo batches were switched for two alternative batches and then a third was added. They reconvened a meeting on the next morning. One of these contained visible particulate matter, and one had RNA that was the wrong size. The batch with floaters in it was the infamous EJ0553 \u2013 the first batch used in the UK.\n\nThe CHM feared they were not getting the best quality batches, and that \u2018it may be the case that the batches the FDA are evaluating are further along the development lifecycle than those allocated for the UK.\u2019 Later, their worst fears were realised. The company said the EJ0553 vial had failed to meet their own acceptance quality limit based on visual inspection. They did not know the ratio of lipids to RNA nor the overall potency (the measure of how much spike was likely to be produced). The minutes say,\u2018The company further explained that these particles did not alter the concentration of the drug product and they did not think this would have an impact on safety and efficacy of the product. However, as these were rejected vials [italics mine], they did not perform a potency test on these rejected vials.\u2019The company explained that \u2018the appearance of these lipid-associated particles increases at the end of the filling line\u2019.Nucleic acids clump and lipid nanoparticles float; both could result in a higher concentration of product in the last batches to be filled.\n\nThe batches they were first offered may have been worse than these, but that does not excuse using these ones. The CMH minutes said that variable potency testing \u2018makes interpretation of the available data difficult\u2019. They noted that the potency test would be passed if between 30 and 100 per cent of cells produced spike, saying: \u2018The limits for in vitro cell expression were also wide being set at 30 per cent or above. This could lead to large differences across batches.\u2019 They added, \u2018a concern was raised that if the product has less than 50 per cent RNA integrity, it may suggest that half of the product is not what it was laid out to be.\u2019 However, they then declared it reassuring that \u2018the later developmental batches have a higher level of RNA integrity that is more comparable with the earlier clinical batches.\u2019\n\nThe focus throughout seemed to be a concern that junk vials might not have the same efficacy. There was minimal discussion on safety even though they had seen no data comparing these P2 products with P1.\n\nThe defence for using these vials was that they \u2018were not understood to be associated with a change in concentration of RNA containing LNPs\u2019.That claim did not appear to be based on data, nor should it have provided any reassurance regarding safety, which depends on factors beyond the concentration of the active ingredient.\n\nThree days later, Lord Bethell signed a temporary use authorisation. EJ0553 became the template for all subsequent UK Pfizer batches, despite the absence of clinical safety data for P2. On 21st December, the EMA gave a conditional authorisation for Comirnaty (the brand name) and MHRA authorised for use in the UK both batches from the \u2018dud duo\u2019, EE8492 and EE8493, which were rejected in November. A later trial showed the true nature of EJ0553 was indeed very different to P1.\n\nEvidence emerges\n\nAs P2 was used and people were affected, MHRA should have been alarmed by the signals. From the first day of rollout, doses of EJ0553 coincided with three cases of anaphylaxis among 400 initial recipients, affecting those with a clinical history of anaphylaxis. By March 2021, breast screening programs noted 11 per cent of dose 1 recipients and 16 per cent of dose 2 recipients exhibited lymphadenopathy , a \u2018swelling of lymph nodes\u2019 that \u2018usually settles within a few days\u2019 \u2013 a dramatic increase compared to the trial\u2019s P1 product rate of 0.4 per cent. Adjustments to breast screening protocols were required to avoid false cancer diagnoses.\n\nIn April 2021, Pfizer submitted evidence showing significantly higher rates of adverse reactions among clinical trial participants who received P2 (see Figure 2). These participants were originally part of the placebo group and had not previously received the P1 vaccine used during the initial clinical trial. Following the temporary authorizations, most participants in the placebo group were promptly vaccinated with the P2 product, making medium- and long-term safety analysis impossible. Despite the stark increase in adverse reactions among these individuals, Pfizer dismissed the findings, stating that the excess reactions wereas expected.\n\nFigure 2: Adverse Reactions in P1 vs. P2 Recipients in Clinical Trials, Pre- and Post-Unblinding This figure presents data from Pfizer\u2019s FDA submission, comparing adverse reactions between individuals who received P1 vaccines during the blinded trial phase (roughly around December 2020) (Table 60) and those who were given P2 vaccines as a third dose after two placebo doses up to March 2021 (Table 65). Adverse reaction rates were notably higher in the P2 group, despite the relatively short follow-up.\n\nDespite this, MHRA did not re-evaluate the trial findings in light of this, nor did they respond to signals in Yellow Card reporting. Furthermore, they ignored a disproportionately high rate of adverse events in women given P2 compared to near-equal rates in those given P1 in clinical trials. Pfizer\u2019s June 2021 Periodic Safety Update Report (figure 3) detailed this stark gender disparity. This was reinforced by Lareb\u2019s finding that 48 women and 19 men experienced prolonged lymphadenopathy.\n\nFigure 3: Gender Disparity in Adverse Reactions: P1 vs. P2 Vaccines This table highlights a stark gender disparity in adverse reaction rates between clinical trial data (P1) and real-world data (P2). While P1 showed higher adverse reactions in males (middle column), P2 data from real-world administration revealed significantly higher rates in females (first column), suggesting a fundamental difference in the reactogenicity of P2 vaccines.\n\nIn September 2021, MHRA was first presented with trial data on P2. This was not data regarding the 252 participants given it as dose 1 and 2, but was on just 306 trial participants who received P2 as a booster. Both the original batch from the UK rollout and one of the batches rejected outright by USA and UK were two of the three batches (EJ0553 and EE8493) used in Pfizer\u2019s booster trial. The recipients of these P2 boosters had a 5.2% lymphadenopathy rate. In comparison this was 4.3 per cent for those receiving P2 in the adolescent trial and 0.4 per cent for P1 . These findings indicate a 10- to 13-fold increase in reactogenicity. Did they act? No. They said nothing until December, then on Christmas Eve 2021, they added this fact as a footnote to a table saying that \u2018a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy (5.2% vs 0.4%) was observed in participants receiving a booster dose (third dose) compared to participants receiving 2 doses\u2019. This statement misleadingly framed reactogenicity as booster-related rather than acknowledging its roots in the P2 manufacturing process. Lymphadenopathy was just as common with dose 1 when P2 was given. In reality, 85 per cent of lymphadenopathy cases occurred after the first two doses, with some persisting beyond six months. The difference was not the dose; it was because P2 was given.\n\nThe elevated rate of lymphadenopathy and other adverse events is indicative of a marked inflammatory process likely linked to P2 manufacturing processes. Contaminants such as endotoxins or residual plasmid DNA may contribute to these signals. It could be something else or a combination of factors \u2013 the exact cause is as yet unproven. Unlike largely endotoxin-free P1 batches, risk of endotoxin in P2 using E. coli to produce key materials is higher.\n\nConclusion\n\nMHRA\u2019s failure to address differences between P1 and P2 in their safety analysis undermined public trust. Millions of people received a product with a 13-fold higher reactogenicity than P1. Key safety signals \u2013 such as lymphadenopathy, gender disparities, and reactogenicity \u2013 were overlooked, raising serious questions about regulatory accountability. These decisions have had lasting consequences, from deaths and injury to denial of high adverse reaction rates and widespread public confusion and concern. It is long past time for an overhaul of our regulator, MHRA.\n\n* N.B. These first two batches were called EE8492 or CTM12 and EE8493 or CTM13 and had also been rejected for emergency use in the USA on 20th November 2020.The rejection was because of \u2018differences in applied label\u2019.",

            "content": "Few CEOs know the double-edged nature of dealing with US President Donald Trump as viscerally as Pfizer\u2019s Albert Bourla. In his first term, Trump championed the $18 billion Operation Warp Speed program that helped the US drugmaker develop its COVID-19 vaccines. He also pushed conspiracy theories that made Bourla a target.\n\nWhen positive data on Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was released days after the 2020 election, Trump said the company had lacked the \u201ccourage\u201d to issue it earlier and suggested there was a \u201cmedical deep state\u201d aimed at aiding Joe Biden. Bourla was harassed on the Promenade in Davos a couple of years ago and at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum gathering, he took his meetings in a nondescript apartment building \u2014 the sort of anonymous location that fits the definition of security through obscurity.\n\nIf Bourla feels aggrieved, he isn\u2019t showing it. Instead, after Trump was reelected, he booked a Pfizer management meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Two days before Semafor met him in Davos, he was at Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople were thinking that because it is Trump, [who] is a little bit more controversial leader than the mainstream political leaders, we will change the way that we engage,\u201d the Greek-American doctor of veterinary medicine says. \u201cNo. We engaged with him in the first administration, and we will engage with him now.\u201d Even if he sees the other edge of Trump again, he says, \u201cI\u2019m very resilient, so I will never disengage.\u201d\n\nThe RFK Jr. factor\n\nBourla sounds similarly sanguine about Trump\u2019s pick of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be his health secretary, even though the choice of a vaccine skeptic has alarmed the pharma and biotech industry. \u201cDon\u2019t I see that Kennedy represents risks? Yes, he does,\u201d he says. But he also sees opportunity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we will come that close when it comes to vaccines, because his positions are extreme, not scientific, and he will have to fight\u2026 with the entire medical community if he tries to do any of the things that he wants. But I don\u2019t see why we wouldn\u2019t be able to work with him on developing a new Operation Warp Speed for cancer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBourla has not pitched the idea in those terms yet to Trump or Kennedy Jr., but he met both in Mar-a-Lago and thinks they are tempted by the chance to go after a target as big as cancer. \u201cThe new administration, they have a boldness. They go for it when they go, right? So the question is, how to influence the environment so that they would go for it in the right way?\u201d\n\nBiden backlash\n\nJoe Biden called Bourla \u201ca good friend\u201d in 2021, but Pfizer\u2019s CEO now says some of his former officials \u201chated business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were vicious to business. They were ideologically committed to hurt business,\u201d he says, listing how Pfizer was \u201cattacked\u201d by the terms in the Inflation Reduction Act that capped the price of certain prescriptions, and constrained from dealmaking by an \u201cunacceptably\u201d hostile antitrust regime.\n\nBourla\u2019s proposed cancer initiative echoes the \u201ccancer moonshot\u201d Biden championed as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. But with that, he says, the center of gravity was government agencies like the National Institutes of Health, and \u201cit was not NIH that did the COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump understands that business \u201chas a dynamism that can overcome mountains,\u201d Bourla says. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll put my money on you, Albert\u2019 \u2014 and that means on the private sector, not on me particularly.\u201d\n\nSuch enthusiasm for the new administration was widespread in Davos this week. Even so, Bourla does not understate the upheaval Trump represents: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that with the radical change that is coming, there will be risks and there will be opportunities. The status quo will collapse.\u201d\n\nAfter the windfall\n\nFive years from the first COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, a white-gloved aide was sanitizing the door handles in Pfizer\u2019s Davos base before its CEO walked in. The vaccines Operation Warp Speed funded when a rampant coronavirus had made such practices commonplace \u201csaved the whole world and the whole economy,\u201d Bourla says.\n\nFor a moment, he and his employees were heroes. \u201cWe received a lot of love \u2014 myself, more than I deserved,\u201d he recalls. That did not last. Nor did the market rally propelled by its windfall from vaccine sales. Pfizer\u2019s stock more than doubled between the start of the pandemic and the end of 2021, but then it began a slide that cut Pfizer\u2019s market value in half.\n\nThe sudden reversal of fortune angered investors and created \u201cvery big\u201d morale issues among employees. In those circumstances, he says, \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell people, \u2018Well, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 You need to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, because we developed a plan.\u2019\u201d\n\nBourla cut $4 billion of costs, and made a series of management and board changes, all while integrating Seagen, a $43 billion acquisition. Despite that, the activist investor Starboard took a $1 billion stake last year and accused Pfizer of destroying $20 billion of value. Starboard\u2019s salvo was clumsily launched, and Bourla quickly dismissed its vague call for him to do \u201csomething different.\u201d He says their recent meetings have been productive, but adds, \u201cI feel supported by my board, and I feel that my plan is working, so I will continue executing it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking out\n\nBourla\u2019s Davos agenda included an Anti-Defamation League event. The son of Holocaust survivors has been one of the few senior executives to speak out about the surge in antisemitism after the Hamas attack on Israel and the country\u2019s response. The ensuing war is the most sensitive of topics for corporate America, but he says there has been no fallout for the business, noting that he is careful within Pfizer to condemn all forms of hate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only a CEO, I\u2019m also a human being,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe things that I saw on October 7 were things that my mom was describing that she saw\u2026 and so that\u2019s who I am. This is who I always was, I speak my mind, and I think everybody should do it.\u201d",

(AAP/Facebook)\n\nThe article begins with the statement: \"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla accidentally admitted on live television that Covid mRNA jabs 'are quite dangerous' to humans\".\n\nHowever, the rest of the article fails to provide quotes to back up the claim in the headline and first paragraph, and no evidence is provided to support it.\n\nMr Bourla was interviewed by CNBC on January 14, the day the article was published, and the article provides a link to the interview on YouTube.\n\nIt runs for almost six minutes and covers a range of topics including Pfizer's 2025 outlook, bird flu, confidence in vaccines and obesity drugs.\n\nMr Bourla does not say in the interview that COVID jabs are dangerous.\n\nThe interview begins at the 35 seconds mark of the video. The subject is Pfizer's business strategy for 2025, following a statement by the CNBC anchor that the company's shares were down \"nearly eight per cent\".\n\nFrom the 2 mins 40 secs mark, the interview shifts to bird flu and its potential to cause a pandemic.\n\nMr Bourla doesn't say anything negative about COVID vaccines during the CNBC interview. (AP PHOTO)\n\nAt 3 mins 9 secs, CNBC anchor Brian Sullivan is introduced, and at 3 mins 25 secs he asks Mr Bourla, \"How do we reinvigorate ... confidence in vaccines generally, because we're seeing some of the COVID vaccine concerns spill over now into other vaccines\".\n\nMr Bourla responds by saying, \"I don't think that ... we have a reduction in the vaccination rates because they have concerns with the COVID vaccine.\n\n\"...They don't feel compelled to do it because they don't feel the need, because of course we have controlled COVID so far,\" he says.\n\nThe interview then shifts away from vaccines to medications to treat obesity.\n\nAt no point in the interview does Bourla suggest that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nFalse \u2013 The claim is inaccurate.\n\nAAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.

            "sentiment": null,
            "probability": null,
            "content": "TBE vaccination has had a substantial impact on the burden of TBE in Sweden, with high vaccine effectiveness after three doses for all age groups. During the five-year study period, receipt of three doses of a TBE vaccine may have averted approximately one thousand, predominately hospitalized, TBE cases. These results are consistent with other observational vaccine effectiveness studies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, and Switzerland19,20,21,22,23,24. Notably, the protective effect of TBE vaccines in Sweden is also high in children, a population at high risk of severe TBE outcomes25,26,27.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of TBE vaccines, during the study period there were 2,015 reported TBE cases (3.9/100,000 PPY) in Sweden, predominately in the unvaccinated population. Furthermore, although a substantial proportion of the population live in an area of high TBE incidence and TBE vaccination is recommended for persons living in or visiting a high TBE incidence area, we found that 52.0% of the general population was unvaccinated. These results highlight that TBE vaccine uptake in Sweden is suboptimal, even in TBE endemic areas, and suggest that low uptake is an important contributing factor to the high TBE incidence in the country. Further efforts are needed to increase TBE vaccine uptake in Sweden to prevent TBE, a potentially disabling and life-threatening disease.\n\nAn important limitation in this study is that the information gathered on TBE vaccine history from the surveillance-reported TBE cases and from the participants in the general population surveys did not determine if individuals aged \u2265 50 years who had received 4 or more doses had received the first three doses as a three doses primary series administered at months 0, 1\u20133 and 5\u201312 and the fourth dose three years later as a booster dose or whether the first four doses were received as a 4-dose primary series administered at months 0, 1, 3 and 5\u201312. Unlike other countries in Europe, and contrary to the approved FSME-Immun\u00ae label, a four dose primary series is recommended for persons \u2265 50 years-of-age in Sweden; this recommendation was first provided in 201012. Because we were unable to precisely classify the timing of the fourth dose (i.e., whether a fourth dose was part of the primary series or was a booster after a three dose primary series), we were unable to estimate the VE of receipt of four doses. The VE of receipt of three doses and receipt of four or more doses has been reported in other studies. For example, the estimated VE of 3 doses and \u2265 4 doses in persons \u2265 60 years-of-age was, respectively, 86.2% and 93.4% in Southern Germany and 99.3% and 99.1% in Latvia20.\n\nAnother limitation of this study is that the VE estimates were derived via the screening method which compared the vaccine history of patients with TBE with that of survey responders selected from the general population. Although the demographics of the survey respondents in our study matched the general population in Sweden, the potential for selection bias remains. In particular, individuals who were TBE vaccinated may have been more likely to participate in the population survey than individuals who were unvaccinated. If this occurred, the TBE vaccine uptake of the general population would be over-estimated and TBE VE would be under-estimated. Also, the TBE vaccination history could not be determined for 17.4% of survey participants and 6.2% of TBE cases; we do not know if individuals with missing vaccine histories are more or less likely to have received a TBE vaccine, and if this differs between survey participants and TBE cases. Differential recall of vaccine history by the survey participants and the TBE cases may be present since different approaches were used to ascertain the vaccine history of TBE cases and of the surveyed general population, which could result in misclassification bias. Although the direction of the selection and misclassification bias in the screening method approach is unknown, two recent studies estimated VE using both a matched case\u2013control analysis and the screening method and found lower, and thereby more conservative, VE estimates using the screening method suggesting that the bias using the screening method may be towards the null resulting in lower VE estimates21,25. Determining the effectiveness of TBE vaccines in Sweden would be greatly facilitated, as suggested by others28, by establishing a national vaccine registry which would enable VE estimation via retrospective cohort analysis and reduce the likelihood of selection and misclassification bias.\n\nThere are also limitations, including inherent uncertainties, in our approach for estimating the number of TBE cases averted by TBE vaccination and estimating the number of TBE cases that would be averted under the counterfactual scenario where everyone was TBE vaccinated. For these reasons, estimates on the number of TBE cases averted should be interpreted with caution. Finally, our study was unable to estimate product-specific vaccine effectiveness for FSME-IMMUN\u00ae and for Encepur\u00ae. However, during the study period, approximately 69% of TBE vaccine doses sold in Sweden were FSME-IMMUN\u00ae (Pfizer, internal data, September 2024) suggesting that much of the effectiveness against TBE demonstrated in this study can be attributed to FSME-IMMUN\u00ae.\n\nThis first published study of TBE VE in Sweden showed that TBE vaccination was effective for the prevention of TBE cases which predominately resulted in hospitalization. Furthermore, the effectiveness of TBE vaccination in children, an age group with increasing TBE disease burden, was demonstrated. Vaccination averted hundreds of TBE cases despite the relatively low TBE vaccine uptake and compliance. To prevent additional TBE cases in Sweden, enhanced efforts to increase TBE vaccine uptake are needed.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against Prem Watsa's other long-term stock picks.\n\nPrem Watsa is a Canadian billionaire, entrepreneur, and investor often referred to as the Canadian Warren Buffett for his value-based investment approach and long-term focus. As the founder, chairman, and CEO of Fairfax Financial Holdings, Watsa has built a reputation for transforming his company into one of the leading insurance and investment firms in the world. His ability to identify undervalued opportunities and navigate financial crises has cemented his place as one of the most respected figures in global finance. Watsa was born in India in 1950 to a middle-class family. He earned a degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, one of India\u2019s premier institutions. In 1972, Watsa immigrated to Canada to pursue an MBA at the University of Western Ontario\u2019s Richard Ivey School of Business.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAfter completing his MBA, Watsa began his career in the insurance industry, where he gained valuable experience that would later shape his business philosophy and success. In 1985, Watsa acquired control of Markel Financial, a struggling Canadian insurance company. He renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings, short for Fair and Friendly Acquisitions, and set out to implement his vision of combining insurance underwriting with value-oriented investing. Fairfax operates as a holding company, similar to Berkshire Hathaway, with investments spanning insurance, reinsurance, and other businesses. Under Watsa's leadership, Fairfax has grown exponentially.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Fairfax manages over $1 billion in 13F securities. The company has delivered a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15% in book value per share since its founding. Prem Watsa is a staunch proponent of value investing, inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His strategy involves identifying undervalued assets, particularly during times of market distress, and holding them for the long term. Watsa has been a strong advocate of investing in India, acquiring stakes in companies like Thomas Cook India and launching the Fairfax India fund to capitalize on the country\u2019s growth. Watsa famously anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, using derivatives to protect Fairfax\u2019s portfolio and earning over $2 billion in profits during the crash.",

            "content": "Neil Kumar has for years contended his unorthodox drug company is overlooked by biotechnology investors. He may not have that problem for much longer.\n\nThe company he leads, BridgeBio Pharma, is in the early stages of launching a treatment for a heart condition called transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. Though the drug, Attruby, isn\u2019t BridgeBio\u2019s only approved product, it has the largest financial upside.\n\nGlobal sales of the other marketed therapy for the condition, Pfizer\u2019s tafamidis, were on track to eclipse $5 billion last year, reflecting a market that analysts forecast could eventually be worth $15 billion to $20 billion annually.\n\nBridgeBio is trying to make the case Attruby, which similarly stabilizes a misshapen protein, is more potent. The two drugs haven\u2019t been directly tested against each other, however.\n\nBridgeBio could also soon have as a third competitor Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which has different type of therapy under review by U.S. regulators. Both Pfizer and Alnylam have larger salesforces and more established commercial track records than BridgeBio \u2014 one reason why investor expectations are \u201cfar lower\u201d for BridgeBio\u2019s drug, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Josh Schimmer wrote last year.\n\nThat skepticism is reflected in BridgeBio\u2019s stock price, which is worth less now than it was one year ago. The company\u2019s valuation, Kumar told BioPharma Dive in November, implies a pessimistic outlook in which Attruby is \u201cthe worst second-mover launch of all time.\u201d\n\nKumar is used to such doubts. BridgeBio\u2019s structure, as a centralized \u2018hub\u2019 with a web of biotech \u2018spokes,\u2019 is meant to be a more cost-effective way of making drugs, but isn\u2019t generally popular with public investors. Attruby, which for a time was under the ownership of a spoke called Eidos Therapeutics, is an example of how BridgeBio\u2019s system can work: It was developed for lower cost than what\u2019s typical in the industry, according to Kumar.\n\nBut along the way, BridgeBio\u2019s value slumped, the public markets turned against biotech and investors zeroed in on companies they thought most likely to get bought, he said.\n\n\u201cThe whole problem with biotech is it's such a long ecosystem. I've been working on that goddamn drug for ten-and-a-half years, and I'm just starting to launch it,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cIt's an amazing journey, but most people do not want that.\u201d\n\nKumar says the company is finally on the verge of a breakout. Early prescription numbers revealed at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week suggested Attruby\u2019s launch could beat Wall Street\u2019s projections and lifted shares by nearly 30%. The company is also expecting Phase 3 readouts over the next year or so that could put it on a \u201cpath to profitability in the next several years,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Mani Foroohar wrote last week.\n\nKumar spoke with BioPharma Dive about BridgeBio\u2019s battles for investor support and its plan to win market share. The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nBIOPHARMA DIVE: There\u2019s been debate about the merits of \u2018hub-and-spoke\u2019 biotech. Why lean into that model when public investors, at least so far, haven\u2019t rewarded you for it?\n\nNEIL KUMAR: We employ it for three reasons. One is we like to focus at the level of biology for each disease. Another is we want to marry that with the fact most things fail in our industry. We wanted diversification at the central level so we could shut down what wasn't working and focus on what was. And lastly we wanted the efficiencies that come from having a centralized backbone.\n\nWhy is it difficult to convince investors of that value?\n\nKUMAR: Only two types of value get rewarded by investors. One is, \u2018I think you\u2019re going to get bought.\u2019 For the last three years, all investors have generated alpha from is betting on companies that get bought, so they want to be in spaces where M&A is going to happen. They don't really want to create the next big company. They just want to create the asset that gets bought.\n\nThe other is owning recurring revenue, which means you have a drug that\u2019s running off revenue. But even if you do have a drug product, they want you to be a single-asset company, because then you can easily get bought.\n\nThe hub-and-spoke model becomes very difficult to explain to those people. Or they just don't want to invest in it because they're not interested in investing in you as an allocator of capital. They're like, \u2018I can do that myself.\u2019\n\nWhat could change investor views?\n\nKUMAR: We could turn the corner because this market has been so difficult. At some point, someone is going to say there has to be a [profitable] way to do it. At some point, someone has to care I progressed Eidos all the way through Phase 2 for less than $60 million. If I were in a venture capital-backed company, it would\u2019ve cost hundreds of millions of dollars. If I were in pharma, it would\u2019ve cost even more.\n\nKey to BridgeBio\u2019s success is Attruby. What gives you confidence it can compete against one similar, already-established product and another that could be on the way this year?\n\nKUMAR: On the clinical side, it's continuing to talk about the messages that are on [Attruby\u2019s] label. As early as three months, we see an impact on a combination of hospitalization and death. I haven't seen that elsewhere. We have a 42% reduction on that endpoint at 30 months and a 50% reduction in hospitalization at 30 months. Hospitalizations are most of the events in these trials. The fact that we're keeping people out of the hospital in that profound way means people are living longer and living better. And we are a more potent stabilizer [than tafamidis].\n\nWe\u2019re also doing more clinical experiments than almost anyone else to continue to elaborate on, \u2018Okay, how do we treat the [atrial fibrillation] population? What do we do for renal disease?\u2019\n\nOn the access side, we priced at a slight discount to tafamidis. Alnylam\u2019s [drug] is double the cost of tafamidis. So not only do we believe we have the most effective drug, we also have a drug that has the lowest list price.\n\nBut list price isn\u2019t the game in America, it's a lot of other stuff too. We designed everything about our distribution network to lower the bar for people to get on this drug should they want to. We're a small company. We're totally focused on this.\n\nWhat did you learn from Pfizer\u2019s launch?\n\nKUMAR: They\u2019ve had a killer launch. They do $6 billion in sales. They've done a nice job educating the community. But there are opportunities we hear from patients and physicians to do even better. I think as we do that, Pfizer will catch up, prices drop and everyone does better. That's how markets are supposed to work, and the beneficiary, ultimately, should be the patients.\n\nWhat will you be watching should Alnylam\u2019s drug get approved?\n\nKUMAR: How early are they having an impact on hospitalizations and mortality? What's the degree of impact they're having at 30 months? And what do they look like on hospitalizations and the hospitalization data that they haven't published?\n\nThe silence on their hospitalization data is deafening. Where is it? People care a lot about hospitalizations. There are very expensive payer systems, and it\u2019s one of the largest forms of morbidity associated with this disease.",

            "content": "In 2022, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PFE 0.47%) became the first healthcare company to generate $100 billion in annual sales. But since that notable achievement, its financial results have fallen off a cliff, as has its stock price. Pfizer has made progress, especially on the clinical and regulatory fronts, through acquisitions and internally developed programs. But nothing has stopped the bleeding -- yet.\n\nCould 2025 be different? Let's see whether the drugmaker can finally turn things around this year.\n\nWill financial results be a catalyst?\n\nPfizer's woes started because it couldn't keep delivering the kinds of financial results it did during the earlier pandemic years, or even anything close to that. If the drugmaker can at least consistently grow its revenue and earnings at a good clip, that might lead more investors to buy the stock at current levels.\n\nIt's made some improvements along those lines this year. In the second and third quarters, after not doing so for several periods in a row, the company's top line moved in the right direction:\n\nHowever, Pfizer's revenue guidance for 2025 doesn't look particularly exciting. The company expects its top line to come in between $61 billion and $64 billion -- the same projection it made for the full fiscal year 2024. In other words, 2025 revenue will stay more or less flat compared to 2024, based on the company's own guidance.\n\nThe good news is that Pfizer is projecting its adjusted earnings per share for 2025 to be in the range of $2.80 to $3, growing between 10% and 18% compared to 2024. Still, based on its guidance, those financial results won't help the stock rise significantly this year unless Pfizer meaningfully beats its projections. And if it fails to live up to them, the share price will drop even more.\n\nLooking at potential pipeline progress\n\nClinical and regulatory progress can jolt a drugmaker's stock price. That hasn't exactly happened for Pfizer in the past couple of years, despite the many approvals it won, because none of its new products will generate life-changing sales. Could that change in 2025?\n\nIf it does, it might be because of Pfizer's work in the weight loss market. The drugmaker is developing danuglipron, a potential once-daily oral weight management medicine. Danuglipron is currently in phase 1 studies (previous versions of the drug went as far as phase 2 trials), and Pfizer could report data this year.\n\nIf the investigational therapy does well -- even in just a phase 1 study -- it could positively affect Pfizer's stock performance, since the anti-obesity market is currently the hottest in the pharmaceutical industry. The current leading treatments in the weight management market are administered via weekly injections. There is a demand for oral options, something many drugmakers are working on.\n\nCould Pfizer make enough headway along those lines in 2025 to jolt its share price? It's hard to predict these things, but it's worth noting that many other drugmakers are also working on potential oral drugs for weight management. Pfizer has a variety of other pipeline candidates, especially in oncology, but investors might not react as positively to progress on these other fronts, since the anti-obesity market looks especially attractive and is growing incredibly fast right now.\n\nThe more important question\n\nPfizer might not perform particularly well this year. Its financial results likely won't be outstanding, and there's no guarantee that its more promising pipeline candidates will deliver the kinds of results investors want to see.\n\nThat said, the company has been hard at work, slowly but surely setting up a foundation for the future. Eventually, its pipeline progress will likely pan out, especially in oncology. It will be able to replace older products whose sales aren't growing as fast as they once were. It should also decrease its exposure to the coronavirus market, which, though still contributing meaningfully to its top line, can be somewhat inconsistent.\n\nLastly, Pfizer is a strong dividend stock. It offers a forward yield of around 6.5% -- compared to the S&P 500's average of 1.3% -- and has grown its payouts by 53.6% in the past decade.\n\nPfizer hasn't been attractive to growth-oriented investors, or to those with a short investing time horizon. But those looking for blue-chip dividend payers to buy and hold for five years or more should seriously consider investing in the stock.",

Beginning in 2011, private actions were filed alleging that Pfizer and Ranbaxy conspired by entering into an anticompetitive agreement to delay the release of Ranbaxy\u2019s cheaper and generic version of Lipitor in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. These private actions were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation (MDL) before the U.S. District Court of New Jersey. Pfizer announced a global $93 million settlement of this litigation in February 2024.\n\nIn 2013, the West Virginia AG filed an action in the Circuit Court of Mason County, WV, against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, asserting claims substantially similar to the claims asserted in the private actions. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged violations arising under the West Virginia Antitrust Act and the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. The AG retained outside counsel on a contingency fee basis to prosecute the action.\n\nAfter more than a decade of litigation, on December 12, 2024, the Circuit Court of Mason County approved the parties\u2019 settlement, which included the following terms:\n\nMonetary payment to the state: Pfizer: $8.75 million Ranbaxy: $8.25 million\n\nMonetary payment to outside counsel: Pfizer: $2,187,500 plus reasonable expenses Ranbaxy: $1,612,500\n\n\n\nOn January 10, Morrisey announced the share each county and city within West Virginia would be entitled to receive from the reimbursements obtained from Pfizer and Ranbaxy. The quantities per county and city differ based on population size. The cities will receive a total of $1,855,000, and the counties will be receiving a total of $1,630,000.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s lawsuit follows state AG\u2019s traditional playbook of keeping an eye on private litigation brought against pharmaceutical companies, determining whether litigation is warranted, and, if so, filing their own litigation in a favorable home state forum. In complex litigation such as this matter, and especially in states like West Virginia that have limited attorneys in the state AG\u2019s office responsible for filing actions under state consumer protection and antitrust laws, outside counsel is often retained on a contingency fee basis to prosecute these cases. Accordingly, if a company\u2019s practices are subject to private litigation, especially before an MDL, the company should establish a proactive strategy to prepare for and respond to state AG inquiries.",

Then the balloon popped and the business contracted, sending investors running for the exits. Pfizer has become an interesting case of a well-known stock offering an outsized dividend yield.\n\nIs this a classic yield trap -- an abnormally high yield with poor business fundamentals lurking beneath the surface? Or could it be a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity?\n\nHere is whether Pfizer stock might be a buy today -- and why.\n\nPfizer's pandemic boom (and bust) shouldn't haunt the stock much longer\n\nDividend investors will focus on Pfizer's current dividend yield of 6.3%. The stock has offered high yields before, averaging about 4% over the past decade. However, the current yield is significantly higher than usual, a classic warning sign that investors sense trouble within the business. Are those fears warranted?\n\nPfizer benefited from the pandemic. Sales of its COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) and treatment (Paxlovid) totaled over $56 billion in 2022, over half of the company's revenue that year. However, those pandemic-related sales have mostly dried up at this point. Excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer grew revenue by 14% year over year in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nYou can see below that Pfizer's trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue and earnings per share (EPS) have seemingly bottomed as non-COVID growth begins to drive the bus again:\n\nThe market hasn't responded much to this pivot yet, but it could be just a matter of time. Stock prices can be irrational in the short term, but tend to follow earnings eventually.\n\nGrowing earnings fuel this dividend\n\nPfizer's high dividend yield may have caught your attention, especially if you're a dividend investor. Although the market's pessimism has elevated this yield to its highest level since 2008-2009, the financials backing it remain rock-solid.\n\nManagement has done nothing but reiterate its commitment to the dividend, both verbally in earnings calls and through its actions. In December, Pfizer raised the quarterly dividend by a penny. It's not a huge increase, but you get that massive starting yield.\n\nMore importantly, Pfizer can afford the increase. The annual dividend is now $1.72 per share, just 60% of the company's final 2024 earnings guidance. With the wheels of growth beginning to turn again, that dividend seems like a safe bet to continue paying and growing.\n\nPfizer spent a significant portion of its pandemic windfall on a $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, a biotech company specializing in oncology. The new-look Pfizer has bet heavily on oncology for future growth, with 2030 goals to add several new blockbuster drugs to its portfolio, shift most of its business to biologics (drugs derived from living cells), and double its treated patient base.\n\nAnalysts estimate that Pfizer's efforts will lead to annualized long-term earnings growth of approximately 8%, which is plenty to support future dividend raises.\n\nThis is a rare high-yield stock with capital gains upside\n\nPfizer is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies. It's been around for generations. While I wouldn't call it a growth stock, it could have market-beating potential at these prices. The stock trades at only 9 times earnings, a bargain for a business expected to grow by 8% annually. That's a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of about 1.1, low enough that Pfizer stock should have a relatively low floor even if the business ultimately falls short on growth.\n\nThe market has valued Pfizer as a company that has low-single-digit earnings growth, but it's far more than that -- it provides an easy 6% return from the dividend alone. Investors usually buy a stock for a specific purpose: Growth stocks typically offer greater share-price appreciation, while high-yield dividend stocks offer investment income. But occasionally, funny things happen in the market, and a stock provides both.\n\nPfizer appears to fall into that opportunistic category. That makes the stock a buy for any investor looking for reliable dividend income, or just a good deal today.",

            "content": "Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management's confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\n\"From a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that's partially because of the relative underperformance that they've had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they're becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won't rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:PFE)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 20: 20.01%\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global pharmaceutical company that mainly manufactures, markets, and sells related products worldwide. Leveraging its pandemic profits, the company acquired Seagen for $43 billion in late 2023 to strengthen its oncology pipeline. The company is likely to keep seeking acquisitions of promising pharmaceutical firms to further enhance its pipeline. This approach is proving effective, with management projecting earnings growth of 10% to 18% for 2025. Analysts anticipate the company\u2019s earnings to grow by approximately 14% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) attracted significant investor attention in 2020 by being the first to launch a COVID-19 vaccine in the US, outpacing Moderna. Beyond its vaccine, the company\u2019s diverse product lineup includes treatments for autoimmune conditions, cancer, migraines, and more. Analysts suggested that the company's growth potential might be underestimated. It has heavily invested in research and development and made strategic acquisitions, enhancing its portfolio with key products such as the RSV vaccine Abrysvo, the migraine treatment Nurtec ODT, and cancer therapies Adcetris and Padcev.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported revenue of $17.7 billion, reflecting a substantial 32% increase compared to the same period the previous year. The company effectively addressed the heightened demand for Paxlovid during the recent rise in COVID-19 cases.\n\nParnassus Investments highlighted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer\u2019s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us. The company completed its acquisition of Seagen, which should strengthen Pfizer\u2019s pipeline in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Pfizer also offers an attractive dividend yield.\u201d\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a strong dividend payer as the company holds a 15-year streak of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.5%, as of January 20.\n\nAs of the end of Q3 2024, 80 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3 billion.\n\nOverall PFE ranks 6th on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(Source: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (fda.gov))\n\nQ: How did the FDA arrive at the decision to approve COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA)? What is\n\ndifferent now when compared to the December 2020 authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?\n\nA: FDA conducted a thorough evaluation of the data and information submitted in the Biologics License Application (BLA) for COMIRNATY before making a determination that the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. (Source: Q&A for COMIRNATY(COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA) | FDA)\n\nQ: How is COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) related to the PFIZER-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine?\n\nA: They are the same. The FDA-approved Pfizer-BioNTech product COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under EUA have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID-19 vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. Therefore, providers can use doses distributed under EUA to administer the vaccination series as if the doses were the licensed vaccine. For purposes of administration, doses distributed under the EUA are interchangeable with the licensed doses. The Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers provides additional information about both the approved and authorized vaccine. (Source: Q&A for COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine mRNA) | FDA)\n\nQ: Will the emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine remain in effect\n\nafter the approval?\n\nA: Yes. The EUA remains in effect for the two dose primary series in individuals 12 years of and older and as a third primary dose for individuals 12 years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. Additionally, the FDA authorized the vaccine for emergency use to allow for a single booster dose administered at least 6 months after completion of the vaccination primary series in certain populations. (Source: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/qa-comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-mrna)\n\nQ. If I received one manufacturer for Dose 1, can I receive a different manufacturer for Dose 2 and be considered complete? Ex: Dose 1 was Moderna, but can Dose 2 be Pfizer/COMIRNATY?\n\nA. Yes, Mixing the vaccines will result in a completed/compliant series. It is recommended to make EVERY EFFORT to immunize the patient with the same product, when giving a series. There is little to no safety data to support the use of mixed series. It is in the patient\u2019s interest to receive a single manufacturer for their vaccination series to ensure the best response (as has been studied to date). A VAERS report should be completed if a mixed series is performed for any reason. Reference the following website for the latest information as recommendations have been changing with each CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid- 19-vaccines us.html. The following is a useful poster on deviations: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/covid19-vaccine-errors-deviations- poster.pdf\n\nQ. Are the COVID-19 vaccines rigorously tested?\n\nA. Yes. Clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in tens of thousands of study participants to generate the scientific data and other information needed by FDA to determine safety and effectiveness. These clinical trials are being conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by the FDA. (Source: Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. How is it that COVID-19 vaccines have been developed so quickly?\n\nA. In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. Efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety. Recognizing the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines, the FDA is utilizing its various authorities and expertise to facilitate the expeditious development and availability of vaccines that have met the agency\u2019s rigorous and science-based standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness. Early in a public health crisis, FDA provides clear communication to the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to the scientific data and information needed to ensure development of vaccines and works quickly to provide advice on their proposed development plans and assessment of the data that are generated.\n\n(Source: Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. What are the plans for continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines authorized by FDA for emergency\n\nuse?\n\nA. FDA expects vaccine manufacturers to include in their EUA requests a plan for active follow-up for safety, including deaths, hospitalizations, and other serious or clinically significant adverse events, among individuals who receive the vaccine under an EUA, to inform ongoing benefit-risk determinations to support continuation of the EUA. FDA also expects manufacturers who receive an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue licensure (approval). Post-authorization vaccine safety monitoring is a federal government responsibility shared primarily by FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other agencies involved in healthcare delivery. The U.S. government \u2013 in partnership with health systems, academic centers, and private sector partners \u2013 will use multiple existing vaccine safety monitoring systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines in the post-authorization/approval period. Some of these systems are the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative, and Medicare claims data. (Source: Emergency Use Authorization for\n\nVaccines Explained | FDA)\n\nQ. What is V-safe and how do I participate in it?\n\nA. V-safe is a smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Through v-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Depending on your answers to the web surveys, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information. V-safe will also remind you to get your second COVID-19 vaccine dose if you need one. Once you get a COVID-19\n\nvaccine, you can enroll in v-safe using your smartphone. Your healthcare provider will give you an information sheet on v-safe that explains how to register and get started. V-safe is free to use \u2014 you will need a smartphone with a modern browser and access to the internet to participate. Participation is voluntary and you can opt out at any time. To opt out, simply text \u201cSTOP\u201d when v-safe sends you a text message. You can also start v-safe again by texting \u201cSTART.\u201d Note: V-safe cannot schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments, nor serve as an official record of being vaccinated against COVID-19. You will receive a COVID-19 vaccination card at your vaccination appointment. V-safe does not provide medical advice. If you have symptoms or health problems that concern you at any time following COVID-19 vaccination, please contact your healthcare provider. (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html)\n\nQ. How do we know the vaccine is safe given the speed of vaccine development and rollout?\n\nA. Key Points about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC:\n\n\u2022 Millions of people in the United States and around the world have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\n\n\u2022 The United States is using established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.\n\n\u2022 Results from U.S. and global monitoring efforts are reassuring. No unexpected patterns of reactions or other safety concerns have been identified during early vaccine safety monitoring. And, if they show up, we have systems in place to quickly identify them and take action.\n\n\u2022 All of the currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines, have been carefully reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA is responsible for reviewing all safety data from clinical trials to determine if the expected benefits of vaccination outweigh potential risks.\n\n\u2022 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed all safety data before recommending the current COVID-19 vaccines for use.\n\n(Source: Answering Patients\u2019 Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination | CDC)\n\nQ. If I experience medical complications from the COVID-19 vaccine, will the VA cover it?\n\nA. If the vaccine caused a chronic disability in active service, the VA would consider that under the general principles for service connection. Whether the vaccine is only approved for emergency-use is not a factor the VA would consider. (Source: VA SME)\n\nQ. Can I get multiple vaccines in one visit to the doctor?\n\nA. The COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines may be administered on the same day with exception of the live smallpox vaccine. (Source, CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/adolescent-easyread.html) Per the updated 7 Oct 2021 Assistant Secretary of Defense Health Affairs Co-Administration Guidance memo, the available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccine products (i.e., Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY\u00ae) vaccines) may be co-administered with other vaccines without regard to timing, with the exception of the live smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000\u2122). Members should always check with their provider on which tests they can get before, during or after an appointment for COVID-19 vaccination. The TB test is authorized before, during or after a COVID-19 vaccination appointment.",

The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

The missives you send are always inspiring\u2026.\n\nA Belgian court dismissed a lawsuit against European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen centered on text messages she exchanged with the Pfizer chief executive officer during negotiations for Covid shots, Agence France-Presse reports. A source close to the case confirmed that the appeals court \u201cdeclared inadmissible\u201d a set of complaints brought in 2023 by Belgian former lobbyist Frederic Baldan, as he could not prove suffering \u201cpersonal harm.\u201d The court \u201cfound the complainants wrong across the board,\u201d von der Leyen\u2019s lawyer Adrien Masset told AFP. The EU moved swiftly after the Covid pandemic emerged in 2020 to secure vaccines for member countries to buy for their citizens and residents, but many aspects of the procurement from Pfizer have been kept confidential, leading to claims of a lack of transparency and several legal proceedings. Last year Baldan, who argued that von der Leyen both overstepped her role and violated the European Commission code of conduct, lost a similar lawsuit in Brussels. Another complaint filed by The New York Times against the commission for failing to release the texts despite a freedom of information request is being heard by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new class of drugs may be emerging to challenge the dominance of the first generation checkpoint inhibitors, such as Merck\u2019s Keytruda, which has been used to combat dozens of different cancers in millions of patients, making it the top-selling drug in the world, STAT explains. Experts say a certain type of bispecific antibody seems to have hit upon a crucial combination of two cancer targets: the proteins VEGF and either PD-1 or PD-L1. There has been a surge of interest in these compounds from biotech and pharma in the last few months, spurred on most by the presentation of promising clinical data from Summit Therapeutics. In September, the company presented data showing its PD-1 and VEGF bispecific outperformed Keytruda in a Phase 3 clinical trial in advanced lung cancer patients.

            "content": "Nobody could have predicted the vogue for GLP-1 drugs to promote weight loss. In the US alone, the number of patients starting GLP-1 treatments for nondiabetic purposes has increased by 700% since 2019, highlighting the popularity of these drugs beyond their original aim of treating Type 2 diabetes.\n\nYet the soaring enthusiasm for so-called glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, first approved in 2005, overshadows an array of risks related to their off-label use. These include important environmental, social, and governance risks that investors must evaluate carefully since the environment is rapidly evolving. We talk about them below, but examples include:\n\nOff-label marketing risk\n\nSafety\n\nAffordability\n\nWe\u2019ll also show how to screen through the GLP-1 drug companies. When combining insights from Morningstar Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings and Morningstar Equity Research (depicted in Exhibit 1), we find that Pfizer PFE and Roche RHHBY stand out as potential top choices for investors among current and potential future market entrants.\n\nGLP-1 Drugs: Demand Surges in a Long-Established Market\n\nThe market for GLP-1 drugs is projected to exceed $200 billion in annual sales by 2031, according to Morningstar Equity Research. Current market leaders include Novo Nordisk NVO and Eli Lilly LLY with treatments such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound addressing both diabetes and obesity.\n\nStill, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are unlikely to have the obesity space to themselves for long. According to Morningstar Equity Research, several other players, including Pfizer, Roche, Amgen AMGN, AstraZeneca AZN, Zealand Pharma ZLDPF, Structure Therapeutics GPCR, and Altimmune ALT, are expected to join the GLP-1 space, with multiple drug launches expected between 2027 and 2032.\n\nAmong the key players set to enter the GLP-1 space, Pfizer has two products in phase 1 trials, whereas Roche has four products in the pipeline, with two products in phase 2 trials. Both companies could launch their first GLP-1 products as early as 2028, potentially making them strong competitors to current market leaders, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nAll That Glitters Is Not Gold: Issues and Risks Around GLP-1 Medications\n\nThe effectiveness of GLP-1 medications in promoting weight loss has led to a surge in off-label demand, particularly for cosmetic weight-loss purposes. This off-label use introduces several ESG-related issues, both for patients and the companies marketing these drugs. An ESG approach allows more in-depth research into risks that aren\u2019t captured by traditional financial analysis.\n\nOff-Label Marketing Risk\n\nManufacturers of GLP-1 medications may face regulatory scrutiny and legal risks if they promote their products for off-label use or disseminate inaccurate and misleading information. That raises substantial concerns for these companies and their investors. Such practices could trigger investigations into their promotional activities or legal action from consumers, sparking lengthy legal proceedings and operational disruptions. All these could pose significant financial burdens on the companies involved.\n\nSafety Concerns and Liability Issues for GLP-1 Drugs\n\nGLP-1 medications, like all other pharmaceuticals, carry safety challenges, including the risk of adverse side effects. Chronic use of any medication can increase the likelihood of adverse side effects due to prolonged exposure. While patients living with chronic life-threatening conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, may accept these risks, people using GLP-1 drugs for less life-threatening and severe purposes may be less forgiving if the side effects outweigh the perceived benefits.\n\nConsequently, people using GLP-1 medications for weight loss may litigate more readily over unanticipated or adverse side effects. This exposes manufacturers to potentially heightened liability risks, particularly in the US, where a litigious culture increases the risk and financial impact of legal challenges.\n\nAccess, Affordability, and Pricing Risks for GLP-1 Medications\n\nPerceived excessive and unjustified price increases, as well as regional cost disparities, have sparked public debate and criticism over companies\u2019 pricing strategies for their GLP-1 medications. That creates significant regulatory risks for companies. For instance, at the start of 2024, the US list prices of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) and Mounjaro (Eli Lilly) increased by 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, bringing their monthly cost to $979 and $1,069.\n\nThese price hikes are part of a broader conversation surrounding the cost disparities between the US and other regions. A congressional hearing in September 2024 raised concerns over the stark price differences between the US and the European Union for similar medications. For example, Ozempic is priced at approximately $1,000 per month in the US, versus around \u20ac89 in Germany.\n\nPricing is intensifying public debate and scrutiny surrounding these medications. That\u2019s likely to grow. Morningstar Equity Research predicts that Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy will be subject to Medicare price negotiations (as part of the Inflation Reduction Act) starting in 2027.\n\nHow to Screen GLP-1 Drug Manufacturers\n\nWhich current and future GLP-1 manufacturers may be best positioned to navigate these risks? One helpful tool is Morningstar Sustainalytics\u2019 ESG Risk Rating, which offers valuable insights into companies\u2019 exposure to material ESG issues and evaluates their strategies to address such risks. By combining this information with Morningstar Equity Research\u2019s fair value estimate, which compares a company\u2019s current market price to its estimated intrinsic value, investors can identify opportunities that align with both financial and ESG objectives.\n\nAs for companies entering the GLP-1 space, investors should look at the material ESG issues of Product Governance, which assesses how companies ensure the safety and quality of their products as well as market their products according to their label, and Access to Basic Services, which focuses on how companies make their products accessible and affordable.\n\nNotes: Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics Inc., and Zealand Pharma A/S are assigned Morningstar Quantitative Moat Ratings, with all companies rated \u2605\u2605\u2605. For the ESG Risk Rating, Altimmune, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, and Zealand Pharma A/S hold Morningstar Sustainalytics Core Ratings, with scores of 37.1, 26.5, and 26.7, respectively. Structure Therapeutics Inc. is not currently rated by Sustainalytics. Source: Morningstar Direct & Morningstar Sustainalytics, Ordered by star rating\n\nCombining insights from the ESG Risk Rating and Morningstar Equity Research, we find that Pfizer and Roche stand out as potential top choices among the companies either currently in the GLP-1 space or those poised to enter.\n\nBoth are rated 5 stars by Morningstar Equity Research and show strong management of key ESG issues, namely Product Governance and Access to Basic Services. These strengths position them well to navigate the complexities of the GLP-1 space while addressing associated ESG risks.\n\nMeanwhile, current market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly appear to present higher levels of unmanaged ESG risks. Novo Nordisk displays average management of Product Governance risks, and both companies showcase average management of Access to Basic Services. Further, both firms are trading at less attractive 3-star and 2-star valuation levels compared with Pfizer and Roche, given potential headwinds such as insurance difficulties, pricing pressures, and new competition.\n\nNevertheless, Pfizer\u2019s and Roche\u2019s success within the GLP-1 space will depend on many factors, including the outcomes of clinical trials, advancements in drug pipelines, demonstrated efficacy and safety of their candidates, and effective strategies for commercialization and market access.\n\nGLP-1 Drugmakers: Looking Into the Future\n\nAs the GLP-1 market matures, ESG risks could decline. Here\u2019s why. Beginning in 2027, GLP-1 prices could fall 10%-15% a year on average, mirroring trends observed in other drugs, according to Morningstar Equity Research These price declines reflect heightened competition and regulatory pressures. In turn, these stresses might address concerns about access and affordability. Similarly, enhanced safety profiles, such as potentially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, for the next generation of GLP-1 drugs could lessen patient liability risks.\n\nSuch developments will require investors to further navigate the current and future landscapes of ESG risks for GLP-1 medications.\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been investors\u2019 favorites for a long time now. Over the years, these equities have performed better than the broader market. That said, when it comes to dividend investing, opinions often split down the middle between those seeking high yields and those favoring dividend growth. Though analysts recommend buying stocks with proven tracks of dividend growth, the appeal of high yields is hard to ignore. According to analysts, investors should steer clear of yield traps and focus on companies that consistently increase the value returned to shareholders. However, those advocating yields have plenty to say about the significance of dividend yields.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nOne such example is a report published by Newton Investment Management. According to the report, high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods between 1940 and 2021. The report also revealed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividends in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios surpassed low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While this result provides useful information, it doesn\u2019t offer details about the market conditions at the time, giving only a broad picture of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have paid close attention to how dividend stocks perform during market volatility, as the need for consistent income becomes more pronounced in such times. As a result, they suggest considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also have a strong history of dividend growth.\n\nDan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, made the following comment about extremely high yields in the firm\u2019s recent report:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps\u2014companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.\u201d\n\nThat said, high yields aren\u2019t automatically a bad sign. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks, as it shows how much income an investor can expect relative to the stock's price. However, to fully benefit from high yields, other factors like the company\u2019s cash flow, payout ratio, and dividend growth must also be considered. If these metrics are strong, high-yield stocks can still be appealing. Some reports have pointed out the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields increase, returns generally rise, and risk decreases. Hartford Funds conducted research factoring in annualized standard deviation, which measures a portfolio\u2019s return volatility, with a higher standard deviation indicating greater historical risk. The report found that from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios delivered an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively.",

            "content": "You've probably heard this before: Pharmaceutical stocks can bring an element of safety to your portfolio. Why is this the case? These companies make drugs doctors and patients rely on -- and that means no matter what the economy is doing, doctors will continue prescribing and patients will continue buying these treatments. All of this equals a rather steady stream of revenue for a pharma company, and this could translate into positive stock price performance over time.\n\nSales of these drugs also have helped put many pharma companies in position to reward shareholders through dividend payments. So, pharma stocks could offer a secure revenue stream and the potential for passive income.\n\nAnd you don't need deep pockets to invest in these players. In fact, with $500 or even less, you can get in on the following two big pharma companies that make great stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie's (ABBV 0.10%) blockbuster immunology drug Humira brought in more than $21 billion at its peak in 2022 -- but as rivals entered the market in recent times, the product's sales have been on the decline. The good news is that AbbVie prepared well for the loss of exclusivity and has other products that could keep the company's growth going over the long term.\n\nIn immunology, AbbVie has paved the path for two other drugs -- Rinvoq and Skyrizi -- to together surpass Humira's peak sales. And they're on the way to doing so, as their sales have soared in the double digits from quarter to quarter. In the latest period, Rinvoq and Skyrizi sales rose 45% to $1.6 billion and 50% to $3.2 billion, respectively.\n\nAbbVie also has an impressive neuroscience portfolio, including products such as Botox for migraine and Vraylar for bipolar disorder, and the company recently completed the acquisition of Cerevel to further boost the product lineup.\n\nIn the recent quarter, AbbVie reported sales that were more than $200 million higher than expected -- and the company increased its full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance for the third time this year. Finally, you're likely to benefit from dividend growth here, thanks to AbbVie's status as a Dividend King.\n\nAll this means there's reason to be optimistic that, even as Humira's revenue declines, AbbVie is transitioning into a whole new period of growth.\n\n2. Pfizer\n\nPfizer (PFE 0.47%) stock took off in the early days of the pandemic as it launched the world's first coronavirus vaccine and brought in blockbuster revenue. This product and Pfizer's coronavirus treatment even helped the company to reach more than $100 billion in annual revenue, its highest ever.\n\nBut in more recent times, declining demand for coronavirus products have weighed on Pfizer's revenue and on the stock price. On top of this, some of Pfizer's top drugs are set to lose exclusivity this decade.\n\nAll this has left the shares trading at the dirt cheap level of 8x forward earnings estimates. Why are they a bargain at this price? It's important to remember that, though Pfizer's coronavirus platform drove revenue in recent years, the company has since shifted to other products that could compensate for the decline in older ones and boost revenue down the road.\n\nPfizer has launched several new products over the past year or so -- completing its biggest period of product launches ever -- and is betting its acquisition of cancer specialist Seagen will help it meet big goals in this area.\n\nThe situation looks promising so far. In the first half of the year, Pfizer was the No. 3 U.S. oncology company by revenue -- and in the recent quarter, Pfizer's oncology portfolio posted 31% year-over-year growth.\n\nThe pharma giant also says boosting its dividend over time remains a key part of its strategy, suggesting investors can count on Pfizer for passive income. This, as well as Pfizer's focus on new products to grow revenue, makes this stock a great addition to your \"forever\" portfolio.",

But it\u2019s unclear how much better the next wave of treatments will be compared to those already on the market.\n\nThese medications, known commonly as GLP-1 or incretin drugs, have taken the world by storm \u2014 especially in the United States.

Popular brand names of these treatments currently on the market include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient with Ozempic, and Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) Zepbound.\n\nThe weight-loss drug boom has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world\u2019s most valuable pharmaceutical companies, with sales skyrocketing in recent years.

In the U.S. alone, nearly 10% of the population \u2014 31.5 million people \u2014 are expected to be using them by 2035.\n\nWith that much money at stake, it\u2019s no surprise that drugmakers are already grinding to develop the blockbuster weight-loss drugs of tomorrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaster weight loss with fewer injections and side effects\n\nSeveral pharma companies are developing weight-loss drugs promising faster results and, in some cases, less frequent injections \u2014 an improvement over weekly shots like Wegovy and Zepbound. To outperform the current options, these new treatments will need to deliver weight loss exceeding 20%, the average achieved with the highest dose of Zepbound.\n\nNovo Nordisk: The Danish pharma giant is developing a successor to its popular Ozempic medication. The company is betting that mimicking multiple hormones could deliver greater weight loss. CagriSema combines semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema. However, in December, Novo Nordisk said patients in a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug only lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks on the medication.\n\nEli Lilly: The American multinational is also developing a stronger weight-loss injection, retatrutide, which, in a small clinical trial, helped patients lose 17% of their weight in 24 weeks.\n\n\u201cRetatrutide is really exciting because the amount of weight loss you have seen there was even beyond tirzepatide (the active ingredient in Zepbound),\u201d president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health Patrik Jonsson told Quartz last year. He added this could help populations that need a greater level of weight loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmgen: The pharma giant said in November that its experimental weight-loss medication, MariTide, helped patients living with obesity or who are overweight lose an average of 20% of their weight in a 52-week trial. Amgen Chief Scientific Officer James E. Bradner previously told investors that MariTide is expected to be sold in a \u201cconvenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration.\u201d\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX): This summer, Viking Therapeutics said it was advancing its experimental weight-loss drug, VK2735, to a late-stage clinical trial. An earlier, smaller trial found that VK2735 helped users achieve an average weight loss of 14% from baseline numbers, plus 13% compared with a placebo after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nZealand Pharma: The Denmark-based drugmaker said that only about a third of patients who took up to 4.8-milligram doses of its drug petrelintide during an early-stage clinical trial experienced nausea \u2014 one of the most common side effects of popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Zealand is pitching petrelinde as an alternative for patients who can\u2019t tolerate GLP-1 treatments, which can include common side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Zealand previously reported in June that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost, on average, 8.6% of their weight.\n\nAn effective weight-loss pill\n\nPharma companies are also developing weight-loss pills that could potentially open the market for patients who are resistant to needles and are likely to be easier to manufacture helping meet growing demand and avoid shortages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk said in September that patients who took a once-daily 50mg dose of its experimental pill amycretin lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months. Trial participants who took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months. For comparison, a large clinical trial of Wegovy found that it helped users lose about 15% of their body weight over 68 weeks. It\u2019s important to note that larger phase 2, 3, and 4 trials involving thousands more participants could return different results.\n\nEli Lilly: Eli Lilly is also developing a weight-loss pill \u2014 orforglipron. The drug is currently in a phase 3 trial \u2014 its results will be published this year. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks.\n\nPfizer (PFE): Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts last fall that the company still expects its leading weight loss drug candidate, danuglipron, to be the second incretin weight-loss pill to enter the market. Pfizer announced in July it was advancing the development of danuglipron, a pill that mimics the gut hormone GLP-1. In December, the pharma giant said that a twice-daily version of the pill helped patients, in an early-stage trial, lose an average of 8% to 13% of their weight. However, the company decided not to advance this formulation to a late-stage trial due to a high rate of side effects.\n\nViking Therapeutics: In November, Viking Therapeutics reported that in a small phase 1 clinical study, patients who took a daily 100mg dose of Viking\u2019s weight-loss pill lost an average of up to 6.8% of their body weight over 28 days when adjusted for those taking a placebo. This result outperformed Novo Nordisk\u2019s amycretin.",

            "content": "One-time or recurring donations can be made through Ko-Fi:\n\nBy Jacob M. Thompson\n\nBig pharmaceutical executives have sought to leave their mark and cozy-up to President-elect Donald Trump in the final weeks leading up to his inauguration, including the likes of Bill Gates, along with others such as Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who has reportedly built a good rapport with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as well, who is often misappropriated in mainstream media as being \u201canti-vax.\u201d\n\nOn January 17th, the Wall Street Journal published a clip from a longer interview that discussed a recent 3-hour meeting the multibillionaire philanthropist had with the former President at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nThe meeting also included another member of Gates\u2019 team and Trump\u2019s incoming Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles.\n\nGates had this to say in the interview:\n\nWe touched on a lot of things. It was over three hours, to my surprise. I spoke a lot about HIV and that the Foundation is literally working on a cure for that. We\u2019re at an early stage. He, in the COVID days, accelerated the vaccine innovation. I was asking him if maybe the same kind of thing could be done here. We both got, I think, pretty excited about that I explained why polio\u2019s been tough in Pakistan, Afghanistan. We\u2019ve had cases show up in Gaza and Africa. He was fascinated to hear what he could do to help. I felt like he was energized. I was frankly impressed.\n\nSEE: Bill Gates Tells Al Jazeera How To Prepare For The \u2018Next Pandemic\u2019 And \u2018To Moderate Some Of The Insanity\u2019 Online\n\nGates had previously expressed interest in Trump\u2019s campaign after his victory in November. Gates said at the time: \u201cCongratulations to President Trump and VP-elect Vance. America is at its strongest when we use ingenuity and innovation to improve lives here in the U.S. and around the world. I hope we can work together now to build a brighter future for everyone.\u201d\n\nSusie Wiles, who was also in attendance at this meeting, is a lesser known tour de force in Washington and Republican circles. Unlike other cabinet members, the Chief of Staff does not need to be vetted and approved by the Senate.\n\nTrump said in a statement after his victory: \u201cSusie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns. Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,\u201d the president-elect continued. \u201cSusie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again.\u201d\n\nSome publications like Politico have referred to her as the most powerful and most feared woman in America.\n\nPolitico provided a synopsis of the type of power Wiles possesses (click the dropdown window to see more details):\n\nThe Most Feared and Least Known Political Operative in America\n\nOn top of this, Wiles is a major lobbyist for big pharmaceutical companies. In a since-deleted post, The Kennedy Beacon highlighted her many connections with big-pharma, writing:\n\nWiles became co-chair of lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs in February 2022. As highlighted by Wholistic News, Mercury\u2019s clientele includes Pfizer; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which spearheaded vaccine funding and distribution efforts during the COVID-19 crisis \u2013 a role also played by the United Nations Foundation, another Mercury client; and Gilead Sciences, developer of the equally-rushed COVID-19 \u201ctherapeutic,\u201d remdesivir, as critiqued in Science.\n\nAnd speaking of Pfizer, its CEO Albert Bourla has also met with Trump to discuss the role of his company with the Trump administration.\n\nThe Financial Times reported:\n\nBourla, who worked closely with the Trump administration on the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, has been leading the charge to cosy up to the president-elect.\n\nHe met Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the run-up to November\u2019s election, and then was instrumental in organising a December dinner with Trump, Kennedy, Eli Lilly chief executive David Ricks and Stephen Ubl, the head of PhRMA, the industry lobbying group, the people said.\n\nThe Pfizer chief is among a growing list of corporate executives trying to foster a direct relationship with Trump ahead of his inauguration on January 20. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Apple chief executive Tim Cook have all dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in recent weeks.\n\nPfizer was also one of several companies, including Meta and Amazon, which have pledged money to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee, a person said.\n\nSEE: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Admits They Partnered With Pfizer To Create Genetic Database From Medical Records\n\nMatt Mowers, a former Trump official who runs lobbying firm Valcour, said in a comment: \u201cEveryone knows where Donald Trump\u2019s going to go on immigration and energy but there\u2019s a lot of nuance that could have multibillion-dollar impacts on Big Tech and pharmaceuticals. Those nuances are the areas in which these companies have to start working with the incoming administration.\u201d\n\nMoreover, John LaMattina, former head of research and development at Pfizer, told the FT: \u201cIf I were a CEO of a pharma company, I\u2019d be going down to Mar-a-Lago as well. Trump loves to have people come and pay their respects to him, and he listens when they come. So what better access to have than to go directly to the president-elect and plead your case?\u201d\n\nAt that meeting, which Wiles also attended, Axios reported that the group discussed how the public and private sectors can collaborate on finding cures for cancer, among other topics.\u2019 The outlet added: \u2018The patio dinner is a potential indication that Trump\u2019s administration will see the pharmaceutical industry as a partner \u2014 not just an adversary \u2014 for parts of its \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda.\u2019\n\nDays after that meeting, Ricks spoke at a meeting at the Economic Club in Washington D.C., where he said, \u201cWe have to raise developed countries, what they pay, and we can lower the U.S.,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a policy argument we\u2019ll hear about soon with the new administration.\u201d\n\nHe did not disclose much about the dinner, but did comment:\n\nMy experience, having done this for eight years, is there\u2019s often more common ground than you\u2019d think, just reading the newspapers.\n\nMore specifically, Bourla emphasized that he has built a rapport with RFK Jr.\n\nBourla explained some of the details in an earnings call last week.\n\nI don\u2019t want to speak about the details of what we discussed during that dinner because I want to respect the privacy, but we developed a good relation with Mr. Kennedy. If he\u2019s confirmed, we will work with him to make sure that we advance the right policies. Bourla said\n\nAdditionally, Bourla expressed his intentions to maintain a positive, \u201cvery long-lasting relationship\u201d that he has with President Trump. He added,\n\nThe President is extremely proud, and of course, we are extremely proud, that [Pfizer] basically delivered a vaccine through this landmark golden standard program, the Operation Warp Speed [\u2026] that saved millions of lives.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s victory, Kennedy Jr. was quick to say that he was not going to be taking away people\u2019s vaccines.\n\nRFK Jr. told NBC: \u201cI\u2019m not going to take away anybody\u2019s vaccines. If vaccines are working for somebody, I\u2019m not going to take them away. People ought to have [a] choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information.\u201d He added, \u201cSo I\u2019m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.\u201d\n\nTrump has also commented that \u2018Bobby\u2019 is not as \u201cradical\u201d as he is often portrayed. The Associated Press quoted him as saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be much less radical than you would think. I think he\u2019s got a very open mind, or I wouldn\u2019t have put him there.\u201d\n\n\u2018At least for now, Pfizer assumes that there will be no material vaccine policy changes in the U.S. in 2025, CFO Dave Denton said on Tuesday\u2019s investor call,\u2019 Fierce Pharma noted.\n\nContrary to repeated erroneous reports, RFK Jr. is not \u201canti-vax,\u201d as he clarified this a number of times out of his own mouth.\n\nDuring a debate with Alex Epstein, at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2019, Kennedy once again asserted that he is not \u201canti-vaccine\u201d but \u201cpro-vaccine,\u201d and has had all of his children vaccinated, but many people do not know his position because the mainstream media is very quick to call him an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and quash the rest of his opinions.\n\nJr. went on to point out that these \u201cmedicines,\u201d as he called them, are exempt from safety testing. Because of that, Kennedy advocates that more safety testing should be done before they are mandated. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t think we should be mandating medical interventions for unwilling Americans, unless we know precisely that that vaccine is going to end up helping them rather than hurting them.\n\nAUTHOR COMMENTARY\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big club, and you ain\u2019t in it!\u201d -George Carlin\n\nSEE: The Club: Trump Seen Acting Jovial With Obama At President Carter\u2019s Funeral\n\nSo, what will be the latest excuse be this time from the MAGA crowd? Wait, lemme guess, is this Trump and Bobby playing 4-D chess again?\n\nAnd just to prove that another pandemic is assuredly around the corner, I reported in December that rushed spending bill to suspend the debt ceiling, again, which contains an entire chunk of legislation dedicated to \u201cpandemic preparedness,\u201d in collaboration with the military and churches, and building on vaccine stockpiles. SEE: House Speaker Johnson\u2019s Rushed Spending Bill Contains \u2018Pandemic Preparedness\u2019, Military Partnership And Vaccine Stockpile, Collaboration With Churches\n\nI try not to be too dogmatic about future events, prognosticating or moonlighting as a soothsayer, but I think I can now safely guarantee that another plandemic is around the corner, relatively very soon; all signs pointing towards it being \u201cbird flu;\u201d and these liars and golden calves will be the ones to sell it to the masses again like once before.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect setup, using the hypocrite RFK Jr. as a red herring to con Americans who genuinely want cleaner food and less big-pharma overreach (like me), to then sell you on the latest vaccine you need. Sure, maybe this administration might distract Americans with banning one or two chemicals in our food, if that, but will then ensorcell those same beguiled Americans into accepting the latest gene-editing clot shot that will stop your heart, as this administration ironically goes about destroying the food supply even more, and consolidating farms in the process.\n\nGalatians 3:1 O foolish Galatians [Americans], who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?\n\nThe WinePress has made it VERY clear that a narrative is being created to establish \u201cbird flu\u201d as the \u201cnext pandemic;\u201d and it has been made repeatedly clear by the mainstream propaganda outlets that whoever was [s]elected as President would be the so-called \u201cBird Flu President.\u201d\n\nSo, there you have it. It\u2019s not just business, it\u2019s even more big business as usual at our expense. But hey, maybe you can show your appreciation and buy into some of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency scam!\n\nSource: winepressnews.com\n\nShare\n\nRelated articles:",

            "content": "On December 10, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, published a report on Fidelity Investments to discuss the outlook and expected nature of consumer staples in 2025. The consumer staples sector had a positive year in 2024. Shuleva is of the view that with sector dynamics returning to normal, 2025 is also expected to have a positive outlook for the sector. Solid consumer balance sheets, a strong economy, and support from the Fed may help the sector perform better than the broader market. Opportunities thus exist in consumer staples in 2025. Stable consumer demand, steady real wage growth, and healthy employment are further expected to support these opportunities.\n\nWe recently published an article on the 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In and discussed what the consumer staples sector might look like in 2025. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\nThe consumer defensive sector covers products that everyone needs almost every day. These stocks are able to sustain any economic environment, even economic slowdowns, as they are not highly dependent on the economic cycle. This differentiates them from cyclical stocks, as consumer defensive stocks can produce stable profits through the various stages of an economic cycle. These stocks can thus protect your portfolio in times of economic instability, as they generally produce reliable income from dividends. While consumer defensive stocks tend not to be susceptible to market instability, they also experience less growth during positive market cycles as compared to cyclical or higher-risk stocks. Some of the most common and pure-play industry groups considered defensive include healthcare, consumer staples, infrastructure, utilities, and others.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)) stands against other undervalued defensive stocks for 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn January 6, Kevin Mahn, President and CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, appeared on CNBC to discuss the current market momentum and shed light on his view about the consumer staples sector. He corroborated Shuleva\u2019s claim that consumer staples as a sector didn\u2019t have a positive 2024 and lagged behind in the market. The technology space, in contrast, had much bigger gains.\n\nHowever, he believed that the staples space is a very defensive sector, and it has opportunities in 2025. Viewing historical trends, the consumer staple sector has, over the past 10-15 years, traded at 1 to \u00bd turns over the S&P 500 multiple. Now, it is trading essentially over one standard deviation below its historical average. Therefore, some stocks in the sector have the potential to outperform.\n\nCould Tariffs Be a Cause of Concern in 2025?\n\nHowever, tariffs are expected to be a significant concern for retailers in 2025. On January 17, Yahoo! Finance\u2019s Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma appeared on Catalysts to discuss the impact of tariffs on retailers. She said that while several retailers are adopting a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach, experts have warned that consumer prices could hike within three to six months if tariffs take effect. These price increases are likely to affect discount chain retailers the most, which are usually a part of the consumer defensive sector. This is primarily due to their strategizing with production shifts and price mitigation efforts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 undervalued defensive stocks with forward P/E ratios less than 15 as of January 17, 2025. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them as of fiscal Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Undervalued Defensive Stock for 2025?\n\nA medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nForward P/E: 8.98\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, markets, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. The company works to advance prevention, wellness, treatments, and cures in emerging and developed markets. Pfizer Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:PFE) goal is to become a world-class oncology leader. The company is already the third-largest biopharma company in oncology in the United States. Thus, it plans to continue its progress in oncology for the rest of the decade.\n\nUsing its pandemic profits, the company acquired Seagen in late 2023 for $43 billion to further bolster its oncology pipeline. The company is expected to continue looking for opportunities to acquire promising pharmaceutical companies to augment its pipeline further. This strategy is working well for Pfizer Inc., (NYSE:PFE) as management estimates earnings growth between 10% and 18% for 2025. Analysts also estimate the company\u2019s earnings to grow by around 14% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has an attractive dividend yield of 6.3%, higher than most blue-chip stocks. Its management has reiterated plans to support this dividend and raise it periodically, recently announcing a 2.4% increase in early December.\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 1st on our list of undervalued defensive stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of undervalued defensive stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Following Pfizer\u2019s voluntary withdrawal of Oxbryta from the global market, a mother of three daughters battling sickle cell disease shares why patients need it as a therapeutic option.\n\nThe headline rocked our family to the core.\n\nAt 5 pm ET, Sept. 25, 2024, the statement read: \u201cPfizer Voluntarily Withdraws All Lots of Sickle Cell Disease Treatment OXBRYTA\u00ae (voxelotor) From Worldwide Markets.\u201d\n\nThis pulled the rug out from under the global sickle cell disease community. We did not see it coming. We weren\u2019t ready for the chaos that ensued.\n\nOxbryta was the only disease modifying therapy for sickle cell disease that actually worked for my oldest daughter Tully. She\u2019s a college student, and the drug offered her hope for a bright future, free of pain crises. Breaking the news to her, that she could no longer have access to Oxbryta, was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to do as a mother.\n\nThe day started out beautifully. I had just landed at home in Atlanta after joining other patient advocates in Washington for the Sickle Cell Disease Summit. It was a first-of-its-kind event organized by the US Department of Health and Human Services to highlight progress in research, care, and cures. I was on an emotional high, more hopeful and optimistic than ever about the future of my daughters and all people living with this dreadful disease.\n\nThe swing from high to low sent a shock through my system that I still haven\u2019t recovered from nearly four months later. It is a numb sensation that continues to permeate my body.\n\nAt first, I was stunned, broken, and saddened. There was no time to process feelings of shock and grief. Instantly, a barrage of messages started coming in from other caregivers, patients, and community members.\n\n\u201cHow is this even happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we just stop taking the drug?\u201d\n\nGreat questions. I did not have the answers. Pfizer\u2019s announcement was vague, leaving room for a host of interpretations. No guidance was provided on how to go about stopping the therapy. Those questions went to doctors and community leaders.\n\nNo one knew what to do.\n\nThis loss felt personal.\n\nPrior to the FDA approving Oxbryta in November 2019, hydroxyurea was the only drug on the market for sickle cell disease. It offers a marginal benefit for some but provides no real clinical benefit for almost half of patients. As a mother of three daughters who all suffer from sickle cell disease, I was painfully aware that one medication on the market is nowhere near enough. Millions of patients around the world are suffering and need more treatment options. Patients have long been neglected, and that\u2019s a great injustice.\n\nSo, when Oxbryta came along, I fought for it. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if it worked for my daughters or not. This was a fight of principle. I fought for the right of my children and all patients to have therapeutic options. I fought knowing that, like all medications, Oxbryta will work for some and wouldn\u2019t work for others.\n\nI painted the picture of three sisters \u2014 ages 15, 14, and 10 at the time \u2014 being hammered by an unpredictable disease that has no boundaries of the types of havoc it wreaks. I shared our challenges with pain crises, a stroke, too many hospitalizations to count, over 10 surgeries, stigma, acute chest syndrome, monthly blood transfusions, jaundice, and so much more.\n\nBefore my oldest daughter Tully started taking Oxbryta, she suffered from chronic fatigue, hemoglobin that tethered between mid-6 to low-7 grams per deciliter of blood (normal is 11.5-15 g/dl). Her immune system develops antibodies against the donor blood she\u2019s given, making it difficult and dangerous for her to be transfused.\n\nOxbryta raised her hemoglobin level, making it less likely for her to need a transfusion. Now, if her hemoglobin drops suddenly, or she needs a higher level for a procedure requiring anesthesia, she will not have Oxbryta to help her. She will instead get daily injections of erythropoietin to try to stimulate her already overworked bone marrow to make more red cells, a painful treatment that is far less safe and effective than Oxbryta. About one in five people with sickle cell disease are hard to transfuse safely and are in the same situation as Tully.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s life was shaken by the withdrawal of Oxbryta. She went to the emergency room for a pain crisis three or four times a year when she was on the drug. When the drug was taken away, in the first month, she had to go to the ER every single week.\n\nThere is never a good time to need emergency care; however what breaks my heart even more is that this happened during a time when hospitals were out of IV fluids. When the hospitals were forced to ration what little supplies they had, sickle cell patients were unable to get access to these vital fluids. Sickle cell patients like my daughter who were seeking emergency care because of pain were only receiving strong opioids.\n\nTully missed a lot of school and lost a lot of weight. She is back to being chronically fatigued, jaundiced, with low hemoglobin.\n\nShe and many patients who relied on Oxbryta are back to living life without any disease modifying therapy that works for them. In fact, they are back to being defenseless against a monstrous disease that is systematically damaging their organs.\n\nThat is not OK.\n\nWhen Pfizer acquired Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT), the company that developed Oxbryta, we all had concerns about what this meant for the future of sickle cell drug development. Pfizer, the world\u2019s second largest pharmaceutical company, bought out a company that existed unapologetically for the advancement of sickle cell disease. We knew that GBT had other sickle cell compounds in the pipeline and were afraid that they might become a lower priority for development at a big company like Pfizer.\n\nAfter all, Pfizer had left our community high and dry before, when it was unsuccessful in developing rivipansel to treat acute pain in sickle cell.\n\nEven so, with all of our reservations, while we hated to see GBT go, we prayed that with Pfizer\u2019s global reach, Oxbryta and the other therapies would reach parts of the world that are being hit the hardest by sickle cell disease, like sub-Saharan Africa, where 50-80% of children born with the disease die before their 5th birthday and upwards of 90% die before their 18th birthday.\n\nUnfortunately, rather than making Oxbryta available to more individuals, Pfizer has taken it away from everyone. The reasons for this drastic decision have not been fully explained but appear to be related to risk in malaria endemic areas.\n\nAs a member of the sickle cell community, I am speaking for many when I say that we need this medication. We have only the small hope that on careful review with the FDA, Pfizer will do the right thing and reverse their voluntary withdrawal of Oxbryta.",

            "content": "Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned -0.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 6.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +380%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 points to a change of +59.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.93 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.5 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $63.36 billion and $63.2 billion estimates indicate +8.3% and -0.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPfizer reported revenues of $17.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33.8%. EPS of $1.06 for the same period compares with -$0.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +16.53%. The EPS surprise was +65.62%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2024. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Fresenius Medical Care North America's Continued Vaccine Advocacy\n\nThe medical community widely applauded the national vaccine rollout to dialysis patients, and Fresenius Medical Care North America (FMCNA) has worked to remain ahead the curve when it comes to educating patients and employees about the importance of being vaccinated.\n\n\n\nWhen COVID-19 began rapidly spreading in early 2020, there were no vaccines or treatments available to defend against this novel virus. Fast forward to today, and some treatments are available to help those who have been affected by COVID-19, along with several effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 and that have been authorized by the FDA for emergency use.\n\nA recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study found there is strong evidence to suggest that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among frontline healthcare personnel, first responders, and other essential workers, offering hope and positive news about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe CDC study results showed that the first dose of the vaccine reduced infection risk by 80 percent or more after two or more weeks and a second dose of the vaccine (which is the recommended number of doses) reduced the risk of infection by 90 percent within two or more weeks after the second inoculation.\n\n\u201cTo date, we've received and distributed more than 76,000 doses of vaccine and more than 171,000 patients and staff have been fully vaccinated in the FMCNA community,\u201d says Dr. Robert Kossmann, Chief Medical Officer for FMCNA. \u201cThis has been achieved through local, state, and federal collaboration. This is great news at a critical time.\u201d\n\nOn March 25, when the Biden administration announced a federal initiative to partner with dialysis centers to provide COVID-19 vaccination, FMCNA commended the White House for this decision knowing its major impact in protecting patients from this virus while also easily and quickly allowing a vulnerable population in the United States to get vaccinated. Patients would be spared from having to go through complicated scheduling systems or traveling lengthy distances to receive the vaccine. FMCNA also became a designated central point of distribution for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to dialysis centers across the country.\n\nFMCNA has strong confidence in the Pfizer vaccine and continues to educate all staff and patients about the safety and benefits of receiving the vaccine immediately when it is offered to them. And the results are paying off, with a reduction in cases across dialysis centers nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an overall decrease in the number of new COVID-19 infections among Fresenius Kidney Care patients and this is directly correlated to our vaccine efforts,\u201d said Dr. Kossmann. \u201cWe have to continue building on our vaccination successes and we know that the available vaccines are effective. The more we vaccinate, the more lives we protect, the more lives we save.\u201d\n\nTo stay up to date on the latest news, education, and data regarding the pandemic please please visit FMCNA\u2019s COVID-19 resource page.\n\nTo hear a behind-the-scenes discussion about the efforts to forge a one-of-a-kind partnership with the federal government to procure and distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to dialysis centers across the country, please check out this special episode of our Field Notes podcast.",

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

            "content": "Advertisement\n\nKey Insights\n\nPfizer's significant public companies ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public\n\nThe largest shareholder of the company is Pfizer Inc. with a 62% stake\n\n\n\nEvery investor in Pfizer Limited ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that public companies own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nWhile institutions who own 19% came under pressure after market cap dropped to \u20b9227b last week,public companies took the most losses.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pfizer.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pfizer?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Pfizer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Pfizer, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nPfizer is not owned by hedge funds. Pfizer Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 62% of shares outstanding. With such a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control of the future of the company. With 4.3% and 3.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Asset Management Arm and Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Pfizer\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Pfizer Limited. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around \u20b912m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that public companies hold 64% of the Pfizer shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 7th of March to $0.43. This will take the annual payment to 6.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nPfizer's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 221% of what it was earning. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.\n\nEarnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the path it has been on, the payout ratio could get to 77% which is certainly still sustainable.\n\nNYSE:PFE Historic Dividend January 19th 2025\n\nPfizer Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from $1.04 total annually to $1.72. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.2% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.\n\nThe Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, things aren't all that rosy. Pfizer's earnings per share has shrunk at 23% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Pfizer's payments are rock solid. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think Pfizer is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Pfizer has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

            "content": "A young man claims he was so driven to despair by debilitating heart issues he suffered after having the Covid vaccines that he almost took his own life.\n\nDespite seeing numerous cardiologists and being checked into hospital with a diagnosis of pericarditis following his second Pfizer vaccine, Conor Briggs, 26, said he was offered nothing to deal with the condition except anti-depressants.\n\nMr Briggs said the pericarditis, which is inflammation of the sac-like tissue surrounding the heart called the pericardium, was making his life hell.\n\n'There were some nights where I just wouldn't sleep because of the feeling that someone was standing on my chest, or squeezing the top of my lungs,' he said.\n\n'I couldn't lie flat. The position of going flat puts your heart in a position that makes it hard to breathe.'\n\nDoctors told Mr Briggs his condition was not serious enough for compensation from the now closed Commonwealth scheme.\n\nHe has now joined a class action led by Dr Melissa McCann which is suing Australian health authorities and associated prominent individuals for failing in their duty of care towards the vaccine injured.\n\nBefore taking the vaccines at the age of 23, Mr Briggs was working in property leasing, studying IT at university and said he was the healthiest he had ever been, running up to 10km every day.\n\nConor Briggs, 26, said heart injuries caused by two Covid vaccines drove him towards trying to take his own life\n\nConor said that before taking the Pfizer Covid vaccines he was the healthiest he'd ever been\n\n'I was taking my health a lot more seriously, eating healthily, going to the gym and all that,' he said.\n\n'My arms were double the muscle I have now.'\n\nEven though the Covid vaccines were not mandated for his work, Mr Briggs said he felt pressured to get them.\n\n'My boss was every second day going \"hey, are you going to get the shots?\", everyone else at work was basically going on about it every day,' Mr Briggs said.\n\nBefore getting his first Covid shot on September 17, 2021, Mr Briggs said he had no particular concerns despite seeing some media reports about people suffering blood clots and heart issues after having them.\n\n'I didn't look into the safety of the vaccines because I thought \"the doctors know what they are talking about\",' he said.\n\n'I didn't have any reason not to trust them. I thought I was actually doing a good thing.'\n\nA few hours after getting the first injection Mr Briggs began experiencing a moderate tightness in his chest and breathing issues.\n\nMr Briggs has been unable to work since taking the jabs and spends most days at his home\n\nAlthough hospitals and cardiologists had diagnosed Mr Briggs with pericarditis that followed his Pfizer Covid vaccine they could offer little in the way of treatment\n\nSpecialists were often at a loss to understand Conor's symptoms after the initial diagnosis of pericarditis\n\nWhen the issues persisted, he went to see his GP, who told him it was still a good idea to get the second Covid jab for 'full protection'.\n\nHe also gave Mr Briggs some anti-inflammatory drugs that made his health problems '90 per cent go away'.\n\nMr Briggs had a second Pfizer vaccine on October 8, 2021 with devastating results within hours of being jabbed.\n\n'I just felt like a weight on my chest,' he said.\n\n'It felt like a different weight than after the first shot. Tighter, harder to breathe and I was super tired the day after.\n\n'But I thought it was one of the to-be-expected side effects, and showed the vaccine was working.'\n\nHowever, in the following days there was no sign of improvement and Mr Briggs said he experienced alarming physical deterioration.\n\n'Two days after the second shot I went back to work and there are 10 stairs to get into the office,' Mr Briggs said.\n\n'About five or six stairs up, my chest became a whole lot more tighter, and it was a whole lot more difficult breathing than normal.'\n\nEventually Mr Briggs went back to the GP.\n\n'She said, I will never forget this line, \"oh luckily it's only pericarditis\",' Mr Briggs said.\n\n'I thought \"lucky me, a 23-year-old with heart problems\".'\n\nForests of the Fallen feature stories from people claiming to have been harmed by the Covid vaccines (pictured a display at Adelaide's Christies Beach in March)\n\nNorthern Beaches grandmother Rosemary Marshall, 70, organises the Forest of the Fallen for the northern side of Sydney\n\nThe Australian Department of Health advises that 'Most myocarditis and pericarditis cases linked to COVID-19 vaccination have been mild and patients have recovered quickly'.\n\nMr Briggs said he isn't convinced.\n\n'A lot of people have been told the same thing but they have had to have surgery to drain fluid because it doesn't just go away,' he said.\n\nMr Briggs said he tried 'five to six' different cardiologists over the space of a year to find treatment that worked for him.\n\nHowever, he claimed none of the specialists could tell him much about his condition with one even abruptly ending the consultation by telling him: 'Well, I have done all I can. There is nothing else I can do. Goodbye.'\n\nAnother told him: 'Conor you have wasted so much time, you have wasted so much money when you probably could have taken these anti-depressants and just been fine.'\n\n'I took one,' Mr Briggs said.\n\n'But only one minute after taking it I thought this isn't right.\n\n'I know my condition is physical and not in my head. If I can fix up the physical problem I won't have mental issues.'\n\nMr Briggs said he and his family have spent more than $100,000 trying a bewildering array of drugs, herbs and other treatments to relieve his symptoms without anything making much difference until he went to an osteopath a bit over two years ago.\n\n'He is the only one who has made a noticeable difference to my breathing,' Mr Briggs said.\n\nAlthough seeing the osteopath has made his heart condition more bearable, it still rules his life.\n\n'The sun and heat give me heart palpitations,' Mr Briggs said.\n\n'I get a tight chest and its hard to breathe when I walk up a hill or more than 20 stairs.\n\n'I have got to plan my day. If it is hot day I cannot be outside too much. My usual days are at home seeing if there are any other treatments or stuff that might work.'\n\nHe eventually told his unsuspecting family how close he had been to taking his life.\n\n'They were obviously a bit shocked but glad that I told them,' Mr Briggs said.\n\nIf his health and the weather permits Conor attempts to get to the so-called 'Forest of the Fallen', a weekly protest held on Sydney's northern beaches where bamboo sticks are stuck in the sand to display stories of people claiming Covid vaccine harm.\n\n'Doing Forests of Fallen I have met a lot of people in my position, a lot of people who didn't even know there were side effects with the shots,' Mr Briggs said.\n\nNorthern Beaches grandmother Rosemary Marshall, 70, organises the Forest of the Fallen for the northern side of Sydney.\n\nShe said she met Mr Briggs through his mother Paula.\n\n'I could hear the heartbreak in her voice and the anxiety,' Ms Marshall told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Paula was very anxious to help Conor, she is absolutely his support system.'\n\nMr Briggs said Dr McCann's class action on behalf of the vaccine injured was a long shot for receiving any monetary compensation but he hoped it achieved other results on behalf of those who claim to be injured by the vaccines.\n\nIn response to questions about Mr Briggs' case a Pfizer spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the vaccine 'saved countless lives'.\n\n'Pfizer is deeply committed to the well-being of the patients it serves and has no higher priority than ensuring the safety and effectiveness of its treatments and vaccines,' the spokesperson said.\n\n'The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered to more than 4.3 billion people in 180 countries and territories around the world, demonstrated a favourable benefit-risk profile in all age groups, and helped protect against severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalisation and death.\n\n'The safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine continues to be vigilantly monitored through post-authorisation surveillance by Pfizer, BioNTech, and regulatory authorities around the world.'\n\nAustralian Therapeutic Goods Administration's advice on Covid vaccines Vaccination against COVID-19 is the most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from infection. Four main COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in Australia \u2013 Comirnaty (Pfizer), Spikevax (Moderna), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), and Nuvaxovid (Novavax). However, Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) is no longer available. Bivalent vaccines for both mRNA vaccines are also registered in Australia. These cover the Omicron BA.1 and BA.4-5 variants. All of these COVID-19 vaccines have met the TGA's high standards for quality, safety and effectiveness. Like all medicines, COVID-19 vaccines may cause some side effects. The most frequently reported include injection-site reactions (such as a sore arm) and more general symptoms, like headache, muscle pain, fever and chills. This reflects what was seen in the clinical trials. Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart or membrane around the heart) is reported in around 1-2 in every 100,000 people who receive Comirnaty (Pfizer), around 2 in every 100,000 of those who receive Spikevax (Moderna) and around 4 in every 100,000 people who receive Nuvaxovid (Novavax).

(NYSE:PFE) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nREAD ALSO: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.",

            "content": "The development of effective vaccines has been essential in our collective fight against COVID-19. These vaccines play a key role in reducing the severity of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths, especially among people age 65 and older.\n\n\u201cWe have more tools than ever to prevent the worst outcomes from COVID-19,\u201d said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, in a news release last year.\n\nGetting vaccinated is still the best defense against severe illness, hospitalization, and death related to COVID-19. Older adults continue to be at highest risk of complications due to age. As we head into cold and flu season, staying up to date with recommended vaccinations can help boost your immunity and give you the most protection possible.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which COVID vaccine is best for older adults, see below for common questions and answers on the latest vaccine guidance.\n\nWhat COVID-19 vaccines are currently available?\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines available and recommended in the U.S. include thos manufactured by Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Novavax.\n\nIn August 2024, the 2024-2025 updated Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines were recommended by CDC for use in the U.S. These updated vaccines more closely target the strain of the virus that is currently circulating. The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines and the Novavax vaccine is a traditional vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine you receive at your doctor's office, pharmacy, or vaccine clinic will depend on what they each purchase and may differ from location to location. However, your vaccine provider will always tell you what vaccine you are receiving and may offer the opportunity to tell them your preference beforehand.\n\nWhat about the COVID vaccine for 65 and older?\n\nThe CDC recommends the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine for those 65 and older. As of October 2024, those 65 and older may get a second dose of the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine six months after their first dose.\n\nIf you're moderately or severely immunocompromised, your doctor may also recommend you get an additional dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your health care provider about the appropriate vaccine schedule for you.\n\nIf you're not able to (or choose not to) get an updated Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, you may be able to get a Novavax booster. To do so, you must:\n\nBe 18 or older\n\nHave completed a COVID vaccine primary series at least 6 months ago\n\nHave not received any other COVID booster dose\n\nHow long does protection from the COVID vaccine last?\n\nYour immunity to COVID-19 should improve within about two weeks after getting the vaccine. While this won't provide 100% protection from getting the virus, it should help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms if you do become ill. Boosted immunity from the COVID vaccine is typically strongest during the first few months.\n\nAre the COVID-19 vaccines safe for older adults?\n\nRegardless of which vaccine you get, you can be assured of its safety. These vaccines were all evaluated using the same rigorous process as all other vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Drug companies were required to provide extensive safety data from clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people. Data on the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines continues to be collected.\n\nYou may experience temporary, minor side effects with the vaccine, which are normal signs your body is building protection against the virus. Common reported side effects include:\n\nPain and swelling at the injection site or upper arm\n\nMuscle aches and weakness\n\nFever and/or chills\n\nTiredness\n\nHeadache\n\nWhen you receive your vaccine, you will be asked to wait at least 15-30 minutes to check for an allergic reaction. This kind of reaction is rare, but may occur in some people, especially those with a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. If you fall into this category, speak with your doctor before getting the vaccine.\n\nWhat if I recently had COVID?\n\nIf you recently had a COVID-19 infection, you may consider waiting up to three months before you get another vaccine. The reason behind waiting is that you develop some immunity to the virus after getting sick, and reinfection is not likely to occur within weeks (or even months) after infection. But if you or someone close to you is at high risk for severe illness, you should not delay getting a booster for too long. Talk to your doctor about the best timing given your particular situation.\n\nIs the COVID vaccine free?\n\nIf you have private health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid coverage, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. You should bring your insurance card with you to your vaccine appointment.\n\nIf you do not have health insurance, you may still be able to receive a free COVID-19 vaccine through your state or local health department or local health center.\n\nWhere can I get the COVID vaccine?\n\nTo find a COVID vaccine appointment near you:\n\nCall your local health department. Many communities have free vaccine clinics at senior centers and other locations. You may be required to register online and schedule a time.\n\nVisit Vaccines.gov. This website makes it easy to find a COVID-19 or flu vaccination site near you. You can also call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 888-720-7489).\n\nCheck with your local pharmacy. While some pharmacies offer walk-in vaccinations, others require you to schedule an appointment on their website. Your pharmacist can answer any questions you have about the updated COVID vaccine.\n\nCheck with your doctor, health clinic, or hospital. They likely also have COVID vaccines on site. If not, your doctor should be able to recommend an alternative location.\n\nReach out to your area agency on aging or senior center. To find yours, contact Eldercare Locator (1-800-677-1116).\n\nIf you need help with getting the COVID-19 vaccine, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask family, friends, or neighbors.\n\nCan I get my COVID booster and flu shot at the same time?\n\nIt is safe to receive your COVID and flu vaccines during the same visit. However, if you\u2019ve experienced soreness at the injection site or other side effects in the past, you may wish to schedule separate appointments to minimize your discomfort.\n\nWill I still have to wear a mask and take other precautions after I\u2019m vaccinated?\n\nAlthough the vaccines are very effective at reducing illness, hospitalization, and death, you should still take basic precautions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. This includes washing your hands frequently and wearing a high-quality mask (like an N95 mask) that fits snugly around your nose and mouth if:\n\nYou\u2019re at high risk for severe COVID\n\nYou\u2019ve been exposed to COVID\n\nYou suspect you have COVID\n\nYou\u2019re in a crowded and/or poorly ventilated space\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFor older adults\u2014especially those with chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes\u2014the COVID-19 vaccine can prevent severe illness or death from the virus.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 continues to pose a threat to older Americans,\u201d says Josh Hodges, NCOA\u2019s Chief Customer Officer. \u201cKeeping up to date with your vaccines is an easy yet powerful way to protect yourself, your family, and your community.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated in January 2025, based on the latest public health information at the time of publication.\n\nSources\n\n1.

            "content": "Pfizer\u2019s virtual lung oncology diagnostics laboratory, developed by Cassette Group. Credit: Cassette Group.\n\nThe metaverse has faded from buzzword to buzzkill, and the hype that once gripped industries has been quietly brushed under the carpet \u2013 or so it may seem.\n\nThe developing technology was worth $48bn in 2022, and growth is still anticipated. In 2023, GlobalData forecast that the technology would be worth $400bn by 2030 despite acknowledging that \u201cthe theme has struggled to live up to the excessive hype that built up in 2021 and early 2022\u201d.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Medical Device Network.\n\nAt the time, the analytics company suggested that the technology had entered an unremitting winter, defined by the limitations of underlying technologies, including blockchain, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and digital twins. It predicted that \u201cwithout improvements in these technologies, the metaverse will continue to disappoint\u201d.\n\nHowever, healthcare giant Pfizer thinks otherwise, investing in the metaverse through a virtual lung oncology diagnostic lab created by VR and AR developer Cassette Group. Other clients of the company include Takeda, Omnicom Health Group, Novartis and the NHS \u2013 representing just a few of the healthcare players with plans for the technology.\n\nAccording to Cassette CEO Ben Taylor, it\u2019s a big space \u2013 he tells Medical Device Network: \u201cWe are only focusing on healthcare because that\u2019s where we see the big opportunity. Pharmaceuticals and life science is such a big space, whether that is in health and safety training in factories or laboratories.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s metaverse and the question of accessibility\n\nFor Pfizer, immersive technology is about the accessibility and scale of training opportunities, which it aims to improve in lung oncology diagnostics through its virtual laboratory.\n\nDeveloped by Cassette and available to healthcare professionals (HCPs) via its portal, Pfizer Pro, the laboratory is a high-resolution virtual imitation of a real laboratory in which users can follow \u2018breadcrumbs\u2019 that guide them through different rooms and equipment.\n\n\u201cIt is based on physical environments, so people do understand how to move about it and how to explore,\u201d explains Taylor. \u201cIt\u2019s very intuitive.\u201d\n\n\u2018Breadcrumbs\u2019 guide users to specific points in the laboratory, where they can interact with information associated with the virtually represented equipment. Credit: Cassette Group.\n\nThe layout is interactive, offering pop-up information associated with the relevant virtual equipment, with integrated quizzes to solidify learning. Gamified in its presentation, the laboratory has been designed specifically for HCPs, with consideration of the different demographics within the field.\n\nDiscussing how the VR world of the metaverse must cater to its users, Tony Hogben, immersive lead at Pfizer digital omnichannel services and solutions, tells Medical Device Network: \u201cYou have younger people \u2013 the Minecraft generation are now joining the working world \u2013 and they are used to this type of experience in which they can move around a virtual space. However, we also have people closer to retirement who maybe don\u2019t have that native ability to access this type of content. Making it accessible for both ends of that spectrum is really important.\u201d\n\nHe adds that it is not only access in the virtual world which has been considered. Immersive technology is often considered to be synonymous with headsets, which may not be available to many HCPs. As such, the laboratory has been designed to be accessed on a variety of terminals, including laptops, desktop computers and mobile phones. It solves an expensive and logistical barrier to training, says Taylor.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the way that they promoted best practice in this field is by flying specialists from all over the world to come to a laboratory and to walk them around and show them face to face what best practice looks like,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThat is absolutely the best way of doing training, but it\u2019s expensive. It takes a lot of time, a lot of coordination of diaries, and requires the use of a laboratory environment as well.\u201d\n\nPfizer sees cost-saving potential in the metaverse\n\nTraining represents a huge financial expense within oncology. Cancer Research UK reports that, on average, it costs \u00a3140,000 ($170,000) to fund a non-clinical PhD student through a three to four-year training programme, while funding the running of its research base, Cambridge Institute, costs almost \u00a345m annually.\n\nHogben suggests that, by embracing the metaverse, Pfizer\u2019s virtual offering provides more professionals access to training for a fraction of the price.\n\n\u201cIn-person training is always going to be the best option if it\u2019s achievable, but it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s logistically hard,\u201d he says. \u201cThe number of people you can train, or that you can engage with, is limited. Virtual training opens the door and makes, the content more inclusive, more accessible.\u201d\n\nVR environments also offer more bang for their buck, thanks to the option of continual revision and review. HCPs are also able to repeat training to improve their understanding, or to remind themselves of key information.\n\n\u201cIt allows people to pre-learn and repeat,\u201d adds Hogben. \u201cIf we say that you can get 70% knowledge retention through doing a virtual immersive experience, but you can do that over and over again, it becomes a case of rinse and repeat. You have all the benefits of in-person training but amplified.\u201d\n\nWhere is the demand for VR in healthcare?\n\nVR is proving its potential in efficiency, offering increased accessibility in the face of tight budgets and geographical challenges. However, the potential use cases span beyond immersive training environments.\n\nA 2023 report by GlobalData points to virtual therapy and telehealth as two areas set to benefit. It offers the example of GameChange, a service developed by the University of Oxford, which uses VR to treat psychosis using digital therapeutics. Elsewhere, startup DeHealth is responsible for creating an AR- and VR-integrated decentralised metaverse via which doctors and patients can interact.\n\nConsidering Cassette\u2019s insights on emerging applications, Taylor points to examples in the medical device field.\n\n\u201cWe work with companies who make devices and are looking for better ways to train buyers in how to use the devices,\u201d he says. \u201cIt varies from VR through web-based, interactive training and it\u2019s a cost saver for them because it saves the expense of sending someone out.\u201d\n\nYet, on the question of training, it is not only Pfizer that has seen the potential of VR and the metaverse. Among Cassette\u2019s other clients is Baxter, which the company worked with to develop a 3D digital twin of the PRISMAX 2 machine, responsible for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients in the ICU. Using VR headsets, HCPs are trained on the equipment, engaging with a replicated version of the machines\u2019 user interface, physicality, and functionality.\n\nWill the metaverse winter thaw?\n\nDespite GlobalData\u2019s assertion that \u201ccooling interest, economic obstacles, and the immaturity of enabling technologies resulted in a metaverse winter in 2023\u201d, there appears to be a healthy metaverse market bubbling under the surface.\n\nAccording to Pfizer\u2019s Hogben, the metaverse is only playing dead, but the cooling-off period has been beneficial for developers.\n\n\u201cI think pronouncing the metaverse dead is great because it\u2019s just part of the usual hype cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything has its initial hype, then it dies, then we build it. Last year, everybody was interested in the metaverse. That\u2019s not the case anymore, meaning that we have the space to work on the fundamental technologies and foundations we need to put in place.\u201d\n\nDespite the breathing space, questions about immersive technology remain. Companies must balance technological advancements with accessibility for all demographics, and the financial savings associated with virtual learning with the benefits of in-person study.\n\nAs the sector develops, Hogben thinks the future is bright enough to thaw the metaverse winter.\n\n\u201cAs a healthcare solution, it absolutely makes sense,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe learn by doing. There are lots of great studies on immersive learning and immersive experiences, and how effective they are for knowledge retention. It is obviously where we go, but how do we activate that?\u201d",

A March 2024 study published in the British Medical Journal cemented a positive correlation between medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), the synthetic hormone found in Depo-Provera, and the tumors. The study found that women using Depo-Provera are five times more likely to develop intracranial meningiomas when used for more than one year.\n\n\u201cPfizer claims to be a global leader in scientific innovation, yet in the case of Depo-Provera, it completely ignored credible scientific studies that connected the contraceptive to serious health risks - all in order to fill its pockets,\u201d said Elizabeth Fegan, managing partner of FeganScott, the firm leading the lawsuit. \u201cWomen believed they were receiving one of the most convenient and effective forms of contraception when, in reality, they were exposing themselves to a dangerous drug.\u201d\n\nThe complaint states that at times, nearly a quarter of all sexually active women in the United States used Depo-Provera. Use of the popular contraceptive has historically been highest among women in at-risk populations, as it is relatively low-cost and less burdensome compared to other contraceptives.\n\nThe suit cites a body of scientific studies published between the 1980s and 2024 that link Depo-Provera to the development of intracranial meningiomas, which FeganScott Attorney Lynn Ellenberger says both the brand and generic manufacturers should have been aware of and acted upon.\n\n\u201cIn the last 20 years, Pfizer and its predecessors have updated the Depo-Provera label in the United States 14 times but have never mentioned the increased risk it poses, as a high-dose progestin, for developing brain tumors. In this instance, Pfizer chose profits over protecting women,\u201d said Ellenberger.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the federal court in the Western District of Pennsylvania, seeks to establish a medical monitoring program for those in certain states who have received the Depo-Provera injection for at least one year. Individuals interested in learning more about their legal options are urged to contact FeganScott at www.feganscott.com.\n\nAbout FeganScott\n\nFeganScott is a national class action law firm dedicated to helping victims of consumer fraud, sexual abuse, and discrimination.

And vaccines are the most effective, cost-effective health care intervention that have existed since clean water,\u201d Bourla said, according to a recording of the session.\n\nWhile reiterating that he has already engaged with the President-elect and his team and would like to work with Trump on areas of mutual interest, Bourla issued a clear warning\n\n\u201cOn the vaccines, if he [Kennedy] does some of the things that he has spoken in the past, I think he will find in front of him, not [just] us, but the entire medical community, the entire scientific community, the entire health care [community] \u2014 in terms of insurance companies because they know that this is very cost effective. And also the employers who are really believing that by using vaccination, they are reducing their health care costs rather than increasing it,\u201d Bourla declared.\n\nThe rate of childhood vaccinations has been dropping in the United States, and Bourla warned that this might lead to the worsening of diseases should Kennedy act on his beliefs.\n\n\u201cAnd even worse, if he does some of the things, because already \u2026 we are losing some vaccinations in [chicken] pox and \u2026 polio, in terms of how many people are vaccinating. If we go below a specific threshold, we will start having an epidemic, and that will be detrimental for him and for the administration. So I think we made that very clear,\u201d he said.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\nIn fact, vaccination rates in kindergarteners have declined since 2020. According to the CDC, \u201cAfter 10 years of near 95% nationwide vaccination coverage, coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); poliovirus vaccine (polio); and varicella vaccine (VAR) declined to approximately 93% over the 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 school years and remained essentially unchanged during the 2022\u201323 school year.\u201d\n\nAfter painting the picture of a worst-case scenario in the U.S., Bourla struck a more conciliatory tone by saying how he can work with the Trump administration on areas of mutual interest.\n\n\u201cHe has seen a lot of his friends and people that he knew dying from cancer, and he keeps asking every time I meet \u2014 \u2018What are we doing with cancer?\u2019 and \u2018Can we cure it?\u2019 And I think that\u2019s an opportunity to try to build programs that will accelerate the cancer development,\u201d Bourla said.\n\nAside from Pfizer, other companies were also asked if they expect any changes from the incoming administration on vaccines. The CEO of Moderna, which created the mRNA Covid vaccine, and has other vaccines in its pipeline said that it is too early to know what the Trump administration is going to do in terms of vaccines. But St\u00e9phane Bancel went on to add the following in more detail:\n\nThe piece that we are confident in, I think, is that every elected leader and every public health leader in those agencies \u2014 FDA, CMS, CDC and so on \u2014 want to protect the American people, want to make America healthy again. And so vaccine is a very important tool. If you think about vaccines in the elderly, if a recommendation was to be changed, the impact will be seen in the same season \u2014 in which you might see in increase in costs \u2026 in the same season because we know that [if] a 70-year-old person is hospitalized, [that person] is of course going to cost much more that same year by being hospitalized with very high cost. And so there\u2019s a lot of doctors, scientists in all those agencies that know the facts and will be able to provide to the new elected leaders those facts so that they understand the benefit and the risk-benefit [ratio] in terms of vaccinations that has been known and demonstrated for a long time. And so we\u2019re going to collaborate with the new administration, like we\u2019ve always done with every administration in every country where we operate. We believe that focusing on the data and the risk-reward ratio will be the right way to do it.\n\nThe CEO of GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) wasn\u2019t asked specifically about the prospect of vaccines under Trump, but Emma Walmsley did sing their praises.\n\n\u201cThe reality is there is no better return on healthcare budget investments than investing in vaccines that stop disease before it starts. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a regulatory environment that, in the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act], has been removing copays,\u201d she said according to a transcript of her session at JPM.\n\nPhoto: WhataWin, Getty Images",

            "content": "There has been a shakeup in markets since Donald Trump\u2019s election, and investors have been positioning their portfolios to bet on names that are expected to benefit from the incoming president\u2019s policies. The pharma and healthcare space, which was already out of favor with investors, has continued to look weak after the president-elect tapped Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA known vaccine skeptic, Kennedy\u2019s anointment led to a selloff in vaccine makers\u2019 share prices. Global pharma giant Pfizer PFE, which fell 10% in 2022 and 41% in 2023, ended 2024 down about 2%. Pfizer stock trades in the ballpark of $26 and fell to a multi-year low last year before recovering slightly. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss why Pfizer\u2019s stock is so low and whether it is a buy or sell now as Trump takes office in just a few days.\n\nWhy Is Pfizer Stock So Low?\n\nPfizer\u2019s current stock price is only marginally higher than its 1942 IPO price of $24.75, although investors should note the company has split its stock five times in this roughly 80-year period.\n\nAlthough the company did create significant wealth for investors in the last century, it hasn\u2019t been a star performer. The stock is up a mere 8.5% over the last 20 years and has underperformed the S&P 500 Index SPX by a wide margin. Worse, it has lost 50% of its market capitalization over the last three years.\n\nOne of the key reasons for its dismal price action over the last three years is declining sales in its COVID-19 portfolio. Bumper sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and its Paxlovid medication helped propel PFE stock to record highs. As sales of these two products have fallen off the cliff, so has Pfizer\u2019s stock price.\n\nWhile Pfizer has a decent pipeline of new products in development, it has yet to come up with something groundbreaking. In December 2023, the company had to halt the development of its twice-daily oral weight loss drug danuglipron after adverse side effects were reported.\n\nAdditionally, many investors weren\u2019t keen on Pfizer\u2019s Seagen acquisition which added $31 billion in debt to its balance sheet. While Seagen\u2019s cancer treatments fit well with Pfizer\u2019s oncology portfolio, it\u2019s a long-term story. Moreover, several of Pfizer\u2019s patents are set to expire over the next five years, which could pressure the company\u2019s sales unless it develops new products to fill the gap.\n\nLastly, having Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as the HHS secretary is not exactly an ideal scenario for vaccine makers like Pfizer given his public views on vaccines. However, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla is not losing sleep over Trump\u2019s nominee for the key position. Bourla, who spoke with Kennedy Jr. emphasized \u201cthe opportunities outweigh the risks\u201d with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nPfizer Stock Forecast\n\nOf the 24 analysts covering Pfizer, 11 have a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating while 12 rate it as a \u201cHold\u201d or some equivalent. One analyst rates PFE as a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d PFE\u2019s mean target price of $31.33 is 19.5% higher than the Jan. 15 closing price, while its Street-high target price of $45 is 71.6% higher.\n\nUBS has turned bearish on pharma names ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration. In a recent note, the firm\u2019s analysts, led by Trung Huynh, said, \u201cWe believe President-elect Trump will be capable of enacting significant change, and the unpredictability is expected to cast a shadow over the space.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the brokerage maintained Pfizer as a \u201cNeutral\u201d but slashed its price target by $2 to $29. \u201cWe need to see continued successful execution to be more constructive on the name, nevertheless we are encouraged by recent progress on management\u2019s key priorities,\u201d said the UBS note. Analysts termed 2025 a \u201ctransition year\u201d for the company.\n\nShould You Buy PFE Stock?\n\nWhile PFE has been a long-term laggard, I won\u2019t give up on the stock for three main reasons. Firstly, the company is expanding its portfolio of anti-cancer drugs, with Seagen being a key part of that strategy. Management expects Seagen to add $10 billion in \u201crisk-adjusted\u201d sales by the end of this decade.\n\nSecondly, PFE trades at less than 10x its expected earnings over the next 12 months, and while analysts don\u2019t expect its earnings to grow this year, the multiples still look low. Finally, with a dividend yield of over 6.5%, Pfizer looks like a good income play for investors seeking high-yielding and relatively safe dividend stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: PFE .

            "content": "Pfizer Inc. is a US-based multinational biotech company. The company operates as a research-based pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, production and marketing of medicines and vaccines. It is the 2nd largest drugmaker globally by revenue and is ranked 64th on the Fortune 500 list. The company\u2019s avenues of research include Immunology, Oncology, Cardiology, Endocrinology and Neurology.\n\nRegarding its product line, the company has at least ten blockbuster drugs producing more than $1 billion in avenue revenue each. The company brought in over $81 billion in total revenue in 2021. The US is its main market and represents roughly 50% of all revenue. China and Japan make up roughly 12% of the business, while the rest come from the \u201crest of the world\u201d. It employs roughly 79,000 people and is headquartered in New York state.\n\nPfizer Inc. was founded in 1849 by Charles Pfizer Sr. and his cousin Charles Earhart. The two were German immigrants and chemists that set up shops outside New York City to make medicinal compounds. The first major success was an antiparasitic called santonin, and the commercialization of citric acid-making technologies quickly followed that up. Their success with citric acid led to the company\u2019s expansion and other major discoveries.\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of materials for making citric acid and forced the company to seek alternatives. The one they latched on to was the fermentation of certain fungi known to produce citric acid naturally. This led to the advancement of fermentation technology that was later used in the commercial production of penicillin and then the advancement of antibiotics in general.\n\nPfizer Inc was incorporated on June 2nd, 1942 in Delaware, and another period of expansion began. The postwar drop in demand for penicillin led to the discovery of newer, more marketable antibiotics and cemented the company\u2019s role in modern medicine. By the time he 80s rolled around, the company was trading on the New York Stock Exchange and on the path to developing today\u2019s blockbuster lineup.\n\nThe company\u2019s top seller in 2021 was Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine. It generated nearly $37 billion in 2021 and was followed by Prevnar, Ibrance and Eliquis with just over $5 billion in sales each. Other blockbuster names on Pfizer\u2019s list include Xeljanz and Enbrel, each bringing in $3.5 billion. Pfizer operates 39 research and production facilities worldwide and sells its products in 125 countries.\n\nAs of 2022, the company had a robust pipeline of potential treatments, with more than 220 in some stage of clinical trials. Among its leading candidates is a vaccine for RSV, a life-threatening respiratory disease affecting children. 2021 highlights include 8 FDA approvals, four new regulatory submissions and 13 new trial startups. Pfizer is also a well-known dividend payer and has returned more than $8.7 billion to shareholders since going public.",

            "content": "Mylan, the drugmaker now part of Viatris, has reached a $73.5 million settlement to resolve claims from drug wholesalers accusing the company of inflating prices for its EpiPen allergy treatment devices. According to Reuters, the preliminary agreement was submitted on Wednesday night in a Kansas federal court and is pending approval by U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree.\n\nThe lawsuit, initiated by wholesalers such as KPH Healthcare and FWK Holdings, alleged that Mylan collaborated with Pfizer to delay the introduction of a generic version of the EpiPen. This delay, the plaintiffs contended, caused buyers to pay inflated prices for the life-saving device. Although both Mylan and Pfizer have denied any wrongdoing, Pfizer previously settled related claims with drug wholesalers for $50 million in 2023, per Reuters.\n\nThe EpiPen, a handheld device used to administer epinephrine during severe allergic reactions, has been at the center of several lawsuits over its pricing. Mylan, which managed the marketing and distribution of EpiPens, increased the price of a two-pack from $100 in 2008 to $600, leading to widespread criticism and legal challenges. Pfizer, which manufactured the device, was also implicated in the claims.\n\nThis latest settlement includes nearly 80 drug wholesalers who purchased EpiPens beginning in 2014. According to court filings, the attorneys representing the plaintiffs intend to seek up to 33% of the settlement fund, approximately $24.5 million, as legal fees.\n\nThis is not the first time Mylan has faced substantial financial consequences over EpiPen pricing. In 2022, the company agreed to a $264 million settlement with consumers and insurers. Similarly, Pfizer settled with a group of consumers in 2021 for $345 million.\n\nReuters reported that Mylan\u2019s attempt to narrow the scope of the lawsuit was denied by Judge Crabtree in December, paving the way for this resolution. Representatives for Mylan and the plaintiffs\u2019 legal teams did not respond to requests for comment regarding the settlement.\n\nSource: Reuters",

This vaccine will help reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases, offering greater protection for vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly.\n\n\u201cPAHO is committed to boosting regional production of sustainable, innovative technologies by strengthening existing capacities and our regional purchasing mechanism, the Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines,\u201d said PAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa. \u201cThis collaboration reflects our dedication to ensuring equitable access to safe, effective vaccines that prevent severe diseases and save lives,\u201d he added.\n\nThrough this initiative, not only will Argentina benefit from local production of the vaccine by Sinergium Biotech, but countries across the Region of the Americas will be able to access vaccine doses through PAHO\u2019s Regional Revolving Funds, ensuring more rapid rollout of the vaccine at competitive prices.\n\nVaccines PCV10 and PCV13 have had a positive impact on the health of children in Latin America and the Caribbean. Estimates from a 2016 study on the global burden of lower respiratory tract infections showed that following the introduction of these vaccines, cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children under the age of 5 years, caused by the vaccine-covered serotypes, were significantly reduced. However, an increase in infections caused by other, non-vaccine-covered serotypes was observed.\n\nPCV20, which includes seven additional serotypes compared to PCV13, is expected to further increase protection against severe diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), responsible for pneumonia, meningitis, and other serious infections, including those linked to antibiotic-resistant strains.\n\nPneumococcal disease remains a global public health problem. According to global estimates by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluations (IHME) in 2021, 155,000 children under the age of 5 died due to pneumonia and meningitis caused by pneumococcus. Of these deaths, 3,345 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean. During the same year, pneumococcal disease caused around 243,000 deaths in adults aged 70 and older, including 18,000 deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe PCV20 vaccine will be available to Latin America and the Caribbean starting in early 2025. It is estimated that the first doses produced in Argentina will be available by 2026. This vaccine, recommended for children under two and adults over 60, is already being introduced in high-income countries and will also be accessible to countries in the region.\n\nFor over 40 years, PAHO\u2019s Revolving Fund for Access to Vaccines has enabled countries in the region to make joint vaccine purchases, giving them bargaining power and ensuring competitive pricing, regardless of each country\u2019s individual demand. With PCV20, countries will also be able to purchase the vaccine at a favorable price, and shipments will be regional, reducing both costs and the carbon footprint. Another benefit of the vaccine, compared to PCV13, is that it will be delivered in prefilled syringes, simplifying the administration process at point of care.\n\nBy contributing to the development of an ecosystem for large-scale vaccine production and distribution, the effort will help to increase the region\u2019s resilience to future pandemics and outbreaks\u2014one of the key lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Morgan Healthcare Conference kicked off Monday with a flood of high-value deals, reinvigorating sentiment across the biopharma industry. Johnson & Johnson made the biggest splash, acquiring neurology leader Intra-Cellular Therapies for $14.6 billion, while GSK picked up precision therapy specialist IDRx for $1B upfront and Eli Lilly laid down up to $2.5 billion for Scorpion\u2019s PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor program. Meanwhile, the immunology and inflammation space continues to fire on all cylinders as Gilead invests up to $1.7 billion for LEO Pharma\u2019s preclinical oral small molecule STAT6 program.\n\nAnd those are only the deals accepted by both parties. Prior to the conference, Biogen offered to acquire its struggling neuro partner Sage Therapeutics for around $469M. The proposal follows a catastrophic run for Sage, which has seen its shares fall more than 90% in the past two years.\n\n2024 sales and earnings forecasts have also generated attention this week, with Sarepta reporting that Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy Elevidys beat analysts\u2019 expectations in the fourth quarter, and Eli Lilly projecting a full-year revenue miss driven largely by lower-than-expected sales of GLP-1 blockbusters Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n\nAs expected, obesity has been a hot topic at JPM, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla announcing that his company is going \u201call in\u201d in the space. This follows new FDA guidance revealed last week recommending a minimum weight loss threshold for drug developers. Among the many companies taking notice is newcomer Verdiva Bio, which launched last week with more than $410 million in opening funds.\n\nAlso debuting last week was Kardigan, which raised $300 million to tackle heart disease. Kardigan joins a resurgent cardiovascular space, where several companies\u2014including those developing gene therapies\u2014are targeting myriad diseases. Finally, BioSpace senior editor Annalee Armstrong caught up with Daphne Zohar, CEO of BioSpace NextGen 2025 company Seaport Therapeutics Daphne Zohar, who offered her thoughts on the current state of the neuropsychiatric space.\n\n",

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla expressed measured confidence Monday about the pharma\u2019s plans and portfolio for obesity, anchored by its oral candidate danuglipron.\n\nAccording to reporting from Reuters, Bourla said that Pfizer is going \u201call in\u201d on obesity. The pharma has brought more experts onboard to help it \u201cmake better and more sound decisions,\u201d particularly when it comes to danuglipron, which the pharma is developing as a once-daily option for chronic weight management. Pfizer has plans to open a late-stage study of the asset later this year.\n\nDesigned to be orally available, danuglipron is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that, like weight-loss early-movers semaglutide, from Novo Nordisk, and tirzepatide, from Eli Lilly, works by promoting the secretion of insulin from the pancreas, slowing gastric emptying and suppressing appetite. Danuglipron is meant to make treatment more convenient than these already-approved treatments, however, which in turn could help it carve out a niche in the increasingly competitive obesity space.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m very cautious with danu,\u201d Bourla said at JPM25, according to Reuters. Pfizer had previously advanced a twice-daily formulation of danuglipron, but in December 2023, the pharma abandoned this program in favor of a once-daily dosing schedule after Phase IIb results showed high rates of toxicities.\n\nAnalysts seem split on Pfizer\u2019s danuglipron plans. In a July 2024 interview, Guggenheim Securities analyst Vamil Divan told BioSpace that \u201cwe\u2019re a little more cautious that this is going to turn out to be the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they just desperate and in some way [trying to] move in the [weight loss] space?\u201d Divan asked.\n\nMeanwhile, in a Monday note to investors, analysts from BMO Capital Markets wrote that Pfizer appears to be \u201chesitant to expand on danuglipron expectations,\u201d which have \u201cnotably been dampened\u201d following the mid-stage readout. \u201cPfizer remains confident in the opportunity in obesity, but continues to manage expectations highlighting additional assets in their portfolio which could expand beyond danuglipron,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nStill, given the current market landscape, pushing through with the oral danuglipron appears to be the best choice for Pfizer, which doesn\u2019t seem open to playing the injectable game, with Bourla on Monday saying that \u201cprobably it\u2019s a little bit too late.\u201d\n\nKailera Scores Phase II Weight-Loss Win\n\nMeanwhile, Massachusetts- and California-based biotech Kailera Therapeutics does not seem to share this reservation about injectable weight-loss treatments. Also on Monday, the company unveiled topline Phase II data for HRS9531, a subcutaneous dual agonist of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors\u2014a mechanism of action that it shares with Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide.\n\nAt 36 weeks, patients treated with the injectable medicine saw a mean placebo-adjusted weight reduction of 21.1%, an effect that was highly statistically significant, according to Kailera. The biotech also detected no signs of plateau in weight loss, indicating potentially greater efficacy with prolonged exposure. At the time of the readout, 59% of patients lost at least 20% of their body weight.\n\nKailera CEO Ron Renaud in a statement called these findings \u201ccompelling,\u201d pointing to the \u201csignificant impact HRS9531 could have for the treatment of obesity and related conditions.\u201d The biotech is currently building its clinical and manufacturing capabilities to push HRS9531 into Phase III development, Renaud added, though he did not reveal a detailed timeline.\n\nRenaud is scheduled to speak at JPM25 on Tuesday.",

On the cost side, Pfizer achieved $4 billion in savings and announced an additional $1.5 billion in margin improvements.\n\nIn R&D, leadership changed for the first time in 15 years, with Mikael Dolsten stepping down, and the team underwent a restructuring. Bourla also highlighted returns to shareholders, including over $7 billion in dividends and $4.5 billion toward debt repayment in the first nine months.\n\nAlso Read: Pfizer And GSK\u2019s RSV Vaccines Safety Labels Updated, FDA Adds Warning For Rare Neurological Disorder\n\nLooking at the period from 2025 to 2030, Pfizer is facing a significant loss of exclusivity (LOE) wave that will reduce revenues by about $17-18 billion between 2026 and 2028.\n\nBourla said the products acquired are projected to bring in $20 billion in revenue by 2030, which should offset those losses and provide some growth.\n\nAdditionally, the company is counting on revenues from products already launched and others in the pipeline. This is where the gap lies between Pfizer\u2019s outlook and market expectations.\n\nWhile new product launches in 2023 were underwhelming, Pfizer made significant progress in 2024, which makes the company optimistic about future performance.\n\nWhen asked about the visibility into the business, Albert Bourla added that the main difference between 2024 and 2025 is the stabilization of the COVID business.\n\nIn 2024, guidance reflected significant uncertainty, partly due to miscalculations in COVID-19 revenue, the transition of Paxlovid to a commercial model, and contract renegotiations with Europe. As a result, Pfizer was cautious when setting expectations.\n\nFor 2024, the company reconfirmed guidance in December. For 2025, projections are similarly strong, with COVID revenues expected to remain stable.\n\nVaccination rates are low but consistent, and Pfizer anticipates achieving similar results in 2025 as in 2024.\n\nFor Paxlovid, demand closely tracks COVID waves, which have followed a predictable pattern over the last three years\u2014two waves annually. Overall, the company foresees stability in our COVID business moving forward.\n\nPrice Action: PFE stock is down 1.49% at $26.40 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nRead Next:",

The last time it traded under $35 was April 3, 2020. By that point, the stock was already up more than 60% year to date amid hopes that it would develop a vaccine that could end the national emergency, which was declared on March 13.\n\nModerna\u2019s stock price peaked at $449 in September 2021 as the revenue from COVID-19 vaccines started pouring in. But unlike other pharmaceutical companies, Moderna predominantly sells vaccines. Once everyone who wanted a jab got their two doses, it was hard to keep up the momentum.\n\nPfizer, on the other hand, has a large portfolio of prescription drugs. Its financials are less tied to vaccines, and shares fell below their pre-Covid stock price of about $30 in 2023.\n\nThat could also be why Moderna\u2019s stock price has tanked a lot more in recent years now that demand for its vaccines has fallen and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nVaccine bulls often point to the fact that they are one outbreak \u2014 or medical breakthrough \u2014 away from another big revenue boost.

Morgan Healthcare Conference got off to a newsy start Jan. 13 in San Francisco, with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s CEO Joaquin Duato addressing a just-announced $14.6 billion purchase of Intra-Cellular Therapies -- and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering strong words for the potential anti-vaccine policies of the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe planned purchase of Intra-Cellular will give J&J control of mental health drug Caplyta, which Duato said \u201cwill lift our sales growth immediately,\u201d and which he predicts will become more than a $5 billion annual business.\n\nDuring the first three quarters of 2024, Caplyta garnered $483 million in sales. The drug is approved for treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (see this recent commercial), with an indication for major depressive disorder now being considered by the Food & Drug Administration.\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nO'Neil Trader, an analyst with Seeking Alpha, pointed out in a post that Monday\u2019s deal came to fruition only following last week\u2019s settlement of patent litigation between Intra-Cellular and Sandoz. That agreement essentially gave Intra-Cellular, and now J&J, an exclusive on the drug through 2040.\n\n\u201cI believe J&J is paying (at least) a fair price, with decent likelihood of creating substantial long-term value for the company,\u201d Trader wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, expressed concerns to Reuters of possible antitrust problems getting government approval for the deal, even under the new Trump administration.\n\nReuters pointed out that J&J\u2019s existing schizophrenia drug, \u201cpaliperidone, sold under multiple brand names such as Invega and Xeplion, brought in $3.16 billion in sales in the first nine months of 2024.\u201d\n\nDuato expressed optimism about working with the new administration, telling J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott that \u201cwe are going to be able to discuss how we can have pro-innovation, pro-access policies here in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have worked with 24 different presidential administrations,\u201d he said of J&J\u2019s 139-year history.\n\nDuato was followed on the J.P. Morgan stage by Pfizer CEO Bourla, who was a bit more outspoken about the incoming Trump team than he had been last month in presenting the firm\u2019s 2025 guidance.\n\nWhile echoing Duato in saying that \u201cthe opportunities outweigh the risks\u201d when it comes to policies on patient access to healthcare (\u201cout-of-pocket is extremely expensive, we need change on that\u201d) and innovation (\u201cChina is growing faster and faster, and we should not let them take the lead\u201d), Bourla was blunt in comments about Rober F. Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s choice to head Health & Human Services:\n\n\u201cClearly, the things that he has said [about] vaccines in the past are in complete contradiction with what we believe, what the medical community believes, what the scientific community believes, and what regulators all over the world believe.\n\n\u201cIf he does some of the things that he has spoken in the past,\u201d Bourla continued, RFK Jr. could expect to be opposed by \u201cthe entire medical community, the entire scientific community,\u201d plus insurance companies \u201cbecause they know [vaccinations are] very-cost effective, and also employers, who really believe that by using vaccinations, they are reducing their health care costs rather than increasing it.\u201d\n\nThen, mentioning polio in particular, he warned that if vaccination thresholds get too low, \u201cwe will start having evidence that will be detrimental for him and for the administration. \u201c\n\nOn a happier note, \u201cthe president-elect is very much focused on cancer. He has seen a lot of his friends and people that he knew dying from cancer and he keeps asking every time we meet, \u2018What are we doing with cancer and can we cure it?\u2019\u201d",

Here\u2019s what you need to know heading into Day Two.\n\nPfizer \u201cAll In\u201d On Obesity\n\nPfizer announced plans to go \u201call in\u201d on its experimental obesity drug danuglipron. Calling it \u201cdanu\u201d for short, CEO Albert Bourla said late-stage studies are likely for the second half of 2025. With danuglipron, a once-daily pill, Pfizer aims to avoid directly competing with the current injectable drugs dominating the market, Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound. \u201cProbably it\u2019s a little bit too late,\u201d for that, Bourla said). Instead, according to Bourla, Pfizer aims to get into the obesity market through either orals or injectables with a different mechanism of action from semaglutide-based treatments like Wegovy and Zepbound.\n\nRegeneron Gears Up for Phase III Readouts\n\nRegeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer gave updates on the biotech\u2019s seemingly full pipeline. Itepekimab, an investigational treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will deliver Phase III data this year, potentially adding another drug to stand alongside Dupixent, its COPD drug already on the market in the US. Phase III results for two cancer drugs, fianlimab, a checkpoint inhibitor for melanoma and linvoseltamab, a bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, are also expected this year. Ordspono, an antibody used for treating lymphoma, is already approved in the EU and Regeneron is preparing resubmission for FDA approval after an early 2024 rejection due to issues with patient enrollment status in confirmatory trials.\n\nSarepta Touts Strong Launch for Elevidys\n\nSarepta Therapeutics announced a large market take for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy Elevidys, just shy of $400 million. Sarepta is turning Elevidys right around and putting it back in the pipeline, expecting a Phase III readout for in a related condition, limb-girdle muscle dystrophy. Market analysis Monday from BMO Capital Markets has Sarepta pushing its sales north of $2 billion globally if a potential EU approval comes through. Also touted at JPM25 was a previously announced $10 billion deal with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to produce seven RNA interference products aimed at facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and spinocerebellar ataxia 2.\n\nBioNTech Pushes Further into Cancer\n\nBioNTech, springboarding off its global COVID-19 mRNA vaccine successes, touted pushes into mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies and anti-PD-1 antibodies. BNT327/ PM8002, in development with Biotheus, is in multiple Phase I, II, and III trials for small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and other solid tumors. That\u2019s on top of autogene cevumeran, an mRNA cancer immunotherapy developed with Genentech/Roche, for which the first patient has been treated in a Phase II trial for urothelial carcinoma; a Phase II trial in colorectal cancer is also underway. BNT323/DB-1303, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for endometrial cancer, is wrapping up a Phase I trial with data expected in 2025. BioNTech noted no news regarding its COVID-19 vaccines, besides reporting stable market shares and purchase agreements in place with the EU.\n\nModerna Bearish on Vaccines Despite Analyst Takes\n\nRival vaccine manufacturer Moderna, for its part, felt bearish on vaccination rates at JPM. But Truist analysts Asthika Goonewardene and Karina Rabayeva said that they believe the declining outlook on COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2025 may be restricted to just Moderna\u2019s vaccine, perhaps reflecting a consumer survey produced by Truist showing that consumers preferred the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 48% of the time versus 29% for Moderna. Nevertheless, Moderna is pushing forward on a pipeline of an RSV vaccine for patients 60 years and older which just showed positive Phase III data, as well as a seasonal flu vaccine, a combo flu/COVID vaccine, a cytomegalovirus vaccine, and most timely of all, a norovirus vaccine, all of which are currently in Phase III trials.",

He highlighted the rationale for adding an anti\u2013PD-1 agent to BCG in the treatment of patients with BCG-naive, high-risk NMIBC, and detailed how sasanlimab plus BCG could alter the treatment paradigm in high-risk NMIBC if the CREST findings support regulatory approval.\n\nShore is the primary investigator of the CREST trial and medical director of the Carolina Urologic Research Center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nOncLive: What differentiates the anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody sasanlimab from other immune checkpoint inhibitors?\n\nShore: The most important aspect is that sasanlimab is administered subcutaneously. Historically, PD-1 blockers had been administrated intravenously. [CREST] was the first phase 3 trial in bladder cancer [to evaluate this type of subcutaneous treatment], with sasanlimab administered once every 4 weeks in a subcutaneous delivery system.\n\nThe obvious advantage to [subcutaneous administration] is a more rapid throughput in the clinic. Whether you\u2019re in urology or medical oncology, you do not need to deliver therapy intravenously [IV], and it can be administered [faster]. There's not as much technical skill involved in subcutaneous administration vs IV access and administration. That provides nice efficiency for clinics and patients.\n\nWhat was the rationale for adding sasanlimab to standard-of-care BCG for patients with BCG-naive, high-risk NMIBC?\n\nWe knew from earlier work with other checkpoint inhibitors that PD-1 blockers have been beneficial in BCG-unresponsive CIS, and we have compelling data for other PD-1 blockers being successful in patients with frontline, metastatic urothelial cancer. [CREST] looked to combine the old, standard use of BCG [in the BCG-naive setting in combination with sasanlimab], using BCG as induction only or as induction and maintenance.\n\n[CREST] was a 3-arm trial [that enrolled] patients with high-risk, BCG-naive NMIBC. They had either high-grade papillary disease, T1 lamina propria invasion, or carcinoma in situ [CIS]\u2014the more traditional definition of high-risk NMIBC. The 3-arm study [enrolled] over 1000 patients globally. Patients in arm A received traditional induction and maintenance BCG in conjunction with 2 years of sasanlimab [given] once every 4 weeks. [Patients in] arm B received sasanlimab for the 2-year period; however, those patients received only induction BCG with no maintenance. In arm C, patients did not receive sasanlimab; they received induction and maintenance BCG for 2 years.\n\nTopline data showed CREST met its primary end point with sasanlimab plus BCG improving EFS vs BCG alone. What are the potential implications of these findings?\n\nThe traditional challenge that we face with patients with high-risk NMIBC is that they could have recurrent disease and then are considered unresponsive to BCG. Many of these patients may also go on to progress to a more advanced histopathology. Therefore, by adding an immunotherapeutic\u2014as a class, [these agents] have been known to have benefit in muscle-invasive disease, metastatic disease, and BCG-unresponsive CIS\u2014the goal was to cut down on the likelihood of recurrence, progression, or death.\n\nIt's remarkably rewarding to see that this was a successful study. After we present [and publish] the full data set, [sasanlimab plus BCG] certainly has a potential for regulatory approval.\n\nIf sasanlimab plus BCG does earn approval from regulatory authorities, what would be the implications for the treatment paradigm for BCG-naive, high-risk NMIBC?\n\nIt [would be] important for patients and clinicians because it would expand our armamentarium for shared decision-making. [There could be] patients who would say, \u2018I want more than just BCG,\u2019 which clearly has a beneficial effect as induction and maintenance. Are there going to be specific types of patients and histopathology [where we would] want to combine traditional BCG with a PD-1 blocker?\n\nCould there be a potential role for sasanlimab in combination with BCG outside of the population of patients with high-risk NMIBC?\n\nI think there will clearly be a role for PD-1 blockers in intermediate-risk disease. There are several ongoing early-phase trials right now combining PD-1 blockers with other novel mechanisms of action for patients with intermediate-risk disease.\n\nIn addition, there are opportunities to combine PD-1 blockers with neoadjuvant strategies and bladder-sparing strategies, in addition to BCG-unresponsive combinations. It's an exciting time for researchers and health care providers who care patients with bladder cancer, and that's throughout the entire continuum, [including] NMIBC, bladder-sparing opportunities, neoadjuvant [therapy] prior to radical cystectomy, perioperative therapeutics around cystectomy, and then all the wonderful work we've already seen with frontline and metastatic disease.\n\nReference\n\nPfizer\u2019s sasanlimab in combination with BCG improves event-free survival in patients with BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Image Credit: Ververidis Vasilis / Shutterstock.\n\nPfizer is cutting costs and refocussing its research and development (R&D) operations in a bid to maintain and grow revenues in 2025, says CEO Albert Bourla.\n\nThe company achieved its 2024 goal of achieving $4bn in net cost savings according to Bourla and expects to save a further $500m in 2025, which it intends to allocate for its reorganised R&D. Bourla said the company views the cancer and metabolic disease spaces particularly as opportunities for innovation.\n\nBourla outlined the company\u2019s vision for the next few years in a presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference taking place 13\u201316 January in San Francisco.\n\nHe emphasised a priority reshuffling within the company\u2019s clinical pipeline, now overseen by Dr. Chris Boshoff who was appointed head of R&D in November 2024. This, he said, is expected to lead to 2025 revenues of $61bn\u2013$64bn. He also touched upon the challenges of monitoring and driving R&D productivity.\n\nIn oncology, the CEO placed emphasis on the CDK4 inhibitor, PF-07220060, along with vedotin-based antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting IB6 and PDL-1 as high-potential assets set for prioritised development. Bourla also noted further development expected for Elrexfio (elranatamab), Pfizer\u2019s monoclonal antibody in Phase III trialling to treat multiple myeloma.\n\nSignificantly, the company is poised to make a foray into the metabolic space with its oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) danuglipron. In a space that is currently dominated by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly with their injectable GLP-1RAs, Bourla said the company aims to establish itself close behind Lilly in the oral GLP-1RA space.\n\nLast year, Bourla had to face investor scrutiny as the company\u2019s share price and revenues declined as the demand for Covid-19 products waned. A tepid performance earlier in the year spurred activist investor Starboard Value to acquire a $1bn stake in the company and attempt to oust Bourla as CEO in October 2024. However, a positive Q3 and internal support for the CEO seemed to have halted Starboard\u2019s plans.\n\nThe company now aims to maintain the momentum it gained late last year. Among the efforts to do sis is an attempt to embolden profits from Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 therapeutic Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) with a next-generation formulation that has the potential to eliminate the drug-drug interaction concerns, which previously limited prescription of Paxlovid by physicians.\n\nAs sector experts look to gauge the potential impact of an incoming Trump administration on the pharma space, all eyes are on what senior executives gathered at the conference have to say. On that subject, Bourla stated the potential risks posed to pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer will likely be outweighed by opportunities presented, notably the President Elect\u2019s interest in cancer therapy innovation.\n\nHe did, however, express concern regarding Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s potential influence over the pharmaceutical industry, noting that his controversial views on vaccination are likely to fuel resistance from the scientific and medical community, along with insurers and employers.",

            "content": "Dividends hold particular significance, especially as the broader market has experienced consecutive gains of over 20%, a scenario not seen since the late 1990s. Moreover, the low payout ratio, currently at 29% compared to the historical average of 50%, suggests there is considerable potential for companies to increase their dividend payouts. Kwon pointed out that another key factor supporting dividend investing is the growing number of retired baby boomers seeking income. With cash products yielding around 4%, there is a strong demand for dividends, as investors are looking for immediate cash returns and are pressuring companies to increase their dividend distributions.\n\nDividends historically accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total return from 1936 to 2012 but have contributed only 16% over the past ten years, according to a research note from BofA Securities released late last year. Looking forward, Kwon anticipates that dividends will have a more significant impact on total returns compared to the previous decade.\n\nAnalysts note that, from a broad perspective, earnings growth has traditionally been the primary driver of dividends. Last year saw strong earnings growth, and they anticipate an even better performance in 2025. Goldman predicts an 11% increase in earnings per share for this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024. This is expected to result in a 7% rise in dividends, compared to a 6% increase last year. Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 12% boost in dividends this year, fueled by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nThe year 2024 proved favorable for dividends, even though the Dividend Aristocrats Index lagged behind the broader market. Throughout the year, US companies consistently increased or upheld their dividend payouts. In addition, several major tech firms began offering dividends, signaling to investors that it's possible for a company to focus on both growth and shareholder returns. By September 30, 2024, approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P index were distributing dividends, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the past decade. Notably, nearly 24% of these dividend-paying firms were in the technology sector, a significant increase from 13% ten years ago. Sectors such as healthcare and industrials also experienced notable growth in the number of companies offering dividends. This broader distribution of dividends has expanded the range of investment opportunities, giving equity-income investors more access to high-growth, dynamic, and innovative companies. Given these developments, analysts remain optimistic about their performance heading into 2025.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThis optimism about dividend stocks is largely rooted in their historical performance, as they have been instrumental in reducing overall portfolio volatility and can help cushion losses when stock prices decline. Research indicates that dividend-paying stocks often outperform their non-dividend-paying counterparts during bear markets, such as during the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis. This may be because companies that pay dividends are typically larger, more established, and more profitable, making them more resilient than the broader market.\n\nFrom October 2019 to September 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in the market\u2019s total performance, equity income funds demonstrated lower volatility and reduced downside risk compared to the broader market. Given this, we will discuss the most reliable dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to identify companies with a history of dividend growth spanning over 10 years. From this group, we selected companies offering dividend yields of at least 1% as of January 12. From that selection, we identified the ten stocks that hedge funds favored the most during the third quarter of 2024, based on data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nAn American multinational pharmaceutical industry company, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was the first drugmaker to launch a COVID-19 vaccine in the US, ahead of Moderna. In addition to its vaccine, the large pharmaceutical company offers a wide range of other products, including treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancer, migraines, and more. According to analysts, the company's growth potential might be stronger than many realize. The company has made significant investments in internal research and development, along with several important acquisitions. These efforts have brought notable additions to Pfizer's portfolio, such as the RSV vaccine Abrysvo, the migraine treatment Nurtec ODT, and cancer drugs Adcetris and Padcev.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported revenue of $17.7 billion, a notable 32% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The company also effectively met the increased demand for Paxlovid during the recent rise in COVID-19 cases. Parnassus Investments highlighted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer\u2019s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us. The company completed its acquisition of Seagen, which should strengthen Pfizer\u2019s pipeline in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Pfizer also offers an attractive dividend yield.\u201d\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) declared a 2.4% increase in its quarterly dividend on December 13, 2024. This was the company's 15th consecutive year of dividend growth, which makes PFE one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company now pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.44%, as of January 12. This strong dividend history comes from its solid cash position. In the first nine months of 2024, the company distributed $7.1 billion through dividends.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 80 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held investments in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is more than $3 billion.\n\nOverall PFE ranks 7th on our list of the most reliable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

( PFE ) is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing healthcare through discovering, developing, manufacturing, and distributing innovative medicines and vaccines. The company's extensive portfolio encompasses products like Eliquis, Comirnaty, and Paxlovid, addressing worldwide health challenges. The New York-based company is expected to announce its fiscal Q4 earnings results before the market opens on Tuesday, Feb. 4.\n\nAhead of this event, analysts expect the drugmaker to report a profit of $0.48 per share , up significantly from $0.10 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has surpassed Wall Street's earnings estimates in the last four quarters. In Q3, PFE exceeded the consensus EPS estimate by 65.6%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect PFE to report an EPS of $2.94, up 59.8% from $1.84 in fiscal 2023 .\n\nShares of PFE have dipped 7.5% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind both the S&P 500 Index's ( $SPX ) 22.1 surge and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLV ) marginal drop over the same period.\n\nDespite strong Q3 results, Pfizer stock fell 1.4% on Oct. 29 because of mixed market perceptions . The company posted better-than-expected Q3 revenue of $17.7 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, with impressive growth fueled by COVID products Paxlovid and Comirnaty. However, CEO Albert Bourla's defense of acquisitions criticized by activist investor Starboard Value raised concerns about potentially wasteful spending. While Pfizer raised its 2024 guidance to $61 billion - $64 billion in revenue and $2.75 per share - $2.95 per share in earnings, doubts about growth sustainability outside Covid products contributed to investor unease, dragging the stock down.\n\nAnalysts' consensus view on Pfizer\u2019s stock is cautiously optimistic, with a \"Moderate Buy\" rating overall. Among 24 analysts covering the stock, 11 recommend \"Strong Buy,\" 12 suggest \"Hold,\" and one indicates \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d This configuration is slightly more bullish than three months ago, with 10 analysts suggesting a \"Strong Buy.\"\n\nAs of writing, PFE is trading below the average analyst price target of $31.43.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The bra size of an average British women is 36DD.\n\nRapid breast growth is a rare condition medically known as gigantomastia.\n\nExperts are still exploring what triggers it though some cases are known to be the result of hormone problem or a reaction to certain drugs.\n\nDoctors, who reported the case in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u2014Global Open, suggested the vaccine may have triggered a cause of gigantomastia called pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH).\n\nPASH itself a poorly understood condition where cells in the breast tissue called myofibroblasts overgrow as benign lumps.\n\nIt is rare, having only been medically documented some 200 times, and no previous examples had any known link to vaccines.\n\nThe unnamed woman is shown above after receiving breast reduction surgery. She is considering further procedures to get back to her normal cup size\n\nBut how exactly the vaccine would have triggered PASH is unknown.\n\nThe woman in the report had no underlying conditions and while her breasts seemed swollen and saggy, there were no masses.\n\nAn ultrasound and CT scan showed slightly swollen lymph nodes around the woman's armpits and dense blood vessels, which the medics believe was from the enlarged breast tissue.\n\nAnalysis of tissue samples taken from biopsies confirmed the growth was result of PASH.\n\nDespite a course of treatment involving steroids and antibiotics no reduction in breast size was noted.\n\nShe chose to undergo a breast reduction procedure to take her bust size down to a DD 11 months after the jab.\n\nThe patient underwent another procedure five months later due to problems with asymmetry, taking her down to her original B cup size.\n\nWhile the experts said the timing suggested a link between the Covid jab and PASH, they said it cannot be proven it was the culprit and called for further research.\n\n'The association between the COVID-19 vaccine, PASH, and breast hypertrophy warrants further investigation to comprehend the spectrum of reactions to the vaccine,' they said.\n\nThe graph shows the cumulative number of Covid jabs dished out in the UK as of November 2023\n\nHowever, they criticised medics who dismissed the woman's concerns that her symptoms were linked to the vaccine.\n\n'Although a temporal relationship does not establish causality, dismissing patient concerns can erode trust,' they wrote.\n\n'Physicians should consider and value patient concerns when developing therapeutic relationships.'\n\nIn 2021, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found Covid vaccines could lead to swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, leading to abnormal findings on mammograms and breast ultrasounds.\n\nBritish health officials were also aware of this link, issuing a notice to staff that while this may occur, any abnormal findings from these scans should still be investigated as potential breast cancer symptoms and not dismissed as a vaccine reaction.\n\nSystems like MHRA's Yellow Card reports, in theory, allow experts to track potential side effects through active monitoring, though some MPs are concerned the system isn't proactive enough.\n\nSuch reports can serve as a 'canary in the coal mine' if patterns emerge with a particular drug, type of patient, and a suspected reaction.",

A new era in drug discovery has arrived. \u201cPostEra, the Boston-based biotech expands $610M partnership with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, spearheading the AI revolution in Drug discovery.\n\nThis landmark agreement aims to conquer cancer with AI as the most powerful weapon yet forged. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs)- are a promising class of drugs used to treat cancer by eliminating tumor cells while keeping the healthy cells safe. It just does not end there; they are also focusing on expanding their existing $260M Ai lab, which resonates around small molecule therapeutics.\n\nPostEra said it would receive $12 million upfront in a press conference held on 7th January and is qualified to receive additional milestone payments and labeled royalties on approved products that result from this collaboration.\n\nFortifying Sucess:\n\nThe long-standing Ai lab partnership was aimed at testing the efficacy of machine learning in rug discovery with a relatively independent framework. Advances in small molecules programs is a result of this collaboration.\n\nPfizer nominated the maximum number of programs for further development, a vote of confidence for PastEra\u2019s AI-integrated perspective.\n\nADCs are like stealth aircraft, they promote targeted cancer therapies.It has the precision of monoclonal antibodies and the strength of cytotoxic drugs, they only target the tumor cells, and directly deliver the payload into the cancer cells while keeping the healthy cells away from harm.\n\nPfixer\u2019s keen interest in ADC is nothing new; in 2023, it acquired Seagen, a leader in ADCs, for $43 billion. As Morris noted, \u201cThe potential of ADCs to combine targeted delivery with high efficacy has made them one of the hottest areas in oncology, but challenges remain, particularly in designing better payloads.\u201d\n\nHow can Ai help?\n\nPostEra\u2019s AI engine, Proton, optimizes the design of payloads- the component that delivers a lethal blow to tumor cells. Optimizing payloads requires navigating through a maze of complicated biological interactions and chemical properties. How is Proton different? It has advanced integration of generative chemistry and synthesis-aware design capabilities, positioned to tackle these challenges head-on.\n\nProven track Record\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time PostEra and Pfizer have been in the spotlight together. Their prior vitory \u2013 the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors using the Proton platform played a crucial role in developing potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitors against the virus. Showcasing how AI-driven drug discovery methods can accelerate preclinical testing.\n\nAlpha Lee, Chief Scientific Officer of PostEra, emphasized: \u201cPeer-reviewed publications with Pfizer have already demonstrated the real-world impact of AI-driven drug discovery in achieving preclinical milestones faster than expected.\u201d\n\nFuture of Medicine\n\nThis $610 million partnership is a landmark achievement, not just for PostEra and Pfizer but for the entire field of drug discovery. It signals a new era where AI is no longer a futuristic fiction but a powerful tool transforming how we develop life-saving medications.\n\nPostEra & Pfizer Partnership: $610 Million Ai- driven ADC Breakthrough",

Despite heavy redactions, McKernan was able to assist in fact-checking the unredacted citations, exposing key discrepancies between what Pfizer is saying and what the science really shows.\n\nOne critical area of concern lies in the presence of residual DNA in the mRNA vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, which have stringent regulations controlling the amount of what is referred to as \u201cnaked\u201d DNA, the modified RNA vaccines are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which protect both the DNA and RNA from body mechanisms that would otherwise rapidly degrade these contaminants.\n\nMcKernan warns that the inclusion of the SV40 promoter, which is designed to integrate into the host\u2019s DNA, could lead to serious risks such as fertility issues and cancer, especially given the lack of long-term safety testing.\n\nDespite these risks, Pfizer assures Health Canada that its vaccines are non-oncogenic, meaning they do not cause cancer. However, their package insert contradicts this claim where it\u2019s stated that carcinogenicity (and genotoxicity) were never assessed, since they were considered irrelevant. While Pfizer cites billions of doses administered over three years as evidence of safety, this claim is unsupported by proper scientific analysis, relying instead on simulation models funded by the Gates Foundation to promote confirmation bias. McKernan emphasizes that focusing on theoretical lives saved by the vaccines distracts from the real issue of contamination.\n\nCompounding these concerns, Health Canada requested clarification from Pfizer regarding the size distribution of residual DNA fragments and circular plasmids found in the vaccines \u2013 something you think they would ask for before the shot was injected into the arms of millions of Canadians.\n\nAlthough Pfizer provided them with this data, the government response documents were almost entirely redacted. McKernan\u2019s findings have been validated by an FDA lab, where even high school students confirmed the DNA contamination, undermining claims that his lab was somehow at fault. McKernan underscores that this contamination issue is not confined to laboratory settings, but has already spread in real-world situations, raising alarms about public health risks.\n\nAs McKernan works to bring attention to the issue, he calls for greater accountability and oversight. The widespread failure to identify these contaminants, despite simple testing methods, calls into question the competence of health regulators globally, including those in Canada.",

            "content": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Pfizer, AbbVie and Royalty Pharma, as well as updates from Biogen and Alkeus Pharmaceuticals that you may have missed.\n\nPfizer on Friday said its PD-1 inhibitor sasanlimab, when combined with standard therapy in people with bladder cancer, delayed death and disease complications longer than standard therapy alone. The Phase 3 trial could give Pfizer\u2019s subcutaneous immunotherapy an edge over rival drugs, like Merck & Co.\u2019s Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, which are approved to treat people with more advanced disease. Pfizer tested sasanlimab with an immunotherapy called Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin in people whose cancer hadn\u2019t spread beyond the bladder lining after surgery. If sasanlimab wins Food and Drug Administration approval, it could be the fourth PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor cleared as an under-the-skin shot. The FDA has already approved subcutaneous versions of Roche\u2019s Tecentriq and Opdivo, and Merck has positive Phase 3 data in hand for under-the-skin Keytruda. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAbbVie has recorded an approximately $3.5 billion impairment charge related to its purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics, according to a new financial filing. Through its $8.7 billion acquisition, which completed last summer, AbbVie got a pipeline of experimental brain drugs, including one that looked to be a promising new therapy for schizophrenia. But that drug suffered a major clinical setback late last year. The \u201coutright failure\u201d \u2014 as one analyst described it \u2014 was so significant that AbbVie subsequently lost more than $40 billion in market value. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nRoyalty Pharma is simplifying its corporate structure, announcing Friday a deal to absorb the management company that\u2019s run Royalty since its founding in 1996. Royalty will acquire RP Management LLC using equity and some $100 million in cash, along with assuming RP Management\u2019s debt. By internalizing RP Management, Royalty will no longer pay it a 6.5% fee and a small cut of the investments it makes. Royalty expects the roughly $1.1 billion in total transaction value will be \u201cmore than offset\u201d by cash savings of at least $1.6 billion over the next decade. Royalty Pharma acquires stakes in experimental drugs, buying up rights to future royalties once they are approved. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nEli Lilly has licensed rights to an experimental drug for idiopathy pulmonary fibrosis, announcing Friday a deal with biotechnology company Mediar Therapeutics. The antibody drug, dubbed MTX-463, is set to enter Phase 2 testing later this year, which Mediar will handle. Afterwards, Lilly can lead all further development and marketing, a right for which it is paying Mediar $99 million in upfront and near-term milestone fees. Mediar could receive up to $687 million more in additional milestone payments. MTX-463 targets a protein called WISP1 that\u2019s been linked to fibrosis. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics on Friday said it would reduce its workforce by 65% after deciding to refocus its research on immunology and inflammation. As part of the changes, Barinthus\u2019 chief operating officer and chief financial officer will step down, and the company will close a site in the U.K. Notably, Barinthus no longer plans to invest in a hepatitis B treatment it was developing and will instead seek a partner for the program. Moving forward, the firm will prioritize a celiac disease drug program that\u2019s expected to deliver Phase 1 data this year. All told, the changes extend Barinthus\u2019 cash runway into 2027. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nBiogen is adding yet another new member to its leadership team, announcing Thursday the appointment of Adam Feire as head of business development and external innovation. Feire most recently held a top position in Novartis' business development unit. His addition is the latest in a string of changes to Biogen's C-suite that have taken place since Christopher Viehbacher, who led Sanofi for six years, took over as CEO in late 2022. In his short time at the helm, Viehbacher has made dealmaking more of a priority for Biogen, as exemplified by the company\u2019s $7.3 billion purchase of Reata Pharmaceuticals and $1.2 billion acquisition of HI-Bio. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nAlkeus Pharmaceuticals on Thursday said it plans to submit an approval application to the FDA sometime this year for a Stargardt disease drug it\u2019s developing. The drug, called gildeuretinol acetate, has been tested in several trials, among them an open-label study of people in the earliest stages of the progressive eye disease. New results from that study, summarized by Alkeus Thursday, show two more treated individuals had stable vision over two years post-treatment. Alkeus hopes the treatment can preserve sight. Data from a placebo-controlled study are expected this year. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

            "content": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced positive topline results from its pivotal Phase 3 CREST trial evaluating sasanlimab, an investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) as induction therapy with or without maintenance in patients with BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The study met its primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) by investigator assessment, demonstrating a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement with sasanlimab in combination with BCG (induction and maintenance) as compared to BCG alone (induction and maintenance).\n\n\u201cPatients with BCG-na\u00efve high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer have high rates of recurrence and progression,\u201d said Neal Shore, M.D., FACS, Medical Director for the Carolina Urologic Research Center, and lead investigator for the CREST trial. \u201cThese study results demonstrate the potential for sasanlimab in combination with BCG to redefine the treatment paradigm for patients living with BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including patients with carcinoma in-situ (CIS), providing prolonged event-free survival which may delay or reduce the need for more aggressive treatment options. Administered subcutaneously every four weeks, sasanlimab, if approved, could also help lower the treatment burden on both patients and healthcare systems.\u201d\n\nEach year, approximately 100,000 people globally are diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC.3 Induction therapy with BCG followed by maintenance has been the standard of care for patients with high-risk NMIBC for decades.4 40-50% of patients experience recurrent disease, often requiring radical cystectomy,5,6,7 which is associated with significant risks8,9,10 and bladder-sparing treatment options are still limited.11,12\n\n\u201cThe initial therapy of high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with BCG has not advanced in decades. Today\u2019s pivotal Phase 3 CREST results are potentially practice-changing, representing the first advance in therapy for BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk, non-muscle invasive cancer in over 30 years,\u201d said Roger Dansey, M.D., Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cThese results reinforce Pfizer\u2019s leadership in genitourinary cancer research and development, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to deliver new treatment options for patients with bladder cancer.\u201d\n\nThe overall safety profile of sasanlimab in combination with BCG was generally consistent with the known profile of BCG and data reported from clinical trials with sasanlimab. The profile of sasanlimab was also generally consistent with the reported safety profile of PD-1 inhibitors.\n\nResults will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress. Pfizer plans to discuss these data with global health authorities to support potential regulatory filings. Sasanlimab also continues to be investigated in combination with Pfizer\u2019s antibody drug conjugate (ADC) portfolio in advanced solid tumors.\n\nAbout CREST\n\nThe CREST trial is a Phase 3, multinational, randomized, open-label, three parallel-arm study of sasanlimab, an anti-PD-1 mAb, in combination with BCG (BCG induction with or without BCG maintenance) versus BCG (induction and maintenance) in participants with BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk NMIBC. Patients were randomized to receive sasanlimab 300 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection every four weeks up to cycle 25 (cycle = four weeks), in combination with BCG once weekly for six consecutive weeks (induction period) followed (Arm A) or not (Arm B) by maintenance with BCG, or BCG induction and maintenance up to cycle 25 (Arm C). The primary endpoint is EFS as assessed by the investigator, between Arm A and C, defined as the time from randomization to the earliest of recurrence of high-grade disease, progression of disease, persistence of CIS, or death. Key secondary endpoints include EFS as assessed by the investigator between Arm B and Arm C.\n\nAbout Sasanlimab\n\nSasanlimab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 mAb that binds to human programmed death-1 (PD-1) to block its interaction with PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2. PD-1 is a protein expressed on T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and B cells, that functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands and may play an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. It can be administered through a once every four weeks subcutaneous injection by prefilled syringe (2mL).\n\nIn early-stage clinical studies, sasanlimab administered at 300 mg SC every four weeks showed clinical efficacy in advanced solid tumors and advanced urothelial cancer. In addition to NMIBC, sasanlimab is being evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials with other novel combinations.\n\nAbout Pfizer Oncology\n\nAt Pfizer Oncology, we are at the forefront of a new era in cancer care.

            "content": "Pfizer\u2019s investigational PD-1 inhibitor sasanlimab achieves significant efficacy in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a topline readout from the Phase III CREST trial revealed on Friday.\n\nCREST is a pivotal randomized and open-label study that enrolled 1,070 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients who had not yet been treated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunotherapy. Participants were assigned to one of three parallel arms: Two underwent an induction regimen of BCG plus 300-mg subcutaneous sasanlimab followed (arm A) or not (arm B) by maintenance BCG. Patients in the third groupreceived the control treatment of a BCG induction and maintenance regimen.\n\nThe study\u2019s primary outcome is event-free survival (EFS) between arm A and controls, defined as the time from group assignment to disease progression, persistence of carcinoma, the first high-grade disease recurrence or death. EFS measured between arm B and the control group was set as a key secondary endpoint.\n\nPfizer did not provide specific data in its news release on Friday, revealing only that sasanlimab plus BCG\u2014given as induction and maintenance\u2014leads to \u201cclinically meaningful and statistically significant\u201d improvements in EFS versus BCG alone. As for safety, CREST found sasanlimab to be well-tolerated overall, with adverse events that were consistent with what had been reported in previous trials and with the PD-1 class more broadly.\n\nPfizer COO Roger Dansey in a statement called these results \u201cpotentially practice-changing\u201d for BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk NMIBC patients, for which the initial therapy \u201chas not advanced in decades.\u201d In this indication, induction and maintenance treatment with BCG has been the standard regimen for years\u2014even though up to half of patients suffer from recurrence and require surgery, according to Pfizer.\n\nCREST\u2019s findings represent \u201cthe first advance in therapy for BCG-na\u00efve, high-risk, non-muscle invasive cancer in over 30 years,\u201d Dansey added.\n\nWhile Pfizer will continue to test potential combination regimens of the PD-1 blocker with its other antibody-drug conjugates, the company plans on using CREST\u2019s data to support a regulatory filing for sasanlimab in this indication, according to the announcement.\n\nIf approved, Pfizer claims that sasanlimab would become the first PD-1 inhibitor indicated as a combination therapy with BCG that can prolong EFS specifically in high-risk patients who had never been treated with BCG.\n\nThis dosing profile will help set sasanlimab apart in a space dominated by Merck\u2019s blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda, which is widely considered to be a cornerstone oncology asset. In NMIBC, Keytruda can only be used on patients who have already undergone BCG treatment but were found to be unresponsive, as per its label. Sasanlimab is also designed to be administered subcutaneously, as opposed to Keytruda\u2019s intravenous route.",

Reviewed content Verdict: Inaccurate Claim: \u201cPfizer just released a few days ago the side effects of the jab\u201d ; this lists contains more than forty medical conditions that are side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Source: Facebook Social media users , 2025-01-02 Verdict detail Factually inaccurate: The list of medical conditions cited in the claim wasn\u2019t released by Pfizer in 2025. It originates from a document submitted to the FDA in 2021 and has been publicly accessible online since 2022.\n\nMisleading: The medical conditions listed are adverse events reported following vaccination, not confirmed side effects. Adverse events are occurrences that follow vaccination but lack evidence of a causal link to the vaccine. By conflating these terms, the claim misleads readers into assuming causation where none has been established. See our method of evaluation Full Claim \u201cPfizer just released a few days ago the side effects of the jab\u201d ; this lists contains more than forty medical conditions that are side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\n\nReview\n\nFacebook posts circulating in early 2025 claimed that Pfizer had \u201cjust released\u201d a list of side effects associated with its COVID-19 vaccine. These posts shared a list of approximately 40 to 50 medical conditions purportedly linked to the vaccine, including positive antisperm antibodies, epileptic psychosis, and stillbirth (see examples here and here). However, this claim is both inaccurate and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the list isn\u2019t new, nor did Pfizer \u201cjust release\u201d it, as the posts claimed. A similar list appeared in a 2023 article by the Argentinian outlet El Cronista, which cited a 2022 article from The South African. These articles claimed that Pfizer provided a list of over 1,200 potential vaccine-related side effects to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, investigations by Reuters in 2022 and AFP in 2023 debunked this allegation. Science Feedback also reviewed that claim in 2022 and found it misleading. Thus, the 2025 posts merely recycled a previously refuted claim without providing any new information.\n\nSecond, the list submitted to the FDA described medical conditions reported in the first three months following vaccine authorization among vaccinated individuals, but this doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine caused these events. The use of the term \u201cside effects\u201d in these claims is misleading, as it implies a causal relationship that hasn\u2019t been established.\n\nThe list originates from a Pfizer document submitted to the FDA in early 2021 as part of the company\u2019s Biologics License Application for COVID-19 vaccine approval. This document includes Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) gathered from health agencies across 63 countries, including the United States.\n\nThe Reuters review highlighted that these adverse events were collected from national reporting systems, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the U.S. and the Yellow Card system in the U.K. While these systems are critical for monitoring vaccine safety, they can\u2019t be used alone to establish a causal link between vaccination and reported medical conditions. As Science Feedback has explained on multiple occasions, such databases are useful for identifying patterns but require further investigation to determine causality (see here, here, and here for details).\n\nFurthermore, the Pfizer document lists these medical conditions as \u201cadverse events\u201d and not \u201cside effects\u201d. It\u2019s important to distinguish these terms. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), an adverse event is defined as:\n\n\u201cAny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.\u201d [our emphasis]\n\nThis means that adverse events like those cited in the Pfizer document may occur by coincidence and aren\u2019t automatically linked to the vaccination itself. The Pfizer document echoed this, clarifying that:\n\n\u201cAn accumulation of adverse events reports does not necessarily indicate that a particular AE was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factors such as past medical history or concomitant reaction.\u201d\n\nThe idea that any medical event occurring after vaccination is caused by the vaccine is an example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy\u2014the mistaken assumption that because one event follows another, the first must have caused the second. But establishing causality requires detailed clinical investigations and statistical analyses. Science Feedback previously explained the concept of determining causality here.\n\nAn EMA spokesperson cited in the Reuters article concurred:\n\n\u201cSpontaneous case reports of suspected adverse reactions alone are rarely sufficient to prove that a certain suspected reaction has indeed been caused by a specific medicine. This could be a symptom of another illness, or it could be associated with another medicinal product taken by the patient at the same time. Hence, a case report should be seen as a piece of a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d\n\nFor example, some medical conditions, such as myocarditis with mRNA vaccines or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia in adenoviral vector vaccines, were identified only after large-scale vaccine distribution. These associations were confirmed through case reviews and epidemiological studies. By contrast, most conditions listed in the Pfizer document haven\u2019t been causally linked to vaccination.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Pfizer recently released a list of vaccine side effects is inaccurate. The document referenced in these posts was submitted to the FDA in 2021 and made public in 2022. Moreover, the conditions listed in the document are adverse events reported following vaccination, not proven side effects, and thus lack evidence of a causal relationship with the vaccine.",

Updated: Jan. 9, 2025]\n\nThis winter, when the usual sneezing, wheezing, coughing, and fevers start up, there is extra protection for people at high risk from at least one common illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes mild cold symptoms in most people, but can lead to hospitalization and even death in older people and babies. But now there are immunizations aimed at older people, babies, and pregnant women who want to protect their newborns.\n\n\u201cA lot is changing for RSV,\u201d says Scott Roberts, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist. \u201cThere have been attempts to make a vaccine for decades, and they have failed for a variety of reasons.\u201d\n\nOne turning point came with the investigation of an RSV protein called \u201cRSV fusion (F)\u201d that provided potent stimulation to the immune system\u2014research that paved the way to clinical trials showing positive results.\n\nThe vaccines for older people are important, partly because immunity wanes with age, and they\u2019re unable to fight off infections such as RSV as well as they did when they were younger, explains Dr. Roberts. Children are vulnerable because their lungs are smaller, making them more vulnerable to severe disease.\n\nThere are now three RSV vaccines for people ages 60 and older to choose from. They are ABRYSVO\u00ae from Pfizer; AREXVY\u00ae from GSK; and mRESVIA\u00ae, manufactured by Moderna.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all adults ages 75 and older and those ages 60 to 74 who have risk factors for severe RSV disease, such as chronic heart or lung disease, a weakened immune system, other medical conditions such as diabetes, and/or live in a nursing home, get one of the three RSV vaccines. (However, the CDC says if you received an RSV vaccine last year, you don\u2019t need an RSV vaccination this year.)\n\nIn addition, there are two options for infants and toddlers, including a monoclonal antibody called nirsevimab (brand name Beyfortus\u00ae) for all infants up to 8 months old born during\u2014or entering\u2014their first RSV season, and for a small group during their second season who are between 8 and 19 months old and at high risk for severe disease (including children who are severely immunocompromised).\n\nABRYSVO is also approved for administering to pregnant women ahead of the RSV season to provide them with antibodies they could pass along to the fetus and protect their newborns from birth to 6 months of age from severe RSV.\n\nDr. Roberts and Thomas Murray, MD, PhD, a Yale Medicine pediatric infectious diseases specialist, answered questions about the new options for older adults and kids.",

(NYSE:PFE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Pfizer, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nNYSE:PFE Ownership Breakdown January 9th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pfizer?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Pfizer. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pfizer's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nNYSE:PFE Earnings and Revenue Growth January 9th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Pfizer. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",

The report said multinational corporations that were part of the COVID-19 investigation were headquartered outside of Florida.\n\n\u201cIf those subpoena recipients had chosen to raise legal challenges to our subpoenas, it might have taken many months to shepherd those challenges through the trial and appellate courts before we could even begin receiving documents,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis did not come to pass, but there is no reason to expect that will be the case in future statewide grand juries.\u201d\n\nThe report also called for Florida to enact \u201cmore widespread monitoring of wastewater for pathogens.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, states were able to glean valuable insight regarding the geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) by monitoring viral load in samples gathered from wastewater treatment facilities,\u201d the report said.\n\nAt the federal level, for example, the report called for new clinical trials of the vaccines and regulations against a \u201crevolving door\u201d in which employees move between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe understand that prior experience in the regulatory arm of a particular industry can be an attractive quality in a potential job candidate, just as private sector experience can help a regulator interface with these private actors,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis phenomenon has clearly produced a \u2018fellow traveler\u2019 attitude between the pharmaceutical companies and the agencies designed to regulate them. The boats of the regulators and the regulated are not supposed to be rowing in the same direction.\u201d\n\nThe grand jury did not pursue criminal charges, in part, because it did not uncover activities involving vaccine makers and distributors that were not approved by federal regulators, the report said. Also, the grand jury did not find \u201cstatements that were both objectively false and sufficiently precise to support a criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic gave sponsors (pharmaceutical companies) enormous leverage over federal regulators, and they were certainly not afraid to use it. Still, regulators had the responsibility to recognize and temper these intentions,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt is hard to lay blame solely at the feet of the pharmaceutical industry for cutting regulatory comers when government actors were holding their hand the whole way. The lack of tension between federal regulators and sponsors is a significant problem.\u201d\n\nThe grand jury was set up in December 2022, as Gov. Ron DeSantis was planning to embark on a run for the Republican presidential nomination. The report said the grand jury \u201cdid not draft this final report to win any arguments or settle any scores.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the political, social and cultural wars that have been waged over the last four years, asking those who read this document to keep an open mind is probably asking for too much,\u201d the report said. \u201cInstead, we will just say that no matter what anyone\u2019s prior opinions are regarding these issues, our findings will likely confirm some of them and debunk others.\u201d\n\nTAPPED TOGETHER\n\nTwo beer-industry lobbying groups have joined forces heading into the 2025 legislative session as they seek to uphold the state\u2019s distribution system and meet \u201cthe evolving demands of beer consumers across the state.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Beer Wholesalers Association and the Beer Industry of Florida on Monday announced they would work together under the wholesalers association banner.\n\nAssociation Chairman David Bear, CEO of Pensacola-based Lewis Bear Company, said in a news release that the merger will strengthen lobbying efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d the state\u2019s Depression-era three-tier regulation system. That system requires separation of manufacturing, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages.\n\n\u201cIt is our mission to maintain consumer access to the diversity and quality they value while preserving a system that benefits every part of the supply chain,\u201d Bear said.\n\nANYONE FOR A SPECIAL SESSION?\n\nDeSantis reiterated this week that he would like lawmakers to call a special legislative session before the regular session starts March 4.\n\nDeSantis previously had called for a special session to address condominium issues, as residents complain about soaring costs. But on Tuesday, he also said lawmakers need to take steps to align the state with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement plans and to address issues related to hurricane recovery and the constitutional amendment initiative process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot (on immigration),\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe passed a major bill in 2023, but I think that there needs to be some additional legislation to help complement the federal government\u2019s now\u2013newfound appreciation to stop illegal immigration and to hold people accountable. \u2026 We need to be prepared to act. I don\u2019t think that you can wait until April or May to do something in that respect.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday morning, representatives of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, and Senate President Ben Albritton, R-Wauchula, had not commented on DeSantis\u2019 latest call.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA POST OF THE WEEK\n\n\u201cEven Power has done an incredible job leading Florida Republicans to overwhelming victory as chair of @FloridaGOP.

Further, Pfizer conspired with social media platforms to censor criticism and label posts containing truthful information about its vaccine as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d In December 2024, a federal district judge dismissed the lawsuit, claiming that the federal government had given Pfizer immunity through the Public Readiness and Emergency Act. Today, Attorney General Paxton filed a notice that we will appeal the ruling and continue fighting to hold Pfizer accountable.\n\n\u201cPfizer repeatedly and knowingly misrepresented the effectiveness and safety of their COVID-19 vaccine and pressured Americans to take the shot without full knowledge of the risks,\u201d said Attorney General Paxton. \u201cWhen consumers questioned the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, Pfizer sought to silence them\u2014prioritizing profits over the truth. I will not stop until Pfizer is held accountable for deceptively pushing its COVID-19 vaccine on consumers.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo read the filing, click here.",

            "content": "A recent study published in PRS Global Open has brought attention to a rare and puzzling phenomenon\u2014a teenager\u2019s breasts reportedly grew to a triple G-cup size following a COVID-19 vaccination. Dubbed by some as the \u201cCOVID boob job\u201d or \u201cPfizer Boob Job,\u201d this case has sparked sensational headlines and significant debate, leaving many wondering about the potential links between COVID-19 vaccines and unexpected side effects.\n\nGrand Rapids, MI plastic surgeon Bradley Bengtson, MD emphasizes the need for measured analysis when discussing such reports. \u201cI believe COVID infections likely cause a large number of unusual signs and symptoms we really can\u2019t determine or define. I also believe COVID is slammed for a number of things we can\u2019t explain and that may actually be due to something else,\u201d says Dr. Bengtson.\n\nWhile swelling in the breast area can understandably cause alarm, Dr. Bengtson notes that it\u2019s not always linked to a specific cause like COVID-19 or its vaccines. \u201cIf a patient has no capsular contracture or scar tissue around the implant, pain or swelling is most likely due to overactivity or lymph nodes that swell and may cause pain. This can stem from something as simple as a cold, a scratch or a localized infection and is usually transient,\u201d he explains.\n\nThe study has raised important questions about the potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. However, experts like Dr. Bengtson caution that swelling or unusual symptoms may not always have a direct connection to the virus or its prevention methods. \u201cI have not seen any patients I can actually say were COVID-related,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Patients?\n\nFor those who experience sudden swelling or changes in the breast area, the key takeaway is not to panic. Swelling may be due to temporary factors like lymph node enlargement or even hormonal changes unrelated to COVID-19. However, it\u2019s crucial to consult a medical professional for a thorough evaluation.\n\nAs the medical community continues to study the long-term effects of both COVID-19 and its vaccines, maintaining open communication with healthcare providers is vital.",

According to IQVIA, a drug makert research firm, the loca; market for growth hormone products surged from 159.2 billion won ($109.2 million) in 2020 to 277.5 billion won in 2023.\n\nThe dominant treatments for pediatric growth hormone deficiency caused by pituitary gland dysfunction in Korea are somatropin-based daily injections.

The agency also reaffirmed that the benefits of both Pfizer\u2019s Abrysvo and GSK\u2019s Arexvy outweigh their risks.\n\nThe new labeling is based on postmarketing monitoring for GBS in older adults who received either Abrysvo or Arexvy, as well as clinical trial data and reports to a safety database maintained by the FDA. Taken together, this data suggested an increased, but low, risk of GBS during the six weeks following immunization, the agency said.\n\nGBS can cause damage to nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and in some cases partial paralysis. The rare side effect is also associated with use of other vaccines like flu shots, as well as the withdrawn COVID-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s analysis compared rates of GBS cases in vaccinated individuals to estimated background rates of the disorder.

A professor of medicine, Bokhari will direct the Rutgers RWJMS Amyloidosis Fellowship.\n\nAmyloidosis is a condition caused by an abnormal protein that accumulates in organs such as the heart, kidneys, nerves or musculoskeletal system. It is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed because of its subtle symptoms and multiple organ involvement. There are two common types of amyloidosis in the United States, light chain (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR). The differences between the two are the severity and potential life expectancies of patients if the condition has reached the heart and is not identified and treated. Without proper care the average life expectancies for AL amyloidosis and ATTR amyloidosis patients are 6 months and 2.6 to 4.8 years, respectively Bokhari said the condition is significantly underdiagnosed. In fact, 25 percent of cardiac patients over 80 will likely have a form of amyloidosis in their hearts; 13 percent of patients with heart failure have amyloid proteins in their systems and 3.5 percent of African Americans, or 1.5 million, are genetically predisposed to carry a marker for the disease.\n\nBokhari\u2019s mission is to spread awareness among the medical community and to train cardiologists so the disease can be diagnosed early. Without treatment it will be fatal within months or a few years, depending on the type of disease, he said.\n\n\u201cThe work at RWJMS and RWJUH to support the center, which has treated more than 600 patients since 2022, has been tremendous,\u201d Bokhari said. \u201cThese are among the highest patient numbers in the country. The Pfizer fellowship grant will enable us to train cardiologists in amyloidosis, which will increase our capacity to identify it, treat patients and save lives.\u201d\n\nPartho P. Sengupta, Henry Rutgers professor of Cardiology and chief of cardiovascular medicine at RWJMS, chief of Cardiology at RWJUH added, \u201cWe are fortunate to have world renowned faculty like Dr. Sabahat Bokhari join and lead our programs. This prestigious grant reflects his international reputation and our role as a leading academic center that is committed to training the next generation of physician leaders.\u201d\n\nBokhari pioneered the development of a noninvasive imaging method using technetium-pyrophosphate, a (\u201ca radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agent used for diagnostic imaging scans for the bones, heart and gastrointestinal tract\u201d [taken from drugbank.com] or \u201can advanced imaging device\u201d) used worldwide and recommended by the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and American Society of Nuclear Cardiology for the evaluation of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis.\n\nFor more information visit the Cardiac Amyloidosis and Cardiomyopathy Center",

            "content": "The FDA on Tuesday required GSK and Pfizer to include warnings about Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome risk in the labels for their respiratory syncytial virus vaccines.\n\nThe directive follows a post-marketing study by the regulator, which found that patients inoculated with GSK\u2019s Arexvy and Pfizer\u2019s Abrysvo are at greater risks of developing GBS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by weakness, tingling in the extremities and, in severe cases, paralysis.\n\n\u201cThe overall body of evidence suggests increased risks of GBS with Abrysvo and Arexvy, but that available evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship,\u201d the FDA wrote. Results of the post-marketing study, which relied on Medicare claims data, showed nine excess cases of GBS per million Abrysvo doses and seven excess cases per million Arexvy inoculations in adults 65 years and above.\n\nThe GBS safety risk will not be reflected in boxed warnings\u2014considered as the FDA\u2019s most serious precautionary signal\u2014but instead will appear in the Warnings and Precautions section of the vaccines\u2019 respective labels. It applies to the 42 days following vaccination.\n\nTuesday\u2019s safety update is the latest blow to RSV vaccine developers. In June 2024, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its inoculation guidelines, narrowing the recommended use of RSV shots to all seniors 75 years and above and those 60 to 74 years who are at risk of severe disease. Previously, RSV vaccines were recommended in all adults 60 and older.\n\nA few months later, the CDC reaffirmed these new guidelines, insisting that the benefits of RSV vaccination outweighed its risks in these specific elderly populations. Meanwhile, for adults below 60 years, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices argued that data so far have not \u201cmotivated an immediate policy expansion,\u201d with existing evidence pointing to \u201cincreasing certainty\u201d that the shots are linked to GBS risk.\n\nThese adjusted ages are expected to hurt RSV vaccine sales. In an October 2024 report, analytics firm Airfinity lowered its annual revenue estimates for the shots to $1.7 billion by 2030. This figure represents a 64% drop from its prior projection of $4.6 billion.\n\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee last month found that two of Moderna\u2019s experimental RSV vaccine are potentially linked to an imbalance in severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Still, the panelists insisted that there is not enough information to conclusively recommend discontinuing the candidates\u2019 development, and urged the FDA and the pharma to continue testing.\n\nThe RSV vaccine space is dominated by GSK and Pfizer, with the former being the undisputed leader. Arexvy was approved in May 2023\u2014one month ahead of Pfizer\u2019s Abrysvo\u2014and raked in nearly $1.6 billion by the end of 2023. Abrysvo\u2019s 2023 earnings, in comparison, sat at $515 million.",

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.25%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.06%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the drugmaker had gained 6.1% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 5.77% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.8% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Pfizer in its upcoming release. On that day, Pfizer is projected to report earnings of $0.48 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 380%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $17.48 billion, up 22.67% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.17% upward. Pfizer is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Pfizer's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.26. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 12.67, which means Pfizer is trading at a discount to the group.\n\nOne should further note that PFE currently holds a PEG ratio of 0.65. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.28.\n\nThe Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 193, this industry ranks in the bottom 24% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

The pharmaceutical giant will pay the smaller firm up to $350 million to use software models to design new small molecules as well as antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs.\n\nADCs are new territory within the PostEra-Pfizer partnership. The two companies have been working together since late 2020, when Pfizer tapped 1-year-old PostEra to design small molecules using machine learning for an undisclosed amount of money. Just over a year later, Pfizer expanded the partnership to antivirals and cancer drugs, paying PostEra $13 million up front and promising up to $248 million in milestone payments. The new deal includes $12 million up front.\n\nPostEra\u2019s main offering is generative chemistry software: machine learning models that take chemical information and use it to propose molecules with properties that make them better able to go after a specific target and, crucially, can be made in a real-world laboratory.\n\n\u201cAll the way back in the early days of PostEra, one of the drums we kept banging on was how important it was for machine learning models to take into account the synthesizability of the chemicals they\u2019re generating,\u201d says Aaron Morris, the start-up\u2019s cofounder and CEO. \u201cThis concern and passion for synthesis, I think, also translates into helping make ADCs.\u201d\n\nADCs are made up of an antibody, a small-molecule payload, and a linker. The new phase of the Pfizer partnership will focus specifically on optimizing payloads.\n\nMorris says that PostEra has already hit preclinical milestones about 40% faster than Pfizer had anticipated. The start-up recently published a peer-reviewed paper describing a compound that prevented SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in mice by blocking the virus\u2019s papain-like protease (PLpro), a target different from the main protease (Mpro) that the Pfizer drug Paxlovid hits (Sci. Adv. 2024, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ado4288). That compound went from \u201ca cold start\u201d to in vivo proof of concept in about 8 months, says Alpha Lee, PostEra\u2019s cofounder and chief science officer.\n\nThe start-up separately has agreements with Amgen, for up to five small molecules, and with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). PostEra coleads an Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern with the NIH funding, although that\u2019s slated to run out in a few months. Lee says he and other AViDD Center leaders are looking for money to continue the work, which has focused on antivirals for coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and picornaviruses. Outside these collaborations, PostEra has four wholly owned preclinical programs in \u201cwomen\u2019s health and fertility,\u201d per its website.",

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this drugmaker have returned +3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 6.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of +380% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +59.8%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.93 indicates a change of -0.3% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.",

Ron DeSantis to investigate \u201cany and all wrongdoing\u201d concerning COVID-19 vaccines did not find any evidence of criminal activity, according to a report unsealed on Tuesday.\n\nWhat You Need To Know A statewide grand jury convened at the request of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to investigate \u201cany and all wrongdoing\u201d concerning COVID-19 vaccines did not find any evidence of criminal activity\n\n\n\nIn response to its findings, the grand jury made policy recommendations in its report, including increasing transparency around clinical trials and banning advertisements for pharmaceutical drugs\n\n\n\nDeSantis sought the investigation in 2022, ahead of his bid for the Republican Party's presidential nomination\n\n\u201c(N)ot finding any indictable criminal activity does not mean we did not find any problems. On the contrary, there are profound and serious issues involving the process of vaccine development and safety surveillance in the United States,\u201d the grand jury wrote in its final report.\n\nIn response to its findings, the grand jury made policy recommendations in its report, including increasing transparency around clinical trials and banning advertisements for pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains that COVID-19 vaccines underwent intensive safety analyses and that the shots continue to be monitored after FDA approval to ensure they still meet federal safety and efficacy standards.\n\nWhile the vaccines aren\u2019t perfect, they do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects, according to federal officials and public health experts.\n\nDeSantis sought the investigation in 2022, ahead of his bid for the Republican Party's presidential nomination and as he was bolstering his national profile through hard-line opposition to pandemic lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\nAt the time, DeSantis said the probe would \u201cbring legal accountability to those who committed misconduct\u201d and could help get more information from pharmaceutical companies about the vaccines and potential side effects.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond on Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nStatewide grand juries, usually comprised of 18 people, can investigate criminal activity and issue indictments but also examine systemic problems in Florida and make recommendations. In recent years, other panels have tackled immigration issues and school safety.\n\nThe full grand jury report is available below:",

The findings underscore the need for more robust clinical research to evaluate the drug's efficacy in managing persistent symptoms of the condition.\n\nAlso Read: Pfizer's Paxlovid Demonstrates Safety But Raises Questions on Efficacy in Low-Risk Covid-19 Patients-NEJM Study\n\nThe study involved patients aged 25 to 55 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March 2020 and December 2022 and experienced symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, irregular heart rate, and post-exertional malaise.\n\nParticipants took Paxlovid courses ranging from 7.5 to 30 days, often in combination with other medications or supplements, complicating the assessment of the drug's isolated effects.\n\nWhile some participants experienced sustained improvement, others noted temporary relief or no change.\n\nTwo patients who took extended Paxlovid courses during acute reinfections reported eventual recovery to their pre-reinfection baseline. Another participant discontinued the treatment early due to severe stomach pain, highlighting the need to consider potential side effects.\n\nThe study acknowledges its limitations, including small, non-representative sample size and reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce recall or fatigue bias.\n\nHowever, its participatory approach sheds light on lived experiences that traditional medical records may overlook.\n\nExtended antiviral courses have precedent in other conditions like HIV and hepatitis C, suggesting a basis for further exploration in Long COVID.\n\nResearchers are encouraged to investigate potential treatment pathways, including optimal course lengths and symptom recurrence post-treatment. Larger clinical trials are underway to systematically evaluate these factors.\n\nCurrently, no FDA-approved treatments specifically target Long COVID. If clinical trials validate Paxlovid's benefits, regulatory pathways like expanded access or fast-track designation could help make the drug available to patients.\n\nLast year, the FDA updated the emergency use authorization for Paxlovid.\n\nPrice Action: PFE stock is up 0.49% at $26.72 during the premarket session at last check Monday.\n\nRead Next:",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Semaglutides Market Report 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThis Semaglutides market report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market. It traces the market's historic and forecast market growth by geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size has grown rapidly in recent years. It will grow from $20.54 billion in 2023 to $23.07 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3%. The growth during the historic period can be attributed to lifestyle changes leading to higher diabetes prevalence, increased investment in research and development, rising healthcare expenditure, the expansion of pharmaceutical companies into developing regions, and growing acceptance of injectable therapies.\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years. It will grow to $36.87 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to the increasing global prevalence of diabetes, rising awareness about diabetes management and treatment, growing demand for effective therapies with fewer side effects, supportive government initiatives and policies for diabetes treatment, and an aging population contributing to higher diabetes incidence.\n\nMajor trends expected during this period include the integration of digital health technologies, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, increased demand for telemedicine and remote monitoring, development of wearable technology, the use of 3D printing, and the application of blockchain for supply chain management.\n\n\n\nThe rising prevalence of diabetes is anticipated to drive the expansion of the semaglutide market in the coming years. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. The increasing incidence of diabetes is largely attributed to factors such as rising obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and poor dietary habits. Semaglutide plays a key role in diabetes management by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which stimulates insulin secretion, reduces glucagon release, and slows gastric emptying, thereby helping to lower blood glucose levels and support weight loss.\n\nFor example, in November 2021, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), a Belgium-based non-profit organization, reported that approximately 537 million people globally are living with diabetes. This number has been steadily increasing, with the IDF projecting that by 2.04 trillion people will have diabetes, representing a 46% rise. As a result, the growing prevalence of diabetes is driving the expansion of the semaglutide market.\n\n\n\nKey players in the semaglutide market are focusing on developing products such as GLP-1 receptor analogues to enhance the effectiveness of treatments for diabetes and obesity, improve patient adherence, and reduce side effects through advanced delivery systems and personalized medicine approaches. A GLP-1 receptor analogue is a synthetic peptide that mimics the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases insulin secretion and regulates blood sugar levels in diabetes management.\n\nFor instance, in January 2022, Novo Nordisk India, an India-based pharmaceutical company, launched oral semaglutide, marking a significant advancement in diabetes treatment. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor analogue (GLP-1 RA) traditionally available only as an injection, was developed in an oral form for the first time. This oral version combines semaglutide with an absorption enhancer known as SNAC, which protects the medication from degradation in the stomach and enhances its absorption.\n\n\n\nIn May 2024, Novo Holdings, a Denmark-based life sciences company, acquired Catalent for $16.5 billion. This strategic acquisition aims to strengthen Novo Holdings' portfolio by incorporating Catalent's expertise in drug delivery technologies, biologics, and gene therapies, thereby bolstering its position in the global healthcare market. Catalent, Inc. is a US-based company involved in the production of semaglutide.\n\n\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the semaglutides market in 2023. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the semaglutides market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa.

She has double D breasts and may get another breast reduction to return to her normal size.\n\nThe Toronto study authors are calling for further research to see if there\u2019s a link between the COVID-19 vaccine, PASH and rapid breast growth.\n\nMore than 13.6 billion COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide since 2020.

            "content": "The start of the new year is typically a time when people make big changes around health\u2014and drug companies are no exception.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, more than 250 branded drugs from pharmaceutical giants including Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi-Pasteur, Merck, Pfizer, and more will see price hikes in the U.S., according to data analysis conducted by health care research firm 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nPfizer alone is raising prices on over 60 drugs, the most on the list. (Pfizer has nearly 500 products in its portfolio.) In addition to a 3% increase on Paxlovid, its COVID treatment, Pfizer\u2019s cancer drugs Adcetris and Ibrance, as well as arthritis treatment Xeljanz, will now cost between 3% and 5% more, according to Reuters.\n\nThe median increase\u2014which is only to the list price and does not include rebates or other discounts\u2014is similar year over year at 4.5%. Still, more drugs are getting higher price tags in 2025 compared with last year.\n\nPfizer told Fortune in a statement: \u201cPfizer has adjusted the average list prices of our medicines and vaccines for 2025 below the overall rate of inflation\u2014approximately 2.4%\u2014across many products in our diverse product portfolio. The modest increase is necessary to support investments that allow us to continue to discover and deliver new medicines as well as address increased costs throughout our business.\u201d\n\nHigher prices on new drugs?\n\nIn the U.S., prescription drug prices are significantly higher compared with those in similarly wealthy countries.\n\nExperts say a backlash forced drugmakers to scale back on annual increases less than a decade ago, but drug launch prices continue to rise, which results in \u201cpayers restricting access, raising premiums, or imposing unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for patients,\u201d according to a 2022 article published in JAMA, in which researchers analyzed trends in drug launch prices between 2008 and 2021.\n\nReuters analyzed prices for new drugs in February of 2024 and found that U.S. launch prices were 35% higher in 2023 compared with 2022.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers don\u2019t have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\u201d 3 Axis president Antonio Ciaccia told Reuters about the 2025 planned drug increases.\n\nAdditional price increases will likely be announced by drugmakers this month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

It cited as evidence probes by the state attorney general that resulted in three federal lawsuits.\n\nThe lawsuit details price increases for several drugs, including Nadolol, which shot up in price 2,762%; Clomipramine, which treats obsessive compulsive disorder, which increased 2,600%; propranolol HCL, a heart medication, which increased 1,000%; and oxybutynin chloride, which shot up somewhere between 1,100 and 1,500%.\n\nDrug purchasers, especially insurers, suffered as a result, Aetna claimed, since they were paying unfairly high prices for generic drugs that are typically placed on formularies to lower costs.\n\nAetna is asking for a court order forcing the drugmakers to overhaul their contracts and practices to promote greater price transparency, and for a ban on \"fair share\" arrangements, in which the drugmakers allegedly fixed prices and rigged bids.\n\nTHE LARGER TREND\n\nCVS Health's third-quarter earnings showed Aetna underperforming. Its revenues hit $33 billion in Q3, up from $26.3 billion in Q3 2023. But it posted an adjusted operating income loss of $924 million this year. Its Medical Benefits Ratio was 95.2% in the quarter, compared to 85.7% in the same period last year.\n\nDue in part to Aetna's performance, CVS Health officials said they were not providing a formal outlook, though CVS Health president and CEO David Joyner said he was optimistic about the segment's recovery prospects, particularly with the announcement that Steve Nelson, a former UnitedHealth Group insurance leader, to run Aetna.\n\nJeff Lagasse is editor of Healthcare Finance News.\n\nEmail: jlagasse@himss.org\n\nHealthcare Finance News is a HIMSS Media publication.",

            "content": "The board of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.43 on the 7th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield 6.5%, which is above the industry average.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Pfizer\n\nPfizer's Payment Could Potentially Have Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, the company wasn't making enough to cover what it was paying to shareholders. This situation certainly isn't ideal, and could place significant strain on the balance sheet if it continues.\n\nThe next 12 months could see EPS growing very rapidly. Assuming the dividend continues along the path it has been on, the payout ratio could get to 77% which is certainly still sustainable.\n\nNYSE:PFE Historic Dividend January 5th 2025\n\nPfizer Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was $1.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.72. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.2% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nThe Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential\n\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Pfizer's EPS has declined at around 23% a year. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Pfizer's payments are rock solid. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We don't think Pfizer is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Pfizer has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit concerning) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

            "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s allies have successfully raised over $200 million to fund a range of initiatives, including his inauguration, political operation, and eventual presidential library, The New York Times reported. This significant sum underscores the ongoing efforts by donors and corporate interests to strengthen their relationships with Trump ahead of a potential second term, the news report stated.\n\nThe fundraising blitz has garnered substantial contributions from some of the biggest names in business, including Pfizer, OpenAI, Amazon, Meta, and several cryptocurrency firms. The $150 million already raised for the inauguration alone, with more expected, will surpass the $107 million collected for Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration, according to individuals briefed on the matter, who spoke to The New York Times under anonymity.\n\nThis record-breaking amount reflects a concerted push from industry leaders eager to align themselves with Trump\u2019s political agenda and avoid the backlash some faced following the violent Capitol attack by his supporters on January 6, 2021, the news report said.\n\nDespite some earlier criticism, corporate donations to Trump\u2019s operation have surged, with Trump boasting of the fundraising success during the holiday season.\n\nOther beneficiaries of the fundraising include Trump\u2019s super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., and its associated nonprofit group, which are expected to support his policy initiatives and candidates aligned with his views.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s transition and inaugural committees did not respond to The New York Times inquiries, David Tamasi, a prominent lobbyist raising funds for the former president, dismissed suggestions, the report said, that corporate donations were an attempt to avoid retribution. He emphasized that such donations are part of a longstanding political tradition in Washington, with corporations eager to engage more openly after staying on the sidelines during previous cycles.\n\n\"It is a time-honored D.C. tradition that corporations are enthusiastically embracing this cycle in all manners, largely because they were on the sidelines during previous Trump cycles. They no longer have to hedge their political bets,\" Tamasi was quoted as saying.\n\nAlso Read | The big companies funding Trump\u2019s inauguration despite denouncing Jan 6",

Dubbed the \u201cPfizer boob job,\u201d the phenomenon has sparked questions about the vaccine\u2019s potential side effects and their impact on breast tissue.\n\nFrom B-Cup to Triple-G: The Dramatic Transformation\n\nThis case, reported in a 19-year-old woman from the United States, outlines her alarming progression from a B-cup to a triple-G bra size within six months. The changes began a mere week after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Following the second dose, the patient reported worsening symptoms, including tingling sensations and significant breast swelling.\n\nDespite an extensive medical evaluation at multiple healthcare centers, no hormonal imbalances or other common triggers of gigantomastia\u2014such as pregnancy or medication\u2014were identified. The patient\u2019s condition eventually led to bilateral reduction mammoplasty, performed by a surgical team at a leading plastic surgery facility.\n\nPreoperative image of patient with triple G cup breasts following development of macromastia after administration of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Credit: Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery-Global Open\n\nInside the Science: What Doctors Found\n\nDuring the surgery, which utilized a Wise pattern reduction technique, doctors removed nearly 3.6 kilograms (7.9 pounds) of tissue from the patient\u2019s breasts. Pathology reports revealed a rare condition known as pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), a benign but abnormal fibrous tissue proliferation associated with hormonal sensitivity.\n\nDespite its rarity, fewer than 20 cases of PASH-associated gigantomastia have been reported globally, making this occurrence especially significant. Doctors observed that the tissue was unusually vascularized, complicating surgery and resulting in significant blood loss.\n\nNotable Clinical Findings:\n\nDiagnostic imaging : Ultrasound and computed tomography scans showed diffuse breast enlargement and axillary lymphadenopathy, with no detectable masses.\n\n: Ultrasound and computed tomography scans showed diffuse breast enlargement and axillary lymphadenopathy, with no detectable masses. Pathology: Dense glandular tissue with interspersed PASH regions, a hallmark of the condition.\n\nGross specimen postbilateral reduction mammoplasty for gigantomastia.\n\nVaccine or Coincidence? The Burning Question\n\nMedical experts, including the surgical team, have emphasized that no direct causality between the vaccine and the patient\u2019s condition has been established. While axillary lymphadenopathy is a documented side effect of COVID-19 vaccines, it is typically temporary and unlikely to cause permanent breast growth.\n\nIn response to public curiosity, the New Zealand Ministry of Health addressed similar social media claims, stating, \u201cThere is no scientific evidence to support the assertion that COVID-19 vaccines cause breast enlargement.\u201d However, researchers acknowledge the need for more studies to explore rare vaccine-related phenomena.\n\nThe following table presents a list of potential factors that may contribute to the development of gigantomastia:\n\nFactor Role in the Case Evidence Found Hormonal imbalance Common trigger of PASH None detected Medication or other drugs Rare but possible trigger None reported COVID-19 vaccine Temporal association noted No causality established\n\nThe Human Side: Erosion of Trust in Healthcare\n\nThe patient faced significant challenges navigating the healthcare system. Initial dismissals of her concerns by primary care providers left her feeling invalidated. Only after consulting specialists and undergoing unsuccessful medication trials was she taken seriously. The experience highlights a broader issue in medicine: the erosion of trust when patients feel unheard.\n\nIn the words of the case authors, \u201cDismissing patient concerns can erode trust. Physicians should consider and value patient concerns when developing therapeutic relationships.\u201d\n\nWhy This Case Matters\n\nThis rare case has sparked international interest, calling for further investigation into the etiology of PASH and its potential links to COVID-19 vaccination. While isolated, it underscores the importance of patient-centered care and scientific inquiry in the face of new medical phenomena.\n\nFor now, the \u201cPfizer boob job\u201d remains a curious mix of clinical mystery and viral intrigue, leaving the medical community with more questions than answers.\n\nSource: journals.lww.com",

The students tested two lots of the vaccine, finding they contained \u201cresidual DNA to a level that exceeds 10 ng [nanograms] per dose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe potential health risk posed by residual small DNA fragments is currently unknown,\u201d the study stated. However, the authors also said that DNA contamination may result in insertional mutagenesis \u2014 or DNA mutations \u2014 that can cause cancer.\n\nSpeaking last month on \u201cThe Defender In-Depth,\u201d Kevin McKernan, who first identified DNA contamination in the shots in 2023, said DNA in vaccines can pose health risks because the DNA \u201ccould integrate into the genome and cause disruption of the genome \u2026 or it could disrupt other genes that are related to cancer.\u201d\n\nThe FDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the study.\n\nCOVID vaccines \u2018must be immediately recalled\u2019\n\nThe new findings challenge \u201cyears of dismissals by regulatory authorities, who had previously labelled concerns about excessive DNA contamination as baseless,\u201d Demasi wrote on Substack.\n\nThe findings also align with earlier reports from independent laboratories in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany and France, she said.\n\nMcKernan, founder of Medicinal Genomics, told The Defender that eight studies have found DNA over the limit. \u201cVery few studies are surveying a large number of lots, so each study is additive,\u201d he said.\n\nEpidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher said that in \u201clight of this evidence, the COVID-19 genetic injections must be immediately recalled, to protect the public from further harm.\u201d\n\nNikolai Petrovsky, Ph.D., director of biotechnology company Vaxine Pty Ltd., told Demasi that the findings are a \u201csmoking gun\u201d and that the new study \u201cclearly shows the FDA was aware of these data.\u201d\n\nChristof Plothe, D.O., a member of the World Council for Health steering committee, agreed. He said:\n\n\u201cSo far, the European, Australian, and American health regulatory boards have denied any risks from plasmid DNA contamination in the COVID-19 injections despite nine studies by internationally known research teams. \u201cAll teams concluded that this contamination poses an unacceptable risk to three-quarters of the world\u2019s population. \u2026 Three teams so far have demonstrated the integration into human cells. To what extent this is happening to everybody who was injected needs to be investigated.\u201d\n\nMcKernan said that the FDA has long ignored evidence of the dangers posed by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe criteria for pulling these shots was established long before DNA contamination was first discovered,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope that evidence of highly variable manufacturing would be grounds for immediate class 1 recall from the FDA. They are currently distracted with performing class 1 recalls on non-lethal hairspray.\u201d\n\nSign Up for Free\n\nA Class 1 recall involves \u201ca situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\u201d\n\nAccording to Demasi, \u201cThe FDA is expected to comment on the findings this week. However, the agency has yet to issue a public alert, recall the affected batches, or explain how vials exceeding safety standards were allowed to reach the market.\u201d\n\nPlothe noted that Demasi presented evidence of DNA contamination to the FDA in September 2024, asking if the agency had launched an investigation or requested further testing of the mRNA vaccines by their manufacturers.\n\n\u201cNothing resulted from this request,\u201d Plothe said. \u201cAs nine studies have proven this severe contamination and repeated requests to health regulatory boards have not led to any consequence, we must ask about the motive.\u201d\n\nBrian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer for Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD), noted the irony of high school students discovering what the FDA has seemingly missed in the four-plus years since the vaccines\u2019 introduction.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that it takes student researchers at the FDA to do the work of the FDA regulators,\u201d Hooker said. \u201cIt is alarming that the public is made aware of this contamination in an obscure journal that features high school science research. One has to ask, \u2018Where is the FDA now?\u2019 and \u2018Why hasn\u2019t the public been alerted of this?\u2019\u201d\n\nDemasi said that the significance of the new study\u2019s findings is that they came from research performed at an FDA facility.\n\n\u201cNow that DNA contamination of the mRNA vaccines has been verified in the laboratory of an official agency and published in a peer-reviewed journal, it becomes difficult to ignore,\u201d Demasi wrote. \u201cIt also places vaccine manufacturers and regulators in a precarious position.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to The Defender\n\n***\n\nFor more #TruthAboutCovid19 Reports by Inner Journey : visit \u2192 https://innerjourney101.substack.com/t/covid-19\n\n***\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nCMM | Inner Journey: https://www.youtube.com/@InnerJourney-h9f\n\n***\n\nSubscribe to our Truth Channels:",

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other stocks targeted by activist hedge funds.\n\nShareholder activism continued at a record pace in 2024 as activist hedge funds pushed for strategic changes in various companies to unlock hidden value. In the first nine months of the year, 184 activist hedge fund campaigns were up and running, 26% above the four-year average. The surge came as new activists joined the fray and spearheaded 22% of the campaigns.\n\nWhy Was Shareholder Activism on The Rise?\n\nA number of factors can be emphasized. One is the global economy cooling down. Although the US economy appeared to be on track to a soft landing, as many experts had predicted, economic growth remained timid, and other nations like Germany were on the verge of going into recession.\n\nThe rise of so-called ESG investing is another factor contributing to increased shareholder activism. Environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, is a relatively recent trend in which investors purchase stock in a company for its intrinsic value and because it performs well on ESG metrics. Some activist investors have positioned themselves as ESG-focused in the midst of this trend.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Penny Stocks to Buy for 2025 and 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E. Shaw.\n\nNevertheless, only 30% of the top ten activist investors accounted for the total campaigns in 2024, down from 46% in the same period in 2023. On the other hand, most of the campaigns were less successful in breaking into company boardrooms as management fought back.\n\nManagement pushed back on several campaigns even as activist hedge funds were forced to settle on management changes. Additionally, as investors' newfound freedom to choose between management and dissident slates makes it easier to get representation on boards, the universal proxy card continues to lead to more settlements between activists and businesses.\n\nEven though winning board seats isn't the main goal of every campaign, the quantity of victories indicates how well businesses are defending themselves. Dissidents won 74 seats in the first half, compared to 93 in the same period in 2023. Activists only secured 11% of the seats they were vying for in US proxy elections, compared to 65% in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, a push for company sales by activist hedge funds hit a snag as buyouts throughout the year were scarce owing to the high interest rate environment. High interest rates made it difficult for companies to access cheap capital that they could use to complete acquisitions.",

Let us know!\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania expects to receive $467 million from a German COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer after the pair settled a lawsuit out of court in late December 2024.\n\nThe university filed a lawsuit against BioNTech four months ago, claiming that the company licensed vaccine technology developed by its Nobel Prize-winning researchers, but did not remit the full value of the royalties owed after selling $75 billion worth of vaccines worldwide.\n\nInstead, the university asserted that BioNTech only paid royalties for vaccines sold in countries where it holds patents, instead of global sales, because the vaccine was manufactured in countries where the university has existing patents \u2013 something covered in the contract\u2019s fine print.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured in both Puurs, Belgium and Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n\u201cBioNTech must pay royalties as a percentage of its entire worldwide sales and not as it has done to date, only a portion of its worldwide sales,\u201d wrote Leslie Miller Greenspan, attorney at Tucker Law Group in Philadelphia and an attorney for the university in August 2024. \u201cBioNTech is failing to meet its royalty obligation because it applies an inappropriate deduction for supposed royalties to third parties.\u201d\n\nBioNTech also owes the National Institutes of Health $791.5 million for the same issue, to be paid no later than Feb. 18, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nThat\u2019s more than $1.2 billion in unpaid royalties BioNTech is expected to pay for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine sales.\n\nBioNTech is not admitting fault in the case as part of the settlements.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania and BioNTech declined to comment for this news story.\n\nBioNTech agreed to pay $400 million in royalties owed from between 2020 and 2023 to the university, plus another $15 million to fund BioNTech and University of Pennsylvania vaccine alliance research for another three years as part of the settlement. Finally, the company will contribute $52 million to a jointly managed research and development investment fund.\n\nThe university also changed the contract terms to ensure it would be paid what it considers the full value of the deal since the product is still being sold on the market, and added a side letter for a \u201clow-single-digit percentage\u201d royalty on the net sales of its licensed products in 2024 and beyond.",

            "content": "Pfizer has terminated its hemophilia A gene therapy partnership with Sangamo Therapeutics, the companies revealed on Monday, sending the biotech\u2019s stock down 56% on the last day of 2024.\n\nThe drug candidate, giroctocogene fitelparvovec, is designed to enable adults with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A to produce Factor VIII. A Phase III trial of the therapy hit its primary endpoint last year, linking the gene therapy to a significant reduction in the annualized bleeding rate across at least 15 months of follow-up. The companies shared more data from the trial in December.\n\nPfizer indicated to Sangamo in November that it was discussing the data with regulatory authorities, the biotech said. Sangamo expected Pfizer to file for approval in the U.S. and European Union in early 2025. Instead, Pfizer axed plans to seek approval and terminated the partnership.\n\nThe change of plans comes amid evidence that the market for first-generation hemophilia A gene therapies may be smaller than expected. BioMarin Pharmaceutical won FDA approval for a hemophilia A gene therapy in June 2023, only for a slow launch to prompt the biotech to narrow its focus to three markets. Sales of that product, Roctavian, totaled $16 million across the first nine months of 2024.\n\nPeople with hemophilia A already have access to drugs such as Roche\u2019s once-weekly treatment Hemlibra, and have so far largely stayed on existing products rather than try Roctavian. Studies have raised doubts about the durability of the effects of Roctavian and giroctocogene fitelparvovec, which are designed to be one-time treatments.\n\nSangamo will regain full rights to its program when Pfizer\u2019s termination takes effect in April. The biotech said it plans to \u201cexplore all options\u201d for bringing the gene therapy to market, including looking for a new partner for the program.\n\nShares in Sangamo fell 56% to $1.02 in the aftermath of the news. The response reflects the loss of a potentially significant source of income: Pfizer paid $70 million upfront to license the candidate and gave Sangamo a further $55 million in milestones as the program progressed.\n\nBigger paydays were on the horizon. On an earnings call in November, Sangamo CEO Sandy Macrae said Pfizer could pay up to $220 million in regulatory and commercial milestones \u201cover the next two years.\u201d\n\nThe loss of that potential income adds to Sangamo\u2019s financial challenges. Sangamo said in November that it had enough money to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025. The biotech made the cash runway forecast before securing $20 million upfront from Astellas in return for rights to gene therapy delivery technology.",

We hope you had a restful holiday; If you took a break from keeping up with biotech news, we\u2019ve got you covered with a brief rundown of the most important updates from the past week and a half.\n\nPfizer won\u2019t move forward with asking regulators to approve a gene therapy for hemophilia A and instead will hand back rights to development partner Sangamo Therapeutics in a blow to the California-based biotechnology company. In a Dec. 30 statement, Sangamo CEO Sandy Macrae said his company was \u201csurprised and extremely disappointed\u201d by Pfizer\u2019s decision, which comes some five months after the treatment met its goal in a Phase 3 study of people with the inherited bleeding disorder. Sangamo plans to search for an \u201coptimal path\u201d forward, which could include partnering with another company. Pfizer has steadily retreated from gene therapy, although it sells a hemophilia B gene therapy called Beqvez that it obtained from Spark Therapeutics. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nRoche and Ideaya Biosciences acquired rights to similar, experimental lung cancer drugs in separate deals with China-based biotechnology companies. First, Ideaya on Monday paid Hengrui Pharma $75 million upfront for an antibody-drug conjugate that targets the protein delta-like ligand 3, or DLL3, and is currently in preclinical testing. Roche followed on Thursday by paying Innovent Biologics $80 million for a DLL3-targeting ADC that began a Phase 1 trial last month. Both drugs are being evaluated against small-cell lung cancer, a more aggressive and less common form of the disease. \u2014 Ben Fidler\n\nAfter many years of effort, Novartis has obtained positive results from a Phase 3 study for a form of its spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy Zolgensma that\u2019s delivered via spinal injection rather than intravenous infusion. Data from the study, called Steer, showed treatment improved motor abilities in people with the neuromuscular disease who were two years of age or older and could still sit but had never walked independently. U.S. regulators suspended testing of the intrathecal formulation in late 2019 over safety concerns, but in August 2021 permitted Novartis to begin the Steer study. Novartis plans to share the new data with health authorities to support approval of the gene therapy in a broader range of people with spinal muscular atrophy. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nBioNTech will pay the National Institutes of Health $792 million to settle disputes over use of patented technology to develop the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, marketed by Pfizer, according to a securities filing.The payment will consist of $750 million worth of claimed royalties for the years 2020 through 2023 and $42 million for an amended license agreement that sets new royalty terms. Separately, BioNTech said it has settled with the University of Pennsylvania over patents related to technology used to develop Comirnaty, paying up to $467 million to Penn. Pfizer will reimburse BioNTech $365 million related to the NIH settlement and up to $170 million related to the Penn settlement. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner\n\nAxsome Therapeutics intends to ask regulators for approval of a combination drug it\u2019s developed to treat agitation caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease, despite mixed results from the company\u2019s latest late-stage trials. In one Phase 3 study, Axsome\u2019s drug, called AXS-05, lowered the risk of relapse in agitation versus placebo. However, AXS-05 missed its goal in another trial. Drawing on positive data from two prior studies, Axsome said it will submit a U.S. approval application in the second half of the year, which analysts expect may still be granted. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nSanofi and partner SK Bioscience are expanding their partnership as they begin Phase 3 testing of a next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children. The shot is designed to protect against 21 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and, according to Sanofi, is the first of its type targeting more than 20 to enter a Phase 3 trial in infants. The planned trial program will include over 7,700 infants, children and adolescents. If successful, the companies\u2019 shot could eventually compete with Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar 20, which in 2023 received a green light from the Food and Drug Administration for use in infants and children. Sanofi and SK Bioscience will co-fund research and development costs, while SK Bioscience will receive a 50 million euros upfront payment from Sanofi. \u2014 Delilah Alvarado\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved Hikma Pharmaceuticals\u2019 generic version of Novo Nordisk\u2019s daily GLP-1 shot for diabetes, Victoza. First approved in 2010, Victoza once was the biggest selling drug in the class. But by 2023 its sales had declined to 8.7 billion kroner, or about $1.3 billion, while revenue from the more potent weekly GLP-1 shot Ozempic has grown since its 2017 launch. Teva Pharmaceutical launched an authorized generic of Victoza in June 2024. \u2014 Jonathan Gardner",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE), as well as a micro-cap stock AMREP Corp. (AXR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+24.0% vs. +23.8%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance. (You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>> ) Shares of Home Depot have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+18.5% vs. +17.9%). The company\u2019s stock prices is driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. The company delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand. Home Depot gains from its \u201cOne Home Depot\u201d investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience. HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. (You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>> ) Pfizer\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-4.3% vs. +0.9%). The company\u2019s revenues from Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 products are declining due to lower demand. Pfizer also expects a significant impact from the loss of patent exclusivity in the 2026-2030 period, as several of its key products face patent expirations. However, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID operational revenue growth improved in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by its key in-line products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches and newly acquired products from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened its cash position, which is being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Seagen\u2019s acquisition has strengthened its position in oncology. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reducing measures should drive profit growth. (You can read the full research report on Pfizer here >>> ) Shares of AMREP have outperformed the Zacks Real Estate - Development industry over the past year (+44.3% vs. -8.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $166.03 million has achieved impressive financial growth in fiscal 2025, with fiscal second-quarter revenues up 34.5% to $11.9 million and net income soaring 264.8% to $4 million. First-half revenues rose 61.9% to $30.9 million, driven by operational efficiency and favorable market conditions. Strategic land holdings in New Mexico position AMREP to benefit from rising housing demand amid easing monetary policies, declining mortgage rates and limited supply, supporting long-term growth. Favorable macro trends and resilient housing prices drive profitability. Risks include geographic concentration, market volatility, affordability challenges, reliance on the real estate market and elevated input costs. Regulatory changes, competition and economic uncertainty could impact performance, but AMREP\u2019s operational efficiency and strong margins mitigate these risks.

            "content": "Shares of Sangamo Therapeutics have plummeted more than 56% over the past few days after Pfizer announced it had terminated its partnership to develop an investigational gene therapy product to treat hemophilia A.\n\nThe drug, giroctocogene fitelparvovec, is specifically designed to treat adults with moderate to severe hemophilia A.\n\nAs a result of Pfizer\u2019s decision, Sangamo will regain full development and commercialization rights for its therapy.\n\nThis announcement marks a sudden change of direction for Pfizer, which previously expressed commitment to investing in experimental treatments for diseases like hemophilia.\n\nIn July, Pfizer announced positive results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Sangamo\u2019s gene therapy, noting that the drug demonstrated superiority compared to prophylaxis. The pharma giant also presented results at the 66th annual ASH Meeting and Exposition in December.\n\nSangamo CEO Sandy Macrae expressed disappointment about Pfizer\u2019s decision to step aside, especially after noting that the therapy had demonstrated significant potential for hemophilia A patients.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised and extremely disappointed by Pfizer\u2019s decision to end our collaboration so close to the anticipated BLA and MAA submissions,\u201d Macrae said in a statement.\n\nSangamo stated that Pfizer indicated that it was discussing data from the gene therapy with regulatory authorities.\n\nIt also mentioned that the pharma giant indicated to Sangamo that the drug\u2019s Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorization Application submissions (MAA) to the Food and Drug Administration were anticipated to occur in the spring.\n\nHowever, Pfizer will now effectively terminate its license agreement with Sangamo in April. Sangamo said that all trial patients under Pfizer will continue to be monitored as previously planned.\n\nThe gene therapy maker also said it is committed to continuing the program and will potentially seek a new collaborator.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to exploring the optimal path forward for this important treatment, including seeking the right partner with the focus and understanding of the genomic medicine commercial environment to bring this medicine to patients,\u201d said Macrae.\n\nWhile gene therapy trials have shown positive results for symptom management, commercial troubles around therapies on the market suggest that patients may be more interested in using existing drugs, even if they need to be administered more frequently.\n\nAnalysts have noted that these products aren\u2019t necessarily a top priority for pharma giants as many manage symptoms rather than curing diseases.\n\nFor example, BioMarin won FDA approval for a gene therapy in 2023, but it hasn\u2019t found many patients who are willing to try the product. The biotech announced sales of $16 million over the first nine months of 2024 and mentioned that it\u2019s focused on cutting costs and growing revenues in the future.\n\nDespite the current market reactions toward gene therapies, Sangamo is still committed to the development of more therapies.\n\nThe company also recently announced partnerships with Astellas Pharma and Genentech, which it believes will help carve a path forward for neurology genomic medicine. Sangamo added that it expects the enrollment of patients in a Phase 1/2 study of a therapy for idiopathic small fiber neuropathy this year.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on advancing our wholly owned neurology genomic medicine pipeline and progressing our Fabry gene therapy program towards a potential BLA submission in the second half of 2025,\u201d Macrae stated.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about.\n\nHealthcare has been one of Jim Cramer\u2019s favorite topics lately. The tail end of the year has pushed a portion of the sector, namely healthcare benefit managers and pharmaceutical chains, into Wall Street\u2019s spotlight. Investors were particularly anxious after President-elect Trump\u2019s remarks during a press conference at Mar-e-Lago. At the event, he promised to take on the healthcare middleman due to the high costs that Americans were facing. Americans are \u201cpaying far too much. . . .much more than other countries\u201d for healthcare, shared Trump. He pointed at what he believes is the heart of the problem. According to Trump, \u201cWe have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don\u2019t do anything except they\u2019re a middleman.\u201d\n\nThe role played by the healthcare middlemen has also made the President-elect vow to \u201cknock out the middle man\u201d despite understanding that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to be very unpopular after that.\u201d Cramer has spent several shows discussing either the broader impact of the President-elect\u2019s goal on the benefits management industry or the impact on specific companies. After Trump shared his plans for the middlemen, Cramer pointed out that the industry does enjoy significant reach.\n\nHe shared \u201cI think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress.\u201d This is because Cramer believes that once the different levers of the US government (Republicans, Democrats, and the Executive) act in unison then, \u201cwhen you have that kind of come together over them, you don\u2019t wanna be in that business.\u201d\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the big companies are not completely vulnerable. \u201cThese companies are not, uh, without their friends,\u201d shared Cramer. He also added that the firms also \u201cresent the middlemen. Cardinal\u2019s had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. [MCK] is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product.\u201d\n\nYet, while the companies might have friends, some of them are vulnerable as well. Later during his show, Cramer commented on the firm that ranks 13th on this list. He shared that this firm is \u201cviewed as being part of the problem of the cost of healthcare,\u201d and added that \u201cthey have no friends.\u201d He also mentioned another firm in a later program. This stock ranks 6th on our list of stocks Cramer talked about after the Fed\u2019s interest rate cut.\n\nHe believes that \u201cLook I think that if I were the people at [the healthcare benefit managers], when the President-elect decides that he is going to take a shot at you, as we know from his first time around, it\u2019s not one off. There\u2019s multiple shots. Multiple attempts to say listen you guys are . . . friction. I would not buy these stocks.\u201d Commenting on President-elect Trump and his partner Elon Musk, Cramer commented \u201cI mean these guys are powerful one-two combination.\u201d\n\nThe rather sharp remarks for the pharma benefits manager were somewhat of a departure from Cramer\u2019s earlier comments. For the same stock, he shared \u201cCan we just say that the middlemen have been under fire for decades. And they are always, they always, McKesson is always standing. McKesson has just defied everyone. Right. They defy everybody. No one can touch McKesson.\u201d\n\nOverall though Cramer believes that the healthcare benefits management sector might be in for trouble in the future. Investors also appear to be cognizant of this reality with some stocks down 45.57% year-to-date. Within this turmoil, let\u2019s see how his previous stock predictions have fared.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about healthcare stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out pharma, hospital management, and healthcare benefit management stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 80\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 8-16-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: -6.5%\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global pharmaceutical giant that has struggled with high debt and activist investor pressure in 2024. The firm had $61.5 billion in long-term debt as of 2023 end, and its CEO is currently exploring the sale of its hospital drug unit to raise cash and reduce leverage (news that saw the stock drop by 14% over the next couple of days). Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\u2019s shares will be driven by cost-cutting through which the firm aims to deliver at least $4 billion in savings in 2024. It is also aggressively touting its COVID treatment Paxlovid as a cash cost, particularly as the drug brought in $2.7 billion in Q3 sales. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in August:\n\n\u201cPfizer has a 5% yield and some interesting drugs, but it\u2019s a bit like when you trade for someone who costs $60 million and they end up performing like a penny stock.\u201d\n\nOverall, PFE ranks 3rd on our list of healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PFE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Moderna and Pfizer were the two major pharmaceuticals who came up with vaccine against Covid-19.As the clip went viral, Cummings reacted to some of the comments on X and asked whether she said any lie.\"this is what I said at the end of my roast set on CNN tonight that I zoomed through beacause I was running out of time (and scared) : Since I only have a minute left and I\u2019m live on an establishment media, I figured I\u2019d list some of things mainstream media will never cover: The first trump shooter didn\u2019t have any silverware in his house,The Crown prince of Saudi Arabia put money into Disney, why is fluoride still in our water?

            "content": "Drugmakers plan to raise US prices on at least 250 branded medications including Pfizer COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s cancer cell therapies and vaccines from France\u2019s Sanofi (SNY) at the start of 2025, according to data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nNearly all of the drug price increases are below 10% \u2013 most well below. The median price increase of the drugs being hiked Jan. 1 is 4.5%, which is in line with the median for all price increases last year.\n\nThe increases are to list prices, which do not include rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts.\n\nPfizer\n\nLarger drug price increases were once far more common in the U.S. but in recent years drugmakers have scaled them back after price hikes drew sharp criticism in the middle of the last decade.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers don\u2019t have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\u201d 3 Axis President Antonio Ciaccia said.\n\nA Reuters analysis of prices for new drugs found that pharmaceutical companies launched new U.S. drugs in 2023 at prices 35% higher than in 2022.\n\nThe over 250 drug hikes represent an increase from Dec. 29 last year when drugmakers unveiled plans to raise prices on more than 140 brands of drugs.\n\nDrug companies are also reducing some prices on Jan. 1. Merck & Co plans to cut the list price of its heavily discounted diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet \u201cto align the list price more closely to the net price.\u201d\n\nUS PAYS MOST\n\nThe U.S. pays more for prescription medicines than any other country, and incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to lower drug costs by focusing on middlemen in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nMore drug price increases are likely to be announced by other drugmakers over the course of January \u2013 historically the biggest month for drugmakers to raise prices.\n\nPfizer raised prices of the most drugs on the latest list \u2013 more than 60 drugs. As well as a 3% hike on Paxlovid, the company raised prices on medicines including migraine treatment Nurtec and cancer drugs Adcetris, Ibrance and Xeljanz between 3% and 5%.\n\n\u201cPfizer has adjusted the average list prices of our medicines and vaccines for 2025 below the overall rate of inflation \u2013 approximately 2.4% \u2013 across many products in our diverse product portfolio,\u201d Pfizer spokesperson Amy Rose said in an email. She said the increases help support investments in drug development and offset costs.\n\nBristol Myers raised the price of its expensive cancer cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi by 6% and 9%, respectively. The personalized blood cancer treatments can already cost close to half a million dollars.\n\nA BMS spokesperson said in an email that the company is \u201ccommitted to achieving unfettered patient access\u201d to its medicines. She said the price of Breyanzi in particular \u201cis reflective of the potentially transformative, individualized treatment in a one-time infusion.\u201d\n\nSanofi raised prices on around a dozen of its vaccines between 2.9% and 9%.\n\nThe largest brand price increases according to the 3 Axis analysis were from Leadiant Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Italy\u2019s Essetifin. The company raised prices around 15% on its Hodgkin\u2019s disease treatment Matulane and about 20% on Cystaran, eye drops to help patients with symptoms from a rare condition called cystinosis.\n\nSpokespeople from Leadiant and Sanofi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBristol Myers raised the price of its expensive cancer cell therapies Abecma and Breyanzi by 6% and 9%, respectively.

They had witnessed a growth of 12.5 per cent in revenues from the US market in H1 FY2025.\n\nHowever, high incidences of warning letters and import alerts by the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) remain a key credit risk. These not only lead to delays in product launches, but also failure in supplying penalties and the incurring of additional costs towards remedial measures, thus impacting revenue growth and profit margins.\n\nPharma companies have taken several measures to combat various US market-related risks. These include optimisation of product portfolio, cost saving measures and increased focus on complex molecules including injectables, inhalations, specialty products and biosimilars.",

My heart rate felt so fast.'\n\nMs Spinks told a doctor 'she couldn't breathe', but was told it was a 'normal reaction'.\n\n'She didn\u2019t listen to my heart, she didn\u2019t do any tests,' she said.\n\n'She said \"go home take two aspirins and we see how you are in the morning\".'\n\nHowever, Ms Spinks said the pain and worry were so bad she didn't get any sleep that night.\n\nBefore getting the Covid shots Ms Spinks had been a baseball and softball player since her youth representing at national level\n\nMs Spinks with her family who she said had helped her pay around a quarter of a million dollars on treatments since she got the Covid vaccines\n\nThe next day Ms Spinks' mother Shona took her to a hospital but was not allowed to be in the room with her daughter because of Covid restrictions.\n\n'I had to flag down a nurse because no one was looking at me,' Ms Spinks said.\n\n'They did not do tests that were relevant and should have kept me but they didn\u2019t.'\n\nDuring the following weeks, Ms Spinks said she felt a stab to her heart 'every minute or every second minute of every day'.\n\n'It would leave me breathless. I couldn\u2019t hold a conversation. I was bed-ridden for the first month,' she said.\n\n'Because my heart rate is so high it is so exhausting to exist.'\n\nMs Spinks also suffered severe palpitations throughout her entire body during both day and night.\n\n'At times, the palpitations were so powerful that I couldn\u2019t even sit still, as my entire body rocked with each heartbeat. I am in agonising pain and they have given me no medication,' she said.\n\n'I would cry myself to sleep but I lived in fear of not waking up. I thought I was going insane.'\n\nFor two years after the jabs, Ms Spinks underwent seven cardiac MRIs and dozens of echocardiograms, stress tests, angiograms and electrophysiology studies along with numerous ECGs, hundreds of blood tests and various X-rays.\n\nShe consulted two cardiologists, a rheumatologist, an immunologist, a physiotherapist and a paediatrician and spent three periods in hospital - the most recent being a two-week admittance in October.\n\nMs Spinks has been diagnosed with vaccine myopericarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) arrhythmia, tachycardia and tachy-brady syndrome.\n\nThese conditions produce inflammation around and on the heart, rapid heart beats and extreme dizziness when standing from a prone position.\n\nMs Spinks went to Cyprus earlier this year for apheresis treatments that filter spike protein out of the blood\n\nMs Spinks has endured three years of extensive tests and treatments since the vaccines\n\nTo cope wi the assortment of hellish symptoms, Ms Spinks took 23 medications daily, including 12 Nurofen, along with steroids, colchicine, calcium-ion inhibitors, and beta-blockers.\n\n'Unfortunately, none provided any relief,' she said.\n\nMs Spinks said the biggest hurdles to getting help with vaccine injuries has been getting them diagnosed in the first place and then finding someone who is across the the emerging medical studies on Covid vaccine side-effects.\n\nUnder the care of her 'fantastic' current cardiologist, Ms Spinks and Shona pushed for and eventually secured IVIG (human immunoglobulin) infusions.\n\nMs Spinks described this treatment as a 'turning point' and was delighted to find all her debilitating symptoms were 'basically gone' a few days after getting the first blood infusions.\n\n'I felt alive for the first time in years. It was fantastic,' she said.\n\nUnfortunately the improvements began to fade after a few months, but her overall condition is still better than it had been before the IVIG treatment.\n\nAfter doing her own medical research along with her mother, Ms Spinks travelled to Cyprus for apheresis treatments, which is a kind of blood filtering or cleaning to remove spike proteins, which are produced by mRNA vaccines.\n\nMs Spinks estimates the money she and her parents have spent on the various treatments amounts to around $250,000.\n\n'It is deeply disheartening to have to seek medical treatments abroad when these should be accessible in a first-world country like Australia,' she said.\n\nMs Spinks has been forced into three hospital stays for conditions brought on by the Covid jabs\n\n'I feel profoundly let down by the medical system, which neglected my condition for far too long.\n\n'If I was diagnosed sooner, treated sooner I don\u2019t think I would have these permanent issues.\n\n'The lack of structure we have in Australia, we have zero resources for vaccine injured people, there is nothing, and I don\u2019t know there is any research done into all this.'\n\nShe still needs to make medication twice daily to keep her heart beat regulated, but is well enough to work one day a week as a receptionist for a radiology company.\n\n'I can kind of function but I am still not the same person I was and I don\u2019t think I ever will be,' she said.\n\n'I have had to make my peace with that.'\n\nLast year Ms Spinks even managed to finish her physio degree.\n\n'I am very proud of that, there were a lot of placement hours and pushing through a lot of that pain,' she said.\n\nHowever, it appears unlikely she will get to practice as a physio with most aged care homes and other care facilities requiring fully up-to-date vaccination for work placements.\n\nThe Health Department states on its website that Covid vaccines 'have been thoroughly assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and found to be safe and effective'.\n\n'The TGA checks all Covid-19 vaccines for quality, safety and effectiveness before approving them for use in Australia,' the department said.\n\n'This is the same process that all vaccines go through in Australia. Medical experts at the TGA continuously check all vaccines to make sure they are safe.\n\n'Vaccines are only approved for use in Australia after they have been assessed to show that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks.'",

            "content": "Pfizer\u2019s research partnership with Sangamo Therapeutics produced a hemophilia A gene therapy that reached FDA discussions about a regulatory submission. That\u2019s as far as the alliance will go. Pfizer is terminating the seven-year-old pact, a move that comes before the pharmaceutical giant must make costly milestone payments for a product with uncertain commercial prospects.\n\nAccording to Sangamo, Pfizer said the termination reflects its decision to not go forward with regulatory submissions for the hemophilia A gene therapy, giroctocogene fitelparvovec. The termination was announced after Monday\u2019s market close. When the termination takes effect in April, Sangamo will regain all rights to the gene therapy. The Richmond, California-based biotech said it still aims to advance the program and will explore all options, including seeking a new collaboration partner to take the therapy through regulatory review and commercialization.\n\nGiroctocogene fitelparvovec is a functioning version of the gene that codes for factor VIII, the clotting protein that\u2019s deficient in hemophilia A patients. The one-time treatment is intended to enable patients to produce factor VIII, bringing that protein closer to normal levels. Under the collaboration agreement signed in 2017, Sangamo was responsible for Phase 1/2 development of the gene therapy. Pfizer\u2019s responsibility spanned late-stage development, regulatory submissions, and commercialization.\n\nThis past summer, Pfizer reported preliminary Phase 3 results showing the gene therapy led to statistically significant reductions in annualized bleeding rates through 15 months. The pharma giant said it planned to meet with regulators. According to Sangamo, Pfizer had said it expected U.S. and European regulatory submissions would happen in early 2025. As recently as last month, Pfizer indicated it was discussing the data with regulators.\n\nHemophilia gene therapies have made it through regulatory review. Pfizer did it earlier this year, winning FDA approval for Beqvez, a hemophilia B gene therapy that was licensed from Spark Therapeutics. But commercializing pricey hemophilia gene therapies has proven to be difficult. For patients who can manage hemophilia with infusions of clotting proteins or chronic dosing of certain drugs, one-time treatment from gene therapy has been a tough sell. Newer hemophilia drugs are entering the market, giving patients even more choices. Pfizer has one of them with Hympavzi, a once-weekly injectable drug approved by the FDA in October for both hemophilia A and B.\n\nThe commercialization challenges facing hemophilia gene therapies are forcing companies to make hard choices. Lackluster sales of Roctavian, a BioMarin Pharmaceutical gene therapy for hemophilia A approved last year, have led that company to explore options including divestiture of the product. Now Pfizer has decided not to proceed with Sangamo\u2019s hemophilia A gene therapy.\n\nUnder the gene therapy alliance, Sangamo received $70 million up front. According to the biotech\u2019s financial reports, it had received $55 million in milestone payments so far. Up to $220 million in additional milestone payments remained outstanding. Sangamo was counting on the Pfizer payments for its survival.\n\nSponsored Post How PDPM Optimization Improves Facility Financial Performance Transitioning to PDPM models significantly shifted the healthcare industry. By replacing the RUG system, healthcare providers cut waste and more accurately reflect the care each patient received.\n\nCollaborations with Novartis and Biogen ended last year, leading Sangamo to implement a corporate restructuring and layoffs. Sangamo has since inked deals with Genentech and Astellas Pharma, but these agreements come with small upfront payments and milestones that may be years away. In its financial reports, Sangamo said it has explored the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection. The company\u2019s cash position as of Sept. 30 was $39.2 million, according to its report for the third quarter of 2024. Sangamo said it expected to have enough cash to last only into the first quarter of 2025.\n\nSangamo needs cash to support its pipeline of neurology genomic medicines, including a gene therapy for Fabry disease. In October, the FDA confirmed to the company that Phase 1/2 data would be sufficient to support a regulatory submission under the accelerated approval pathway. The company planned a submission for the second half of 2025.\n\nIn the announcement of the Pfizer termination, Sangamo said it believes it can chart a path forward for its programs, but the company acknowledged that additional funding is necessary for advancing each of them, including the hemophilia A gene therapy. In a prepared statement, Sangamo CEO Sandy Macrae said the company was surprised and disappointed by Pfizer\u2019s decision to end the collaboration so close to the expected regulatory submissions.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to exploring the optimal path forward for this important treatment, including seeking the right partner with the focus and understanding of the genomic medicine commercial environment to bring this medicine to patients,\u201d he said.\n\nIllustration: Kuzma, Getty Images",

Credit: jayk7 via Getty Images.\n\nSangamo Therapeutics\u2019 stock has plummeted by 50% in premarket trading after Pfizer ended the companies\u2019 partnership to co-develop a gene therapy for haemophilia A.\n\nSangamo announced it will regain the development and commercialisation rights to giroctocogene fitelparvovec, an investigational gene therapy for adults with moderately severe to severe haemophilia A.\n\nThis follows Pfizer\u2019s decision to terminate their global collaboration and license agreement, effective 21 April 2025. Sangamo plans to explore options to advance the programme, including seeking a new collaboration partner. Shares in Sangamo \u2013 which had been set to receive up to $220m in milestone payments under the agreement \u2013 lost 50% of their value in after-hours trading following the announcement, which came just before the close on 30 December.\n\nThe decision comes despite positive results from the Phase III AFFINE clinical trial (NCT04370054), which demonstrated that the therapy met its primary goal by reducing the total annualised bleeding rate (ABR) compared to routine Factor VIII (FVIII) replacement prophylaxis. Pfizer previously indicated plans to submit biologics license application (BLA) and marketing authorisation application filings in early 2025 but has now opted not to proceed.\n\nPfizer said in a statement that a slow uptake of haemophilia A gene therapy in patients with moderate to severe disease and \u201climited interest\u201d in another gene therapy option for the specified patient population prompted its decision.\n\nThe development of gene therapies for rare diseases is a resource-intensive process that requires advanced technologies, large-scale clinical trials, and navigation of complex regulatory pathways. This has led several pharmaceutical companies to reevaluate or halt gene therapy programmes due to high costs and questions about commercial viability.\n\nGene therapies, especially for conditions with small patient populations like haemophilia A, pose unique financial challenges. While these treatments can potentially provide long-term or curative outcomes, their high development costs and production complexities result in significant price tags. For instance, BioMarin\u2019s US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved haemophilia A gene therapy, Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox), launched in 2023 with a $2.9m price point, sparking ongoing debate about the cost-effectiveness of such therapies.\n\nSandy Macrae, CEO of Sangamo Therapeutics, said the therapy has the potential to be life-changing for haemophilia A patients and is well-positioned for regulatory submissions and commercialisation. Macrae expressed disappointment at Pfizer\u2019s decision, particularly given the strong Phase III data, but acknowledged Pfizer\u2019s role in advancing the programme to this stage. Pfizer will continue to monitor trial participants during the transition period.\n\nCell & Gene Therapy coverage on Pharmaceutical Technology is supported by Cytiva.\n\nEditorial content is independently produced and follows the highest standards of journalistic integrity.

            "content": "The beaten-down pharmaceutical giant could double your investment over three to four years.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry can be a tough business. Companies must innovate constantly to stay relevant because patents protecting their proprietary drugs expire. Pfizer (PFE 0.47%), a longtime stalwart in the pharmaceutical sector, enjoyed a growth spurt during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid treatment.\n\nSales and earnings have plunged since the pandemic ended, sending Pfizer stock down over 50% off its former high.\n\nIronically, the best time to invest in cyclical companies like Pfizer is during these valleys, just before the next growth spurt. Although Pfizer seems headed toward big things over the coming years, the stock has immediate appeal. Here are three reasons to consider buying Pfizer like there's no tomorrow -- today.\n\n1. The business is trending up again\n\nAs terrible as COVID-19 was for society, it was undeniably a windfall for Pfizer. The company's two COVID-19 products combined for approximately $56.7 billion in sales in 2022, ballooning its total revenue to $100.3 billion. Naturally, as the pandemic opportunity dried up, it seemed like Pfizer was imploding. You can see sales and earnings spike and then crash in the chart below:\n\nMore importantly, revenue and earnings bottomed and began rising again this year. This isn't a fluke; through nine months of 2024, Pfizer's specialty care products are up 11% year over year, while oncology sales are up 25%. Comirnaty sales (reported in Pfizer's primary care portfolio) are down 66% through nine months of 2024 versus last year, but the number is small enough now that it's not dragging the company down.\n\nPfizer is focusing on oncology for growth for the rest of the decade. In late 2023, it used its pandemic profits to acquire Seagen for $43 billion to beef up its oncology pipeline. The strategy seems to be working so far. Management is predicting earnings growth between 10% and 18% for 2025, and analysts estimate earnings will grow by an average of 14% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nIn other words, Pfizer looks ready to grow again.\n\n2. A massive dividend with strong financial backing\n\nInvestors don't have to buy and hope they eventually make money. Pfizer is generously compensating its shareholders for their patience with a dividend that yields 6.3% at today's share price.\n\nThat's higher than most blue chip stocks, which might raise alarm bells about the dividend's dependability. However, the facts don't support that. Management has repeatedly maintained its plans to support (and raise) the dividend and followed through with a 2.4% increase in early December.\n\nIt's not a big increase, but Pfizer is focusing on paying down debt, so once the balance sheet is healthy again, I'd look for more dividend growth. Financially, the dividend is fine. The payout ratio is only 67% of guided 2025 earnings, so this wasn't a desperate raise -- Pfizer can afford it.\n\n3. Potential market-beating returns from Pfizer's current price\n\nYou might expect a hefty dividend and double-digit earnings growth to fetch a solid valuation on the stock market, but nope. Pfizer trades at just over 10 times its 2025 earnings guidance. Why? It's probably a combination of several factors. Pfizer may still have a stigma from its post-pandemic falloff. Additionally, investors may fear how a new government administration could impact Pfizer and the broader pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need the valuation to change to make good money from Pfizer stock. The stock could remain at its current price-to-earnings ratio and still deliver 20% annualized returns, enough to double your investment in under four years. That's 6% from the dividend plus another 14% from earnings growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 trades above its historical norms, leading some to speculate about potential market downturns. I'd say the odds are that Pfizer stock will outperform the broader stock market over the coming years, assuming its oncology growth agenda goes as planned. So far, so good, with a strong growth guide for 2025.",

Every time it attempts to climb over the $30 mark, something causes shares to slide right back down. Despite the disheartening price action, this medical sector giant is still one of the world\u2019s largest research-based biopharmaceutical companies behind Eli Lilly & Co. NYSE: LLY.\n\nPfizer is trading at a bargain valuation at just 9.1x forward earnings with a tasty 6.46% annual dividend yield. Here are four more reasons to consider this stock for your portfolio.\n\nGet Pfizer alerts: Sign Up\n\n1) Pfizer Has Resumed Growth Again\n\nPfizer Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$31.92\n\n24.05% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 17 Analyst Ratings Current Price $25.74 High Forecast $45.00 Average Forecast $31.92 Low Forecast $25.00 Pfizer Stock Forecast Details\n\nRevenues had declined for five of the past six quarters heading into its Q3 report. In its third-quarter 2024 earnings report, Pfizer posted profits of $1.06 per share, which handily beat consensus estimates by 45 cents. Its revenues surged 32% YoY to $17.7 billion, absolutely crushing consensus estimates for $14.92 billion. The revenue growth reflects an operation increase of 32% YoY or $4.3 billion, mostly due to the growth contributions of its Paxlovid COVID-19 antiviral treatment and acquired products. Higher instances of COVID-19 infections in the summer have driven the surge in COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.\n\nExcluding contributions from its COVID-19 treatments, Paxlovid and Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine, revenues would have increased $1.7 billion or 14% YoY. Cost savings are on track to deliver at least $5.5 billion from its previously announced cost reduction initiatives.\n\nPfizer remains on track with its dose optimization studies for its oral GLP-1 receptor agonist candidate, Danuglipron. It's all once daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist in Phase 1, and its oral small molecule GIPR antagonist is advancing in Phase 2 studies.\n\n2) Pfizer Is Focused on Its Oncology Business\n\nPfizer is focused on growing its oncology business which is driven by its acquisition of massive $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. Critics and activist Starboard were very displeased with Pfizer overpaying for Seagen, which is only supposed to contribute around $3.1 billion in revenue to the topline in 2024.\n\nPfizer is already the world's third-largest oncology company based on 1H 2024. Its advanced prostate cancer drug XTANDI revenues rose 28% YoY. TALZENNA revenue rose 77% YoY. The company reported significant overall survival benefits for its Phase 3 TALAPRO study, which is a combination of TALZENNA and XTANDI. Its adult alpositive metastatic noncell lung cancer drug LOBRENA saw 31% operation growth. ELREXFIO for multiple myeloma treatment saw 80% sequential revenue growth over Q2 2024.\n\nPfizer has a solid pipeline for lung cancer treatments, which is the number one cause of cancer-related death around the world. It's enrolling patients in its Phase 3 clinical study for MEBROMESTOSTAN, its novel EZH2 inhibitor for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Pfizer is making progress on the development of two candidates to replace the current backbones of HER positive HER2 negative breast cancer.\n\n3) Pfizer Raised the Full-Year 2025 Guidance and Updated the 2025 Forecast\n\nThe company raised its full-year 2024 EPS to $2.75 to $2.95, up from previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.65 versus $2.66 consensus estimates. Full-year 2024 revenue is expected to be between $61 billion to $64 billion, raised from previous guidance of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion versus $61.13 billion. The updated guidance includes nearly $10.5 billion in anticipated revenues for Comirnaty ($5 billion) and Paxlovid ($5.5 billion).\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2024, Pfizer updated guidance for 2025. The impact of Medicare Part D redesign is expected to be a $1 billion headwind across its product portfolio in 2025. The new Trump administration is committed to reforming the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) industry but doesn't expect material vaccine policy changes. Prevnar revenues are expected to decline slightly in 2025. The company also reached its goal of achieving $4 billion in cost savings in 2024, with another $500 million expected in 2025.\n\n4) PFE Stock May Attempt to Break Out of a Descending Triangle Pattern\n\nA descending triangle is normally a bearish chart pattern indicator of lower highs on the bounce against flat bottom support. The descending upper trendline converges with the flat-bottom horizontal lower trendline support at the apex point. A breakdown triggers if the stock falls below the lower trendline support. A breakout triggers if the stock surges above the upper trendline resistance.\n\nPFE formed its descending upper trendline resistance at the $31.54 swing high, converging with the flat-bottom lower trendline at $24.46 at the apex point. PFE initially appeared to have broken out through the upper trendline on Oct. 9, 2024, but shares fell back under by Oct. 30 and reached the lower trendline on Nov. 15, 2024, before staging a rally back toward the 2020 pandemic low of $26.43. The daily anchored VWAP is rising at $25.73. Fibonacci (Fib) pullback support levels are at $25.75, $24.46, $22.45, and $20.36.\n\nActionable Options Strategies : Bullish investors can consider using cash-secured puts at the Fib pullback support levels to buy the dip. If assigned the shares, then writing covered call at upside Fib levels executes a wheel strategy for additional income while collecting the hefty 6.46% annual dividend yield. The consensus analyst price target has 20.75% upside to $32.14.\n\nBefore you consider Pfizer, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Pfizer wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Pfizer currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

That was an increase on the $1 million booked by BioMarin in the same period of 2023, but Roctavian remains hamstrung by reimbursement and market access challenges and the company said recently it will limit commercialisation of the gene therapy to just three key markets (the US, Italy, and Germany).\n\nIn July, Pfizer presented the results of the phase 3 AFFINE study of giroctocogene fitelparvovec that showed the gene therapy was able to achieve superior results on various measures, including reducing the annualised bleeding rate (ABR), compared to prophylaxis with factor VIII replacement therapies.\n\nThat prompted Pfizer and Sangamo to start talking to regulators about a possible route to approval, but it seems Pfizer has lost faith that investing further in the programme will give it a satisfactory return.\n\nAmong the reasons held up for the slow uptake of Roctavian are doubts about how clinically meaningful the ABR endpoint is to patients and clinicians, as well as unanswered questions about the long-term effects of the therapy, in addition to the market access challenges. At the moment, it would seem those also apply to giroctocogene fitelparvovec.\n\nPfizer, meanwhile, has been building a presence in haemophilia with other new therapies, notably recently launched anti-TFPI antibody Hympavzi (marstacimab) \u2013 used to treat haemophilia A and B without inhibitors \u2013 and $3.5 million haemophilia B gene therapy Beqvez (fidanocogene elaparvovec), which was approved by the FDA in April and competes with CSL Behring's Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec). So far, Pfizer has not revealed any sales figures with Hympavzi or Beqvez.\n\nThe decision adds to the pressure on Sangamo, which has been through a difficult period in the last couple of years, punctuated with job losses and divested R&D programmes, as it reinvents itself as a neurology-focused genomic medicine specialist. Last year, Novartis and Biogen also exited alliances with the company.\n\nThe company said that recently announced partnerships with Roche's Genentech unit and Astellas, and advanced business development discussions for its Fabry gene therapy programme (isaralgagene civaparvovec) in phase 1/2, will allow it to chart a path forward.",

            "content": "RICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGMO), a genomic medicine company, today announced it will regain development and commercialization rights to giroctocogene fitelparvovec, an investigational gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of adults with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A that it has co-developed with, and licensed to Pfizer Inc., following a decision by Pfizer to terminate the global collaboration and license agreement between the parties. Sangamo intends to explore all options to advance the program, including seeking a potential new collaboration partner. Pfizer has indicated to Sangamo that this termination reflects its decision not to proceed with the Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) submissions for, or to pursue commercialization of, giroctocogene fitelparvovec.\n\nIn July 2024, Pfizer announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 AFFINE trial evaluating giroctocogene fitelparvovec that demonstrated the trial met primary and key secondary objectives of superiority compared to prophylaxis. On December 9, 2024, Pfizer presented detailed AFFINE data in an oral presentation at the 66th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition, with the presentation selected as part of the \u201cBest of ASH\u201d program, which highlights the most cutting-edge science presented during the Annual Meeting. In November 2024, Pfizer indicated to Sangamo that Pfizer was discussing these data with regulatory authorities. Pfizer previously indicated to Sangamo that anticipated BLA and MAA submissions were expected to occur in early 2025.\n\n\u201cGiroctocogene fitelparvovec has demonstrated the potential to be a life changing gene therapy treatment for hemophilia A patients, and following positive results from the Phase 3 AFFINE trial, we believe it is well positioned for regulatory submissions and potential commercialization,\u201d said Sandy Macrae, Chief Executive Officer of Sangamo Therapeutics. \u201cWhile we were surprised and extremely disappointed by Pfizer\u2019s decision to end our collaboration so close to the anticipated BLA and MAA submissions, especially given the compelling pivotal clinical trial data, we appreciate their collaboration in leading a robust and successful clinical development program and for advancing the asset to this important stage. We are committed to exploring the optimal path forward for this important treatment, including seeking the right partner with the focus and understanding of the genomic medicine commercial environment to bring this medicine to patients. In parallel, we remain focused on advancing our wholly owned neurology genomic medicine pipeline and progressing our Fabry gene therapy program towards a potential BLA submission in the second half of 2025.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer will terminate effective April 21, 2025, at which time Pfizer will be required to transition the giroctocogene fitelparvovec program back to Sangamo. All trial participants will continue to be monitored as planned during the transition period.\n\nSangamo believes that its recently announced partnerships with Genentech and Astellas, and advanced business development discussions for its Fabry gene therapy program, will allow it to chart a path forward for its neurology genomic medicine pipeline as it prepares to initiate expected enrollment of patients in the Phase 1/2 study of ST-503 for idiopathic small fiber neuropathy in mid-2025, and file an anticipated Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA) submission for the prion disease program in Q4 2025, each subject to securing adequate additional funding.\n\nAbout the AFFINE Trial\n\nThe Phase 3 AFFINE (NCT04370054) trial is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single infusion of giroctocogene fitelparvovec in adult male participants (n=75 dosed participants) with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A. Trial participants included in the assessments of the key endpoints of the primary efficacy analysis (n=50) completed a minimum six months of routine FVIII replacement prophylaxis therapy during the lead-in study (NCT03587116) providing data to compare with post giroctocogene fitelparvovec treatment.\n\nIn July 2024, Pfizer announced that the AFFINE trial achieved its primary objective of non-inferiority, as well as superiority, of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) from Week 12 through at least 15 months of follow up post-infusion compared with routine Factor VIII (FVIII) replacement prophylaxis treatment. Following a single 3e13 vg/kg dose, giroctocogene fitelparvovec demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mean total ABR compared to the pre-infusion period (1.24 vs 4.73; one-sided p-value=0.0040). Key secondary endpoints as defined by the trial protocol were met and also demonstrated superiority compared to prophylaxis. In the AFFINE trial, giroctocogene fitelparvovec was generally well tolerated.\n\nGiroctocogene fitelparvovec has been developed as part of a collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization of gene therapies for hemophilia A between Sangamo Therapeutics and Pfizer. In late 2019, Sangamo transferred the manufacturing technology and the Investigational New Drug application to Pfizer. Under the agreement, Pfizer assumed responsibility for pivotal studies, any regulatory activities, and potential global commercialization of giroctocogene fitelparvovec.\n\nAbout Hemophilia A\n\nHemophilia is an inherited, rare bleeding disorder that causes people to bleed for longer than normal due to a deficiency of a protein required for normal blood clotting, known as clotting Factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilia A. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the amount of the factor in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur, which can lead to serious health problems.\n\nHemophilia A occurs in approximately 25 in every 100,000 male births worldwide. Approximately 55-75% of males with hemophilia A have a moderate to severe form of the disease. For people who live with hemophilia A, there is an increased risk of spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery. It is a lifelong disease that requires constant monitoring and therapy.\n\nAbout Sangamo Therapeutics\n\nSangamo Therapeutics is a genomic medicine company dedicated to translating ground-breaking science into medicines that transform the lives of patients and families afflicted with serious neurological diseases who do not have adequate or any treatment options. Sangamo believes that its zinc finger epigenetic regulators are ideally suited to potentially address devastating neurological disorders and that its capsid discovery platform can expand delivery beyond currently available intrathecal delivery capsids, including the central nervous system. Sangamo\u2019s pipeline also includes multiple partnered programs and programs with opportunities for partnership and investment.

These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to: Sangamo\u2019s plans to explore options to commercialize giroctocogene fitelparvovec and advance the giroctocogene fitelparvovec program, including through seeking a potential new collaboration partner; the potential of giroctocogene fitelparvovec to be a life changing gene therapy treatment for hemophilia A patients; Sangamo\u2019s belief that giroctocogene fitelparvovec is well positioned for regulatory submissions and potential commercialization; the effects of the termination of the collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, including with respect to the transition of giroctocogene fitelparvovec back to Sangamo; expectations concerning Sangamo\u2019s Fabry program, including plans for a potential BLA submission and the timing thereof and expectations concerning Sangamo\u2019s ability to secure a potential partnership for such program; Sangamo\u2019s plans to initiate enrollment of patients in the Phase 1/2 study of ST-503 for idiopathic small fiber neuropathy and the anticipated timing thereof; Sangamo\u2019s plans to submit a CTA for the prion disease program and the anticipated timing thereof; Sangamo\u2019s belief that its recently announced partnerships with Genentech and Astellas, and advanced business development discussions for its Fabry gene therapy program, will allow it to chart a path forward for its neurology genomic medicine pipeline; and other statements that are not historical fact. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to Sangamo\u2019s lack of capital resources and need for substantial additional funding to execute its operating plan and to continue to operate as a going concern, including the risk that Sangamo will be unable to obtain funding or partnerships or additional collaboration partners necessary to advance its preclinical and clinical programs and to otherwise operate as a going concern, in which case Sangamo may be required to cease operations entirely, liquidate all or a portion of its assets and/or seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; the uncertain and costly research and development process; risks related to Sangamo\u2019s reliance on partners to advance its Fabry and giroctocogene fitelparvovec programs, including the risks that Sangamo may be unable to identify and engage any new potential collaboration partners for such programs on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and even if Sangamo is able to do so, such potential partners may be unable to meaningfully advance such programs, whether due to internal portfolio prioritization decisions or otherwise; the risk that Sangamo will not realize the benefits of, including receipt of potential payments under, its collaboration agreements; the effects of macroeconomic factors or financial challenges, including as a result of the ongoing overseas conflicts, current or potential future bank failures, inflation and high interest rates, on the global business environment, healthcare systems and business and operations of Sangamo and its collaborators; the uncertain timing and unpredictable nature of clinical trial results, including the risk that therapeutic effects in the Phase 3 AFFINE trial will not be durable in patients; the unpredictable regulatory approval process for product candidates across multiple regulatory authorities; reliance on results of early clinical trials, which results are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, including the results of any registrational trial of Sangamo\u2019s product candidates; and the potential for technological developments that obviate technologies used by Sangamo. There can be no assurance that Sangamo and its collaborators will be able to develop commercially viable products. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described above and other risks and uncertainties that exist in the operations and business environments of Sangamo and its collaborators. These risks and uncertainties are described more fully in Sangamo\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings and reports, including in Sangamo\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by Sangamo\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and subsequent filings and reports that Sangamo makes from time to time with the SEC. Forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of this date, and Sangamo undertakes no duty to update such information except as required under applicable law.",

            "content": "Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs.\n\nAs executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NYSE:PFE) and Seagen products. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is now the third-largest US oncology biopharma by revenue. XTANDI, a market leader in advanced prostate cancer, grew 28% year-over-year, while TALZENNA saw a 77% increase, supported by positive survival data from the TALAPRO-2 study for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. PADCEV with pembrolizumab has become the leading first-line treatment for advanced bladder cancer, while LORBRENA achieved 31% growth in thoracic cancer.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported Q3 revenues of $17.7 billion, a 32% operational increase. COVID-19 products contributed significantly, with PAXLOVID generating $2.7 billion and COMIRNATY adding $1.4 billion. Non-COVID products also saw strong growth, with revenues of $13.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was $1.06, benefiting from strong revenues, cost efficiency, and a favorable tax rate, while GAAP EPS was $0.78, impacted by a $420 million charge for a facility sale tied to the discontinued DMD program.\n\nCapital allocation focused on deleveraging, dividends, and reinvestment. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) returned $7.1 billion to shareholders via dividends, invested $7.8 billion in R&D, and reduced debt by $4.4 billion year-to-date. It also monetized Helion shares, reducing its stake from 23% to 15%, yielding $3.5 billion in proceeds.

Among these moves is the selection of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services -- a decision that's already putting pressure on vaccine stocks. For cautious investors, this could be a signal to steer clear of Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), a stock with a history of underperforming in January.\n\nAccording to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, PFE averaged a January loss of 4.6% over the past 10 years, and finished the month in the red eight of those times. In fact, the last time Pfizer stock was higher for the month of January was in 2018. A comparable move from the security's current perch of $26.39 would place it near the $25 level.\n\nThe equity is pulling back slightly today, though it remains well above its Nov. 15 dip to $24.48 -- its lowest mark since January 2013. Shares are down 8.2% in 2024, though they're pacing for a small December gain to snap a four-month losing streak.\n\nShould this historical trend play out once again, it could force options traders to change their optimistic tune -- a move that could weigh on PFE. This is per the security's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.55 that sits in the 1st percentile of annual readings, pointing towards a penchant for calls amongst short-term premium players.\n\nOptions look to be an attractive route to go when weighing in on the Pfizer stock, according to its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 20% that ranks in the 11th percentile of the last 12 months. What's more, the security's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits at a relatively low 30 out of 100, making it a prime selling candidate for these short-term bulls.",
