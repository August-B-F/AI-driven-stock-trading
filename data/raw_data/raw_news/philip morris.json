Casino & Hotel Virginia off Interstate 95 and Wagner Road in southern Petersburg. Plans call for building a permanent gaming parlor and 200-room luxury hotel around the 90,000-foot temporary casino that developers The Cordish Companies and Bruce Smith Enterprise say will be up and running by the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nA Richmond television station reported last week that the temporary building could be the same one used by the developers of Caesars Virginia during construction of its hotel and casino on the site of the former Dan River Industries complex in Danville. However, Andy Poarch, a spokesperson for Cordish/BSE in Virginia, told The Progress-Index that while Cordish/BSE is working with the same company that Caesars used, it will not be the same one.\n\nPolice charge armored truck driver with embezzlement, say he claimed robbery to cover gambling\n\n\u201cIt will be tailored to fit our brand and operating style, and the guest experience we provide,\u201d Poarch said.\n\nThe Danville prefab casino, which the news outlet Virginia Business described as looking \u201clike a simple white tent on the outside,\u201d was 40,000 square feet and housed 740 slot machines, 25 live- and 28 electronic-gaming tables, and a quick-service restaurant called Three Stacks.\n\nPetersburg\u2019s temporary casino will be 75,000 square feet and house 900 slot machines, 33 tables, and a bar and quick-service restaurant.\n\nPetersburg and Danville are the only casino hosts in Virginia that used prefabricated buildings for their temporary casinos. Before Hard Rock opened its resort in Bristol, a temporary casino set up shop inside an abandoned mall.\n\n'Needs emotional healing': Soldier AWOL from Fort Gregg-Adams since February back on post\n\nVIDEO: Live! Casino & Hotel Virginia groundbreaking in Petersburg, Va. Live! Casino & Hotel Virginia groundbreaking in Petersburg was attended by hundreds. Watch the excitement and shovels in action.\n\nHow will Petersburg\u2019s resort compare to others?\n\nSize wise, the Live! resort in Petersburg will cover a total of 525,000 square feet of hotel, meeting and entertainment space when it opens in 2027.\n\nIt would be the third largest of Virginia\u2019s five casino resorts behind the 620,000-square foot Hard Rock Casino resort in Bristol and 587,000-square foot Caesars Virginia. It will be slightly larger than the 400,000-square foot Rivers Casino in Portsmouth and the under-construction similar-sized HeadWaters casino resort in Norfolk.\n\nIts planned 1,600 slot machines would be more than the others in Virginia, which are averaging about 1,500. Petersburg will have 65 live-action gaming tables, about 14 less than Caesars Virginia but more than Bristol, Portsmouth and Norfolk.\n\nThe planned 4,000-seat concert venue is larger than the ones at the other Virginia casinos.\n\nWatch a video here of how the Petersburg casino is envisioned.\n\nTeens face first-degree murder in shooting death of Hopewell man in early March\n\nThe first five\n\nVirginia launched its casino industry in 2020 when the Virginia General Assembly passed \u2013 and then-Gov. Ralph Northam signed \u2013 legislation setting up casinos in five cities with histories of sagging economic bases. The five original sites were Bristol, Danville, Norfolk, Richmond and Portsmouth.\n\nAll but Richmond approved referendums to bring the casinos to town. Richmond voters twice rejected plans to build a casino in south Richmond near the Philip Morris tobacco plant.\n\nBetween Richmond\u2019s votes, Petersburg seized on the opportunity to boost its base with its own casino push. Efforts stalled in the 2022 and 2023 legislative sessions as Petersburg battled Richmond for the fifth casino. After Richmond second rejection in 2023, interest in Petersburg intensified, and in 2024, the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin agreed to allow the referendum here.\n\nThat referendum passed with an 82% majority, which is considered a record in Virginia for any ballot issue not involving candidates.\n\nIn the meantime, population-rich northern Virginia \u2013 apparently envious of the popular MGM resort at National Harbor just inside Maryland \u2013 has launched its own pushes to host a casino. All have failed, including one earlier this year that passed the state Senate but died in the House of Delegates, as Virginia lawmakers appear content with the five for now.\n\nHowever, that region is home to the Rose Gaming Resort in Dumfries, owned and operated by the company that developed Rosie\u2019s Gaming Emporium sites in Richmond, New Kent County, Vinton in Roanoke County, Hampton, Emporia and Collinsville in Henry County. Because none have gaming tables and the slot machines are set up differently, Rosie\u2019s sites are not considered \u201ctraditional\u201d casinos.\n\nBill Atkinson (he/him/his) is an award-winning journalist who covers breaking news, government and politics.

            "content": "Rodney Van Dooren, Head of Illicit Trade Prevention Asia Pacific, Philip Morris International (PMI), speaking at a recent session- Switching off illicit cigarettes in the ASEAN region\n\nWritten By: Rodney Van Dooren , Head of Illicit Trade Prevention Asia Pacific, Philip Morris International (PMI).\n\nDuring a recent session on \u2018Switching Off Illicit Cigarettes \u2019, Rodney Van Dooren, Head of Illicit Trade Prevention Asia Pacific, Philip Morris International (PMI), underlined the importance of securing cross-border collaboration and stringent enforcement to combat illicit tobacco trade in the ASEAN region\n\nOver the past year, governments and relevant agencies across the ASEAN region have intensified their efforts to crack down on illicit cigarettes. However, the problem remains severe, with 1 in 4 cigarettes consumed in these countries being illegal. The issue transcends borders, as countries like India and Thailand serve as both transit hubs and destination markets for smuggled cigarettes.\n\nThe WHO FCTC identifies India as a key player in the illicit tobacco trade, acting as both a transit point and a significant consumer market. Intelligence reports indicate that illicit cigarettes enter India through ports, airports, and land borders, contributing to a multi-billion-dollar underground economy. Globally, illicit cigarettes account for approximately 11.3% of total consumption, leading to a staggering $40.5 billion in tax losses for governments worldwide.\n\nIllicit Cigarette Trade in the ASEAN Region- The Growing Threat\n\nThe illicit cigarette trade in the ASEAN region presents significant challenges, threatening national security and compromising sovereignty. This is more than just an economic issue\u2014it is a form of economic sabotage that undermines legitimate businesses and government revenue streams.\n\nRecent statistics highlight the severity of the issue. In 2023, illicit cigarettes made up 15% of global consumption, totalling 485 billion units. Among these, illicit white cigarettes accounted for 47%, while counterfeit products comprised 7%. Media reports also suggest that Cambodia has become a hub for counterfeit cigarette production, a direct violation of intellectual property rights. Overall, the economic losses attributed to illicit cigarettes in the ASEAN region exceed $3.7 billion, further exacerbating fiscal challenges for governments.\n\nLoopholes Enabling the Illegal Cigarette Market in ASEAN\n\nSeveral regulatory and enforcement loopholes continue to fuel the illegal cigarette market. Weak intellectual property rights enforcement, tax evasion, and widespread corruption allow the black market to thrive. While origin countries often benefit economically, destination markets bear the brunt of the damage through lost revenue, public health risks, and increased criminal activity.\n\nAlthough international agreements such as those under the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Customs Organization (WCO), and Free Trade Agreements (FTA) call for cross-border cooperation, they lack strong legal instruments to hold participating nations accountable. Declared exports often list a trading entity rather than the actual destination, making it difficult to track illicit shipments. This discrepancy allows smugglers to bypass import duties and excise taxes, further exacerbating economic losses.\n\nAdditionally, loopholes in regulations create enforcement challenges. Manufacturing and export laws do not require compliance with destination country regulations, allowing illicit products to be legally produced and shipped while avoiding scrutiny. Moreover, current transit regulations do not allow authorities to inspect suspicious shipments, leaving gaps in enforcement.\n\nThe Path Forward: A Coordinated Regional Strategy\n\nTo combat the illicit cigarette trade effectively, ASEAN nations must adopt a unified approach that prioritizes strong governance and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nLeadership and Policy Action : The issue should be prioritized at the highest level, with the Head of State leading efforts to combat corruption, enhance regulatory frameworks, impose stricter penalties, and foster cross-border cooperation.\n\n: The issue should be prioritized at the highest level, with the Head of State leading efforts to combat corruption, enhance regulatory frameworks, impose stricter penalties, and foster cross-border cooperation.

Harmonized Regulatory Framework: The region should adopt uniform laws requiring manufacturers and exporters to comply with destination country regulations. Additionally, enforcement agencies should be empowered to inspect suspicious tobacco shipments in transit to prevent illegal trade. PMI\u2019s Commitment to Eradicating Illicit Tobacco Trade\n\nEliminating illicit tobacco trade has been a longstanding priority for Philip Morris International (PMI) and remains integral to its broader efforts in driving operational excellence and building a sustainable future. As part of its strategy, PMI focuses on five critical areas: research & intelligence, protecting the supply chain, partnerships & cooperation, support for law enforcement and raising awareness. The organisation partners with law enforcement agencies in the fight against the trade of illegal cigarettes. Efforts are largely concentrated on securing its supply chain and protecting products via technology and innovation: from multiple applications of authentication and security technologies to track and trace products across the supply chain.\n\n(Rodney Van Dooren is the Head of Illicit Trade Prevention Asia Pacific, Philip Morris International).",

Yet when these users begin scouting and diving into the state capital\u2019s retail real estate market, they often find that entering or expanding there is much easier said than done.\n\nSkyrocketing home prices, increased vehicular congestion and limited infrastructure outside the urban core are just the most visible ways in which Austin has been somewhat victimized by its own torrid growth over the past 10 to 15 years. And each of those variables factors into retail site selection and contributes to the challenges of adding new retail and restaurant space to the market.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: InterFace Conference Group, a division of France Media Inc., produces networking and educational conferences for commercial real estate executives. To sign up for email announcements about specific events, visit www.interfaceconferencegroup.com/subscribe.\n\nSimply put, if there are no rooftops, roads, parking spaces and utilities, there can be no new retail development. Such is the story in some of Austin\u2019s more remote suburbs, though few doubt that those preliminary requirements for retail growth will eventually be delivered. But there is also the issue of raw supply \u2014 and not just the simple lack of it as a function of demand, but also the misalignment between the types of spaces that are in demand and what leasable product is available in the desired locations.\n\nFor all of these reasons \u2014 combined with the simple fact that pretty much no real estate action in Austin happens quickly \u2014 retail and restaurant operators looking to plant their flags in the state capital must temper their expectations. Setting aside those users who are homegrown or got in early, there are just too many barriers to entry in Austin to actually achieve a fairytale growth story in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a group of retail tenant brokers and owners who spoke at the InterFace Austin Retail & Mixed-Use conference in late February. The LINE Hotel, located in between downtown proper and the historic Rainey Street District, served as the host ground for the event, which drew several hundred attendees in its inaugural showing. Aamil Sarfani, CEO of San Antonio-based consulting firm Sarfani Commercial Advisors, moderated the retail leasing panel.\n\nPanelist John Heffington, partner at the Austin office of retail brokerage firm SHOP Cos., crystalized the notion that for many retailers and restaurateurs, timely expansion in the Austin area is something of a pipe dream. His analysis included the challenges that he faces as an advisor in managing said expectations.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk to tenants that are interested in coming to this market and make plans, they\u2019ll say, \u2018We really want to open three stores at the same time to achieve maximum efficiency,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy response is, \u2018If I can find you three stores in five years, I\u2019ll have done an amazing job as your broker.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about setting expectations with Austin and frankly, the entire MSA,\u201d Heffington continued. \u201cDevelopers want to deliver the product that people will lease, because we have tenants that will pay $55 to $60 per square foot in Pflugerville, Georgetown, Cedar Park or even down in Kyle. But there are so many pieces of land that are locked up at too high a basis or subject to requirements from suburban planning departments that make no sense and don\u2019t pencil [out]. So we\u2019re not getting anywhere right now because although there is so much demand across the board, we don\u2019t have places to put these tenants.\u201d\n\nHeffington also said that it is not uncommon for franchise operators to sign deals for multiple locations in the area without fully grasping the barriers to entry. The franchisors then contact brokers to help with their site selection \u2014 instead of the other way around \u2014 only to learn that scaling an operation to the tune of five new units will more likely take between five to seven years as opposed to one or two.\n\n\u201cDevelopment timelines with franchisors coming into Austin are always interesting conversations to have,\u201d agreed panelist Phil Morris, director of retail at local brokerage firm Commercial Industrial Properties. \u201cThey want your expertise and guidance, but they don\u2019t want to hear that they won\u2019t be able to open however many stores on their timeline, because they\u2019ve sold that [business plan] on a different basis.\u201d\n\nProduct, Location Misalignment\n\nAt another point in the discussion, both Heffington and Morris touched on the mismatch between the type of retail product that suburban municipalities prefer versus the types of spaces that tenants actually want.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle that we see is municipalities wanting and offering developers incentives for mixed-use multifamily environments,\u201d Morris said. \u201cEspecially as you push northward, there are density increases and parking reductions, and it becomes clear that retail is an afterthought.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevelopments have 20-foot bay depths, supports in the middle of spaces, slabs that have been filled in,\u201d Morris continued. \u201cSo they\u2019re just driving up the costs [on tenants] for a space that\u2019s already going to be difficult for them to get into.\u201d\n\nMorris also said that he understands the logic of suburban municipal leaders and developers who want retail uses. He gets that vertical development, as indicated by the aforementioned design features, helps projects pencil out, and that city planners endorse the \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d logic. He stated that regular communication between developers and retail brokers is therefore crucial to avoiding scenarios in which developers and municipalities inadvertently make it more challenging to incorporate retail components \u2014 and to lease those space up with quality tenants.\n\nModerator Sarfani concurred with this conundrum. He observed that \u201ccities want mini-Domains, but it\u2019s just not realistic,\u201d a reference to the sprawling mixed-use development on the city\u2019s north side that locals often refer to as Austin\u2019s \u201csecond downtown.\u201d\n\nThe fact that much of this discussion centered on deals and developments in suburban markets speaks to the tightness of the retail market in Austin\u2019s urban core, as well as the faith in future growth prospects of the \u2019burbs. Still, these areas vary in the degree to which their growth stories are matured. Consequently, some nonlocal users are hesitant to pursue deals in some suburban markets, which can add to competition and barriers to entry in suburban markets that are highly developed. Panelist Andrew Alvarado, vice president at Weitzman, spoke to this dynamic via anecdote.\n\n\u201cWe represent a coffee user that\u2019s expanding into Austin, and we drive the market with them, and when we get to certain areas, they\u2019re confused because it looks like pastureland,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know the growth is coming, but it still takes them some time to wrap their heads around it all.\u201d\n\nHeffington concurred that location and how prospective tenants perceive a suburban market\u2019s fundamentals are top concerns for brokers who represent them.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver for tenants when they enter this market is inventory and where they can get the deals done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tenants that would pay $70 to $80 per square foot in the suburbs if the location was right, but ask them to go two blocks over, and they wouldn\u2019t pay $20 per square foot. So it\u2019s very hard right now to find the deals and trade areas that these tenants want.\u201d\n\nPanelist Graham Hildebrand, director of real estate development for local restaurant chain Torchy\u2019s Tacos, confirmed this market reality by stating that his company is fine with ponying up for the best real estate.\n\n\u201cIf we can find the location with the [co-] tenants that we want, we\u2019re willing to pay a premium price instead of paying a little less for bad space,\u201d he said.",

Palantir and Nvidia stocks surged to unusual gains, near 2000% at Palantir\u2019s peak since 2023, and by more than $3 trillion for Nvidia\u2019s market cap.\n\nValuation concerns also played a role. Companies at the forefront of major trends, such as AI, may experience that their valuations peak at a sales ratio from 31 to 43 times. In June 2024, Nvidia reached a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio ceiling of 42.39, while Palantir\u2019s P/S ratio hit around 100 last month.\n\nDruckenmiller\u2019s turnaround bets\n\nDruckenmiller has been investing in three turnaround stocks:\n\nPhilip Morris International: Druckenmiller purchased 1,352,255 shares last year.

The company\u2019s strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio have been driving the company. For the fourth quarter of 2024, net revenues increased 7.3%, driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing and increased smoke-free product volumes.\n\n\n\nThe company has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, Philip Morris aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.\n\n\n\nHowever, foreign currency fluctuations are impacting earnings, with a projected 22-cent-per-share currency headwind in 2025. Despite regulatory challenges, including increased tobacco restrictions, the company\u2019s strategic cost-saving measures and operational efficiency continue to drive profitability.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+25.5% vs. +19.5%). The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to the growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.\n\n\n\nSolid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are key growth drivers for BKNG. The growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company.\n\n\n\nHowever, sluggishness in its agency business due to the declining trend in agency bookings is a major headwind. Also, geopolitical tensions and market uncertainities remain concerning for the company.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Booking Holdings here >>>)\n\n\n\nAnheuser-Busch\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry over the past year (+7.2% vs. -13%). The company\u2019s pricing actions, continued premiumization, and other revenue-management initiatives have been aiding results. BUD\u2019s premiumization efforts also bode well. It has been focused on premium beer offerings, aligning with consumer preferences in the alcohol industry.\n\n\n\nBUD continues to build a diverse portfolio of global, international, craft and specialty premium brands. The expansion of its Beyond Beer portfolio, and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing bode well.\n\n\n\nBUD\u2019s relentless execution, brand investments and accelerated digital transformation aided sales in fourth-quarter 2024. However, AB InBev has been witnessing higher SG&A costs for a while now. The Zacks analyst expect SG&A costs to rise 1.5% year over year in 2025.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Anheuser-Busch here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+204.3% vs. -7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $488.78 million is expanding its product portfolio with recent FDA approvals, including generic Vyvanse, Methotrexate and Acetaminophen-Codeine tablets.\n\n\n\nElite Pharmaceuticals benefits from in-house manufacturing efficiencies, reducing reliance on third-party suppliers. A shift to direct sales has boosted margins and pricing control, though revenues fell 7.6% in third-quarter fiscal 2025 to $14.4 million from the $15.5 million in the prior-year quarter due to shipment delays and declining licensing fees.\n\n\n\nIndustry tailwinds, including generic drug demand and patent expirations, provide growth opportunities. ELTP faces industry-wide pricing pressures, rising debt and competitive threats. Litigation over its OxyContin generic poses risks while increasing inventory and potential financing needs could impact cash flow and shareholder dilution.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\n\n\n\nNational Research\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (-62.9% vs. +13.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $343.95 million is facing declining contract renewal rates (-4% in 2024) and high client concentration (17% of revenues from top 10 clients) pose risks. Competitive pressures from larger players, regulatory uncertainties and cybersecurity threats further challenge NRC\u2019s performance.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, NRC Health is strengthening its market position through strategic partnerships with major healthcare providers, expanding its client base and enhancing revenue stability. The company is leveraging AI-driven solutions, such as Huey AI, to optimize patient engagement and improve efficiency, differentiating itself in a competitive market.\n\n\n\nRising demand for patient-centered healthcare, driven by value-based care models, further supports NRC\u2019s growth.

            "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller has shifted his investment focus from high-flying AI stocks, like Palantir and Nvidia, to companies with turnaround potential.\n\nConcerns over unsustainable valuations led Druckenmiller to divest from Nvidia and Palantir, which peaked at historical highs.\n\nHis new investment strategy centers on companies undergoing transformation, such as Philip Morris International, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nPhilip Morris is innovating with products like the IQOS system and expanding in emerging markets.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is restructuring to optimize its streaming strategy and financial stability.\n\nTeva is focusing on drug development and financial recovery through strategic cost-cutting and legal resolutions.\n\nDruckenmiller\u2019s approach emphasizes the value of pragmatic investing over following fleeting market trends.\n\nIn the whirlwind of Wall Street\u2019s ever-changing landscape, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, chief of the Duquesne Family Office, seems to have seen enough of the AI hype. Once enamored with artificial intelligence titans like Palantir and Nvidia, Druckenmiller has dramatically shifted course, redefining his investment strategy to capitalize on three turnaround plays that echo with potential yet subdued glamour.\n\nDruckenmiller had amassed a formidable stake in AI trailblazers Palantir Technologies and Nvidia, only to liquidate those positions with startling decisiveness. This move is as intriguing as it is strategic. Palantir\u2019s stock once soared to dizzying heights, with gains approaching an almost mythical status\u2014close to 2,000% at its zenith since early 2023. Meanwhile, Nvidia\u2019s valuation swelled past an astronomical $3 trillion. Such meteoric rises are rare, even in Wall Street\u2019s storied history, making Druckenmiller\u2019s decision to cash out all the more compelling. It suggests an astute, if not prescient, understanding of the cyclical nature of investment fads.\n\nBehind this dramatic exit lie stark valuation concerns. Technology stocks, particularly those riding the wave of the \u2018next big thing\u2019, often peak with unsustainable valuations. Nvidia, for instance, reached a price-to-sales ratio of 42.39, and Palantir hit around 100, both figures defying long-term sustainability. With echoes of past market bubbles fading into memory, Druckenmiller\u2019s choice points to a seasoned investor\u2019s wisdom: locking in profits before the tide turns.\n\nAs Druckenmiller bid adieu to these AI juggernauts, he focused his gaze on companies at the cusp of reinvention and resurgence.\n\nPhilip Morris International stands as a testament to transformation. Once beleaguered by a stagnating share price and a shrinking market for traditional cigarettes, the company embarked on a bold journey toward a smoke-free future. With innovative products like its IQOS heated tobacco system and the rising popularity of oral nicotine pouches like Zyn, Philip Morris has reignited its growth engine, focusing on expanding its market footprint in emerging economies where tobacco remains a high-demand commodity.\n\nThen there\u2019s Warner Bros. Discovery, an emblem of adaptation in a volatile media landscape. Undergoing significant restructuring and aggressive streaming content expansion, the media giant has shifted its focus to stabilize its balance sheet and improve cash flow. With its subscriber base swelling and the impending split into two distinct operational units, the promise of a more profitable future beckons.\n\nFinally, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries represents a narrative of redemption. Having battled legal and financial storms, Teva has emerged with a clearer path thanks to pivotal settlements and rigorous cost-cutting measures. With a renewed focus on innovative drug development, Teva is setting its sights on a healthier, more dynamic future.\n\nThe real takeaway from Druckenmiller\u2019s portfolio metamorphosis isn\u2019t merely about betting against AI; rather, it\u2019s about the embrace of seasoned pragmatism over fleeting euphoria. Wall Street\u2019s constant flux offers few certainties, but the knack for identifying undervalued potential remains invaluable. Druckenmiller\u2019s maneuvers highlight a compelling narrative: the allure of high-flying tech may be tempting, but sometimes, the true value lies in the quiet power of reinvention.\n\nWhy Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s Move Away from AI Stocks Is a Masterclass in Strategic Investing\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of Wall Street, investment strategies must be as dynamic as the industries they target. Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, well-known for his astute market observations, recently pivoted from high-flying AI giants like Palantir and Nvidia to companies poised for transformation. His decision underscores the importance of recognizing when to capitalize on the cyclical nature of investment fads and when to shift focus to new opportunities. Here, we explore the facets of Druckenmiller\u2019s adjusted portfolio and the broader implications for savvy investors.\n\nThe AI Boon and Druckenmiller\u2019s Strategic Exit\n\nWhile many investors remain captivated by AI, Druckenmiller strategically exited positions in Nvidia and Palantir, which had experienced meteoric rises in valuation. His decision stems from concerns about unsustainable valuations, evidenced by Nvidia\u2019s price-to-sales ratio of 42.39 and Palantir\u2019s near 100. The move reflects a seasoned investor\u2019s instinct to bank profits before potential value corrections, a lesson in market timing and pragmatic foresight.\n\nSpotlight on Druckenmiller\u2019s New Investment Choices\n\n1. Philip Morris International: Reinvention in Tobacco\n\nPhilip Morris International is reinventing its business model, not by abandoning tobacco, but by embracing technologies such as the IQOS heated tobacco system, which heats tobacco instead of burning it to reduce harmful chemicals. Their focus on alternatives like oral nicotine pouches and targeting emerging markets underscores a strategy driven by product innovation and geographic diversification.\n\nReal-World Use Case: Investors looking for stock growth may find value in companies that innovate within traditional sectors. As PMI expands its smoke-free products and captures market share in high-demand areas, it offers a potential growth narrative that aligns with global trends toward reduced harm products.\n\n2. Warner Bros. Discovery: Restructuring for Growth\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is undertaking significant restructuring, emphasizing streaming to capture the digital audience. By reorganizing into two distinct operational units and expanding its streaming content, the company aims to stabilize financially and increase profitability.\n\nMarket Forecast: As streaming continues to dominate media consumption, platforms with robust subscriber acquisition strategies are well-placed for growth. Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s approach to segmenting operations could provide a leaner, more focused business model driving future profitability.\n\n3. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries: A Path of Redemption\n\nTeva Pharmaceuticals, once mired in legal and financial difficulties, is now focused on cost-cutting and innovation in drug development. With pivotal legal settlements and renewed focus, it seeks to carve out niches in pharmaceuticals that rival more established companies.\n\nControversies & Limitations: Despite its turnaround potential, Teva faces challenges in overcoming past scandals and maintaining consistent profitability. Investors must weigh these factors against the company\u2019s strides in innovative therapies.\n\nIndustry Trends Supporting Druckenmiller\u2019s Choices\n\n\u2013 Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals: With aging populations and healthcare advancements, pharmaceutical innovation stands at the forefront of investment opportunities.\n\n\u2013 Media and Streaming: As consumer habits shift to on-demand content, companies able to scale streaming solutions will dominate the entertainment sector.\n\n\u2013 Reduced Harm Products: Companies innovating alternatives to traditional tobacco align with health-conscious consumer trends.\n\nActionable Investment Tips\n\n1. Diversification: Look beyond tech hype to diversify investments, balancing high-growth opportunities with value stocks.\n\n2. Trend Analysis: Monitor industry trends such as healthcare innovations and media consumption shifts for emerging investment opportunities.\n\n3. Valuation Vigilance: Regularly assess the valuations of portfolio companies to identify when it\u2019s strategically sound to realize gains.\n\nFor further insights into stock market strategies and innovative companies, visit Bloomberg or Forbes.\n\nIn conclusion, Druckenmiller\u2019s investment shift away from AI and toward transformative industries serves as a reminder that prudent, well-timed decisions often trump trends. Investors should learn to recognize value and potential where others see stagnation or risk.",

            "content": "Tobacco stock investors don't have a lot of choices these days, so if you're looking to invest in one of these classic dividend payers, two of the first stocks that are likely to come up on your radar are Altria (MO 0.02%) and Philip Morris International (PM 0.13%).\n\nThe two stocks have their differences, though they were once the same company before they split in 2007. While both companies own the same set of cigarette brands, led by Marlboro, Altria retained the domestic business, while Philip Morris operates outside the U.S.\n\nLet's take a look at how these two dividend stocks stack up against each other today.\n\nBusiness model: Altria vs. Philip Morris International\n\nYou might assume that as cigarette makers, Altria and Philip Morris have the same business models, but that isn't entirely true.\n\nBoth companies have been focused on diversifying away from cigarettes to next-generation, smoke-free products, but Philip Morris has had significantly more success than Altria. Philip Morris has developed Iqos, its heat-not-burn devices that use tobacco sticks, which have gained significant market share in major markets around the world like Japan, and the company even acquired the rights to sell Iqos in the U.S. from Altria.\n\nPhilip Morris has also found success with Zyn, the oral nicotine pouch brand it gained in its acquisition of Swedish Match. The company is even expanding production of Zyn in order to meet growing demand.\n\nIn 2024, its smoke-free business delivered 14.2% revenue growth, and smoke-free products now make up 40% of revenue, showing the company is moving beyond cigarettes.\n\nMeanwhile, Altria has faced significant setbacks, as its $12 billion investment in Juul was reduced to essentially nothing due to a regulatory crackdown, and its pivot to the cannabis industry with a minority investment in Cronos Group also fell flat.\n\nAltria has now put its faith in Njoy after acquiring the maker of e-cigarettes and vaping products for $2.7 billion in 2023, which has full marketing authorization from the FDA, ensuring Altria won't make the same mistake it did with Juul.\n\nNjoy is delivering solid growth for Altria, with consumable shipment volume up 15.3% to 12.8 million, but smokable products still make up close to 90% of Altria's revenue.\n\nFinancials: Altria vs. Philip Morris\n\nLooking at the financial results head to head, Philip Morris benefits from operating in international markets, where smoking hasn't faced the same degree of regulatory and cultural pushback that it has in the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, Altria reported a decline in revenue of 1.9% to $24 billion, primarily due a 10.2% slide in cigarette shipment volume, which was partially offset by higher prices.\n\nAltria remains highly profitable, with an adjusted operating margin of 61.2%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 3.4% in 2024 to $5.12.\n\nOn the other hand, Philip Morris managed to grow international cigarette volume in 2024, rising 0.6% to 616.8 billion, showing a much different market than in the U.S. Overall revenue rose 7.7% to $37.9 billion, and operating income jumped 16% to $14.9 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, meanwhile, were up 15.6% to $6.95.\n\nDividend and valuation: Altria vs. Philip Morris International\n\nAltria has long had a reputation as a top dividend payer, and that remains true, as it currently offers a dividend yield of 7%. It also has a long history of raising its dividend every year.\n\nLooking at valuation, based on its trailing adjusted earnings per share, Altria trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11.3.\n\nPhilip Morris, on the other hand, has a dividend yield and valuation that reflects its faster growth, as its dividend yield is currently 3.5%, and it has a P/E ratio of 22 based on its adjusted EPS of 6.95.\n\nWith a higher dividend yield and a lower valuation, Altria has the edge here.\n\nWhich is the better buy?\n\nWhile Altria does seem to have finally found a growth vehicle it can count on in Njoy, the company is still losing revenue, and its core cigarette business faces much stiffer headwinds than Philip Morris's does.\n\nPhilip Morris, meanwhile, has found success with next-gen products like Zyn and Iqos, and is growing much faster than its tobacco stock peers, as even its cigarette business is still delivering growth.\n\nPhilip Morris trades at a premium, but for good reason. With its strength in next-gen products, it has a clear path for long-term growth. That means it's worth paying up for.",

            "content": "At my current height and weight, I am overweight. If I gain 10 more pounds, my Body Mass Index (BMI) will reach the big 3-0. That would place me in the obese category. Since the 1990s, life expectancy in the U.S. has fallen behind other developed nations. This decrease in life expectancy is due to increasing rates of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Since 1990, the obesity rate has doubled. This results in about 40% of U.S. adults being obese. By 2050, 65% of adults in the U.S. could be obese.\n\nHow did our food supply change? During the latter part of the 20th century, Philip Morris (Altria) and R.J. Reynolds began to pursue corporate diversification by taking over major portions of the U.S. food industry.\n\nIn 1985, Philip Morris bought General Foods. In 1988, they acquired Kraft Foods, and in 2000, Nabisco. These acquisitions made them the largest food company in the world. R.J. Reynolds merged with Nabisco in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco.\n\nThese companies had developed highly competent laboratories where cigarettes and other tobacco products were engineered to become more consumable. Some scientists have suggested that one outcome of this work made cigarettes more addictive. Experts like Dr. Neil Benowitz have stated that \u201cQuitting nicotine can be just as hard, or harder, than quitting heroin.\u201d\n\nDid they pursue the same focus in the food industry? That question is still top-of-mind because much of the food they produced was considered \u201chyper-palatable.\u201d These foods were processed high in salt, sugar, and fat. The phrase \u201cYou can\u2019t eat just one\u201d became the norm for these highly processed foods.\n\nOther American companies also produced reformulated foods during this period that included those combinations of high fat, sugar, and sodium. So, 35 years ago, we started to grow wider and wider.\n\nIn the late 90\u2019s, the tobacco companies faced huge lawsuit settlements over their tobacco products, and they also began coming under fire for manipulating our food supply. By the early 2000\u2019s, the tobacco companies began to sell or spin off their food divisions. Whatever influence they had had on the processed hyper-palatable food industry remained.\n\nWhat else may have contributed to our transition to obesity? Do you have any idea how many additives are in processed American food? The United States allows over 10,000 additives in our food. Are they lethal? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess, but the FDA authorized and generally recognized them as safe additives. In Europe, however, there are only about 300 safe additives. That is a very challenging statistic.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s food safety approach in the U.S. is reactive. Unless it is proven to be harmful to humans, the FDA allows an additive. In Europe, however, additives must be proven to be safe before they are permitted to be used. For that reason, Europe bans additives like potassium bromate and titanium dioxide. The United States does not ban them. And what happens when you combine numerous additives in a product? Does it impact our microbiome?\n\nClass IV caramel coloring used in the United States, linked to health care concerns like cancer, is banned in Europe. Yellow #6 Dye in our snack foods has produced tumors in animal studies. (Europe uses paprika instead.) Our cola products use high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which has been scrutinized for its potential negative health impacts. In Europe, Cola is typically made with real sugar.\n\nIronically, the drug we take for managing obesity and diabetes costs us approximately $1,500 per month in the U.S. It has been suggested that it be approved for everyone from age 6 up for use here. That would cost trillions of dollars. Even though that drug is made by a Denmark company, Denmark promotes diet and exercise for obesity management instead of their drug. Just sayin\u2019.\n\nThe reason I\u2019ve gained 10 pounds can be corrected by diet and exercise. Just like the Danes.",

In a statement, a spokesperson said Phillip Morris NZ was not selling nicotine pouches in New Zealand, and globally PMI did not use social media influencers for ZYN.\n\nThe products are different from existing nicotine replacement therapy in the form of gum, lozenges or patches that have gone through Medsafe testing.\n\nThat is because the ZYN pouches are being sold as a lifestyle product not a medical device.\n\nIt is hard to avoid the videos of them circulating on Instagram and Tik Tok.\n\nPhoto: Supplied\n\nOne student told Checkpoint the products had been popular at his school for some time.\n\n\"They went around at school and people try them, people like them it's the same as vapes, I guess the like rush of it and the flavour I guess.\"\n\nAlbany Senior High School principal Claire Amos said the vaping craze that went through their school had left her students addicted.\n\n\"They've become reliant on vapes as a way for managing their anxiety and their stress, and they're actually using it to self-medicate.\n\n\"So, when we have caught students, they were feeling anxious, they were feeling this, or they were feeling that and in many cases I get the sense that they don't want to be dependent on vapes.\"\n\nPhoto: Supplied\n\nSenior research fellow of public health at the University of Otago Dr Jude Ball said that was backed by research which showed the negative effects of vaping went further than physical and extended to poor mental health and self-esteem.\n\n\"So, people can feel really judged, and can you know judge themselves when they find themselves addicted.\n\n\"The hit of nicotine releases dopamine in the brain and that's why it feels good, but over time it affects the way that the brain's pleasure centre operates.\n\n\"It can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems like anxiety and depression.\"\n\nIn June there will be a complete ban on disposable vapes and vape retailers will not be able to have displays outside their store, while dairies and service stations will have to keep the devices out of sight like cigarettes.\n\nBoth Jude Ball and Claire Amos welcome those changes but are worried about the oral nicotine pouches on the horizon.\n\n\"That is going to be so easy for our young people to access.\n\n\"I get really concerned that just when we are starting to introduce meaningful policies to reduce vape use in New Zealand, we're about to get something that could prove even worse.\n\n\"There's no evidence that those products are better than what we've already got in terms of helping people quit smoking but there's a lot of evidence that those products are being marketed heavily to young people.\"\n\nUnlike vaping, which produces plumes of scented vapour, people using pouches can do so fairly undetected.\n\nIn a statement, a Phillip Morris International (PMI) spokesperson said: \"Youth should never use nicotine containing products.

            "content": "Source The Motley Fool\n\nData is abundant, if not overwhelming, on Wall Street. Between earnings season -- the six-week period when a majority of S&P 500 companies unveil their quarterly operating results -- and near-daily economic data releases, it can be easy to miss something important.\n\nFor instance, investors might have overlooked one of the most-important days of the entire first quarter: Feb. 14. While Valentine's Day was the focus for most Americans, Feb. 14 marked the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nA 13F provides a concise snapshot that allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's leading money managers have been buying and selling. While Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett tends to be the most-followed fund manager, he's far from the only billionaire investor known to make waves on Wall Street.\n\nDuquesne Family Office's billionaire chief Stanley Druckenmiller oversees more than $3.7 billion in AUM, and his trading activity is also closely monitored by the investing community. Druckenmiller runs an active hedge fund -- the average hold time for all 78 securities is less than seven months -- which tends to seek out short-term price dislocations.\n\nInterestingly enough, Druckenmiller has sent two of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the planet to the chopping block, and has been gobbling up shares of three of Wall Street's most-prolific turnaround stocks.\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has dumped shares of Palantir and Nvidia\n\nPerhaps the biggest eyebrow-raising move from Duquesne Family Office's billionaire investor is his dumping of shares of AI giants Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Since March 31, 2024, Druckenmiller sold 95% of his fund's stake in Palantir.\n\nMeanwhile, all 9,500,750 split-adjusted shares of Nvidia that Duquesne held, as of June 30, 2023, were gone 12 months later. Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 forward split in June 2024, thus the need to adjust the share count.\n\nAlthough both businesses possess well-defined competitive advantages, there are obvious reasons for Druckenmiller to have cashed in his fund's chips.\n\nFor starters, the gains for Palantir and Nvidia have been eye-popping. Palantir stock galloped higher by close to 2,000% (at its peak) from the start of 2023, while Nvidia's market cap surged by north of $3 trillion. These are highly uncommon gains and Duquesne's chief saw it as an opportunity to ring the register.\n\nValuation concerns likely also crept into the picture. Historically, companies on the cutting edge of a next-big-thing trend, such as AI, have seen their valuations peak at a range of 31 to 43 times sales. Nvidia stock hit its ceiling at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42.39 in June 2024, while Palantir's P/S ratio surged to around 100 last month. Based solely on what history tells us, neither figure is sustainable over the long run.\n\nThere's also the very real concern that history will repeat and the artificial intelligence bubble will burst. Every next-big-thing investment trend for more than three decades has been overhyped by investors well before it's had a chance to mature and gain widespread adoption. If the AI bubble were to burst, its most-direct beneficiaries, such as Nvidia and Palantir, would probably be among the hardest-hit stocks.\n\nLong story short, the risk-versus-reward scenario strongly favored locking in gains.\n\nDuquesne's Druckenmiller bets big on a trio of turnaround stocks\n\nBut just because billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has been a seller of two widely owned AI stocks, it doesn't mean he hasn't been putting his fund's capital to work elsewhere. Based on Duquesne Family Office's 13F filings, he's been piling into three turnaround stocks over the last year.\n\nPhilip Morris International\n\nNot including dividends, tobacco stock Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) had been a buzzkill for the better part of a decade. From the start of 2014 through the end of 2023, its shares rose by less than 8%. But this didn't stop Druckenmiller from purchasing 1,352,255 shares of Philip Morris stock last year.\n\nTraditionally, the biggest competitive advantage tobacco companies possess is the addictive nature of nicotine, which is found in tobacco. Even with cigarette shipments declining in most developed markets, Philip Morris has been able to offset these declines by increasing its prices.\n\nTo add to this point, Philip Morris International has an operating presence in more than 180 countries. If cigarette shipments fall off in some of its developed markets, there's a good chance burgeoning middle classes in emerging markets, where tobacco remains a luxury, will help pick up the slack. In other words, geographic diversity is a big help to the company's top-and-bottom line.\n\nBut what's propelled Philip Morris's escape from a decade of underperformance is its smoke-free products. Its oral nicotine pouches (Zyn) and heated tobacco system (IQOS) are delivering sustained double-digit increases in sales and reaccelerating its earnings growth rate. The long-awaited transformation of the traditional tobacco industry has arrived, and Stanley Druckenmiller is here for it.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery\n\nA second turnaround stock that Duquesne's head honcho has been piling into is legacy media operator Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD). In 2024, Druckenmiller oversaw the purchase of 4,657,650 shares of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nLike most legacy media companies, Warner Bros. is spending aggressively to build out its streaming content; and the results have been mostly promising. Global direct-to-consumer subscribers grew by more than 19 million last year to 116.9 million, while average revenue per user hovered in the mid-to-high $7 range. Thankfully, Warner Bros. Discovery possesses strong subscription pricing power, which should play a key role in boosting future profits from this segment.\n\nThere's also been a clear improvement in the company's balance sheet. Following AT&T's spin-out of Warner Bros. and its subsequent merger with Discovery in April 2022, the newly formed company had quite a bit of net debt. But with management focused on free cash flow generation and improving its financial flexibility, Warner Bros. Discovery's net debt fell to $34.2 billion, as of Dec. 31, 2024, from $45.3 billion at the end of 2022.\n\nLastly, the company expects to restructure into two separate divisions -- Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios -- by the midpoint of this year. This type of restructuring can lead to better earnings visibility, and it may signal the possibility of future dealmaking.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries\n\nThe third turnaround stock that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller has been absolutely piling into is generic- and brand-name drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA). In 2024, Duquesne picked up 8,997,400 shares of Teva, which makes it Druckenmiller's fourth-largest holding.\n\nFor the better part of seven years (2015-2022), Teva was a perfect example of Murphy's Law in action. It overpaid for generic-drugmaker Actavis, which ballooned its outstanding debt, and was the target of a seemingly endless barrage of litigation, which ranged from its role in the opioid crisis to its pricing of generic drugs.\n\nTeva's breakthrough came in July 2022 when it settled opioid litigation with 48 states. While the $4.25 billion settlement figure is a big number, it's being paid out over 13 years and isn't entirely a cash component. Up to $1.2 billion of this amount can be comprised of Narcan deliveries to states. Narcan is the drug used to counteract opioid overdoses.\n\nTeva's management team also made it a point to improve the company's financial flexibility by addressing its debt. Former turnaround specialist CEO Kare Schultz, and current CEO Richard Francis, have collectively worked to sell non-core assets, reduce operating expenses, and boost margins. The end result is a reduction in net debt from north of $35 billion following the Actavis acquisition to less than $14.5 billion, as of the end of 2024.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle for Teva was shifting more of its focus and capital expenditures toward higher-margin novel-drug development. With Teva's sales once again climbing, the future appears bright for Duquesne's fourth-largest position.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Phil Murphy tour site of I-80 sinkhole in Wharton\n\nWHARTON, New Jersey (WABC) -- U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy spent time on Saturday in New Jersey touring the site of a new sinkhole that opened up on I-80 in Morris County this week.\n\nSecretary Duffy joined Gov. Phil Murphy and Congressman Thomas Kean Jr. in Wharton as crews continue to repair the sinkhole that has snarled traffic in recent days.\n\nNewsCopter 7 was over the scene after the sinkhole opened up near Exit 34. The NJ Department of Transportation says that during a drilling operation, a 15-foot by 15-foot hole opened up in the median.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, the state agency closed and detoured all lanes on I-80 westbound at Exit 34B/Route 15 northbound until further notice.\n\nThe site is close to another sinkhole already under repair that opened up and impacted traffic on the eastbound lanes of I-80 in February. A 40-foot by 40-foot sinkhole, which officials said was located just 75 feet away from the February one, opened up in December.\n\nOfficials said that there is currently no immediate danger to people who live near the sinkholes.\n\n\"This has been a nasty situation now for the past couple of months and it's only gotten worse,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe issue lies underground, as officials say abandoned mineshafts underneath I-80 are collapsing and creating the craters in the road.\n\nDuring his Saturday tour, the transportation secretary emphasized the importance of a coordinated local, state and federal response in repairing the roadway impacted by the sinkhole.\n\n\"This is a massive artery that can't be shut down, and so everyone is working together to figure out what solution we need to make sure we can open up this roadway again,\" Duffy said.\n\nMurphy says the goal is to reopen the westbound lanes of I-80 within the week, but work on the eastbound side will continue for another 6-8 weeks.\n\nStarting Monday, NJ Transit will offer a 50% discount on roundtrip travel for those impacted by the ongoing repair work.\n\nJanice Yu reports from Morris County, New Jersey, with more on the road repairs underway.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More Manhattan news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

It's only gotten worse,\" said Murphy.\n\nSubject to testing, two westbound lanes could be open within a week, while on the eastbound side, the timeline is expected to be 6-8 weeks.\n\n\"It's a massive artery that can't be shut down, so everyone is working together to figure out what solution we need to make sure we can open up this roadway again,\" said Duffy.\n\nThe governor said they are bringing experts in from Pennsylvania and Colorado. For them, safety is paramount for people driving on the roads and workers on the site.\n\n\"As the situation evolves, we're all assessing where we're at and what is the best response,\" said Duffy.\n\nMurphy said relief to the business owners is still to be determined and Rep. Kean said they will work with the Small Business Administration to see how they can help.\n\n\"We see what happens, I live 30 minutes from here, when this shuts down, communities are shutting down, businesses are having incredible difficulty,\" said Duffy.\n\nMurphy said they feel good about structures around the sinkhole after testing.\n\nAs work continues on I-80, New Jersey Transit will begin offering 50% off round trip travel from select stations on the Morris Essex train line to alleviate some pressure from the roadway. That will begin Monday, according to Murphy. He added the discount will continue while repairs are made to the road.\n\nThe mayor of Wharton and the governor suggested working from home if you are able to over the next 6-8 weeks.",

Everything we know 5-minute read\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Route 80 sinkhole in Wharton NJ timeline: Video After a second sinkhole caused closures on Rt. 80 in Wharton, NJDOT investigators identified 90 possible instabilities or \"voids\" under the road.\n\nAs sinkholes continue to open up Route 80 and now Route 287, getting around North Jersey, and in particular Morris County, is becoming more challenging each day.\n\nOn Route 80, the voids on both the westbound and eastbound sides of the highway were created by abandoned mines \u2015 many of which dot the landscape in Wharton, Dover and the aptly-named Mine Hill.\n\nOn 287, where a sinkhole opened on March 21, the cause has yet to be determined.\n\nWhat's for sure is the problems are likely to continue for weeks, if not months, as engineers and construction crews work around the clock to fill the voids and repair the roads.\n\n\"This is getting ridiculous and it's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or dies as a result of one of these sink holes,\" state Assemblyman Brian Bergen told NorthJersey.com. \"We need swift action by the DOT to fix these issues. Going forward, NJ should spend less money on wackadoodle liberal initiatives and more money on shoring up our vital infrastructure.\"\n\nPlease continue reading the story below the gallery\n\nHere's a look at what we know and how we got here:\n\nDetours and road closures\n\nThe location of the sinkholes could not be much worse.\n\nThe voids on Route 80 are located near the junction of Route 15 (there is also a massive bridge repair on Route 15 south underway in Jefferson). The one on Route 287 sits between Routes 80 and 46, just south of the Boonton Reservoir. The two sinkhole sites are less than 20 miles from one another by vehicle, less as the crow flies.\n\nAll the roads are heavily trafficked, used by commuters, truckers, buses and residents just moving around North Jersey.\n\nNow, all that traffic is being funneled through the downtowns and side streets of Boonton, Denville, Wharton, Dover, Randolph, Parsippany and other highway towns. Already, local business owners are taking a hit as the traffic-clogged main streets choke out shoppers. And residents in normally quiet neighborhoods are being subjected to the rumble and stumble of vehicles navigating detours 24 hours a day.\n\nMore: What do apps like Waze and Google Maps recommend for avoiding Route 80 sinkhole traffic?\n\nPlease continue reading the story below the gallery\n\nMines, voids and sinkholes\n\nNJDOT is aware the sinkholes are likely caused by a failing network of mineral mines that once fueled the economy of the region, but were mostly closed and abandoned long before highway construction began in the 1960s.\n\nThe underbelly of Morris County and its roads are filled with more than 100 abandoned underground mines, most located in the northwestern half of the county, according to a 2020 geographical report of Morris County.\n\nSinkhole \u2018Whack-a-Mole?\u2019\n\nThe latest sinkhole to shut down all eastbound lanes of Route 80 in Morris County apparently has plenty of company.\n\nAs repairs continue at the site, testing conducted by the New Jersey Department of Transportation has \"identified 90 locations to be assessed and mitigate potential instability or possible voids.\"\n\n\"Our investigation identified additional subsurface movement, leading to proactive drilling and grouting operations to stabilize the roadway,\" NJDOT spokesperson Steve Schapiro said.\n\nMore: There might be 90 voids under Route 80\n\nWhat causes sinkholes?\n\nTimothy Bechtel, the director of science outreach and a senior professor of geosciences at Franklin & Marshall College, said sinkholes like the gaping cavity that opened this week in an Interstate 80 work zone are \u201cusually related\u201d to precipitation or in more developed areas, leaking underground pipes.\n\nEvery sinkhole starts, Bechtel said, with a manmade void or a natural cave. In this case, the state Department of Transportation has already identified 90 locations along the interstate that need to be assessed due to potential instability and the presence of abandoned mine shafts.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWhat is a sinkhole? An expert talks about the impact on Interstate 80 What is a sinkhole? We asked an expert as the Wharton section of Interstate 80 is feeling the impact of sinkholes in New Jersey on March 20, 2025.\n\nHow did we get here? A timeline\n\nContrary to what it may feel like to North Jersey commuters, the most recent sinkhole issues impacting a stretch of Route 80 in Morris County has only been going on for just over a month.\n\nBut the problems in the area, which include another hole in the roadway spotted in late December, can be traced back to mining activity more than two centuries ago.\n\nClick here for a timeline on how we sunk so far.\n\nOnly in Jersey: Sinkhole ice cream\n\nWhile many are frustrated with detours and traffic caused by the sinkhole on Route 80 in Wharton, one local ice cream shop found a way to sweeten the situation.\n\nDas' Creamery in Budd Lake has created a \"Sinkhole Sundae.\"\n\nSinkholes and mines\n\nCan't get enough of the sinkhole story?

Phil Murphy is urging commuters affected by a series of sinkholes that closed portions of Interstate 80 to \u201cplease work from home\u201d as road crews assess and repair the damage \u2014 a process that could take six to eight weeks.\n\nWestbound lanes of the highway, closed after the most recent sinkhole, could reopen within a week, Murphy said. But repairs to the eastbound side may take up to two months.\n\n\u201cSubject to testing, the hope is two lanes can be opened within a week on the westbound side,\u201d Murphy told reporters during a tour of the site in Morris County along with U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and U.S. Rep. Tom Kean.\n\nThere is no immediate safety threat, Murphy said.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t let folks drive on them if they weren\u2019t safe,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy had other good news for commuters. A sinkhole that opened on a shoulder of I-287 Friday was a pipe issue and it will be fixed in time for Monday\u2019s commute, he said.\n\nMurphy, Duffy, Kean and State Transportation Commissioner Francis O\u2019Connor toured the site of the most recent sinkhole which closed the westbound lanes of the highway on March 19.\n\nDuffy committed to doing \u201call we can\u201d to get the highway reopened, recognizing the importance of I-80 as the states largest east-west interstate highway.\n\n\u201cI live 30 minutes away when this shuts down, communities shutdown, Duffy said \u201cwe want to make it safe to travel.\n\nMurphy said mine experts from other states including Pennsylvania are being called in to help. USDOT has brought in national experts in geotechnical engineering to help NJDOT identify the problem and safely reopen this road, Duffy said.\n\nIn the meantime, New Jersey Transit will be offering discounts to commuters on the Morris and Essex rail lines from five M&E stations. Riders using the Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Netcong, Lake Hopatcong, and Mount Arlington will not need to purchase a fare when boarding.\n\nFor the return trip, customers will only need to purchase a one-way ticket back to one of these five stations, which provides a full 50% discount on roundtrip travel.\n\nThat delivers on a suggestion by Kean that NJ Transit offer area residents some temporary incentives to use transit as an alternative to using I-80.\n\nThree sinkholes in less than two months prompted officials to close the westbound lanes of I-80 this week after shutting the eastbound lanes back in February, when a second sinkhole opened in the center lane.\n\nThe detours resulted in traffic nightmares in several Morris County towns on Routes 46 and 10 and business owners complained of a downturn due to the added vehicles.\n\nMurphy name checked a Bill proposed by Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, R-Morris that would suspend sale tax collection from businesses affected by construction work and Kean hinted that some Small Business Administration aid might be available for businesses in Wharton affected by detouring traffic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re open minded to all of the above, Murphy said.\n\nAuthorities with the state have attributed all three sinkholes to collapsing mineshafts underneath the roadway. Roughly 588 abandoned mines lurk beneath the surface in nine northern New Jersey counties, including in Wharton. (Another nearby sinkhole opened up Friday on I-287 in Morris County, as well, but was not mine related.)\n\nWhen asked if the drilling and grouting work DOT has been doing on the highway has exacerbated the problems Assistant DOT commissioner Chris Feinthel said \u201cwe\u2019re not making things worse. It\u2019s the mines that are the villain\u2026.. which keeps moving.\u201d\n\nMining experts from Colorado and Pennsylvania, which Murphy said have more mines than New Jersey, will assist the DOT.\n\nAfter the second sinkhole developed, the DOT announced a plan to build a crossover for truck traffic as a way to temporarily keep it off of local roadway detours while larger repair work was ongoing. At the time, it estimated the eastbound lanes of the highway would be closed for at least two months.\n\nDuffy praised the efforts of NJDOT for their quick response to the sinkholes and said he\u2019s talked to Murphy and Kean weekly about the states needs.\n\nThis is Duffy\u2019s first official visit to New Jersey since being confirmed as Transportation Secretary, although he lives in Mendham.\n\n\u201cWhen this shuts down, communities shutdown,\u201d Duffy said of the interstate. \u201cWe want to make it safe to travel.\u201d\n\nHis visit also comes three weeks after Murphy signed a state of emergency declaration for the sinkhole area, making it eligible for federal funds and assistance.\n\nThe declaration also allowed the state to apply for federal funding, which may be provided by the Federal Highway Administration if a road has sustained serious damage due to a natural disaster or another external cause. The federal funding application is currently with FHWA, state officials said.\n\nDuffy committed to providing federal funds for repairs but did not specify a figure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do all we can to get the resources,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWe\u2019re providing technical assistance. At a later point we\u2019ll talk about money. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Echoing\n\nMurphy said costs for the shutdown are more than $150,000 a day.\n\nDuffy said he would ask Kean Jr, who was on site, for legislation to cover costs that USDOT couldn\u2019t allocate directly to the State.\n\nMurphy also reassured residents of the nearby Avalon apartments, located next I-80 east and a former mine that the bui8lding is sound after several independent studies.\n\nThe collaboration between the State and Federal agencies is paramount for reopening this vital roadway as quickly and safely as possible,\u201c said State Senate Minority Leader Anthony Bucco.

Since the start of the Israeli offensive on 7 October 2023, the death toll in Gaza has risen to 49,747, with over 113,000 people injured.\n\nDespite the ongoing Israeli airstrikes, which resumed on Tuesday, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) confirmed that communications with mediators were still ongoing to reach a ceasefire agreement. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua emphasized that the movement remains open to any consensus-based arrangements for governing Gaza, rejecting claims from US envoy for Middle East Steve Witkoff that Hamas was insistent on retaining power.\n\nOn the other hand, the Fatah movement, led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, urged Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, arguing that doing so was essential to preserve the \u201cPalestinian presence\u201d in the region. Fatah spokesperson Munther Al-Hayek warned of difficult and painful days ahead for Gaza\u2019s residents if Hamas continued its governance of the territory.\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli military\u2019s destruction of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, calling it a \u201cwar crime and a crime against humanity\u201d that must be prosecuted under international law. The ministry accused Israel of targeting hospitals and medical personnel as part of its broader policy of displacement and extermination against the Palestinian people while criticizing the international community for its silence and inaction.\n\nIn diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation, the foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement calling for the immediate restoration of a ceasefire. They condemned the resumption of Israeli airstrikes as a \u201ctragic step backward,\u201d urging for an immediate return to the ceasefire to prevent further civilian casualties.\n\nIn a separate development, the Ansar Allah Movement (Houthis) in Yemen claimed responsibility for targeting Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv with a hypersonic ballistic missile. The group asserted that the missile had successfully hit its target and warned airlines that the airport had become \u201cunsafe for air navigation\u201d until the Israeli aggression against Gaza ceases and the blockade is lifted.",

            "content": "When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 17x, you may consider Philip Morris International Inc. ( ) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 33.7x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nPhilip Morris International could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Philip Morris International's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 9.8% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 22% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 22% per annum as estimated by the twelve analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 11% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Philip Morris International is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Philip Morris International's P/E\n\nTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nWe've established that Philip Morris International maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nYou always need to take note of risks, for example - we think you should be aware of.\n\nYou might be able to find a better investment than Philip Morris International.

            "content": "Manufacturer: Electric powered superyachts drawing significant interest across US In one particular stump soliloquy, then-candidate Trump mused about having to choose between being electrocuted or eaten by a shark if he were on a sinking electric boat.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Bird's eye view of the Palm Beach International Boat Show mega yachts The Palm Beach International Boat Show will feature 45 yachts measuring 150 feet or longer and 200 super yachts surpassing 80 feet in length\n\nAlex Reisch, a retired Philip Morris International executive, is displaying his 60-foot solar-powered superyacht at the 2025 Palm Beach International Boat Show.\n\nSunreef Yachts, the manufacturer of the catamaran, has observed a significant increase in demand for electric or hybrid boats, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe rising popularity of electric yachts is attributed to environmental concerns, family-friendly features, and a quieter, more relaxing sailing experience.\n\nWEST PALM BEACH \u2014 The irony was impossible to overlook as Alex Reisch gleefully showed off his solar-powered superyacht moored just a few nautical miles from the home of the U.S. president who just a year ago ridiculed electric boats in one campaign rally after another.\n\nReisch, a retired Philip Morris International executive, this week is displaying his 60-foot Sunreef Power Eco ultra-luxe catamaran at the 2025 Palm Beach International Boat Show. It's a promotional appearance hosted by Sunreef Yachts, a company with shipyards in Poland and the Arab Emirates.\n\nBecause Sunreef's yachts are custom-made, the company showboats the vessels it has built for owners at events from Cannes to Monaco to South Florida. The manufacturer has moved into the superyacht class in recent years, and marketing spokesman Artur Po\u0142ocza\u0144ski said the migration to Palm Beach County of one-percenters was exposure too good to pass up.\n\n\"That's why Palm Beach is important to us as we're slowly shifting toward the super yacht end of the industry,\" he said.\n\nA catamaran with the coziness of a luxury chalet in the Alps\n\nReisch was only too happy to guide visitors, prospective buyers and the just curious through the various decks of the tailored catamaran, called \"Double Happiness,\" on a sun-splashed morning just after the boat show's gates opened to patrons on Thursday, March 20. The boat show opened Wednesday and continues through Sunday.\n\nReisch beamed at the two, 120-kilowatt electric engines and the 330-kilowatt main battery pack he said is equal to those of six Teslas. He singled out the array of solar panels that are built into the yacht's sides so they are indistinguishable unless pointed out.\n\nReisch, an Austrian, and his wife, who is from Switzerland, spent three days with a team from Sunreef explaining they wanted a sleek, alpine chalet-type look to the interior design.\n\nPrevious story: While promoting luxury yachts, Lech Walesa talks global politics, capitalism, Trump\n\n\"Everything was chosen,\" he said.\n\nThe couple selected two different types of teak wood flooring and ordered different AC units in the vessel. They also got all the comforts of a luxury getaway in the Alps \u2014 a washer and dryer, a kitchen with a range plus a freezer and refrigerator, dishwasher, a grill on the top deck, a 45-bottle wine cellar and a cocktail bar. The sound system is segmented, too, allowing for TV watching in the living room, playing rap on the lounge deck and classical music in the staterooms, Reisch said.\n\nThe yacht was built in Gdansk, Poland, in shipyards made famous by the 1980s anti-communist Solidarity labor movement led by Lech Walesa. Walesa has done promotional appearances for Sunreef, saying in a 2020 interview with The Palm Beach Post that in a post-Cold War world, he learned the value of helping private enterprises succeed.\n\n\u201cWe had to start from scratch. We had to look for job opportunities and look for markets,\u201d Walesa said recalling the scramble for markets and sales to sustain employment after the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union imploded. And he added this prescient observation.\n\n\"I\u2019ve said this a million times,\" Walesa offered. \"Either the U.S. wants to lead, or they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRemember when Trump talked about choosing between electrocution or facing a shark on a sinking electric boat?\n\n2025 Palm Beach International Boat Show: Mega-yachts descend on West Palm Beach waterfront\n\nNot-so-subtle reminders of Palm Beach County's changing political hue were spotted here and there at the show along Flagler Street and the waterfront marinas in the West Palm Beach downtown.\n\nOne yacht moored not far from Reisch's was named \"Second Amendment\" with two machine guns crossed. A merch stand in a market area stocked \"Gulf of America: No Woke Zone\" caps.\n\nReisch recalled cruising by President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club and residence and said it looked grand.\n\nTrump, however, made clear on the campaign trail that he was no fan of the kind of transportation Reisch has invested seven figures in.\n\nTrump mocked people who bought electric cars saying they would have to recharge every few miles. He heaped scorn on what he said were plans to use electric engines in everything from long-haul trucks to military tanks on the battlefield.\n\nIn one particular stump soliloquy, he mused about having to choose between being electrocuted or eaten by a shark if he were on a sinking electric boat.\n\nElectric superyacht a money saver, owner says, and quiet relaxation\n\nReisch suggested skeptics just go for a ride.\n\n\"Once you charter an electric, you will never go back,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to saving thousands of dollars on fuel per trip, the big-ticket maintenance costs, so often rued by boat owners, are practically nil. The only major mechanical overhaul \u2014 at 50,000 hours \u2014 involves changing out the engines' eight bearings. The components, which are critical to power transmission and shaft alignment, run $100 apiece.\n\n\"I said to myself, 'That sounds really reasonable,'\" Reisch said. \"It's not just good for the environment. It's good for your wallet.\"\n\nAs for distance, Reisch's captain, Josh Hillary, said since the family took possession of the catamaran last June, they have sailed across the western Mediterranean with stops in Sardinia, Spain, France and Portugal. They also toured the Caribbean.\n\n\"We've gone pretty far,\" he said. \"And with a lot of ease.\"\n\nPo\u0142ocza\u0144ski shrugged off the president's critique, noting that 50% of the demand for Sunreef boats is now for either pure electric or some form of hybrid.\n\n\"Yeah, well, OK, but he is teaming up with a producer of electric cars, so ...,\" he said of Trump, who has assigned Tesla chief Elon Musk to slash the federal budget.\n\nTrump and his administration seem to have had a change of heart, for that matter.\n\nOn March 11, Trump held a photo-op with Musk and several Tesla electric vehicles outside the White House to bolster the automaker amid a stock collapse and reports of plummeting sales. On Wednesday, March 19 Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, encouraged Americas to buy Tesla shares.\n\nGreen, quiet \u2014 and appealing to people in the United States?\n\nPo\u0142ocza\u0144ski pointed out another favorable feature, the silence on the high seas from quiet engines. He related how one Sunreef customer, Formula I race car driver, Fernando Alonso, said he enjoyed the sound and smells of a gas-powered, high-performance motor while on the track when racing, but not while vacationing.\n\n\"This is something that completely changes your point of view,\" Po\u0142ocza\u0144ski said. \"Because when you want to relax the last thing you want to hear is the noise of the engine, the generators, the fumes, the vibrations that come from the engine. You don't want all that.\"\n\nMore telling, Po\u0142ocza\u0144ski said, is the burgeoning market for Sunreef's electric catamarans, especially in the United States.\n\nThe manufacturer's director of U.S. sales, Liza Kharoubi-Echenique, said she is seeing a surge in buyers from the 35-to-50 age group. She said the growing attention is not just owing to concern about the environment but also the family-friendly roominess of the catamaran, which is steadier on the high seas.\n\nAnd that interest includes people in locales in red Florida.\n\n\"I am seeing more and more demand across the United States,\" she said. \"And in Miami.\"\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

As part of its sustainability strategy, the company has implemented several initiatives tailored to the specific region where it operates, aimed at conserving water and promoting the responsible use of this essential resource. Since 2017, Philip Morris International (PMI) has invested over 730 million dollars in the modernization and upgrading of its Philip Morris Romania factory in Otopeni. A part of these investments has been directed toward sustainability measures, including the protection of water resources.\n\nWater is one of the most important resources in the production of tobacco products, and as such, Philip Morris Romania is dedicated to protecting local water resources, ensuring the continuity of operations, and conserving the Arge\u0219-Vedea-Pite\u0219ti hydrographic basin. The main initiatives implemented at the Otopeni factory and in the surrounding area include: preventing pollution and contamination through water quality monitoring, wastewater treatment, reducing water consumption through efficient technologies, recycling wastewater, detecting and preventing leaks, and educating employees, suppliers, and communities about the importance of water conservation and pollution prevention.\n\nRegarding wastewater treatment, PMI\u2019s investments at the Otopeni factory have resulted in the launch of a technological wastewater treatment plant (with a treatment capacity of 800 m\u00b3/day) in 2019. In 2021, the existing domestic wastewater treatment plant (with a treatment capacity of 200 m\u00b3/day) was upgraded. Both plants discharge treated water with parameters that meet surface water discharge standards (NTPA 001).\n\n\u201cAt Philip Morris Romania, we recognize the importance of water as a vital resource for our planet and future generations. Our commitment to water conservation is reflected in our continuous efforts to implement sustainable practices and engage with the communities where we operate. By integrating sustainable water management practices into our sustainability strategy, we aim to reduce water consumption, minimize pollution, protect freshwater ecosystems, and mitigate water-related risks. Through stakeholder engagement, promoting innovation and technological development, and prioritizing education and collaboration in the water sector to address common challenges, we aim to contribute to the well-being of local water resources for current and future generations,\u201d said Kurnia Adhi Sulistyawan, Manufacturing Director, Philip Morris Romania. Read more about Philip Morris Romania recognized as Top Employer for the eleventh consecutive year\n\nAnother important initiative for Philip Morris Romania is its collaboration with various stakeholders (including local authorities, service providers, and other institutions) to address water-related challenges and support sustainability plans in the Arge\u0219-Vedea-Pite\u0219ti hydrographic basin. Since 2016, the company has been carrying out reforestation projects, minimizing habitat destruction, collecting waste, improving aesthetic value, and supporting biodiversity conservation initiatives in partnership with NGOs and local authorities. As part of these efforts, volunteers from the company\u2019s staff have planted over 65,000 saplings in the counties of Ialomi\u021ba, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i, Prahova, and D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba, and have collected over 20 tons of waste.",

It has amassed assets over $1.11 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.\n\nWhy Large Cap Blend\n\nCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.\n\nTypically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.\n\nCosts\n\nSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.\n\nAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.\n\nIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.38%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nThis ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 17.80% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Information Technology round out the top three.\n\nLooking at individual holdings, Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD) accounts for about 1.25% of total assets, followed by Cvs Health Corp (CVS) and Philip Morris International Inc (PM).\n\nThe top 10 holdings account for about 12.02% of total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nEQWL seeks to match the performance of the Russell Top 200 Equal Weight Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 100 Equal Weight Index is designed to provide equal-weighted exposure to the securities of the largest 200 companies in the US equity market.\n\nThe ETF return is roughly 1.61% so far this year and it's up approximately 12.29% in the last one year (as of 03/21/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $90.17 and $108.28.\n\nThe ETF has a beta of 0.96 and standard deviation of 15.09% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 103 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\n\nAlternatives\n\nInvesco S&P 100 Equal Weight ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, EQWL is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.",

            "content": "Over the past decade, Romania has experienced a notable increase in entrepreneurial activity. According to the \u201cProfil de Antreprenor 2024\u201d report, the number of new businesses in Romania grew by 58% between 2009 and 2023. This surge is not confined to urban areas; while major cities like Bucharest, Cluj, Timi\u0219oara, and Ia\u0219i continue to be entrepreneurial hubs, rural regions have also seen significant growth. In the early 1990s, only a small percentage of businesses were located in rural areas, but today, 32% of them are established there.\n\nBy Sorina Faier\n\nThe Romanian government has implemented various programs to support entrepreneurs. Initiatives such as financial assistance, training programs, and grants have been introduced to encourage business development. For instance, the \u201cFemeia Antreprenor\u201d program offers up to 200,000 lei in non-reimbursable funds to support female entrepreneurs. Additionally, the government has focused on enhancing the sustainability and innovation within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, as highlighted in the study \u201cSustenabilitate \u0219i inovare \u00een ecosistemul antreprenorial din Rom\u00e2nia.\u201d\n\nGlobally, certain countries are renowned for their robust support systems for employees transitioning into entrepreneurship. Nations like the United States, Canada, and Singapore offer favorable conditions, including access to funding, mentorship programs, and a culture that encourages innovation and risk-taking. These environments provide aspiring entrepreneurs with the resources and support necessary to launch and sustain successful ventures.\n\nDeciding when to transition from employee to entrepreneur is a personal decision that depends on various factors. Key considerations include having a viable business idea, financial readiness, market research, and a solid business plan. It\u2019s also crucial to assess one\u2019s risk tolerance and ensure a support system is in place. Embarking on entrepreneurship requires careful planning and a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nEssential skills for successful entrepreneurship encompass strategic thinking, financial literacy, leadership, resilience, and adaptability. Effective communication and networking abilities are also vital, as they enable entrepreneurs to build relationships, attract customers, and navigate the complexities of running a business. Continuous learning and the ability to pivot in response to market changes further enhance an entrepreneur\u2019s chances of success.\n\nThe success rate of new businesses varies widely across industries and regions. While specific statistics for Romania are limited, globally, it\u2019s observed that approximately 20% of new businesses fail within the first year, and about 50% within five years. However, these figures can fluctuate based on factors such as industry sector, economic conditions, and the entrepreneur\u2019s experience and resources.\n\nRegarding entrepreneurs returning to employment, data indicates that a significant number do so after facing challenges in sustaining their businesses. The transition back to employment can be influenced by various factors, including financial stability, market dynamics, and personal circumstances. While exact numbers are difficult to ascertain, it\u2019s common for entrepreneurs to re-enter the workforce, bringing with them valuable skills and experiences that can benefit future employers.\n\nRomania\u2019s entrepreneurial landscape has evolved considerably over the past decade, with increased support from the government and a growing acceptance of entrepreneurship as a viable career path. Aspiring entrepreneurs should carefully assess their readiness, develop essential skills, and be prepared for the challenges ahead to increase their chances of success.",

After deliberations, the committee agreed to modify the prices, increasing the cost of various locally produced brands\u2014excluding luxury brands\u2014as well as an anticipated rise in the price of \u201cMu\u2019assel\u201d (shisha tobacco).\n\nThe official list of new prices is scheduled to be published in the Official Gazette on April 1st. Generally, the prices of manufactured tobacco are adjusted once a year, except in exceptional cases related to tax changes, such as the one that occurred last January.\n\nThese increases are part of the gradual tax schedule imposed on tobacco, which was introduced under the Finance Law of 2022. The law aims to progressively adjust the Domestic Consumption Tax (TIC) on tobacco products until 2026.\n\nSource: Fes News Media",

            "content": "Chocolate Saga, the only Romanian festival for local craft chocolate producers, has kicked off at Sala Palatului with over 50 producers showcasing their products.\n\n\u201cThe demand for artisanal chocolate is growing, and consumers increasingly appreciate the quality of ingredients and the originality of recipes. The expansion of these brands represents an important step for the development of the local market,\u201d stated Adina Istrate, organizer of Chocolate Saga.\n\nIn 2024, the Romanian chocolate market was estimated at approximately 600 million euros, with an average consumption of about 5 kg of chocolate per capita. Local production was approximately 5,000 tons, worth between 50 and 60 million euros, which covers less than 10% of the country\u2019s annual needs, which is why Romania is in the top 3 importers of chocolate at European level.\n\n\u201cThe year 2024 was a difficult one for the chocolate industry, due to the doubling of the price of cocoa beans and the increase in VAT on sweet products from 9% to 19%. These factors led to an increase in production costs, affecting both producers and consumers. However, the market continues to develop constantly and sustainably,\u201d explained Marian Anghel, General Manager of Omnia Gusti. Read more about Dulcinella Rom\u00e2nia launches two assortments of chocolate. Carpa\u021bi and Dun\u0103rea are local spin-offs of the famous Dubai chocolate\n\nThe chocolate market in Romania continues to grow, and Omniagusti estimates a 10% growth by the end of 2025. The growing interest in quality chocolate, along with profile events and the development of the local industry, have led to an increase in the consumption of local chocolate. More and more Romanians are choosing products made in Romania, encouraged by the promotion of local producers and their high quality.\n\nInvestments of almost half a million euros in chocolate\n\nAmidst this positive development, the artisanal chocolate industry in Romania has expanded considerably. In Bucharest, two new chocolatiers are already welcoming their customers who are passionate about fine chocolate. The Poem brand has opened a new location on Calea Victoriei, following the success of the first chocolatier in Cluj-Napoca. At the same time, Kestar launched the first Bean-to-Bar concept in Romania on Regina Elisabeta Boulevard, marking three months of activity. The total investment in these two locations amounts to almost half a million euros.\n\n\u201cFestivals and fairs dedicated to chocolate contribute significantly to educating the public and consolidating a premium chocolate culture in Romania,\u201d said Andreea Ilina, organizer of Chocolate Saga.\n\nTrends in confectionery also confirm this evolution, and manufacturers are moving towards innovative recipes and the highest quality ingredients.\n\n\u201cConsumers are looking for authentic experiences and unique flavor combinations, which is causing a revolution in confectionery. Artisanal products, made with natural ingredients, are increasingly appreciated. Moreover, in the confectionery segment, many people are looking for a complete experience \u2013 a friendly design, innovative marketing and a pleasant feeling when they step foot in our doors,\u201d explained Sergiu Diaconu, Dulcinella representative.\n\nIn conclusion, with a booming market and a growing interest in quality and authenticity, Romania is becoming an increasingly important player on the European chocolate map.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other defensive dividend stocks to buy during market sell off.\n\nThe importance of defensive dividend stocks only becomes clear when the broader market is taking a hit. The S&P is down nearly 8% in a month while Nasdaq has lost over 11.41%. Investors are wondering how to protect themselves from volatility and the answer lies in defensive stocks.\n\nHere is a key distinction investors must understand. Growth stocks rely on price appreciation to generate shareholder returns, something that is hard to achieve when the broader market is facing a severe sell-off. Dividend stocks, on the other hand, became more attractive. They not only help reduce the volatility but as their price goes down, their yield becomes more attractive.\n\nWe therefore decided to identify the best stocks for such a scenario. To come up with the list of 10 defensive dividend stocks to buy during a market sell-off, we only considered stocks belonging to the Consumer Defensive sector with a market cap of at least $2 billion and a dividend yield of at least 3%.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM): Among Defensive Dividend Stocks To Buy During Market Sell Off\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco company that provides smoke-free products and cigarettes. The company also offers healthcare and wellness products. Its stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.56%.\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is among the few companies that provide investors with both strong growth and consistent cash flows. The company\u2019s management is focused on generating strong returns for shareholders over the last decade. It offered total returns of 107% to investors in the past five years, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s returns of 101.9%. While this may not seem significant, the peace of mind associated with this investment is worth it.\n\nThe company posted a robust performance in FQ424, surpassing expectations with a revenue growth of 7.3% year-over-year. As a result of the solid earnings, the company\u2019s stock surged. Ongoing developments and the attractive guidance for FY2025 make it a rewarding investment opportunity for investors.\n\nAnalysts are also optimistic about the company as tobacco and smoking product prices went up by 6.6% in February. Relaxation in some regulations is also seen as a catalyst for sector growth. Analysts believe that the company will benefit from all these favorable circumstances and the next bull run could be around the corner.",

            "content": "Evaluating stocks involves considering many crucial factors, but the ability to generate cash is of uniquely paramount importance. At the end of the day, a business centers around the idea of generating cash over net income. Non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization can make these two figures look very different.\n\nNon-cash expenses affect net income but not cash flow. However, non-cash expenses are still important to consider, given that they have legitimate effects on business operations.\n\nA key profitability metric that assesses a business's ability to turn sales into cash available to shareholders is the free cash flow margin. It looks at a company\u2019s free cash flow in relation to its sales, indicating cash profitability. Free cash flow shows how much money companies can give to shareholders.\n\nIt does this by subtracting the money spent on capital expenditures. Below are three large-cap stocks in the U.S. that led their sectors in free cash flow margin over the past 12 months. All metrics use data as of the Mar. 17 close.\n\nAltria Group: Massive Free Cash Flow Margin Leads to Massive Dividend Yield\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:MO]\n\nLeading the U.S. large-cap consumer staples sector in free cash flow margin is Altria Group (NYSE: MO). The company boasts a colossal free cash flow margin of over 42%. This towers over the 28% free cash flow margin of the second-ranked stock in its sector, Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM). The company\u2019s extraordinary cash flow generation contributes greatly to its ability to have a sky-high dividend yield of 6.9%. This gives the stock a top 20 dividend yield among U.S. large-cap stocks.\n\nTobacco products are relatively easy to mass-produce, keeping costs down. At the same time, consumers are willing to pay higher prices given the addictive properties of nicotine. This creates an ideal relationship for a highly profitable and cash-generating business.\n\nAirbnb: Share-Based Compensation Puts Free Cash Flow Margin at the Top of Its Sector\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:ABNB]\n\nOver the last 12 months, Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) has led the U.S. large-cap consumer discretionary sector with a free cash flow margin of just under 41%. Airbnb has come a long way since going public in late 2020. Compared to its first full year as a public company in 2021, its free cash flow increased by 108%, reaching $4.5 billion in 2024. The company lost $225 million in 2021, compared to profiting $2.6 billion in net income in 2024.\n\nThere is a massive $1.9 billion difference between the company\u2019s net income and free cash flow, highlighting the effect of non-cash expenses. Much of this difference comes from Airbnb paying out $1.4 billion in total stock-based compensation over the last 12 months. Stock-based compensation pays employees for their work with Airbnb shares and is a non-cash expense.\n\nOne big concern with stock-based compensation is that it creates more shares. This can dilute existing shareholders when employees convert their stock options. However, Airbnb has also engaged in extensive share buybacks, which reduce this dilution effect. In 2024, the firm spent $3.4 billion on buybacks, reducing its outstanding shares. This reduction helps balance the impact of its big share-based compensation strategy.\n\nThe company has cut its fully diluted share count by more than 5% since Dec. 2022. In short, Airbnb\u2019s free cash flow margin is somewhat inflated due to stock-based compensation. However, the company is considerably limiting the risks that come with this compensation method by using buybacks.\n\nTexas Pacific Land: Free Cash Flow Margin Royalty of the Energy Sector\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:TPL]\n\nTexas Pacific Land (NYSE: TPL) rounds out this list with a monstrous free cash flow margin of over 65%. This leads all U.S. large-cap stocks in the energy sector. Much of the reason Texas Pacific Land is capable of such a high free cash flow margin is due to its royalty business model. The company owns around 873,000 acres of land in the Texas Permian Basin, the largest oil-producing basin in the United States.\n\nInstead of extracting oil itself, the company leases out the rights to extract oil to other firms. This eliminates the vast costs and equipment needed to extract oil from the ground. In turn, Texas Pacific simply gets paid royalties based on the amount of oil extracted.\n\nThe company also monetizes the land's surface rights and water rights above its oil reserves. This gives it the ability to maximize profits in a way that companies that only own oil reserves cannot.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here\n\nThe article \"3 Cash Cow Stocks Leading Their Sectors in Free Cash Flow Margins\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

            "content": "The stock market started strong in 2025, but in recent weeks, news of trade wars and tariffs has hammered the markets. Year to date, the S&P 500 is now down nearly 4.5%, and many investors are worried that there could be further declines coming.\n\nThree stocks that have outperformed the index by a wide mile are CVS Health (CVS -1.15%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI 5.22%), and Philip Morris International (PM -0.18%). Why are these stocks doing so well, and can their impressive rallies continue? Let's take a closer look.\n\nCVS Health: Up 51% in 2025\n\nThe best-performing stock on this list is CVS Health, which has risen sharply by roughly 51% in 2025. The company got a big boost last month after reporting its year-end earnings. It beat expectations, and its guidance for the year was in line with Wall Street expectations.\n\nFor investors, it may have come as a pleasant surprise. The company was struggling last year, routinely missing expectations. Ultimately, this led to a change in CEO, with David Joyner taking over from Karen Lynch, and this past quarter was his first full one at the helm. Under the new leadership, investors may be feeling more optimistic about the business, so at least its quarterly numbers may not be as volatile.\n\nLast year, shares of CVS tanked by 43%. That's also one of the reasons the healthcare stock may have been doing so well in recent weeks -- at such a beaten-down valuation, expectations were incredibly low heading into the quarterly results. But investors should tread carefully. While CVS stock is doing better, the company still says medical costs remain high, and that's been a problem for a while. The good news is that at 18 times trailing earnings, this still isn't an expensive stock to own, despite the strong rally.\n\nHowever, there's still a fair bit of uncertainty ahead, especially with President Donald Trump looking to cut costs in ways that are likely to affect multiple industries, including healthcare. Investors may want to consider holding off on buying CVS stock for now, as the company could still face a turbulent path ahead.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Up 26.5% in 2025\n\nAnother surging stock is Super Micro Computer. The company was heading into 2025 with a lot of question marks about its financial statements and whether it would file its quarterly and annual reports on time. Last year, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned over concerns relating to internal controls and board independence.\n\nIn February, the company filed its financial statements on time, with its new auditor, BDO, not raising any flags. That averted disaster, as there are now no imminent concerns of an exchange delisting, and investors appear to be eagerly buying up the stock again. Supermicro's IT infrastructure, including servers, has been soaring in demand. Tech companies are building out their artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities as they develop chatbots and next-gen technologies.\n\nSupermicro can be a good buy if you're bullish on AI, but this is another stock you may want to be careful with. Spending on tech may slow down under more challenging economic conditions. Tariffs may also hurt the company's already thin margins -- Supermicro reported just $2.1 billion in gross profit last year on sales of $14.9 billion, representing just 14% of its top line. This may seem like a cheap AI stock to buy given that it trades at 18 times earnings, but there's still some risk here.\n\nPhilip Morris International: Up 27.9% in 2025\n\nRounding out this list of top-performing stocks to start 2025 is Philip Morris International. Its shares spiked last month after the tobacco company released its guidance for the year, which came in better than what Wall Street was expecting. It expects that its adjusted earnings per share will come in within a range of $7.04 to $7.17, which is higher than estimates of $7.03.\n\nThe stock also got a boost from a recent approval from regulators to market its nicotine pouch, Zyn, in the U.S. Many people believe it's a safer alternative to cigarettes. However, the American Lung Association isn't convinced, saying that such pouches often contain many cancer-causing chemicals and their high levels of nicotine make them \"incredibly addictive.\"\n\nPhilip Morris International stock is off to a hot start to the year, but paying 25 times earnings for a business with a questionable future doesn't look all that enticing. The long-term trend is that tobacco use is coming down. While the current-year guidance may be encouraging, I wouldn't rush to buy the stock, given its valuation and the question marks ahead.",

            "content": "By Jennifer Galardi, Contributing Writer, The Kennedy Beacon\n\nAs a reporter, it has been difficult to keep up with the pace of the new administration. With large budget cuts under DOGE and sweeping immigration reform, some big wins by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under the direction of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have flown under the radar. Case in point: policy reform for the GRAS standard for verifying ingredients in food.\n\nPhoto by FDA/ Getty Images\n\nGRAS, an acronym employed by the FDA to mean Generally Recognized As Safe, was established by the Food Additives Amendment in 1958 to reduce the red tape necessary for the FDA to approve food ingredients. This included foods whose safety had either \u201cbeen established by a long history of use in food\u201d or \u201cby virtue of the nature of the substances, their conditions of use, and the information generally available to scientists,\u201d was considered safe. Back then such ingredients included salt, baking soda, and a long list of spices.\n\nHowever, no one could predict the explosion of highly processed foods and the chemical substances used in them. While GRAS standards began with stringent approval processes in the late 60s, those standards had grown lax by the early 2000s, with hundreds of new ingredients allowed into the marketplace via a process that has been characterized as \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nBut early last week, HHS Secretary Kennedy said he would stop that harmful method of approving ingredients in food \u2013 a system, he said, that had allowed the flow of some 10,000 chemicals into our bodies.\n\nKennedy announced that he is reversing the GRAS standard for food additives to \u201cguilty until proven innocent.\u201d In a recent video on Instagram, Kennedy called the abuse of GRAS a \u201cmass experiment on the American people\u201d and a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\n\nThe move has been widely applauded, with even the FDA commenting that it needs to do a better job. \u201cGRAS has been abused, and it\u2019s ripe for reform,\u201d said Stephen Ostroff, former acting FDA commissioner and deputy commissioner for foods, according to one report. Scott Faber, a senior vice president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, called it \u201clow hanging fruit,\u201d but admitted it\u2019s one no other administration has been willing to tackle.\n\nA Brief History of GRAS\n\nIn 1969, President Nixon directed the FDA to make a critical evaluation of the safety of GRAS food substances. An independent body of scientists convened for comprehensive reviews of all foods under GRAS and offered their findings on over 400 substances. These experts became gatekeepers for ingredients for the next decade or so. In the 70s and 80s, gums, dextrans, and various salts (sodium, potassium, calcium and iron salts) were included for review under the Select Committee on GRAS Substances, or SCOGS.\n\nFrom 1973 - 1997, the GRAS \u201cAffirmation Petition Process\u201d took effect, whereby industry could \u201cpetition the FDA to review the GRAS status of substances not being considered as part of the agency\u2019s GRAS review.\u201d Rather than undergoing rigorous review, the FDA merely would request and consider comments and then issue a final rule affirming GRAS status. Canola oil, enzyme preparations, whey, and cocoa butter substitute were all introduced within this time frame and approved for use under the new process.\n\nBeginning in 1997, the FDA moved from the petition process to what it calls \u201cGRAS Notification,\u201d which essentially allowed food manufacturers to \u201cself certify\u201d new additives and claim they were safe and ready for FDA approval without much opposition. During this period, the FDA approved such products as phytosterols,the compounds found in vegetable oils that are purported to lower cholesterol; DAG (diacylglycerol) oils, which includes partially hydrogenated oils ; and certain enzyme preparations.\n\nUnder the affirmation petition process from 1974 through August 1990, approvals took over 72 months. From 1998 - 2005, the mean time to get food substances approved was just 162 days, which may explain why 170 new additives passed muster.\n\nThe more lax GRAS process changed the standard for food additives, making new ingredients \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d This shift made it easy for highly processed ingredients to enter the food supply, and our bodies. No doubt large food manufacturers saw an opening to include highly addictive but less nourishing ingredients into their products; it increased their bottom line.\n\nIn fact, with the sharp decline in cigarette sales due to strong anti-smoking campaigns that began in the 1980s, tobacco companies searched for alternative profit centers. Processed foods offered the opportunity they needed. In 1985, Philip Morris Companies Inc. agreed to buy General Foods Corporation for $5.8 billion. Just three years later, the old cigarette manufacturer gobbled up Kraft Foods for $12.9 billion. Next came Nabisco. Phillip Morris acquired the popular snack food brand for $14.9 billion in June, 2000. There have been many reports, including this one in the Washington Post, outlining big tobacco\u2019s plan to make snack food hyperpalatable, turning them into new cigarettes.\n\nIn the official press release from HHS, Kennedy commented on the alteration to the GRAS standard: \u201cEliminating this loophole will provide transparency to consumers, help get our nation\u2019s food supply back on track by ensuring that ingredients being introduced into foods are safe, and ultimately Make America Healthy Again.\u201d\n\nLike a lot of legislation, what may have once been useful is now either unnecessary or, in the case of GRAS, insufficient. The food safety example makes a strong argument for a quick and expedient legislative review process. Kennedy and Trump see this new tack as an outright declaration of the end of a system that was not working \u2013 and the beginning of one that can help them both make good on their promise.",

She previously held senior positions at Ernst & Young, HSBC and Prudential, in financial crime and corruption prevention, and anti-money laundering.\n\n\u201cCatherine\u2019s background in fighting illegal activity makes her well equipped to understand how illicit operations impact legitimate retailers\u2019 businesses, and strategies to overcome them,\u201d the tobacco giant said.\n\nThe company is working to tackle the illicit trade at the local level with educational campaigns and test-purchase operations, as well as \u201cbuilding intelligence on a global scale\u201d with international organisations.\n\n\u201cI am passionate about fighting illicit trade, as I have seen first-hand the \u2013 often horrific \u2013 outcomes from these illegal activities,\u201d Goger said. \u201cSpending time out in the field joining test purchases with our undercover team, I was astounded by the brazenness of irresponsible retailers \u2013 with illicit tobacco products openly available.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese retailers sell substandard products \u2013 some of which have been infested with vermin droppings and asbestos \u2013 often to underaged consumers and vulnerable people. There needs to be more awareness of the illicit trade and the negative impact it has on both responsible retailers\u2019 businesses and on public health,\u201d she added.\n\nFigures from HM Revenue & Customs show the number of duty-paid cigarettes sold plummeted from 23.6 billion in 2021 to 13.2 billion in 2024, a decline of 44.4%. In the same period, sales of duty-paid hand-rolling tobacco dropped from 8.6 million kilograms to 4.5 million kilograms, a decline of 47.6%. Overall, the number of cigarettes bought on the legal market fell by 45.5% between 2021 and 2024.\n\nThe Institute of Economic Affairs says these declines come \u201cdespite the number of smokers falling only modestly\u201d and daily cigarette consumption among them remaining stable.\n\n\u201cThe only plausible explanation for this is that there has been rapid growth in tobacco sales on the black market,\u201d said the institute\u2019s Dr Christopher Snowdon. \u201cThis should be a wake-up call for the government.

            "content": "Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc., a company specializing in the development and distribution of innovative products, has released its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter. The report outlines significant financial and operational challenges faced by the company, including a substantial decrease in revenue and ongoing legal and regulatory hurdles.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nTotal Revenues, Net: The company reported total revenues of $0.2 million, a significant decrease from the previous year's $3.2 million, primarily due to a reduction in product sales.\n\nGross Profit: Gross profit stood at $0.2 million, representing 100% of revenues, net, compared to $1.2 million or 37.3% of revenues, net, in the prior year. This increase in gross profit margin is attributed to the absence of cost of revenue.\n\nNet Loss: The company reported a net loss of $4.0 million, compared to a net loss of $2.2 million in the prior year. The increased net loss is primarily due to decreased revenues and increased operating expenses.\n\nNet Loss Per Common Share - Basic and Diluted: The net loss per common share was $0.43, compared to $0.76 in the prior year, reflecting the impact of increased shares outstanding.\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nRevenue Segments: The company's primary source of revenue has shifted from the Bidi Stick to royalties from Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMPSA) under the PMI License Agreement. This shift is due to the ITC complaint filed by RJ Reynolds, which has halted the importation and sale of Bidi Sticks in the United States.\n\nGeographical Performance: The company has expanded its international presence through the PMI License Agreement, allowing PMPSA to manufacture, promote, sell, and distribute ENDS devices in international markets outside of the United States. The product, initially launched in Canada, has been rebranded as VEEV NOW and commercially launched in Europe, with additional market launches planned.\n\nNew Product Launches: The company announced the launch of PMPSA's custom-branded self-contained e-vapor product, VEEV NOW, which was initially distributed in Canada and later in Europe.\n\nFuture Outlook: The company is focusing on developing and monetizing the GoFire intellectual property, which includes vaporizer and inhalation-related technology, to diversify its business and reduce dependence on Bidi Vapor. The company is seeking third-party licensing opportunities in various markets, including cannabis, hemp/CBD, nicotine, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nOperational Challenges: The company faces significant operational challenges due to the ITC complaint by RJ Reynolds, which could prohibit the importation and sale of Bidi Sticks in the U.S. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding Bidi's PMTA process with the FDA and the outcome of Bidi's petition with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FDA's MDO relating to the Classic Bidi\u00ae Stick poses risks to the company's operations.\n\nStrategic Initiatives: The company has entered into a Merger and Share Exchange Agreement with Delta Corp Holdings Limited, which, if consummated, will result in Pubco becoming the parent company. This strategic move is expected to close in March or April, subject to conditions being met.\n\nSEC Filing: Kaival Brands Innovations Group, Inc. [ KAVL ] - 10-Q - Mar. 17, 2025",

            "content": "The NWT government says it will use its share of a huge payout from cigarette manufacturers to \u201csupport preventative care and enhance the efficiency of our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nThe territory is set to receive $185 million from three companies \u2013 JTI Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, which are subsidiaries of Japan Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International respectively.\n\nAn Ontario court approved a settlement earlier this month that will distribute $32.5 billion from those companies to Canada\u2019s provinces and territories. The money is designed in part to compensate for smoking-related healthcare costs over previous decades.\n\nThe NWT has known for a while that its share would be $185 million, of which about $44 million is expected as an immediate payment.\n\nHowever, last week health minister Lesa Semmler gave the first suggestion of how the territory might spend the money by committing, in a statement, to preventative care and enhanced healthcare efficiency.\n\nThe detail of what that might mean has not been set out.\n\n\u201cThis litigation addressed the alleged deceptive practices of tobacco companies from the 1950s to the 1980s. These practices led to significant healthcare costs and our goal was to recover those costs,\u201d Semmler stated.\n\n\u201cThe legal process began more than two decades ago, and the mediation that led to this resolution has taken five years.\u201d\n\nOnce the $44-million initial payment is received, the remaining $141 million is expected to arrive over 18 years.\n\nSemmler promised the money will be used \u201cin ways that directly benefit the people of the Northwest Territories.\u201d\n\nThe territory is still working to help its residents quit smoking.\n\nThe NWT received nearly $2 million in federal cash last month to help campaigns that get people to stop smoking.\n\nAt the time, Semmler said smoking rates in the NWT are among the highest in Canada.\n\n\u201cWhile about one in 10 non-Indigenous residents in the territory over the age of 15 smoke, the rate of Indigenous residents is nearly five times that,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nSmoking is most popular among NWT residents aged 15 to 34, where 32 percent of people say they are smokers. That drops to 22 percent for people aged 60 or over.\n\nThe territory is also moving to ban smoking in the 2,400 or so social housing units it operates.",

Amaral v. Philip Morris, et al., 2181CV000062.\n\nThe Massachusetts Superior Court jury, in Middlesex County, deliberated across five days before finding cigarettes made by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were defectively designed and caused the 2019 lung cancer death of Jose Amaral, then 54.\n\nThe verdict includes $25 million in punitive damages imposed against Philip Morris and another $11.5 million in punitives imposed against Reynolds, in addition to more than $4 million in compensatories.\n\nJurors cleared the two cigarette makers on other claims, and completely cleared two retailers that sold cigarettes to Amaral.\n\nAmaral began smoking as a young teenager and continued smoking a pack or more of cigarettes a day for more than 30 years. Amaral\u2019s family contends Philip Morris and Reynolds made and marketed cigarettes they knew were were addictive and caused cancer. And the month-long trial turned largely on whether cigarettes the two companies made were unreasonably dangerous.\n\nIn his closing argument, Shook Hardy & Bacon\u2019s Bruce Tepikian, representing Philip Morris, told jurors evidence showed all cigarettes are inherently dangerous and that there was no reasonable, safer alternative to the product. Tepikian told jurors Philip Morris had experimented with alternative designs such as heat-not-burn cigarettes and ultra-low nicotine options, but these products failed in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cA cigarette that is not acceptable to consumers is not a reasonable alternative design,\u201d Tepikian said.\n\nJones Day\u2019s Kevin Boyce, representing Reynolds, agreed, and walked jurors through evidence he said showed the company worked for years to reduce dangers inherent in its cigarettes, including making filtered and very-low nicotine cigarettes, which Reynolds scientists believed were safer.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs need to prove that [cigarettes are] defective based on conscious design choices of the company,\u201d Boyce said. \u201cAnd here, the conscious design choices that Reynolds made actually make cigarettes safer and reduce the risk for smokers.\u201d\n\nBut Gordon & Partners\u2019 Gary Paige, representing Amaral\u2019s family, argued that evidence showed filtered and \u201clight\u201d cigarettes like the ones Amaral smoked actually increased rates of adenocarcinoma, the same type of lung cancer Amaral developed.\n\nAnd Dolan Dobrinsky Rosenblum Bluestein\u2019s Randy Rosenblum, also representing Amaral\u2019s family, argued the safer alternatives placed on the market in the late 20th century failed because the companies were unwilling to publicly acknowledge smoking was dangerous during that time.\n\n\u201cThese [alternative designs that were sold] were safer, but they weren\u2019t telling people any of those things,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why these things failed in the marketplace, not because people didn\u2019t want them.\u201d\n\nEmail Arlin Crisco at acrisco@cvn.com.\n\nRelated information\n\nWatch the trial.\n\nNot a subscriber?\n\nLearn how you can access an unrivaled trial video library.",

The company recently reported that it has 17.14 million shares sold short, which is 1.1% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.2 days to cover their short positions on average.\n\nWhy Short Interest Matters\n\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\n\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\n\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\n\nPhilip Morris Intl Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\n\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Philip Morris Intl has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.\n\nComparing Philip Morris Intl's Short Interest Against Its Peers\n\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Philip Morris Intl's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 2.68%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\n\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock?

            "content": "What friends remember most about Julie Morris Golden is the strength of her faith. Golden, 71, passed away Dec. 24, after an 11-year battle with cancer.\n\n\"She died Christmas Eve and spent Christmas with her Savior,\" said long-time friend Patricia Blitch. \"I've known her all my life, and she has always been there for me.\"\n\nBorn in Statesboro, Golden was a true Statesboro native. Her father owned one of Statesboro's first men's clothing stores and her mother was a secretary at Georgia Southern College. She graduated from Statesboro High School in 1956, and was going to attend Georgia Southern, but love intervened.\n\nGolden's high school sweetheart Philip Morris was offered a position in California and asked her to marry him. She did and the couple moved to the West Coast, where their daughter Patti Lynn was born.\n\nThree years later, they moved to Satellite Beach, Fla. to work for NASA, and their second child, Connie Marie, was born. In 1965, they moved back to Statesboro to help run the family wholesale grocery business, T.J. Morris Company.\n\nBlitch, who had been friends with Golden since childhood, was happy to see her return. She recalled Golden's unwavering faith, even through her illness.\n\n\"She never showed anything but her faith in Christ,\" she said. \"She never faltered in her faith, and was a witness through all her illness.\"\n\n\"She was one of the sweetest persons,\" said Betty Hatcher, who was also a long-time friend. \"She was the epitome of a Southern lady - gracious, thoughtful, kind and she was always thinking of ways to help others, especially those who couldn't help themselves.\"\n\nJulie was a devoted wife and mother, and enjoyed decorating and entertaining. Her passion for serving God was reflected in that she was co-owner and operator of The Word, a Christian bookstore.\n\nGolden's battle with cancer began in 1998, when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. That same year her first husband, Phillip Morris, died from complications of diabetes. Golden continued her fight with cancer, and dedicated her time to working with the church and other Christian organizations. Her work with the Second Chances ministry earned her a Deen Day Service to Mankind Award in 2000.\n\nBlitch said Golden was always a charitable person, and recalled the years when she and Golden raised children together, camped and traveled together, and owned a beach house together. \"We celebrated life together,\" she said.\n\nGolden was active in the community, and supported the Averitt Center for the Arts, Ogeechee Area Hospice, and many other organizations.\n\nIn 2004, she married again, to Dr. Bill Golden, in a ceremony at Guido Gardens in Metter. The couple enjoyed attending Georgia Southern University football games, and traveling to Africa and Hawaii.\n\n\"She loved her family, loved her friends and loved her Lord,\" Hatcher said. \"Julie was my dear friend and I am going to miss her so much.\"\n\nA funeral service for Golden will be held today at 1:30 p.m. at First Baptist Church in Statesboro, with Dr. John Waters officiating. Visitation with the family will be held in the church fellowship hall after the service.\n\nThere will be a graveside service at 4:30 p.m. at Eastside Cemetery.\n\nHolli Deal Bragg may be reached at 489-9414.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Over the years, Mark Cuban has invested in various industries, including social software, networking, entertainment, sports, and cryptocurrency. He was an early investor in IceRocket, a blog search engine, and backed companies like RedSwoosh, Weblogs, Inc., and Goowy Media. In 2005, he experimented with a new business model for online journalism through Sharesleuth.com and later launched Bailoutsleuth.com for government oversight. Cuban also ventured into film distribution with Magnolia Pictures and invested in Motionloft, a storefront analytics company. His Shark Tank investments since 2011 total nearly $20 million, with mixed success. In 2022, he launched Cost Plus Drugs to lower prescription prices and disrupt the U.S. healthcare industry. His sports ventures include owning the Dallas Mavericks from 2000 until selling a majority stake in 2023. Cuban has also been active in cryptocurrency, accepting Dogecoin for Mavericks merchandise and tickets.\n\nCuban started his career at Mellon Bank, where he developed an interest in technology and networking. After being fired from his sales job in a software retailer, he founded MicroSolutions, a company specializing in system integration and software reselling. Under his leadership, the company flourished, generating over $30 million in revenue before Cuban sold it to CompuServe for $6 million in 1990, netting approximately $2 million after taxes. Cuban\u2019s success continued with Audionet, a company he co-founded in 1995 alongside Todd Wagner. Audionet evolved into Broadcast.com, growing rapidly and generating millions in revenue. In 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom, Yahoo! acquired Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in stock.\n\nMark Cuban is a well-known entrepreneur and television personality, recognized for his diverse business ventures and outspoken presence in the sports and entertainment industries. He was the principal owner of an NBA franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, of which he now serves as a minority owner. Raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Cuban showed an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age. At age 12, he sold garbage bags to afford a pair of expensive sneakers after which, at 16, he capitalized on a newspaper strike by transporting newspapers. Later, he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh before transferring to Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, where he earned a degree in management in 1981.\n\nWe recently published a list of Mark Cuban Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other top stock picks from Mark Cuban's portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMark Cuban\u2019s investment philosophy is centered on discipline, frugality, and informed decision-making. He emphasizes \u201cliving like a student\u201d in the early years to build a financial cushion, saving at least six months\u2019 income before investing in low-cost index funds. Cuban strongly discourages credit card debt due to high interest rates, advocating for cash or debit card use instead. He also promotes strategic spending by negotiating prices and buying essentials in bulk when discounted. For more experienced investors, Cuban suggests deep expertise in a particular domain and holding cash until a unique opportunity arises, rather than following conventional buy-and-hold strategies. Ultimately, his approach prioritizes financial discipline, smart spending, and long-term investing for steady wealth growth.\n\nThe outspoken tech mogul has a well-defined investment strategy focused on generating wealth through smart, long-term decisions. He favors dividend-paying stocks, referring to them as \u201creal-world value generators,\u201d emphasizing their ability to provide steady income rather than relying solely on price appreciation. In the rapidly evolving AI sector, Cuban sees massive potential, believing that AI will be essential for every company\u2019s survival. Comparing AI investments to buying Apple stock in the 1980s, he considers them the future of passive wealth. As he puts it, \u201cNon-dividend stocks are basically baseball cards. But AI? That\u2019s a whole different game.\u201d\n\nCuban also acknowledges the high-risk, high-reward nature of cryptocurrency investments but warns investors to be cautious. He advises only investing in what one can afford to lose and focusing on cryptocurrencies with real-world applications. His stance is clear: \u201cIf you\u2019re not a true adventurer, stay away.\u201d For those seeking a more stable approach, he recommends the broader market, which has historically delivered reliable returns of around 10% annually. Additionally, his involvement with private companies through \u201cShark Tank\u201d highlights the potential of venture capital, though he recognizes that most investors may need to turn to crowdfunding or venture funds to access similar opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe stocks listed below were picked from the public comments that Cuban has made on his investments. He has explicitly mentioned some of his private holdings during these public appearances while only alluding to others. However, based on a careful assessment of the comments, the stocks listed below largely align with his investment philosophy. The list is compiled in descending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in each firm, which was derived using data from over 1,000 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM): Among Top Stock Picks From Mark Cuban's Portfolio\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 102\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), a global tobacco company, reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. The company generated $9.7 billion in revenue, reflecting a 7.3% increase from the prior year. Operating income also saw substantial growth, rising 14.8% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. A key driver of this performance was the company\u2019s continued expansion into smoke-free alternatives, with shipments of heated tobacco units (HTU) and oral nicotine products surpassing 40 billion units in a single quarter for the first time.\n\nLooking ahead, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) expects adjusted annual earnings per share to range between $7.04 and $7.17, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $7.03. The company also projects a notable increase in ZYN shipments to the U.S., its largest market, with an estimated growth of 34% to 41%. IQOS shipments are also expected to rise by 10% to 12%. Analysts highlighted that PMI\u2019s forecasts for profits, sales volume, and revenue were stronger than anticipated, boosting investor confidence. Historically, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has been conservative in its early-year projections, leading to speculation that upward revisions may follow, further strengthening its stock performance.\n\nAlthough Mark Cuban is not known for investing in Philip Morris, his preference for dividend-paying stocks, which he refers to as \u201creal-world value generators,\u201d aligns with the company\u2019s strong dividend performance. Philip Morris remains a top choice for dividend investors, offering a quarterly payout of $1.35 per share. As of March 6, 2025, the stock carried a dividend yield of 3.58%, making it a potential candidate for investors following Cuban\u2019s philosophy. With 15 consecutive years of dividend increases, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has established itself as one of the most reliable dividend-paying stocks. This consistency in returns makes it particularly attractive for long-term investors seeking stable income. Therefore, those looking for a stable income-generating investment may find PM an appealing option.\n\nOverall, PM ranks 7th on our list of top stock picks from Mark Cuban's portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

We are witnessing a global transformation in the tobacco sector, and science and technology are redefining the way this industry operates. However, to create long-term impact, the industry needs policies that reflect modern realities and innovation. This would also encourage modernization, industry transformation, and investment-driven growth, for the entire tobacco ecosystem, thereby making India a significant partner worldwide,\" said De Wilde.\n\nFrederic De Wilde, President SSEA, CIS & MEA Region, Philip Morris International (PMI)\n\nAddressing the gathering, De Wilde highlighted how science-led decision-making and regulations transform the sector & open new economic opportunities. He emphasized that across various industries\u2014from renewable energy to digital finance\u2014countries that have modernized regulatory frameworks have seen faster economic growth and stronger global positioning.\n\nReflecting on PMI's transformation, De Wilde, said, \"20 years ago, the company began rethinking its role in the tobacco industry, recognizing that consumer needs and scientific advancements demanded a shift. We soon recognized that combustion is the primary cause of harm in smoking and focused our research and innovation on eliminating it. We have invested $14 billion in science, research, and commercial efforts to advance innovation and raise awareness about less harmful alternatives. We hired over 500 top scientists, and built a strong research foundation to ensure the solutions we introduced were supported by credible data and transparent methodologies. Ten years ago, we launched these alternatives in partnership with governments worldwide. The results? In many countries, cigarette consumption is steadily declining, with alternatives taking their place.\"\n\nDe Wilde emphasised how regulatory modernization in parts of Europe and Asia has led to a decline in smoking incidence.\n\n\"In Japan, the introduction of alternatives has cut the combustible cigarette market in half. In Rome, one in three smokers has transitioned to alternatives, signalling a major behavioural shift. Sweden leads Europe with the lowest smoking rate at just 5%, with smoking among young adults nearly non-existent. From a health perspective, Sweden also reports the lowest lung cancer incidence among men in the EU, showcasing the positive impact of regulatory modernization and access to alternatives.\"\n\nFocusing on India's regulatory and economic landscape, De Wilde praised its policy-driven growth in technology, finance, and infrastructure. He emphasized that India's success in regulatory clarity has driven investment, fostered innovation, and strengthened trade partnerships.\n\n\"India has been a pioneer in regulatory modernization across industries. From renewable energy to digital payments, progressive policy frameworks have accelerated economic transformation. The next step is ensuring that scientifically validated industries can also contribute to this progress.\"\n\nDe Wilde acknowledged that PMI wishes to actively engage with policymakers in India to build an understanding of how science-backed innovations can align with regulatory priorities and improve the country's tobacco control outcomes. He noted that while several countries have adopted a structured regulatory approach to new product categories, India has the opportunity to create a global benchmark for progressive trade and policy development.\n\n\"We have seen successful government-industry partnerships globally, where scientific advancements and regulatory policies have worked together to drive positive change. We are eager to contribute to this conversation, working collaboratively with stakeholders to benefit the economy.\"\n\nHe further said that India should look at adopting a redefined Tobacco Control strategy, \"One that blends science-driven policies, along with a sustainable regulatory framework so that alternatives are available. With 300 million tobacco users, including 100 million smokers, a redefined approach can strengthen public health efforts and help save millions of lives.\"\n\nBeyond regulatory modernization, De Wilde emphasized PMI's commitment to sustainability, with a strong focus on agriculture and farmer empowerment. \"India is one of the top tobacco growing countries in the world. Tobacco farming remains vital for thousands of families, and supporting farmers through sustainable practices is essential for long-term agricultural stability. We wish to implement our Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) initiative and provide farmers with technology, training, and resources to improve productivity while minimizing environmental impact.\"\n\nWith the right policies, industries can evolve responsibly, economies can grow sustainably, and trade partnerships can thrive. India is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation, creating a regulatory and investment landscape that benefits businesses, consumers, and the global trade ecosystem.\n\nAbout Times Group ET NOW GBS\n\nThe Times Group ET NOW GBS stands as a distinguished platform that has in the past hosted an illustrious array of personalities, both from India and around the world.

(NYSE:PM) stands against the other low risk stocks.\n\nRisk is a key consideration in investing and portfolio management, as investors generally aim to achieve the maximum return per minimum unit of risk. The true risk of a stock is impossible to measure or quantify, but there are several metrics, such as the volatility of returns or equity beta, that can gauge the magnitude of risk relative to other companies. The equity beta of a stock represents the sensitivity, or correlation, between the returns of the stock and the returns of the broad market. An equity beta below one means that the stock does not respond as much as the broad market to different events, such as macroeconomic developments, monetary policy changes, etc. When a stock with low risk (low beta) is introduced into a portfolio, the overall expected risk of the portfolio is significantly reduced, while the expected return is usually not significantly compromised, leading to a better risk/return profile.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nThere are times when the risk profile of a portfolio becomes a more important consideration than maximizing returns, such as during periods of economic uncertainty, market downturns, or when an investor nears retirement and prioritizes capital preservation over growth. In these situations, investors often shift their focus from aggressive returns, such as growth stocks, to minimizing potential losses, adjusting their portfolios to include more low-beta stocks, bonds, or other defensive assets.\n\nMarket volatility, geopolitical tensions, and changes in monetary policy can also drive investors toward safer investments to protect their capital. Understanding and managing risk, particularly through measures like equity beta, allows investors to navigate uncertain times without exposing themselves to unnecessary losses. While low beta stocks are usually more mature and low growth businesses, they can deliver strong returns during bear markets, as capital actively starts flowing into them and inflates their market valuation. Consequently, by rotating into low risk stocks at the right time, investors can achieve two goals at once \u2013 not only reduce the risk of the portfolio, but also significantly improve the potential return profile.\n\nWe believe the broad stock market is currently at a crossroads and has just entered a new \u201cTrump 2.0 regime,\u201d which will be dominated by unprecedented actions and measures. Not only does the new US administration employ tools such as tariffs that were not used on a large scale for decades, but it has also started some strategic political shifts that could threaten decade-long alliances (such as the US-Europe alliance). All of this, coupled with aggressive cost-cutting in federal budgets and spending, has introduced a lot of uncertainty and difficult-to-digest news for investors.",

            "content": "The illicit tobacco trade is a growing problem in the UK. What is historically perceived as a handful of shopkeepers selling moderate volumes of product procured from a white van man, is now a sophisticated supply chain coordinated by organised crime gangs that are increasingly encroaching on the UK[i]. Illicit trade underscores violent organised crime, money laundering, and even terrorism and it strips the country of duty revenue[ii].\n\nAcross the UK, 6.7 billion counterfeit and contraband cigarettes were consumed in 2023[iii], meaning that over one in four cigarettes consumed were illicit[iv]. While studies show that the proportion of UK smokers decreases year-on-year[v], the most recent KPMG Report on Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe[vi] \u2013 commissioned by Philip Morris International \u2013 shows that UK illicit cigarette consumption, as a percentage of total cigarette consumption, accelerated by more than 20% from 2022 to 2023[vii]. As a result, the UK is the third-biggest consumer of illicit cigarettes in Europe, by volume \u2013 despite falling in the bottom-fifth for smoking prevalence[viii].\n\nCatherine Goger\n\nIllicit Trade Prevention Manager\n\nPhilip Morris\n\nThese tobacco products are produced with no regard for regulations and legislation. Fire-retardant rings are often absent, and illicit cigarettes can be contaminated with rodent droppings and even asbestos, according to lab results.\n\nThe growing problem of cheap illicit products undermines progress towards a smoke-free England by 2030, with pocket money-priced illegal disposable vapes and illicit cigarette packets costing as little as \u00a35 each. Conversely, the duty revenue lost from illicit tobacco exceeds an estimated \u00a33bn per annum[ix].\n\nAt the local level, we work with external consultants on covert operations across Great Britain and Northern Ireland to gather evidence that is shared with Trading Standards and other agencies, both at home and abroad.\n\nThe worsening issue of illicit trade in the UK serves as a reminder that we cannot afford to be complacent of its insidious nature \u2013 driving crime in our communities and putting adults who smoke at even greater risk.\n\nProtecting retailers and keeping our society safe should be the cornerstone of any strategy to curb the illicit tobacco trade. Governments must be relentless against organised crime profiting from illicit trade in tobacco products. The illicit trade numbers in the UK should serve as an eye-opener: the UK government have a duty towards their constituents and must look into implementing innovative and long-lasting policies that aim to make all cigarettes a thing of the past \u2013 both legal and illegal ones.\n\nReferences\n\n[i] Report shows that Organised Crime Groups are locating production facilities closer to large end-markets (UK and France stand as two of the Top 3 European Markets by Counterfeit and Contraband volume \u2013 p.13), KMPG 2023 Report: Illicit cigarette consumption in Europe, p.10, KPMG report - Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe - 2023 Results\n\n[ii] KMPG 2023 Report: Illicit cigarette consumption in Europe, p.217, KPMG report - Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe - 2023 Results\n\n[iii]Ibid\n\n[iv] KMPG 2023 Report: Illicit cigarette consumption in Europe, p.217, KPMG report - Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe - 2023 Results, Total Cigarette Consumption in 2023 was 26.09bn in 2023, of which 6.71 bn cigarettes was illicit (6.71/26.09 = 25.7%, \u00bc = 25%)\n\n[v] 12.9% in 2022 to 11.9% in 2023[v], Office for National Statistics (ONS), released 1 October 2024, ONS website, statistical bulletin, Adult smoking habits in the UK: 2023\n\n[vi] Commissioned by Philip Morris International, KPMG report - Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe - 2023 Results\n\n[vii] KMPG 2023 Report: Illicit cigarette consumption in Europe, p.217: 2022 (21.2%) versus 2023 (25.7%) (25.7/21.2) \u2013 1 = 21.2%\n\n[viii] Prevalence of Tobacco Use Among Adults in the WHO European Region, WHO, 2020, Prevalence of tobacco use among adults in the WHO European Region in 2020\n\n[ix] KMPG 2023 Report: Illicit cigarette consumption in Europe, p.217, KPMG report - Illicit Cigarette Consumption in Europe - 2023 Results\n\nRead the most recent articles written by Philip Morris International - Building an inclusive workplace: How Philip Morris is embedding DEI for lasting impact",

            "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 10, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coca-Cola KO, Philip Morris PM and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.\n\n3 Dividend Kings Shaking Off Market Woes\n\nThe market has thrown a tantrum over recent weeks following tariff news and other economic data pointing to a slowing consumer. While it's certainly been a forgettable period, several stocks, including Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Johnson & Johnson, have remained strong over the past month.\n\nAll three reflect defensive deployments, with their products able to carry steady demand through many economic backdrops. Let's take a closer look at each for those interested in adding in an additional layer of defense.\n\nCoca-Cola Gains Market Share\n\nConcerning headline figures in KO's latest release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily, reflecting growth rates of 12% and 6%, respectively. Notably, the company's gross margin has remained constructive over recent periods, recovering nicely from early 2023 lows.\n\nNotably, Coca-Cola gained market share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in North America, with its overall price/mix also increasing by an impressive 11% throughout its FY24. The stock also reflects a prime selection for those with an appetite for income, with KO holding the elite Dividend King title.\n\nConsistent cash flows have aided the shareholder-friendly nature, with KO sporting a 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nPM Innovation Paints Bright Outlook\n\nPhilip Morris shares have benefited nicely from its latest set of better-than-expected results, with EPS growing 14% alongside a strong 7% move higher in sales. Demand has remained strong for the tobacco titan, with product innovations remaining key for its future.\n\nPM's top line continues to grow at a solid pace, posting YoY growth rates of at least 5% over its last seven periods.\n\nNotably, smoke-free products exceeded 40 billion units for the first time throughout its FY24, with full-year net revenues for its Smoke-free Business (SFB) increasing by 14.2% alongside an 18.7% move higher in gross profit.\n\nShares also provide a high level of passive income, currently yielding a market-beating 3.5% annually. Dividend growth has been rock-solid, with PM also holding the ranks of a Dividend King.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company's FY25 EPS outlook has remained constructive, with PM expected to see 8.9% year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nJNJ Shares Ready to Breakout\n\nJNJ shares have traded primarily sideways over the past three years, up a modest 5% compared to the S&P 500's 46% gain. While the performance has undoubtedly been 'boring', the stability of the stock is a stronger takeaway here.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have taken a backseat in the market as technology and AI-driven equities have soared to record highs. However, analysts at Ned Davis Research believe that a more challenging macroeconomic landscape this year could create opportunities for dividend stocks to regain momentum.\n\nAmid concerns about economic growth and uncertainty surrounding former President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been turning to defensive strategies. In this environment, dividend stocks have proven resilient, offering both stability and attractive passive income. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks companies with a history of at least 25 years of consistent dividend growth, has climbed by over 5.3% in 2025. In contrast, the broader market has declined by nearly 1.7%, as of the close of March 7.\n\nREAD ALSO: 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nWhile analysts remain cautious about the market\u2019s ability to sustain its recent gains, dividend stocks have increasingly drawn their attention for several reasons. According to Ameriprise Financial, the S&P index is widely regarded as one of the most significant benchmarks for global equity markets. Over the past decade, dividend growth and share buybacks have become defining characteristics of the index, which includes numerous global dividend-paying companies. Dividend growth saw a sharp slowdown in the final quarter of 2024, largely attributed to the election and uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes. With these concerns now in the past, Ameriprise Financial expects a resurgence in dividend growth within the broader market. For 2025, projections indicate a potential 8% increase in dividend payouts, following growth rates of 6% in 2024 and 5% in 2023.\n\nThe report further mentioned that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 also played a significant role in boosting dividends and share buybacks in 2018. By lowering the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the legislation contributed to a surge in shareholder returns, with buybacks and dividend payouts reaching multi-year highs the following year. As the TCJA approaches its expiration in 2025, discussions around corporate tax reductions have resurfaced. While the proposed decrease from 21% to 15% is not as substantial as the previous cut, it could still provide an upside for shareholder returns within the broader market once a final decision is reached.\n\nCompanies with a history of regular dividend payments are generally seen as stable investments, reflecting their strong cash flow and financial resilience. These businesses are often found in defensive sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which tend to be less affected by economic fluctuations. As a result, they help investors manage portfolio risks more effectively. At the beginning of 2025, growing concerns over rising inflation and sluggish economic growth led investors to increase their exposure to defensive stocks. This shift in strategy was intended to protect portfolios from potential market volatility linked to these economic uncertainties.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team shared their perspective on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have delivered positive returns in 2025. From that group, we identified dividend companies with strong dividend policies and stable cash positions. We began with a pool of fifty companies, narrowed it down by considering their share price increases, and ultimately selected the top 14 dividend stocks with the highest share price gains as of March 7, arranging them in ascending order of performance.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nYear-to-Date Return as of March 7: 25.18%\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a multinational tobacco company, serving customers with a wide range of related products. The company delivered strong fourth-quarter results for 2024, reporting $9.7 billion in revenue, a 7.3% increase from the previous year. Operating income grew 14.8% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. The company\u2019s shift toward smoke-free alternatives continues to gain momentum, with shipments of heated tobacco units (HTU) and oral nicotine products surpassing 40 billion units in a single quarter for the first time.\n\nOne of the key growth drivers for Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has been Zyn, a nicotine pouch brand that uses nicotine powder and flavoring instead of traditional tobacco. Since acquiring the brand in late 2022, PM has seen surging demand, with Zyn\u2019s sales volume rising 46.2% in the fourth quarter to 183.8 million cans. The company expects this upward trend to continue, forecasting shipments between 780 million and 820 million cans in 2025\u2014an increase of 34% to 41% from the previous year.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) remains a popular choice for dividend investors, offering a quarterly payout of $1.35 per share. As of March 6, the stock had a dividend yield of 3.58%. With 15 consecutive years of dividend increases, it is among the best performing stocks that pay dividends.\n\nOverall PM ranks 1st on our list of the best performing dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The court\u2019s approval of an amended plan to settle all tobacco-related claims against RBH and its affiliates, including Philip Morris, is a positive development. This resolution is expected to remove a longstanding overhang on the company\u2019s stock, allowing Philip Morris to focus on its core operations and growth strategies.\n\nAdditionally, the settlement plan allows RBH to retain a substantial amount of cash, which can be transferred or distributed outside of Canada. This financial flexibility, combined with the potential for incremental cash flow and earnings per share from permitted dividend payments, strengthens Philip Morris\u2019s financial position. Furthermore, the company\u2019s commitment to transitioning smokers to less harmful alternatives and its strong growth profile in the staples sector support the Buy rating, as these factors are expected to drive future growth and shareholder returns.\n\nIn another report released on February 26, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $175.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Irene Rosenfeld (born May 3, 1953, Brooklyn, New York , U.S.) is an American business executive, who was CEO (2006\u201317) of processed-foods giant Kraft Foods Inc. and, after the company\u2019s restructuring in 2012, of Mondel\u0113z International. Under her leadership, Kraft, already the largest food-products company in the United States , expanded its holdings abroad and radically reorganized the marketing of its vast array of snack and grocery brands.\n\nBorn to an accountant father and a homemaker mother, Rosenfeld grew up in suburban Long Island, New York. After a childhood active in sports and academics, she went to Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, where she earned three degrees in rapid succession: a B.A. in psychology (1975), an M.S. in business (1977), and a Ph.D. in marketing and statistics (1980). While at Cornell she married fellow student Philip Rosenfeld, with whom she had two children. After his death in 1995 she remarried but kept her first married name.\n\nRosenfeld started her career at an advertising agency and then in 1981 joined the marketing department of General Foods Corporation, a company with a long line of packaged and frozen products, ranging from Kool-Aid fruit-flavoured beverages to Maxwell House coffee to Oscar Mayer meats. Over the following 15 years she worked up through the company, managing a number of its brands. In 1985 General Foods was bought by tobacco company Philip Morris (now the Altria Group), and over the following decade it was merged with another of Philip Morris\u2019s acquisitions, Kraft Foods, a manufacturer of processed cheese that had also acquired numerous food product lines. In 1996 Rosenfeld was put in charge of Kraft\u2019s entire Canadian division, broadening her experience beyond the marketing of a single brand or type of food product. She also worked on integrating the biscuit products of Nabisco, purchased by Philip Morris in 2000, into Kraft Foods, and in 2001 she was part of a committee that prepared Kraft for its first public stock offering.\n\nIn 2004 Rosenfeld left Kraft for Frito-Lay, a maker of snack products that was owned by beverage company PepsiCo, Inc. She served as Frito-Lay\u2019s CEO and chairman for two years, during which time the company extended its product line by introducing a number of low-salt, low-fat snacks.\n\nIn 2006 Rosenfeld returned to Kraft, this time as CEO and then, following the company\u2019s complete separation from Philip Morris in 2007, chairman of the board. She immediately set about reinvigorating the company by introducing new products, entering expanding markets abroad, and reorganizing the selling of mature American brands. In 2007 the company acquired the biscuit operations of the French company Groupe Danone, and in 2010 Rosenfeld succeeded in an aggressive takeover of British confectioner Cadbury. She then moved to split Kraft into two companies, one selling grocery items in North America (operating under the name Kraft) and the other marketing snack products around the world (Mondel\u0113z International). The reorganization took place in 2012, and Rosenfeld became CEO of Mondel\u0113z. She remained in that post until her retirement in 2017.",

            "content": "The Jonathan Larson Project, now playing at the Orpheum Theatre, is an extraordinary musical journey that breathes new life into the hidden works of one of Broadway\u2019s most iconic composers. Conceived by Jennifer Ashley Tepper and directed by John Simpkins, this vibrant revue uncovers 20 lesser-known Jonathan Larson songs \u2014 some cut from Rent, others from unfinished works \u2014 all of which reveal Larson\u2019s raw talent, social awareness, and deep connection to the world around him.\n\nAnchored by a stellar cast featuring Adam Chanler-Berat, Lauren Marcus, Taylor Iman Jones, Jason Tam, and Andy Mientus, the production is more than a performance \u2014 it\u2019s a love letter to an artist who changed the face of musical theatre. Each performer brings their own distinct style and emotional depth to Larson\u2019s powerful yet often unseen catalog, illuminating themes of love, identity, and societal struggles with authenticity and heart.\n\nAdam Chanler-Berat captivates with his ability to convey vulnerability and introspection, finding the emotional core in Larson\u2019s introspective ballads. His delivery is understated yet impactful, especially in songs that delve into themes of longing and personal conflict.\n\nLauren Marcus brings a magnetic energy, seamlessly balancing the biting wit and emotional depth that Larson infused into his writing. Her fearless performance adds warmth to even the most cutting social commentaries. Her show stopping \u201cHosing the Furniture,\u201d shows comedic chops that make Marcus shine.\n\nTaylor Iman Jones delivers powerhouse vocals and commanding presence, making her standout moments feel deeply personal yet universally resonant. Her performance elevates Larson\u2019s more intense pieces, especially those centered on marginalized voices especially in the powerhouse \u201cLove Heals\u201d, which for me was the highlight of the show.\n\nJason Tam embodies the raw angst and passion of Larson\u2019s writing. With soulful vocals and deeply expressive moments, Tam embodies the restless energy of young artists navigating an unpredictable world.\n\nAndy Mientus, a longtime admirer of Larson\u2019s work, brings a grounded yet electric presence to the stage, especially in \u201cValentine\u2019s Day,\u201d that was cut from Rent. His emotional honesty shines through, particularly in songs that explore identity, love, and belonging.\n\nThe Jonathan Larson Project is more of a revue, but carries an undeniable narrative thread \u2014 a window into the gritty, chaotic world of the East Village in the late 20th century, where Larson\u2019s music thrived. These songs are snapshots of a world where sex, drugs, and political unrest were woven into the everyday lives of artists, activists, and dreamers. Each song feels like a conversation \u2014 sometimes defiant, sometimes mournful \u2014 but always deeply personal.\n\nMany of the songs reveal glimpses of themes later developed in Rent, while others stand as powerful standalone pieces \u2014 testaments to Larson\u2019s sharp social commentary, fearless exploration of complex issues, and his signature rock-influenced sound. The music is raw and unapologetic, carrying Larson\u2019s unmistakable urgency \u2014 a man racing against time to give voice to those often unheard.\n\nThe musical brilliance of this production cannot be overlooked. Charlie Rosen\u2019s expert music supervision and orchestrations \u2014 alongside co-arrangements by Rosen and Natalie Tenenbaum \u2014 deserve nominations if not awards. Their arrangements strike a remarkable balance between Larson\u2019s gritty, raw style and a deeply sophisticated musical structure, making each number feel vibrant and relevant.\n\nDirector John Simpkins allows the songs to give life, never overcomplicating the staging but instead letting the music speak for itself. The minimalistic yet emotionally charged production feels intimate and immersive, allowing the audience to connect deeply with Larson\u2019s words.\n\nByron Easley\u2019s choreography breathes movement into the songs, blending an energy that feels both youthful and rebellious while still connecting to the pulse of the New York streets that Larson so vividly captured. Meanwhile, Cynthia Meng\u2019s masterful music direction adds a dimension of timelessness to the performance \u2014 honoring Larson\u2019s original sound while bringing a fresh vitality to his forgotten works.\n\nFor longtime Rent fans, The Jonathan Larson Project offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a composer whose impact continues to ripple through theatre and culture. For those less familiar with Larson\u2019s work, it is a powerful introduction to an artist whose music dared to challenge societal norms and celebrate the beauty found in imperfection.\n\nMore than a tribute, The Jonathan Larson Project is a powerful reminder of Larson\u2019s legacy \u2014 a voice that still speaks with urgency, relevance, and compassion. It\u2019s a celebration of love, loss, and the relentless pursuit of truth \u2014 a fitting tribute to a man who taught us to measure our lives in love.\n\nThrough June 1 at the Orpheum Theatre, 126 2nd Ave.",

Phil Murphy on Saturday declared a state of emergency\u200b in Morris County in order to access federal funding needed to repair damages caused by ongoing sinkhole issues on Interstate 80. (David Giuliani/Patch)\n\nMORRIS COUNTY, NJ \u2014 Gov. Phil Murphy on Saturday declared a state of emergency in Morris County in order to access federal funding needed to repair damages caused by ongoing sinkhole issues on Interstate 80.\n\nOn Saturday, Murphy visited the section of Interstate 80 East in Wharton, which closed on Feb. 10 due to a sinkhole. During the visit, Murphy said he had requested emergency relief federal funding to repair damages to the highway and other affected areas, according to a news release. \u201cFor several weeks now, the residents of Wharton and commuters all across New Jersey have endured major delays and disruptions as a result of the sinkholes that have opened up here on I-80,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHe continued, \"While there is no immediate danger to the public, we will continue to do everything we can to help New Jersey commuters and families can get their lives back on track.\" According to the latest update from the New Jersey Department of Transportation, crews are continuing proactive drilling and grouting on the eastbound side of I-80 between Exit 34 and the bridge over Route 15 in Wharton Borough.\n\nOfficials said crews are working around the clock to stabilize the roadway and determine what is needed to design an effective repair. The lanes of eastbound I-80 remain closed as NJDOT crews continue testing and filling voids beneath the highway with grout, which helps reinforce the road's foundation. Last week, officials confirmed that a significant void was discovered under the center lane near Exit 34 as road crews worked to repair the initial sinkhole.\n\n\n\nWhile the area has been stabilized, NJDOT officials said the discovery \"will require a more extensive and lengthy repair than originally thought.\" \"Until a design is finalized, it is difficult to determine an exact completion date,\" officials said in a release.",

The Governor was joined by Superintendent of the State Police Pat Callahan, New Jersey of Department of Transportation Commissioner Fran O\u2019Connor, legislators, and local elected officials for a tour of the affected area, which was damaged due to a collapsed mine under the highway\u2019s eastbound shoulder near Exit 34. New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) crews have been performing around-the-clock emergency repairs and stabilization work to address the hazards. To expedite repair, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in Morris County, allowing the State to apply for federal funding which may be provided by the Federal Highway Administration if a road has suffered serious damage due to a natural disaster or another external cause. \u201cFor several weeks now, the residents of Wharton and commuters all across New Jersey, have endured major delays and disruptions as a result of the sinkholes that have opened up here on I-80,\u201d said Governor Murphy. \u201cBy declaring a State of Emergency in Morris County, we can take the first step toward accessing federal funding to help us to repair this damage. While there is no immediate danger to the public, we will continue to do everything we can to help New Jersey commuters and families can get their lives back on track.\u201d \u201cI want to thank Governor Murphy, the New Jersey State Police and local officials for their support and cooperation as we continue repair operations so we can safely reopen the highway,\u201d NJDOT Commissioner Fran O\u2019Connor said. \u201cSafety is our primary concern \u2013 for the crews working around the clock, for the motorists that have been impacted, and for the residents and businesses in the neighboring communities. As the proactive drilling and grouting continues, we are narrowing in on the area that will require a more extensive repair.\u201d \u201cThe closure of Interstate 80 has created significant challenges for motorists, local residents, and first responders alike, but the public's safety remains our top priority,\u201d said Colonel Patrick J. Callahan, Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police. \u201cWe recognize the tireless efforts of the New Jersey Department of Transportation and their dedicated crews as they work around the clock to make the necessary repairs and reopen this critical roadway as soon as possible. We thank Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s leadership and commitment to securing the resources needed to expedite this project. The New Jersey State Police will continue to support our state and local partners to ensure the safety and efficiency of travel throughout the region.\u201d \u201cI saw firsthand this morning the huge impact this highway closure is having on Morris County towns along I-80,\" said Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. \"This is a serious issue that we have to work together at all levels of government to fix and safety of our residents is our shared priority here. I will be advocating daily for all federal resources necessary to get I-80 restored to full capacity. As reconstruction efforts continue, I am also going to work with state and local officials to come up with transportation alternatives in the mean time. I think NJ Transit should offer residents in these towns some temporary incentives to use transit as an alternative for travel both east and westbound. I will be looking more into that this week. We need to help these communities get through this.\" \"The Governor\u2019s visit to the site today, along with the announcement of his request for federal relief funding, is welcome news to the residents, businesses, and commuters in this area. The Governor\u2019s request is an important step toward ensuring the NJDOT and the State Police have the resources necessary to make the critical repairs and restore normal traffic flow as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d said Senate Republican Leader Anthony M. Bucco. \u201cI commend the Governor, NJDOT Commissioner Connor, State Police Superintendent Callahan, and their staffs for their swift response and coordination with local officials to keep drivers safe and minimize disruptions for residents and businesses in the area.\u201d \u201cThis problem on I-80 has encumbered the lives of many, many people both locally here in Morris County and Interstate travelers,\u201d said Assemblyman Christian Barranco. \u201cI support the Governor's decision to seek federal funding to expedite the crucial process of minimizing the impact these sinkholes have caused, and I commend DOT's Fran O'Connor for his daily diligence in making sure manpower is engaged 24 hours a day.\u201d \"I have been working closely with NJDOT and local officials to push for swift and effective repairs to this critical roadway for our state,\u201d said Assemblywoman Aura Dunn. \u201cI appreciate Governor Murphy\u2019s efforts to secure emergency federal funding, as transportation is a necessity, not a luxury. Emergency funding for the sinkhole is essential to ensure public safety, repair vital infrastructure, and prevent further damage to our community.\u201d \u201cOn behalf of the Mayor and council, we would like to express our gratitude to those who are working on the structural repairs on Rt 80,\u201d said Wharton Mayor William Chegwidden and Council President Robert Norton in a joint statement. \u201cWe know it's a monumental task that will take time and resources to ensure integrity and safety to all our citizens. \u201cRoxbury welcomes with the Governor\u2019s decision to sign the executive order declaring a State of Emergency,\u201d said Roxbury Township Mayor Shawn Potillo. \u201cWe also appreciate the support of the New Jersey State Police who have been assisting our local Roxbury police with managing traffic flow. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority will be providing a presentation in Roxbury and discussing ways the state can provide financial assistance to local businesses impacted by this situation. We thank Senate Minority Leader Tony Bucco and our local representatives for their leadership during this challenging time, that communities are facing. \"I want to thank Governor Murphy for coming out to the site on Route 80 today,\u201d said Mine Hill Mayor Sam Morris. \u201cI also want to thank him for the Declaration of a state of emergency which makes this site eligible for federal funds. I think it's appropriate to ask the federal department of transportation to get involved in trying to solve this problem. This is a serious and potentially deadly issue and needs a permanent, well-funded repair. The Governor's actions today foster an effective path forward.\" \u201cFirst and foremost, I want to commend the Department of Transportation and everyone working on this critical site,\u201d said Mount Arlington Mayor Michael Stanzilis. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working tirelessly around the clock, in every kind of weather, to address this issue. I also want to express my gratitude to Governor Murphy for declaring a state of emergency\u2014it\u2019s a vital step toward finding a solution.

However, I know this situation has become incredibly frustrating for them. We need a solution, and we need it as quickly as possible.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate Governor Murphy coming to Morris County to meet with local elected and NJ DOT officials to see and hear firsthand the progress of the repairs on Route 80 eastbound,\u201d said Jefferson Township Mayor Eric Wilsusen. \u201cIt is also an opportunity for Governor Murphy to hear directly from local officials all the impacts this closure is having on our communities. We all hope that a solution is near and the interstate can be opened to full traffic soon.\u201d For a copy of Executive Order No. 383, click here.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.",

            "content": "STAMFORD, CT--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PMI) has been informed by its deconsolidated Canadian affiliate, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH), that the court in RBH\u2019s Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) proceeding has approved a plan of compromise and arrangement for RBH (the Plan). The Plan, as approved, will resolve all tobacco product-related claims and litigation in Canada against RBH and its affiliates, including PMI. The court also approved substantially similar plans for Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited and Imperial Tobacco Company Limited (together, ITL) and JTI-Macdonald Corp. (JTIM).\n\nAs previously disclosed, RBH\u2019s court-appointed mediator and monitor filed a proposed plan for RBH in October 2024. In January 2025, RBH filed an objection to the proposed plan, arguing that the proposed plan could not be approved because the issue of allocation of the CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM remained unresolved. Following a judicial hearing on the proposed plan, RBH, JTIM and ITL reached a consensual resolution of all outstanding objections to the proposed plan filed by the companies, including with respect to the allocation issue, resulting in plan amendments that, among other things, will permit RBH to retain CAD 750 million (approximately USD 525 million) in accumulated cash.\n\nAfter years of mediation to resolve long-pending tobacco product-related litigation in Canada, PMI is pleased that this legal process will now draw to a close, allowing RBH and its stakeholders to focus on the future.\n\nSelect Terms of Plan as Approved by Court\n\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM will pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately USD 22.7 billion). This amount will be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies\u2019 cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits, less the CAD 750 million that RBH will be permitted to retain (RBH Retained Amount), and annual payments based on a percentage of the companies\u2019 aggregate \u201cnet after-tax income\u201d (NATI, as defined in the Plan and excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full; 1\n\nRBH will be free to deal in its sole discretion with the RBH Retained Amount of CAD 750 million, including being free to transfer or distribute such monies outside of Canada;\n\nRBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, will obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or exposure to, RBH\u2019s combustible and traditional smokeless tobacco products based on conduct prior to the effective date of the Plan; related litigation would also be dismissed;\n\nAlternative product businesses (including heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and nicotine pouches) will be maintained separately from RBH's combustible business; and\n\nThe Plan also contains a number of operating covenants that would govern RBH\u2019s combustible business going forward until the settlement amount has been paid.\n\nImplementation of the Plan is subject to certain conditions precedent, including exhaustion of appeal rights and execution and delivery of definitive documentation, such as execution of contractual releases. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent, it is expected that the Plan will be implemented and become effective in 2025. The payment of any dividends by RBH derived from NATI after implementation of the Plan is expected to be incremental to PMI\u2019s operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS. Following implementation of the Plan under the terms approved by the Court, we expect that RBH will remain deconsolidated under U.S. GAAP.\n\nForward-Looking & Cautionary Statements\n\nThis press release contains projections of future results and goals and other forward-looking statements, including statements regarding expected financial or operational performance; capital allocation plans; business plans and strategies; the likelihood and impact of the Plan; and the likelihood of RBH remaining deconsolidated. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.\n\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco and/or nicotine use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of natural disasters and pandemics on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to introduce, commercialize, and grow smoke-free products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our smoke-free products performance.\n\nPMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.\n\nPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future\n\nPhilip Morris International is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match\u2019s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA. As of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates that 38.6 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 39% of PMI\u2019s total full-year 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI has a long-term ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

            "content": "Philip Morris (PM) has been informed by its deconsolidated Canadian affiliate, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc., that the court in RBH\u2019s companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act proceeding has approved a plan of compromise and arrangement for RBH. The plan, as approved, will resolve all tobacco product-related claims and litigation in Canada against RBH and its affiliates, including PMI. The court also approved substantially similar plans for Imperial Tobacco Canada and Imperial Tobacco Company and JTI-Macdonald Corp. As previously disclosed, RBH\u2019s court-appointed mediator and monitor filed a proposed plan for RBH in October 2024. In January, RBH filed an objection to the proposed plan, arguing that the proposed plan could not be approved because the issue of allocation of the C$32.5B aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM remained unresolved. Following a judicial hearing on the proposed plan, RBH, JTIM and ITL reached a consensual resolution of all outstanding objections to the proposed plan filed by the companies, including with respect to the allocation issue, resulting in plan amendments that, among other things, will permit RBH to retain C$750M in accumulated cash. Under the resolution contemplated by the Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM will pay an aggregate global settlement amount of C$32.5B, or approximately $22.7B. This amount will be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies\u2019 cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits, less the C$750M that RBH will be permitted to retain, and annual payments based on a percentage of the companies\u2019 aggregate \u201cnet after-tax income\u201d until the global settlement amount is paid in full; RBH will be free to deal in its sole discretion with the RBH Retained Amount of C$750M, including being free to transfer or distribute such monies outside of Canada; RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, will obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or exposure to, RBH\u2019s combustible and traditional smokeless tobacco products based on conduct prior to the effective date of the plan; related litigation would also be dismissed; Alternative product businesses will be maintained separately from RBH\u2019s combustible business and the plan also contains a number of operating covenants that would govern RBH\u2019s combustible business going forward until the settlement amount has been paid. Implementation of the plan is subject to certain conditions precedent, including exhaustion of appeal rights and execution and delivery of definitive documentation, such as execution of contractual releases. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent, it is expected that the plan will be implemented and become effective in 2025. The payment of any dividends by RBH derived from NATI after implementation of the plan is expected to be incremental to PMI\u2019s operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS. Following implementation of the Plan under the terms approved by the court, we expect that RBH will remain deconsolidated under U.S. GAAP.\n\nPublished first on TheFly \u2013 the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match\u2019s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA. As of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates that 38.6 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 39% of PMI\u2019s total full-year 2024 net revenues.

            "content": "Albany\u2019s celebration of $1 billion in commercial marijuana sales earlier this year must have been music to Big Pot\u2019s ears. \u201cLet us celebrate the individuals, businesses, and communities in cannabis who drive our state\u2019s economic engine,\u201d exulted Felicia A. B. Reid, acting executive director of the state Office of Cannabis Management.\n\nNo one would expect state health commissioner James McDonald to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with, say, Altria or Philip Morris USA to celebrate the sale of tobacco products. But here was Reid, backing drugs known to cause addiction, IQ loss, psychosis, and schizophrenia, especially in young people.\n\nComing from someone whose core responsibility is to ensure that New York\u2019s legal market protects public health and safety, Reid\u2019s statement was alarming. If the Office of Cannabis Management is applauding industry profits, it raises questions about the rigor with which it is carrying out its regulatory duties.\n\nThe upbeat tone of the announcement obscured the facts about how New York\u2019s legalization is going. State revenues from legal weed, for example, aren\u2019t all they were cracked up to be. Between fiscal years 2023\u201324 and 2024\u201325, the money from taxes, fees, and fines amounts to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of New York\u2019s massive $252 billion budget.\n\nProponents of the legal pot marketplace also note that 55 percent of retail sales are now from \u201cnon-flower products.\u201d This should immediately raise alarms with legislators and regulators, however. Non-flower products\u2013\u2013coming in forms like THC-laced candies, cookies, gummies, and vapes\u2013\u2013are more potent and more attractive to kids. A recent analysis of the latest medical literature found that recreational marijuana laws were associated with an increase in marijuana use among young people ages of 12 and 17\u2014hardly something to celebrate.\n\nDig deeper into the state\u2019s own reporting and it\u2019s clear that New York\u2019s attempts to create a regulated \u201cadult-use\u201d market have failed. Cannabis-related poisonings have continued to rise since legalization. Between 2019 and 2022, the number of marijuana-related poison-control calls involving children increased fourfold. New York City public schools data show a 10 percent increase in drug-and-alcohol-related discipline from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThose in charge have failed to acknowledge that the legal marketplace is worsening a drug and mental-health crisis. Their cheerleading is either willful blindness or a calculated omission meant to please investors.\n\nSadly, Governor Hochul, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, State Senator Jeremy Cooney, and others have bought Big Pot\u2019s big lie. New Yorkers should see through it for the con that it is.\n\nPhoto by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images",

Yesterday afternoon\u2019s price action suggested they aren\u2019t giving up on it just yet.\n\nMiddle market\n\nAs we take stock on Wednesday morning, it\u2019s worth zooming out and noting that 264 of the S&P 500\u2019s constituents, or a little over 52% of the index, are actually still up in 2025. Indeed, if you woke up this morning after being asleep since New Year\u2019s Eve, you\u2019d have a hard time guessing that we\u2019ve already had the \u201cDeepSeek freak,\u201d uncertainty over rising geopolitical tensions, and tariffs hitting the headlines this year, with the median S&P 500 stock up 0.7% in 2025.\n\nThe star of the S&P 500 Class of Q1 so far is CVS Health, which has jumped 45% since the start of the year, closely followed by Philip Morris International and Super Micro, which is doing the absolute bare minimum to remain on the market. Uber also joins the all-star lineup, ahead of Meta, which is the best of the Big Tech stocks, evading the pain of peers Amazon (-7%), Nvidia (-14%), and Tesla (-33%), which are all down. But the one company that\u2019s down deepest in the trenches is UGG and Hoka shoe company Deckers, which never recovered from getting stomped after its underwhelming Q3 update.\n\nSo, not everything is down this year... but if you are nervous about a sustained market drop, it might be helpful to know which stocks are most, and least, sensitive to a market crash. Here\u2019s a handy list of each, based on the last three years of data.",

            "content": "British American Tobacco BTI, recognized as one of the top three tobacco companies globally by both market capitalization and net sales, has further entrenched itself in the cannabis industry, finalizing a strategic investment of C$124.6 million (approximately $86.8 million) in Organigram Holdings Inc. OGI, a leading Canadian licensed cannabis producer. The completion of this three-tranche investment cements BAT's role as a major stakeholder in Organigram and highlights the increasing convergence of the tobacco and cannabis sectors.\n\nA Strategic Move Amid Market Challenges\n\nThe investment, executed through BAT's wholly owned subsidiary BT DE Investments Inc., marks another significant foray by a major tobacco company into the cannabis industry. As traditional tobacco markets shrink due to declining smoking rates and regulatory pressures, companies like BAT, Philip Morris International PM and Altria Group MO are seeking diversification in alternative markets, with cannabis proving an attractive prospect.\n\nAccording to Paolo De Luca, chief strategy officer at Organigram, \"Opportunities in the space have only improved with cannabis valuations at historically weaker levels and many cannabis and hemp companies unable to access cost-efficient growth capital despite fundamentally strong businesses.\"\n\nRead also: Zyn Changed Nicotine Forever \u2013 Are Cannabis Pouches The Next Big Thing?\n\nThe injection of funds into Organigram is expected to accelerate the company's international expansion and product innovation efforts. The financing will primarily be allocated to a strategic investment pool known as \u201cJupiter,\u201d designed to identify and support growth opportunities in the global cannabis market. Organigram has already deployed portions of this pool, including C$21 million invested in Germany's Sanity Group and C$2.7 million in U.S.-based Open Book Extracts.\n\nThe Growing Footprint of Big Tobacco in Cannabis\n\nBAT's move follows a growing pattern of investments by major tobacco firms in the cannabis sector:\n\nAltria Group , the parent company of Marlboro, invested $1.8 billion in Canadian cannabis firm Cronos Group CRON in 2018, acquiring a 45% stake.\n\n, the parent company of Marlboro, invested $1.8 billion in Canadian cannabis firm in 2018, acquiring a 45% stake. Philip Morris International agreed to purchase Israeli medical cannabis inhaler company Syqe Medical in 2023 for up to $650 million.\n\nagreed to purchase Israeli medical cannabis inhaler company in 2023 for up to $650 million. Imperial Brands invested \u00a375 million ($96.4 million) in Auxly Cannabis Group CBWTF and participated in funding Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies , a company focused on cannabis-based pharmaceuticals.\n\ninvested \u00a375 million ($96.4 million) in and participated in funding , a company focused on cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. BAT led a $37.6M Series B funding round in Germany's Sanity Group, securing a minority stake in 2022.\n\nThese moves underscore the increasing alignment between the tobacco and cannabis industries, particularly as regulatory frameworks evolve and consumer preferences shift toward reduced-risk products.\n\nGovernance And Influence\n\nAs part of the investment agreement, BAT now holds a 30% stake in Organigram's common shares and a 100% stake in its non-voting preferred shares. This arrangement ensures that BAT maintains a level of control without surpassing regulatory thresholds that could trigger anti-competition concerns. Furthermore, BAT has secured the right to nominate up to 30% of Organigram's board of directors, giving it substantial influence over the company\u2019s strategic direction.\n\nOrganigram's preferred shares, initially convertible on a one-to-one basis into common shares, are designed to increase in conversion rate by 7.5% per annum, a mechanism that allows BAT's economic stake in Organigram to grow over time.\n\nThe Future Of Tobacco-Cannabis Collaborations\n\nBAT's sustained commitment to cannabis signals that the tobacco industry sees long-term value in cannabis-related products. With global cannabis legalization gaining traction, particularly in Europe and parts of the U.S., these investments position tobacco giants to capture market share in a new, potentially lucrative industry.\n\nAs BAT and its competitors continue to navigate regulatory landscapes and consumer demand, the synergy between tobacco expertise and cannabis innovation will likely lead to the development of new product categories, including cannabis-infused vape products and medical formulations. The continued investment in companies like Organigram suggests that big tobacco is not just experimenting with cannabis, it\u2019s preparing for a future in which cannabis products could rival traditional nicotine offerings.\n\nRead next: A Tale Of Two Trumps: Clemency For Some, Death For Others In His Drug Policy Approach\n\nLead image via Shutterstock",

His family takes great comfort in knowing that he is now rejoicing with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nPhil was born on October 10, 1946, in Council Bluffs, IA to Phyllis Ann (Heitman) Higgins and Gail Edward Higgins, both of Council Bluffs. Phil was a big brother to Daniel (Danny) Henry Higgins, and though not by blood, he called Frank Padilla his other little brother.\n\nIn his youth, Phil was a gifted athlete and talented trumpet player. As Phil used to say, \"Those who can't do, teach,\" and so, after his prime years, he was overjoyed to share his passions by coaching Little League baseball and junior high football. He also played trumpet in \"Old Timers\" concerts in the Sheridan, MT high school gymnasium and in the praise and worship bands at church. Phil was a master of words and wrote many a story, testimony, poem, and very strongly worded letter to various politicians. Phil's great sense of humor and inability to know a stranger made him a light in the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nWhen he was just a boy, a photo of some mountains on his grandma's calendar gave Phil a fierce love for them. In his heart, he always knew he'd eventually live where he could be in the mountains. Born and raised an Iowa farmer and cattleman, an opportunity arose in the summer of 1977, and he moved his family to Twin Bridges, MT where he became a Montana rancher. An injury took the ranching away, but Phil found other careers, from banker to realtor. Most recently, he'd found his place at Murdoch's in Hamilton, MT, where he made many friends, including Kevin Costner, who, after a brief conversation, said, \"You know what, Phil? I'm going to remember you!\".\n\nPhil married his loving and devoted wife of nearly 37 years, Peggy Lee (Hircock) Higgins, on December 30, 1988. Phil and Peggy had many adventures and lived in many places, most of which had mountains, until their last move in 2023, which took them back home to Iowa.\n\nPhil is lovingly remembered and deeply missed by his wife, Peggy Lee Higgins; son, Daniel Shawn Higgins; daughters, Heather Lynn (Lance) Koss and Amberly Mae (Paul) Schechinger; grandchildren, Meranda Jean (Cass) Melin, Robert Lee Martinez and Shane Thomas Koss; his legacy will live on through his great-grandchildren, Rosalia Mae Melin, Eleuia Lee Melin, Isabella Ray Melin, Mariana Lynn Melin, Reynato Haart Melin and Bear Morris Apple.\n\nHeaven rejoiced as Phil was reunited in Glory with his parents, Gail and Phyllis, and his brother, Danny. What a wonderful Truth we know that even after he is dead and his skin is long gone, that in his new flesh he shall see God. (Job 19:26-27) and the dead will be raised incorruptible (I Corinthians 15:52).\n\n\"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.\" Revelation 21:4\n\nWith friends and family scattered near and far, we've decided to take some time before holding a service. Right now, we're focusing on holding our loved ones a little closer while we plan a celebration of life that Phil would have truly wanted. We're not exactly sure what that will look like just yet-except that it will definitely include his favorite, chocolate milk! When the time comes, we will reach out with details to honor and celebrate the remarkable life of Philip Gail Higgins.",

Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the rise of cannabis, craft beer, and vaping or the steady decline of soda and cigarettes. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 15 beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 0.6% below.\n\nWhile some beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.1% since the latest earnings results.\n\nMGP Ingredients (NASDAQ:MGPI)\n\nHeadquartered in Atchison, Kansas, MGP Ingredients (NASDAQ:MGPI) is a leading supplier of high-quality ingredients to the food and beverage industry\n\nMGP Ingredients reported revenues of $180.8 million, down 15.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.3%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a slower quarter for the company with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nMGP Ingredients Total Revenue\n\nMGP Ingredients delivered the slowest revenue growth and weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 1.3% since reporting and currently trades at $33.06.\n\nRead our full report on MGP Ingredients here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q4: Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD)\n\nBorn out of a complicated web of mergers and acquisitions, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) boasts a powerhouse beer portfolio of Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona, and local favorites around the world.\n\nAnheuser-Busch reported revenues of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 5.5%.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 25 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\n\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies\u2014those beyond their initial growth phases\u2014and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\n\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires\u2019 stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 22\n\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 3.41%\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a multinational tobacco company that also offers a wide range of related products. The company posted strong results for the fourth quarter of 2024, generating $9.7 billion in revenue, up 7.3% from the previous year. Operating income increased by 14.8% year-over-year, reaching $3.3 billion. The company\u2019s smoke-free products saw impressive growth, with shipments of heated tobacco units (HTU) and oral nicotine products surpassing 40 billion units in a single quarter for the first time.\n\nA major driver of growth has been Zyn, a nicotine pouch brand that uses nicotine powder and flavoring instead of traditional tobacco. Since acquiring the brand in late 2022, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has seen strong demand, with Zyn\u2019s sales volume jumping 46.2% in the fourth quarter to 183.8 million cans. The company anticipates continued expansion, projecting Zyn shipments to rise between 34% and 41% in 2025, totaling between 780 million and 820 million cans.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has also remained a favorite among dividend investors. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.41%, as of March 3. With 15 years of consecutive dividend increases, it continues to be one of the most attractive dividend stocks in the market.\n\nOverall, PM ranks 1st on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

To study her character, she read memoirs by sex workers, underlining sections of Andrea Werhun\u2019s \u201cModern Whore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also, again, just want to recognize and honor the sex worker community,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI will continue to support and be an ally. All of the incredible people, the women that I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting from that community has been one of the highlights of this incredible \u2014 of this entire incredible experience.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the role, Madison also lived in the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn \u2014 where much of the movie is set \u2014 to practice her accent and visit the kind of clubs that are depicted in the film. She also began to learn Russian \u2014 though her delivery did not need to be perfect for the movie \u2014 and took pole-dancing lessons. The role involved significant nudity and a number of intimate scenes, which Madison said was never daunting to her: \u201cI was always comfortable, and I also think because Ani was too,\u201d she told The Times.\n\nAt 25, Madison is among the youngest actresses to have won the award. She is the same age that Grace Kelly was when she won for the 1954 film \u201cThe Country Girl\u201d and that Hilary Swank was when she won for the 1999 film \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry.\u201d\n\nMadison had her breakout role as a teenager in the series \u201cBetter Things\u201d before catching Baker\u2019s eye as a Manson family member in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d and then the 2022 slasher film \u201cScream.\u201d\n\nHer performance in \u201cAnora\u201d drew rave reviews. In The Times, the film critic Alissa Wilkinson called Madison \u201cmesmerizing,\u201d writing that the role required her \u201cto go for broke, with elements of slapstick, romance, comedy and tragedy, along with dancing in skimpy or nonexistent clothing and throwing a couple of powerful punches.\u201d\n\nOther nominees in the category included Cynthia Erivo, who starred as Elphaba in the movie-musical \u201cWicked\u201d; Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the first openly transgender actress to be nominated for an Academy Award, for her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d; and Fernanda Torres, a standout in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a drama about a family torn apart by a Brazilian military junta.\n\n\u201cI also just want to recognize the thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful, breathtaking work of my fellow nominees,\u201d Madison said in her acceptance speech. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be recognized alongside all of you.\u201d",

            "content": "As states continue exploring options for the reform of Investor-State Dispute Settlement, the EU\u2019s proposal to establish a Multilateral Investment Court faces an uncertain legal and political landscape.\n\nInvestor\u2013State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) continues to be subjected to criticism, controversy, and an avalanche of proposals for reform. Envisaged as an instrument for protecting foreign investments, depoliticising investment dispute settlement, and ultimately encouraging investment flows, it has had mixed results in practice. A drastic increase in the number of investment claims \u2013 at the rate of more than 50 per year since 2011 to nearly 1400 known investment treaty arbitrations today, accompanied by a high cost of proceedings and mega awards, has prompted different policy responses by states. These span from modifying the current system, to introducing a new dispute settlement model, or abandoning ISDS altogether.\n\nIn Australia, in 2022 the current Labor government decided not to include ISDS in new trade agreements. However, ISDS has been gaining a fresh traction with four claims brought under earlier trade agreements by Zeph Investments, a Singapore-based company ultimately owned and controlled by Clive Palmer. While minimal details have been shared publicly, three of these claims relate to the refusal of a mining lease for the proposed Galilee Coal Mine in Queensland. These cases form part of a growing body of claims by fossil fuels investors against state measures concerning climate change and decarbonisation, which have sparked a renewed push against ISDS. At the same time, the proponents of ISDS have argued that investment protections are needed to secure private investment for projects supporting energy transition.\n\nLooking for a feasible compromise, states have been participating in the multilateral reform of ISDS taking place under the auspices of the UN Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) since 2017. The EU has been one of the key proponents in this reform, seeking to overhaul the problems of the current system through the establishment of a new international court specialised for the settlement of investment disputes.\n\nEurope and its ISDS debate\n\nMuch like Australia, which faced its first ISDS controversy with Philip Morris\u2019 claim challenging plain cigarette packaging legislation in 2012, European States have also been subjected to high-profile cases concerning state regulatory measures. Unlike Australia, the number of ISDS cases in Europe has been incomparably higher, largely due to a more expansive network of EU Member States\u2019 investment treaties and in particular, their participation in the Energy Charter Treaty \u2013 the world\u2019s most litigated investment treaty, from which the EU and many Member States have recently withdrawn.\n\nMany of these cases involved so-called \u201cintra-EU\u201d claims\u2014those of EU investors against other EU Member States. In 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that arbitration clauses in investment treaties between EU Member States, which form the basis of intra-EU claims, are contrary to EU law. While this has not stopped intra-EU investors from continuing to seek redress before international investment tribunals, leading to more legal uncertainty regarding the enforceability of these awards, it effectively signalled the end of ISDS within the EU. The political debate around desirability of ISDS between EU Member States has thus been resolved on a legal ground.\n\nAt the same time, under its bilateral trade and investment agreements with non-EU States (Canada, Vietnam, Singapore, Chile, Mexico), the EU has negotiated an Investment Court System\u2014a semi-permanent dispute resolution mechanism\u2014as a replacement for traditional ISDS model based on ad hoc arbitration. Since the solution with many bilateral standing tribunals seems impractical and costly, the ultimate goal of the EU is to establish one standing mechanism at the international level\u2014a Multilateral Investment Court (MIC)\u2014the proposal that the EU successfully introduced as one of the reform options in the UNCITRAL.\n\nWould a court resolve ISDS problems?\n\nThe EU has presented its proposal as the only option that systematically addresses all ISDS concerns identified by the UNCITRAL. The key element of the MIC are judges who would be appointed on a semi-permanent basis, significantly departing from the current ISDS practice where disputing parties appoint arbitrators deciding their case. While this might address concerns regarding independence of arbitrators, who are often perceived as pro-investor, it has raised new concerns about states\u2019 political influence over judges.\n\nThe EU proposal also envisages a second-tier mechanism, which seeks to ensure more consistency between decisions, and with the transparency offered by a court, alongside more accountability within the system, in line with the EU\u2019s vision of the rule of law. However, the core issues regarding the functionality of the proposed EU court remain unclear, including its jurisdiction, the enforceability of its decisions and the financing of the new international institution.\n\nIn many aspects, the fundamental premise of the reform, focusing only on the dispute settlement mechanism is flawed, since the main state concerns relate to substantive issues regarding the standards of protection for foreign investors and the impact of the system on sovereign rights of States to regulate in the interest of their citizens. As these are more politically charged issues, they are outside of the reform scope and only sporadically discussed in the UNCITRAL. Accordingly, many do not see the merit in establishing a new international institution that might not be able to address the core legal concerns of the current system.\n\nIs the time right for a new international court?\n\nIn addition to legal questions, the EU\u2019s proposal faces a precarious political landscape. For different reasons, the MIC largely remains an unwanted court for a range of stakeholders, both within and outside the EU. While the EU has a united stance with the Member States in the UNCITRAL, none of the EU trade and investment agreements introducing a court system have yet been ratified by the Member States. In addition, investment arbitration still features in new bilateral investment treaties concluded by EU Member States, so even the EU\u2019s own approach has been more pragmatic than coherent.\n\nIn the UNCITRAL, many States have expressed scepticism about the MIC, including the US, China and Russia. Developing states are more interested in solutions which can deliver tangible benefits for them, such as an advisory centre. Even those states that have bilaterally accepted a court system in an agreement with the EU (only five so far) have not strongly advocated for the EU\u2019s MIC in the UNCITRAL. The current geopolitical environment is hostile to the existing international institutions (e.g. WTO), which makes creating new ones even more complex. For the EU proposal to succeed in the UNCITRAL, it will require consensus of its members.\n\nNevertheless, the considerations of different aspects of the MIC have permeated formal and informal deliberations in the UNCITRAL, in parallel with other reform options, and without the discussion on the MIC\u2019s general desirability ever taking place. The Code of Conduct for Judges has been adopted, alongside the similar code for arbitrators, and deliberations on the draft Statute of the court are ongoing. The advantage of the EU\u2019s proposal is that it seeks to work alongside other options, including the traditional arbitration model. However, given the number of Member States\u2019 treaties (over 1400), the impact of the court might be more profound.\n\nWhile reform deliberations continue, the EU\u2019s strategy of using the UNCITRAL as a vehicle to promote its own vision of the ISDS reform persists, as does the uncertainty about its success.\n\nDr Ivana Damjanovic is a Senior Lecturer at the Canberra Law School and a Visiting Research Fellow at the ANU Centre for European Studies.

            "content": "Source: Felix Mizioznikov/Shutterstock\n\nOn January 16, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the sale of Zyn nicotine pouch products, citing potential health benefits for adult smokers. Nicotine, rather than tobacco, is the main ingredient in these smokeless products, which users place in the mouth between the lip and gum. In the U.S., individuals must be at least age 21 to purchase Zyn or any other nicotine product legally.\n\nThe pouches, which contain nicotine derived from tobacco, are small, dissolvable, and flavored. They were originally made by Swedish Match, a company acquired in 2022 by tobacco giant Philip Morris International (PMI). PMI markets nicotine patches as a modern, tobacco-free alternative to smokeless tobacco products like snus, chewing tobacco, or dip. In its 2025 announcement, the FDA noted that \"a substantial proportion of adults who use cigarette and/or smokeless tobacco products\" switched to Zyn pouches, justifying the authorization.\n\nTobacco-Free Branding\n\nContaining extracted nicotine but no tobacco leaf allowed Zyn to be marketed as a cleaner, more discreet, less-stigmatized option to traditional tobacco products like chew or dip. For example, Zyn doesn\u2019t have to be spit out. In addition, there is no strong odor, making it less noticeable in workplaces or social settings. Also, the white, dry pouches prevent tooth staining, a common concern with snus (moist snuff) and dip.\n\nUnderage Use and Abuse of Nicotine Pouches in the U.S.\n\nRecent data from the 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) indicates that cigarette smoking among high school students has reached an all-time low, with only 1.7% reporting current use. The decline is part of a broader trend of reduced use of other substances like alcohol, marijuana, and traditional nicotine products: 64% of high school seniors haven\u2019t used any substances in the past month, and more than 36% have never used them in their lifetime.\n\nAmong adolescents, nicotine pouches are one of the fastest-growing trends in nicotine abuse. Despite the decline in cigarette smoking, the use of alternative nicotine products, such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, remains a concern. The annual Monitoring the Future (MTF) study of drug abuse in school expanded its scope to include nicotine pouches like Zyn in yearly surveys. The 2024 MTF survey reported a notable increase in nicotine pouch usage among high school students. Tenth-grade use increased 1.9% in 2023 to 3.4% in 2024. For seniors, use doubled, from 2.9% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024.\n\nThe discreet nature of pouch use , appealing flavors, and nicotine delivery of products like Zyn may increase popularity among teens. Self-medication may put some teens at even higher risk. In 2024, 7.8% of high school students reported current e-cigarette use, making it the most commonly used tobacco product among this group. The data highlights a disconnect between the FDA\u2019s analysis of teen use and the apparent growing popularity of nicotine among adolescents.\n\nNicotine Addiction Facts\n\nNicotine addiction is driven by its effects on the brain's reward system. Addiction develops through repeated nicotine-related release of dopamine. Nicotine affects other brain chemicals, including glutamate, GABA, serotonin, and endorphins, reinforcing addiction. When a person inhales cigarette smoke, within 10 seconds nicotine enters the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Nicotine self-administration by smoking or inhalation is comparable to intravenous injection but without a needle. In contrast, Zyn and similar products release nicotine to the brain more slowly.\n\nOver time, increasing amounts of nicotine are needed to achieve the same pleasurable effect. The brain reduces its natural dopamine production, leading to a state in which nicotine is necessary just to feel normal. Nicotine dependence follows: Without nicotine, smokers experience withdrawal symptoms like irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and cravings. As nicotine levels drop, the withdrawal symptoms prompt cravings, driving repeated smoking.\n\nThe cycle of intake leading to dopamine release creates tolerance begetting withdrawal that stimulates craving and keeps smokers hooked. Treatments like nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the use of varenicline (which blocks nicotine\u2019s effects), and behavioral interventions can help break the cycle.\n\nHow Nicotine Pouches Addict\n\nThere are several reasons why nicotine pouches are addicting. First, nicotine in pouches is quickly absorbed through the mouth. This fast absorption leads to rapid nicotine and corresponding dopamine release. As with other paths to nicotine use disorder/tobacco addiction, nicotine from the pouches binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain, triggering dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, the brain\u2019s reward center. The reinforcement quickly leads to compulsive nicotine use and dependence.\n\nThe pouches are sold in different nicotine strengths, with some containing up to 6 mg of nicotine per pouch. For comparison, a cigarette delivers about 1\u20132 mg of nicotine. The high-strength pouches can provide a nicotine hit like smoking more than one cigarette at once.\n\nUnlike smoking or vaping, whereby a user takes breaks between cigarettes or puffs, Zyn use is more continuous; users can keep a pouch in their mouth for 30\u201360 minutes, leading to prolonged nicotine release and brain exposure, reinforcing dependence. Odorless and discreet, the pouches enable users to consume nicotine unnoticed in almost any setting. The reduced barriers to use can make quitting nicotine more difficult.\n\nPerceived Harmlessness May Increase Use and Be a Smoking Gateway\n\nZyn is addictive but less so than cigarettes or vapes because nicotine absorption is somewhat slower than inhalation. In this sense, it is a harm-reduction strategy for current adult cigarette smokers. Cigarettes are also extremely addictive, due to the fast lung-to-brain delivery and reinforcing effects of nicotine and associated behavioral rituals (lighting, inhaling). Vaping is the most addictive use of nicotine due to the rapid absorption of nicotine salts and high nicotine content in devices. Nicotine replacement therapies like patches and gum have much lower addiction potential because they provide nicotine in a slower, controlled manner.\n\nMany people perceive Zyn as a \u201csafer\u201d alternative to smoking or vaping because it doesn\u2019t involve inhaling harmful combustion byproducts. However, for teen users, the ability to use the product frequently and discreetly increases opportunities for self-medication and nicotine addiction risk. ADHD are twice as likely to smoke cigarettes and three times more likely to use smokeless tobacco. Evidence accumulated over the past decade indicates a robust association between ADHD and increased susceptibility to nicotine use and dependence among adolescents. ADHD is not , however, treated by vaping or other nicotine delivery. Teen non-smokers with ADHD or addiction could start with pouches and then move on to vaping or smoking.\n\nSummary\n\nAs with any nicotine product, prolonged Zyn use is addicting and leads to tolerance, requiring ever-higher doses to achieve the same effect. When they try to quit, users experience withdrawal symptoms like irritability, cravings, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, all of which drive continued use. In recently approving the marketing of 20 Zyn nicotine pouch products (Chill, Coffee, Cool Mint, Wintergreen), the FDA emphasized that they are authorized for sale but are not without risk and not considered \"safe.\" Recent reports indicate a rising popularity of nicotine pouches among teenagers, attributed to their ease of use and appealing flavors.",

This potential divestiture shows the company's continued commitment to evolving its portfolio, resonating positively with investors, especially as broader market sentiment shows lingering economic concerns. Within the same quarter, the company's earnings report revealed a significant net loss compared to the previous year, yet consistent sales growth provided a silver lining. The reaffirmation of earnings guidance for 2025 further emphasized its confidence, possibly supporting its share price during this uncertain period. Meanwhile, the broader market broadly decreased 1%, reflecting investor unease and external economic pressures, but Philip Morris's dedicated push towards future-focused products likely cushioned its stocks against the overall market downturns.\n\nDig deeper into the specifics of Philip Morris International here with our thorough analysis report.\n\nNYSE:PM Revenue & Expenses Breakdown as at Mar 2025\n\nOver the last five years, Philip Morris International's total shareholder return, including dividends, reached 149.40%. This performance reflects a combination of strategic adjustments and market movements. Key developments include the potential sale of the US cigar business, which echoes the company's pivot towards smoke-free products. This was complemented by higher quarterly dividends announced in 2024, indicating shareholder value focus even amidst a backdrop of fluctuating profit margins. Moreover, the company's revenue growth, with full-year 2024 sales rising to US$37.88 billion from US$35.17 billion, exhibits steady demand, despite recent financial volatility.\n\nRelative to the US Market and Tobacco industry, Philip Morris outperformed significantly over the past year, signaling investor confidence in its long-term strategic shifts. The company's capacity for resilience was further highlighted by its ability to secure a \u20ac1.5 billion credit facility in December 2024, earmarked for maintaining operational liquidity. Additionally, ongoing innovations like the launch of the IQOS ILUMA i device underscore Philip Morris's continued transformation efforts, aiming to enhance its product portfolio and future prospects.",

(PM) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 102\n\nLone Pine Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $778.47 Million\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) posted its financial results for the quarter ending December 2024, with net sales surging 7.3% year over year to $9.71 billion compared with estimates of $9.44 billion, thanks to strong growth from its products ZYN and IQOS. Moreover, earnings per share increased 14% year-over-year to $1.55 against analysts' expectations of $1.50 per share. Additionally, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share, or an annualized $5.40 per share, reflecting its commitment to shareholder value. These results reinforce Philip Morris\u2019 dominant position in the tobacco industry.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) projected stronger-than-expected profit growth for 2025, driven by the rapid expansion of its nicotine pouch brand, ZYN, and increasing demand for smoke-free alternatives. The company's shares surged nearly 10% following the announcement. As consumers seek alternatives to traditional cigarettes due to health concerns, PMI\u2019s heated tobacco device, IQOS, and ZYN have gained significant traction. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently granted PMI authorization to market ZYN in the country, citing its lower levels of harmful substances compared to traditional tobacco products. Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau emphasized that all three business segments\u2014ZYN, IQOS, and traditional cigarettes\u2014will contribute to growth in 2025, bolstering both revenue and profitability.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which distributes Marlboro cigarettes globally, expects adjusted annual earnings per share between $7.04 and $7.17, surpassing analysts' estimates of $7.03. The company also anticipates a significant rise in ZYN shipments to the U.S., its largest market, with an estimated increase of 34% to 41%, while IQOS shipments are expected to grow by 10% to 12%. Barclays analyst Gaurav Jain noted that PMI\u2019s projections for profits, sales volume, and revenue exceeded expectations, reinforcing investor confidence. Historically, the company has been conservative in its forecasts early in the year, leading investors to speculate on potential upward revisions as the year progresses, contributing to the stock\u2019s strong performance.\n\nOverall PM ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks to buy according to Lone Pine Capital. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

If the business ends up being fine and the dividend keeps growing, investors may look back a few years from now and say this was a phenomenally cheap stock.\n\nBut which is the more likely scenario? Is British American Tobacco a buy here? Or is Wall Street right about the tobacco giant?\n\nDeclining volumes in cigarettes\n\nThrough a long history of mergers and acquisitions, British American Tobacco owns some of the most storied cigarette brands around the world. Camel, Newport, and Lucky Strike make up its globally spanning product portfolio, which has generated heaps of profits every year. However, customer volumes are now under fire.\n\nVolume declines in cigarettes have begun to accelerate in many countries, especially the United States. While that's good for global health outcomes and celebrated by society, it's a headwind to British American Tobacco's business. Last year, combustibles volumes declined by 9% year over year, with sharp declines in the United States. Despite price hikes, the combustibles revenue declined by 4% year over year in 2024 in local British Pounds, although when adjusted for foreign currency movements and the selling of the Russian business, revenue in combustibles was flat compared to 2023.\n\nManagement is expecting more headwinds in 2025 with new excise taxes planned in Bangladesh and Australia, which will weigh on combustibles volumes. The business isn't going to zero overnight and will generate profits for many years, but it is a business undoubtedly in terminal decline.\n\nCan new nicotine products catalyze growth?\n\nBritish American Tobacco is well aware of the decline in its cigarette business, and has been planning for its future for many years. It has incubated or purchased multiple brands in new nicotine products, including nicotine pouches, heat-not-burn devices, and electronic vaping. Over the next five to 10 years, management expects this segment to drive most of the growth for British American Tobacco and eventually lead to growth in bottom-line profits.\n\nIn 2024, new categories revenue grew 8.9% year over year to 3.6 billion British Pounds, equivalent to around $4.56 billion in U.S. dollars. While any growth is good, these brands only made up 13% of overall revenue in 2024 and contributed minimally to profitability. Compare that to Philip Morris International, where close to half of revenue now comes from new nicotine products, and you can see that British American Tobacco is well behind in this nicotine sector transition.\n\nInvestors need to watch this line item closely in the years to come. If growth can accelerate and eventually replace the lost revenue in cigarettes, British American Tobacco's profit generation may extend further than Wall Street is expecting at the moment.\n\nWhy British American Tobacco's dividend can still grow\n\nEven though the business is not in the best shape today, I think British American Tobacco's 7.7% dividend yield is sustainable. In fact, I expect its dividend per share to grow consistently in the years to come.\n\nIn 2024, British American Tobacco generated $12.8 billion (in U.S. dollars) in operating cash flow and $10 billion in free cash flow. After paying dividends, its free cash flow was $3.41 billion. After years of high debt levels, the company's debt ratios have come down, which will allow it to grow its dividend per share along with buying back more stock (which it plans to do in 2025).\n\nAll this being said, British American Tobacco has plenty of room to grow its dividend payout in the next five years, even if its cash flow doesn't grow. With steady growth coming from the new nicotine products and healthy leftover cash flow after dividend payments, I believe British American Tobacco is a good dividend stock to buy today, despite the ugly numbers coming from its cigarette segment.",

            "content": "Tobacco farming in Malawi is a gilded prison\u2014promising wealth while silently ensnaring smallholder farmers in an unforgiving cycle of debt and exploitation. The leaf that powers Malawi\u2019s economy enriches multinational corporations, yet leaves the very hands that cultivate it in deepening poverty.\n\nFor over four decades, tobacco has been Malawi\u2019s economic backbone\u2014its so-called \u201cgreen gold.\u201d Yet, the 95% of producers who are smallholder farmers have seen little of that wealth. They are pawns in a rigged game, where contracts, loans, and corporate deceit strip them of agency and trap them in generational poverty.\n\nA 2024 investigation by the Sustainable Development Initiative (SDI), in partnership with global tobacco watchdog STOP, has laid bare the sinister machinery behind Malawi\u2019s tobacco industry. The February 2025 report, \u201cSowing the Status Quo: How Crop Diversification Is Failing Tobacco Farmers in Malawi,\u201d exposes how tobacco companies use sham crop diversification programs to tighten their grip on farmers rather than liberate them.\n\nThe Debt Trap\n\nTobacco companies present contracts as partnerships, but they are chains disguised as lifelines. These contracts lock farmers into loans for seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides\u2014debts that must be repaid with tobacco yields. What\u2019s sold as a win-win arrangement is, in truth, a system designed to extract maximum value from farmers while offering them the bare minimum in return.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a choice, but taking the loan is mandatory. It pulls us deeper into debt we can\u2019t escape,\u201d one farmer from Mchinji told SDI investigators.\n\nEven when farmers agree to grow other crops alongside tobacco, the contracts prioritize tobacco fields\u2014leaving little land or resources for genuine diversification. Worse still, farmers receive no market guarantees for alternative crops like groundnuts or maize. The result is predictable: unsold produce, unpaid loans, and an inevitable return to tobacco contracts.\n\nDiversification or Deception?\n\nCorporate giants like Universal Corp., Pyxus International, British American Tobacco (BAT), and Philip Morris International (PMI) trumpet their crop diversification initiatives as beacons of progress. But the SDI report exposes these schemes as cynical public relations exercises designed to maintain the status quo.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that tobacco companies oblige farmers to grow other crops without providing a stable market,\u201d said Maynard Nyirenda, Executive Director of SDI. \u201cThis means more labour, less income, and deeper reliance on tobacco\u2014while tobacco companies get to claim they\u2019re promoting diversification.\u201d\n\nThe same companies funding diversification programs are the ones buying tobacco\u2014creating a conflict of interest that perpetuates dependency rather than breaking it. The report accuses tobacco firms of using front organizations to funnel millions into research institutions, shaping agricultural policies that serve corporate interests at the expense of farmers.\n\nNone of the companies responded to requests for interviews.\n\nHealth Costs Ignored\n\nThe toll on farmers goes beyond financial ruin. Yohane Chikuse from Kasungu has grown tobacco for a decade, hoping to secure a better life for his wife and five children. Instead, he earns barely enough to survive\u2014and suffers from Green Tobacco Sickness, a condition caused by absorbing nicotine through the skin during harvesting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke, but I still feel dizzy and nauseous every time I work in the fields,\u201d Chikuse said.\n\nWhile tobacco companies polish their reputations with glossy CSR reports, the human cost of Malawi\u2019s tobacco industry remains largely hidden\u2014until lawsuits like the one filed in 2020 by Leigh Day, representing over 10,000 Malawian tenant farmers (many of them children) against BAT and Imperial Brands. The case, still ongoing, accuses the companies of profiting from forced and child labor on Malawian farms.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Complicity\n\nMalawi\u2019s government is no innocent bystander. President Lazarus Chakwera\u2019s 2020 State of the Nation Address openly endorsed collaboration with tobacco companies to promote crop diversification\u2014a move critics say further entrenched corporate influence.\n\nIronically, Malawi is a signatory to the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which obliges governments to help farmers transition away from tobacco. Yet, the SDI report argues that the government\u2019s willingness to let tobacco companies lead diversification efforts has sabotaged any meaningful transition.\n\n\u201cBy working with tobacco companies, we can help blend other crop types into the farmers\u2019 mix over time,\u201d Chakwera said.\n\nBut as long as tobacco corporations are at the helm, the only thing blending into farmers\u2019 fields is more tobacco.\n\nBreaking the Chains\n\nThe SDI report makes one thing clear: genuine diversification cannot come from the very companies profiting from farmers\u2019 misery.\n\nIt calls for a radical overhaul\u2014demanding that the Malawian government strip tobacco companies of any role in diversification programs and assume full control over helping farmers transition to alternative livelihoods. The report urges investment in infrastructure, extension services, and guaranteed markets for alternative crops.\n\nIf Malawi is to escape the chokehold of tobacco, the government must heed the report\u2019s call and learn from countries like Kenya, where the Tobacco-Free Farms initiative has helped farmers shift to food crops with tangible results.\n\n\u201cShifting away from tobacco won\u2019t happen overnight, but Malawi must act now to start the transition,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nThe Exploitation Must End\n\nTobacco has drained the lifeblood of Malawian farmers for far too long. Behind every exported kilogramme of tobacco lies a story of debt, disease, and dashed hopes. The global decline in cigarette consumption presents a chance to break the cycle\u2014but only if the government seizes control of diversification and prioritizes the wellbeing of farmers over corporate profits.\n\nIf Malawi\u2019s leaders fail to act, they will not only betray the farmers who have toiled for generations but condemn another generation to poverty.\n\nThe golden leaf has lined the pockets of multinational giants long enough. It\u2019s time to unshackle the hands that grow it.\n\nFollow and Subscribe Nyasa TV :\n\nSharing is caring!",

            "content": "It's nice to have cash automatically deposited in your investment account every quarter (or month, in some cases). If you pick wisely, the right dividend stocks can pay you passive income for a lifetime.\n\nTo help you in your search, Fool.com contributors recently selected three quality dividend stocks to buy right now. Here's why they like Realty Income (O 1.49%), Target (TGT 0.19%), and Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%).\n\nYou can count on this monthly dividend\n\nJennifer Saibil (Realty Income): Realty Income is one of the best real estate investment trusts (REIT) an investor can buy. It has an incredible track record, a high yield, and a solid, reliable business. It also pays a monthly dividend, an extra perk for investors who depend on passive income.\n\nRealty Income is a retail REIT, and although it's expanded into new categories in recent years, retail locations still account for nearly 80% of its portfolio. In the retail category, its top tenants are large brand names like Walmart and Home Depot. In other words, companies you can trust to pay the rent. Convenience stores and grocery stores account for more than 20% of the portfolio, and Realty Income boasts a 98.7% occupancy rate.\n\nThe focus on essentials gives it dependability, but branching out into some newer categories gives it diversification. Through acquisitions and new property purchases, Realty Income currently has 15,600 global locations, and in addition to retail, it also has tenants in the gaming and industrial categories. Management has deep sources of capital for new property purchases to keep growing the business and sustaining the dividend.\n\nThe company has paid a monthly dividend for more than 54 years, from before it became a public company, and it has raised it for 110 quarters consecutively. Its stock has been pulled down by negative market sentiment about real estate over the past few years, and at the current price, the dividend yields 5.6%, or more than triple the S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.13%) average.\n\n\n\nRealty Income reported fourth-quarter results this past week, and despite high interest rates and negativity about real estate trends, adjusted funds from operations increased 4% year over year in the fourth quarter and 4.8% for the full year.It's a stock you can buy today and hold on to forever for reliable passive income.\n\nA bad economy won't stop this Dividend King\n\nJohn Ballard (Target): Target has struggled over the past few years, which has sent its stock 52% off its previous peak. Its focus on discretionary items like apparel means it's not as resilient as Walmart or Costco Wholesale, but Target also offers a much higher dividend yield, with potential for growth.\n\nTarget has paid a dividend every year since 1967, and the strategy that has built that outstanding record is still intact.\n\nWhile its focus on selling a broad range of merchandise across apparel, home, and beauty products can hurt sales during episodes of weak consumer spending, Target can benefit tremendously from exclusive partnerships with brands when the economy is firing on all cylinders. Over the last 10 years, its return on capital employed has been roughly even or higher than Walmart's. This means Target has been more efficient at generating profits from its stores than its top competitor.\n\nAlthough Target's comparable sales growth has been lower than Walmart's, stock traffic has been solid. The problem is that customers are not spending as much, which contributed to a lower average ticket in the third quarter. Overall, Target's 0.3% increase in comp sales and a 2.4% increase in traffic last quarter is not bad in the context of a weak retail environment.\n\nConsumer spending will eventually rebound, which is why now is a great time to invest in Target. While investors wait, the stock is paying a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, or $4.48 annually. Target typically pays out around half its annual earnings in dividends. The current forward yield is 3.52% based on 2024 earnings estimates.\n\nThis tobacco company has reinvented itself\n\nJeremy Bowman (Philip Morris): Philip Morris might be best known for selling cigarettes, and on one level, that's true. Most of the company's business still comes from selling cigarettes in international markets, including brands like Marlboro.\n\nHowever, the company has successfully pivoted to next-gen products in recent years like IQOS heat-not-burn sticks, which it launched in-house, and through its acquisition of Swedish Match, which gave it ownership of the popular Zyn oral nicotine pouches.\n\nIn its fourth quarter, overall revenue rose 7.3% to $9.7 billion, with adjusted earnings per share up 14% to $1.55, largely due to the success of its next-gen products, which now make up 40% of revenue.\n\nIn oral smoke-free products, shipments of cans rose 25% in the quarter, while sales of heated tobacco units, which primarily consists of IQOS, were up 13% in the fourth quarter. Even Philip Morris' cigarette sales are growing, thanks to its exposure to international markets, where there's less pressure on smoking than in the U.S. Cigarette shipments rose 1.1% in the quarter to 152.8 billion.\n\nPhilip Morris's next-gen strategy should continue to pay off over the coming quarters as the company acquired the rights to sell IQOS in the U.S., and its newest IQOS device, ILUMA i, is delivering results in Japan, a key market, with a 13% increase in in-market sales.\n\nIn addition to emerging as a solid growth stock, Philip Morris has also long been a rewarding dividend payer, doling out most of its profits as dividends, and steadily increasing its dividend over its history. Currently, the company offers a dividend yield of 3.4%, making Philip Morris an excellent bet for investors looking for a combination of growth and income.",

That's very smart of you! Dividend payers are often underappreciated, but they can be powerful wealth builders.\n\nAfter all, a company has to grow successfully to a certain point where it has relatively reliable income before it will commit to paying shareholders a regular dividend. And such companies often grow in value over time, while their dividends grow, too. And during economic downturns, those dividends usually keep getting paid, even if the stock is in a slump. Though no dividend is guaranteed. Companies can and do cut dividends if they need to.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nHere are three dividend payers to consider for your portfolio.\n\nSomeone on a couch is looking at a phone and smiling broadly.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Altria\n\nAltria (NYSE: MO) used to be known as Philip Morris before it was split up into two companies, one focused on the U.S. (that's Altria) and one on international operations. The stock will certainly draw the interest of dividend seekers, as its recent dividend yield was a whopping 7.4%!\n\nIt's not a slam-dunk investment, though, as Altria faces some challenges. Primarily this: Fewer Americans are smoking these days -- hitting an 80-year low last year. (Only 11% of survey respondents had smoked in the past week, vs. 41% in 1944.) That hasn't been a secret, though, and Altria has been combating it by investing in cigarette alternatives, such as vaping products.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Altria will be a solid grower from here on out. The recent payout ratio of 61% suggests that the dividend is sustainable (at least in the short term), with room for growth, and Altria has increased its payout for more than 50 years in a row. So this can be a smart buy. Just plan to keep an eye on Altria's progress and prepare to jump ship if and when matters seem troubling.\n\n2. Realty Income\n\nHere's another portfolio contender -- with a recent dividend yield of 5.7%. Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT), meaning that it owns lots of real estate, charging its tenants rent. REITs are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable earnings as dividends, by the way.\n\nWhile most dividend payers pay out quarterly, Realty Income pays out monthly. It just reported its fourth-quarter results. Earnings met expectations, revenue exceeded them, and management projections were slightly below expectations. This was enough to send shares down a bit, which only boosts the yield. Oh, and Realty Income has hiked its payout for 110 quarters in a row, giving me confidence it will continue to do so.\n\nThe company's portfolio as of the end of 2024 featured more than 15,600 properties in all 50 U.S. states, the U.K., and six other countries in Europe. Its 1,500-plus tenants include companies such as Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's, and Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nRealty Income's stock looks attractively valued at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37, below its five-year average of 41.\n\n3. CVS Health\n\nCVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is a company you might think twice about investing in, as it has been facing some challenges in its pharmacy business and its Medicare Advantage plans. But right now, its stock is appealingly valued, with a price-to-sales ratio recently at 0.22, below its five-year average of 0.31. And its dividend yield is solid, at a recent 4.2%. CVS recently sported a payout ratio of 73%, meaning that 73% of its earnings are going to dividends and suggesting that the payout isn't threatened and may have room to grow further.\n\nThe company has turned in some promising results, lately, with its fourth-quarter featuring 2024 revenue up 4% year over year and cash flow from operations of $9 billion. If the company keeps improving, its stock will likely follow suit, which will shrink the dividend yield. So now is a fine time for investors bullish on CVS Health's long-term promise to consider snapping up some shares.\n\nThese are just some of many attractive dividend payers out there. So if you're not excited by these, you can likely find others. Don't discount the power and convenience of dividend ETFs, either.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "A deal for Dutch company Startupbootcamp (SBC) to take over Prince Andrew\u2019s former start-up business network, Pitch@Palace, appears to be in doubt.\n\nThe takeover, initially expected to provide the Duke of York with a financial boost, has not been finalized, and no agreements have been signed.\n\nThe BBC reported that despite an earlier announcement of an intended acquisition and discussions about funding from Bahrain, no transactions have been carried out. Sources cited by the BBC state that SBC is now reconsidering its involvement and wants to sever ties with Waterberg Stirling, an investment company registered in Bahrain in late 2024 by Dominic Hampshire, an adviser to Prince Andrew.\n\nPitch@Palace, launched by Prince Andrew in 2014, was designed as a platform for start-ups and entrepreneurs to connect with investors. SBC, which has been operating since 2010, supports early-stage companies and has investments in over 1,700 start-ups.\n\nIn February, SBC announced its plans to take over Pitch@Palace, calling it a \u201cfantastic opportunity\u201d to revive a dormant network.\n\nBBC sources stated that although meetings were held, including at Buckingham Palace, and joint branding efforts had taken place, no formal deal was reached. The initial takeover plan involved SBC working with Waterberg Stirling as a strategic partner, but this arrangement is no longer in place.\n\nThe BBC also reported that Adnan Sawadi, linked to Waterberg Stirling, presented the Pitch@Palace successor, Innovate Global, in China in 2024. During his presentation, he praised Yang Tengbo, who was later accused of espionage. Yang has denied the allegations.\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s finances have been under scrutiny, with questions raised about his ability to cover security and maintenance costs for the Royal Lodge in Windsor. The sale of Pitch@Palace\u2019s network was expected to provide him with financial support. Prince Andrew has been approached for comment.",

            "content": "Analysts suggest that value stocks tend to hold up relatively well during economic downturns. During recessions, investors often become more risk-averse and seek out stable, resilient investments, which frequently include value stocks. A report by GMO examined the performance of undervalued stocks during US recessions since 1969, using valuation metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-earnings, Composite Value, and a combination of value models within their Opportunistic Value strategies. While the firm does not recommend constructing portfolios based solely on traditional price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratios, the report found that even these simple metrics have historically performed fairly well during recessions. Notably, all value models\u2014except price-to-book\u2014delivered stronger returns during recessionary periods (including the COVID-19 downturn) than in non-recession months over the past 55 years.\n\nDuring the high-inflation environment of 2022, value stocks declined by 7%, whereas growth stocks saw a steeper drop of 28.6%. Furthermore, value stocks in the US posted their strongest relative performance against growth stocks since the dot-com crash of 2000.\n\nAn analysis of historical trends suggests that undervalued stocks have delivered stronger long-term returns. Research conducted by Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago and Kenneth French of Dartmouth College highlighted that stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the broader market index between 1963 and 1990, according to Oakmark Funds. Their findings also noted that growth investors often favored companies with exciting prospects, while value investors focused on more traditional, overlooked stocks. In the long run, value investors tended to see better results.\n\nIn 2024, several major tech companies surprised investors by announcing their first-ever dividend payments. Traditionally, technology firms reinvest billions annually to fuel growth, leading to the perception that they rarely distribute dividends. However, as more large-cap companies prioritize enhancing shareholder returns, a balanced approach\u2014focusing on both income generation and stock appreciation\u2014is increasingly becoming the norm. The market has been experiencing uncertainty in recent days, leaving investors concerned about its future direction. Given this unpredictability, a wise strategy is to consistently invest in high-quality dividend stocks when they are attractively priced, rather than attempting to time market fluctuations.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDividend stocks have underperformed in recent years, largely due to the rising hype surrounding AI-related investments. Despite this, analysts continue to favor dividend stocks for their strong long-term potential. Morningstar\u2019s chief US market strategist, Dave Sekera, recently shared insights on their future outlook and current valuation. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thinking that dividend stocks are a good place to be in the first half of the year, where you can at least capture some of those high dividends for the next couple of quarters. I also like that those stocks are going to be lower in duration. So if we do have interest rates continuing to climb, those would perform better. And of course, then we also have the unknowns of exactly what a Trump presidency is going to bring here in the first quarter and even into the second quarter. So I think that there is probably more downside risks of the market in the short term than upside risk. So therefore, I like a lot of these dividend stocks, which of course are more often than not in the value category.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create this list, we screened for dividend stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 25, as of February 26. Then, we picked companies from that list that have a reliable history of paying dividends consistently to their shareholders. We ranked the resulting list based on the number of hedge fund investors who held stakes in these companies, as per the Q4 2024 data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) the Best Affordable Dividend Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of February 26: 22.22\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a New York-based multinational tobacco company that also offers a wide range of related products. The company remained popular among hedge funds in the fourth quarter of 2024 as 102 funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in the company, up from 75 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $12.6 billion.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) delivered strong fourth-quarter results for 2024, reporting $9.7 billion in revenue\u2014a 7.3% increase from the same period the previous year. Operating income rose 14.8% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. The company\u2019s smoke-free segment performed exceptionally well, with shipments of heated tobacco units (HTU) and oral nicotine products exceeding 40 billion units for the first time in a single quarter.\n\nZyn, a nicotine pouch brand that uses nicotine powder and flavoring instead of tobacco, has been a key growth driver since its acquisition in late 2022. In Q4, sales volume for Zyn surged 46.2% to 183.8 million cans. Looking ahead, the company expects Zyn shipments to grow between 34% and 41% in 2025, reaching between 780 million and 820 million cans.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has also attracted investor interest with its strong dividend policy. As of February 25, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share, offering a 3.4% dividend yield. With 15 consecutive years of dividend growth, it remains one of the top dividend stocks on the market.\n\nOverall, PM ranks 4th on our list of best affordable dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

H John Voorhees III / H John Voorhees III\n\nDuracell has decided to move its research-and-development headquarters out of Connecticut from Bethel to Atlanta, Georgia. It is a decision that is being scrutinized not only in the northern Fairfield County town, but also across the state.\n\nThe battery maker is the latest of several prominent companies in recent years to decide to move a hub in Connecticut to another state. Each of those relocations has stoked worries among elected officials and business leaders that pressures such as the cost of doing business and worker shortages have made the state inhospitable to businesses. But a number of relocations to Connecticut during the same time frame have shown that the state can still be an attractive location for many large companies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWhenever an event like this happens, it\u2019s a reminder that we have to ask why the company is leaving,\u201d Chris DiPentima, CEO and president of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association, said this week. \u201cIt usually comes down to cost or workforce.\u201d\n\nConspicuous departures\n\nDuracell has not made anyone available for an interview with CT Insider since the decision to relocate the R&D headquarters was announced last week. But a company spokesperson shared a written statement this week that summarized the reasons for the move out of Bethel, where it has had a presence since the mid-1970s.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cOur decision to move was driven by the desire for better proximity to our manufacturing sites, along with the appeal of the universities in the Atlanta/Georgia area, which made the location ideal for local recruitment,\u201d the statement said. The company\u2019s operations in Georgia include a distribution center in the Atlanta suburb of Fairburn and a manufacturing facility in the city of LaGrange, near the Georgia-Alabama line.\n\nLego's main U.S. offices are located in this building on Print Shop Road in Enfield, Conn.

The three Republican lawmakers who represent Bethel in the state General Assembly \u2014 Sens. Eric Berthel and Tony Hwang, and Rep.

They expressed particular concern about electricity costs and property taxes.\n\n\u201cAny private enterprise looking to make money must surely consider its bottom-line costs. This is a company that has invested tens of millions of dollars in our region and our residents for half a century, and I\u2019m sure it did not take this decision lightly,\u201d Berthel said in a written statement. \u201cThis is yet another red flag regarding Connecticut\u2019s business climate.

Raghib Allie-Brennan, the sole Democratic member of Bethel\u2019s delegation in the state legislature, disagreed with his Republican counterparts. He said in his own statement that, \u201cthis was not a rejection of Connecticut\u2019s policies but rather an internal business decision.\u201d\n\nAllie-Brennan added in his statement that Duracell had qualified for a property tax break of $870,000 from the Georgia state government related to the relocation of the R&D HQ. In its statement, Duracell indicated that it has received state funding in Georgia, but it did not disclose the amount.\n\n\u201cWhile Duracell is grateful for the incentives that Georgia has provided since we established our manufacturing sites in the state, the local tax incentives were not a deciding factor in our move to Atlanta,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nFrontier Communications announced in 2023 that it would move its headquarters from this building at 401 Merritt 7 in Norwalk, Conn., to Dallas, Texas.

An attorney for Duracell told town officials in March 2023 that the company had about 100 to 150 employees based at its hub at 14 Research Drive, which is part of Berkshire Corporate Park.\n\nBased on recent conversations with Duracell officials, town leaders in Bethel are hopeful that a number of employees who work remotely will stay in Connecticut after the R&D move is completed.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThey reassured us that a lot of people are here and staying here,\u201d Bethel First Selectman Dan Carter said last week.\n\nGeneral Electric was headquartered at this property on Easton Turnpike in Fairfield, Conn., before relocating the headquarters to Boston in 2016.

PMI opened the headquarters in November 2022, after relocating from Manhattan. Tyler Sizemore/Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nA Lego spokesperson confirmed this week that the company still plans to complete the move by the end of 2026.\n\nIn September 2023, Frontier Communications announced that it would move its headquarters from Norwalk to Dallas, Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAlso in 2023, The Campbell\u2019s Co., announced that it would close its offices in Norwalk \u2014 a longtime hub for its snacks division, which includes Pepperidge Farm \u2014 as part of a consolidation of the snacks business into the company\u2019s headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The company informed Connecticut state officials in the summer of 2023 that \u201capproximately\u201d 44 employees, most of whom chose not to relocate, would be laid off.\n\nThe Norwalk offices shuttered at the end of last year, a Campbell\u2019s spokesperson said this week. Campbell's still operates in Connecticut, through its bakery in Bloomfield, where more than 375 employees are based.\n\nIn the past 10 years, the most-scrutinized corporate exit from the state has been General Electric\u2019s relocation in 2016 of its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston. The conglomerate\u2019s move ended a stay of more than 40 years in Fairfield.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts spends more on research and development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world,\u201d Jeff Immelt, GE's then-CEO, said in January 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn September 2021, financial-technology firm iCapital opened these offices in the Greenwich Plaza complex in downtown Greenwich, Conn. Christian Abraham / Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nThe uprooting of the headquarters tarnished Connecticut\u2019s economic reputation because GE was the largest company headquartered in the state. It ranked No. 11 in the 2016 edition of the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations.\n\nBut the jobs loss from the move was limited. GE laid off about 100 employees and transferred about 200 employees to Boston, compared with an in-state head count of about 5,700 when it announced the relocation.\n\nGE operations that stayed in Connecticut included remnants of its GE Capital business. The year before, GE completed the spinoff of GE Capital's North American retail finance business into its own publicly traded company, the Stamford-based Synchrony.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe remainder of GE has been split into three new publicly traded companies in the past couple of years. One of those firms, GE Aerospace, has offices at The Towers complex in Norwalk, where GE Capital was based.\n\nSoon after GE\u2019s move, Connecticut faced the prospect of losing another Fortune 500 firm, Aetna. The health insurer, which was acquired in 2018 by an even larger Fortune 500 company, CVS Health, had explored relocating its headquarters from Hartford to Manhattan, but it ended up staying put.\n\nShortly before CVS completed its acquisition of Aetna, the latter committed to keeping its main offices in Connecticut for another 10 years. But CVS/Aetna\u2019s future in the state\u2019s capital city has been clouded by more than 1,200 layoffs affecting positions connected to the Hartford offices that have been carried out or announced in the past year and a half.\n\nLoading...\n\nNotable arrivals\n\nWhile Connecticut has grappled with some significant corporate departures in the recent years, it has also attracted a number of large companies.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring Ned Lamont\u2019s six years as governor, the biggest corporate recruit has been tobacco producer Philip Morris International, which opened in late 2022 its main offices in Stamford, after relocating from Manhattan.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the Fortune 500 included PMI and 14 other Connecticut-headquartered companies. The Connecticut-based companies\u2019 3% share of last year\u2019s Fortune 500 firms exceeds the state\u2019s approximately 1% portion of the U.S. population.\n\nIn 2021, the year that PMI announced it would move to Connecticut, Lamont\u2019s administration announced several other corporate moves. They included the relocation of manufacturing-and-technology company ITT\u2019s headquarters from White Plains, New York to Stamford; the move of cryptocurrency conglomerate Digital Currency Group\u2019s headquarters from Manhattan to Stamford; and financial-technology firm iCapital\u2019s expansion to the state, with an office opening in Greenwich.\n\nIn the past few years, the state has attracted several other fintech firms. New arrivals from other industries have included Full Stack Modular, a company that designs and constructs high-rise buildings, which announced in 2023 that it would relocate its headquarters from Brooklyn, New York to Hamden.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe companies that have moved their headquarters to Connecticut in the past few years have cumulatively pledged to create hundreds of jobs in the state.\n\nSpectrum-services provider Charter Communications is headquartered in this two-building complex at 400 Washington Blvd., in Stamford, Conn. The company relocated its headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri to another building in Stamford in 2012. Tyler Sizemore/Hearst Connecticut Media\n\nAmid the corporate comings and goings of the past decade, Connecticut has struggled with jobs growth. At the end of last year, the state still had fewer payroll jobs than it did at its all-time peak in March 2008. That predicament reflects headwinds, such as low population growth since the Great Recession and post-pandemic worker shortages.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nSome leaders in the business community, such as the CBIA\u2019s DiPentima, take solace in the stabilization of the state government\u2019s finances in the past few years. They add, however, that there is still much more that the state legislature and Lamont\u2019s administration can do to make the state more business-friendly \u2014 particularly by tackling the state\u2019s high costs of living and doing business.",

            "content": "The consumer staples sector has outperformed the slumping market in recent days, with the XLP ETF thriving as a defensive standout amid economic fears.\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nThe stock market has hit a rough patch lately, with the benchmark S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) sliding nearly 3% in a single week. Most sectors have followed the downward trend, rattled by rising economic uncertainty and fear. Yet one corner of the market is defying gravity: the consumer staples sector. Represented by the popular Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLP), this group of steady performers has not only outperformed the broader market but also broken through previous resistance levels.\n\nIts defensive nature is proving its worth right now, and from a technical perspective, the sector looks poised for more gains. So, what's driving this resilience, and how can investors tap into it? Let's dive in.\n\nWhy Consumer Staples Thrive in Shaky Times\n\nWhen economic storm clouds gather and markets sell off, consumer staples often emerge as a beacon of stability. This sector includes companies that produce life's essentials, like food, beverages, household goods, and personal care products. People buy these items no matter how tight money gets, ensuring demand stays steady even in tough times. Unlike discretionary purchases like luxury cars or vacations, staples are non-negotiable, giving companies in this space consistent revenue and earnings.\n\nThis reliability makes consumer staples a classic \"defensive\" investment. When growth stocks stumble, and investors prioritize capital preservation over chasing significant gains, these stocks become a safe haven. Many also offer dependable dividends, sweetening the deal when volatility spikes.\n\nHistory bears this out: during the 2008 financial crisis, consumer staples weathered the storm far better than flashier sectors like technology or financials. It's not about blockbuster growth; it's about holding steady when everything else wobbles.\n\nHow to Gain Exposure to the Sector\n\nThere are plenty of options for investors looking to ride this wave of stability. Below, we'll look at a top ETF for broad exposure and two standout individual stocks that have led the pack in performance over the past year.\n\n1. Consumer Staples ETF\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSEARCA:XLP]\n\nThe XLP ETF is a go-to choice for those seeking diversified exposure without breaking the bank. With a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.09% and a dividend yield of 2.2%, it's both cost-effective and income-friendly. Tracking the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index, XLP holds over 40 of the biggest names in the business, including heavyweights like Costco, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble. Its broad reach and passive management make it a solid pick for long-term investors aiming to dial down risk while staying in the game.\n\n2. Costco Wholesale\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:COST]\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) has been a standout performer as XLP's largest holding at 10.7% weighting. Over the past year, its stock has soared more than 43%, and year-to-date, it's up 15.2% through as of Tuesday's close. The wholesale giant's following earnings report, due March 6 after markets close, could fuel further momentum. Analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) of $4.09, a 10.2% jump from last year, with revenue projected at $63.2 billion, up 8.15% from the prior quarter.\n\nCostco's knack for delivering value to budget-conscious shoppers keeps it thriving, even as economic fears mount.\n\n3. Philip Morris International\n\n[content-module:Forecast|NYSE:PM]\n\nPhilip Morris International (NYSE: PM) has been a defensive dynamo, ranked as XLP's eighth-largest holding with a 5.6% weighting. Its stock has surged 72% over the past year and is up nearly 31% year-to-date, making it one of the S&P 500's top performers. Beyond its robust 3.43% dividend yield, the company's recent earnings have lit a fire under its share price.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Philip Morris reported Q4 2024 EPS of $1.55, beating estimates of $1.49, with revenue of $9.7 billion topping the $9.4 billion expected. But the real spark came from its 2025 guidance: earnings of $7.26 to $7.39 per share, well above the $6.99 analysts had penciled in. While cigarette volumes dipped 2% in the Americas, a 33.4% surge in oral product shipments, led by Zyn nicotine pouches in the U.S., stole the show.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe consumer staples sector's resilience amid market chaos underscores its timeless appeal. Whether through the diversified lens of XLP or standout stocks like Costco and Philip Morris, investors have compelling ways to anchor their portfolios. As uncertainty lingers, this sector's blend of stability, dividends, and upside potential could be just what the market doctor ordered.\n\nBefore you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.\n\nOur team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.\n\nThey believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...\n\nSee The Five Stocks Here",

This regulatory milestone marks a significant step forward in tobacco harm reduction, achieved after a thorough scientific evaluation that demonstrated the product\u2019s potential as a better alternative to smoking. Addressing the significance of this authorization, Ricketts, Nikolaus President Global Commercial Oral Products noted: \u201cThis authorization from the US FDA is a strong validation of our commitment to tobacco harm reduction. This regulatory development sets an important precedent that could influence global policies to drive a notable reduction in smoking rates, contributing positively towards public health.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the importance of better alternatives to cigarettes in Pakistan, Ali Takesh, Managing Director, Pakistan & Afghanistan, PMPKL, said: \u201cProviding less harmful alternatives to adults that would otherwise continue to smoke is at the core of our ambition at PMPKL in line with Philip Morris International\u2019s global vision to be a predominantly smoke-free company by 2030.\n\nThrough this initiative, PMPKL continues to drive progress in tobacco harm reduction while contributing to economic development by investing in innovation and local production.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025",

The next stage will be implemented in April when the display of all tobacco and vape products will be banned at retail shops.\n\nSpeaking at a conference this week, JT International\u2019s (JTI Malaysia) managing director, Juliana Mohd Yahaya, was asked if JTI would be introducing Logic, the company\u2019s featured vape device, to the Malaysian market soon.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a hurry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at Malaysia\u2019s vaping industry right now, it is not [fully] regulated yet.

We are a responsible company, and we do not want to be selling our vape products to anyone under 18.\u201d\n\nUntil then, Juliana said JTI is more than happy to focus its efforts on promoting Ploom, its heated tobacco product (HTP), that was launched in Malaysia in January.\n\n\u201c[Ploom has] performed better than what we expected, I guess, also thanks to the fact that HTPs are not a new category,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at the industry so far, there has been only one choice [Philip Morris\u2019 IQOS].

            "content": "Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.\n\nGlobal dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nDividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market\u2014excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.\n\nThe sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHistorically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market\u2019s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) the Best FMCG Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that also offers a wide range of related products. The company reported strong earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024, with revenues amounting to $9.7 billion, up 7.3% from the same period last year. Its operating income came in at $3.3 billion, up 14.8% from the prior-year period. In addition, the company's smoke-free business saw a strong performance as quarterly shipments of heated tobacco units (HTU) and oral smoke-free products surpassed 40 billion units for the first time.\n\nZyn, a nicotine pouch brand made with nicotine powder and flavoring rather than tobacco, has remained Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)'s strongest growth driver since its acquisition in late 2022. In the fourth quarter, Zyn's sales volume jumped 46.2% to 183.8 million cans. Looking ahead, the company expects Zyn volumes to increase by 34% to 41% in 2025, reaching between 780 million and 820 million cans.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has been grabbing investors' attention due to its strong dividend policy. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 3.4%, as of February 25. It holds a 15-year track record of consistent dividend growth, which makes PM one of the best dividend stocks on our list.\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) jumped to 102 in Q4 2024, from 75 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is more than $12.6 billion.\n\nOverall PM ranks 6th on our list of the dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Knockwood of Gold River.\n\nPhilip was well known in the community of Gold River First Nation near Chester Basin. He was an avid guitar player and a history buff. In the summers, he was often seen sitting on his doorstep with his guitar and you could hear the beautiful music he played echoing across the river. If he was not playing guitar, he was seen on the Gold River train bridge catching pictures of the sunsets and sunrises.\n\nHe had many friends and acquaintances and those who knew him often sang praise to his guitar playing and his knowledge of political and world events. He will be missed by many.\n\nPhilip is survived by his brother Louis (Carla) Morris; sisters Theresa and Donna Morris, all of Indian Brook Sipkene\u2019katik; his long time friend and partner Janice Wells MacLean, and John Christopher Banks who was like a son to him. Phil had close family ties with his nieces and nephews and he will be missed by all who knew him.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at Gold River First Nation Community Centre at a later date.\n\nAs per Phil\u2019s wishes there will be no funeral service but will be handled privately by the family.\n\nThank you to R.A.

            "content": "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 26): JT International Bhd (JTI Malaysia), one of the three largest tobacco companies in the country, has no plans to launch electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or vape products in Malaysia, until regulations on vaping are fully in place, according to its managing director Juliana Mohd Yahaya.\n\nLogic is the current vape product of Japan Tobacco International.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a hurry. That\u2019s because we launched Ploom, our heated tobacco product (HTP), in Malaysia in January this year. That is something we want to focus a bit more on,\u201d she told reporters after revealing findings of the annual Illicit Cigarettes Study for 2024 commissioned by the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers here on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAlso if you look at Malaysia\u2019s vaping industry right now, it is not [fully] regulated yet. What we do not want is [for our vape products] to appeal to minors.\n\n\u201cOnce all of the regulations are in place and [the industry is] brought under control, that's where we will consider that (launching vape products in Malaysia). We always make sure that we do our part. We are a responsible company, and we do not want to be selling our vape products to anyone under 18,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Control of Smoking Products for Public Health Act 2024 entered into force on Oct 1, 2024 to regulate tobacco and nicotine products, including e-cigarettes. However, regulations under the Act will be implemented in stages, starting with the mandatory registration of tobacco products by April this year. And from April, a ban on displaying tobacco and vape products will also be enforced for retailers of general shops.\n\n\u201cAlso, if we have the regulations without the enforcement, our [vape] products may land on the hands of those under 18, and that's not good,\u201d said Juliana.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see whether the regulations will be enforced [well]. What is the enforcement going to be like? It's easy to talk about it, but in reality, whether that is going to happen or not, that's where the enforcement comes in,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted that Ploom had been well received among local users so far. \u201cIt performed better than what we expected, I guess, also thanks to the fact that HTPs are not a new category. If you look at the industry so far, there has been only one choice. But now, we have another alternative that we can give the consumers.\u201d\n\nPhilip Morris (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd was the first to launch its HTP, IQOS, in 2018.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "Lone Pine Capital's billionaire chief is cashing in some of his chips in two market-leading tech stocks in favor of a time-tested business with a 3.5% yield.\n\nIn case you missed it, one of the most-important data releases of the entire quarter occurred on Feb. 14. While many Americans were reminding their significant other how cherished they are on Valentine's Day, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) were filing Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA 13F is a required filing no later than 45 days following the end to a quarter that spills the beans on which stocks Wall Street's top money managers have been purchasing and selling. In other words, 13Fs provide an easy way to tell which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the full attention of Wall Street's billionaire investors.\n\nAlthough Warren Buffett tends to garner a lot of attention, he's far from the only billionaire money manager that can turn heads and raise eyebrows. Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel, who closed out 2024 with $13.5 billion in AUM, is a perfect example of another highly successful billionaire asset manager investors pay close attention to.\n\nIn 2024, Mandel, who tends to mix hot tech trends with stalwart businesses in Lone Pine's portfolio, was a notable seller of two high-profile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. At the same time, he more than doubled his fund's stake in a smoking-hot high-yield dividend stock whose growth rate is reaccelerating.\n\nStephen Mandel sent shares of these industry-leading AI stocks to the chopping block\n\nMost billionaire money managers have taken full advantage of the rise of AI. According to the analysts at PwC in Sizing the Prize, AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to the worldwide economy by the turn of the decade. This is a big enough addressable market that it can accommodate a long list of potential winners.\n\nDespite this ongoing AI spending spree and lengthy growth runway, Lone Pine's billionaire chief hit the sell button on e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) and customer relationship management (CRM) leader Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) in 2024. Spanning 12 months, Mandel sold 1,675,755 shares of Amazon, representing a reduction of 31%, and parted ways with 934,437 shares of Salesforce, equating to a 37% decline.\n\nOn paper, both businesses appear rock-solid. Amazon is incorporating generative AI solutions into its fast-growing and high-margin cloud infrastructure service segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS holds the leading global market share among cloud infrastructure service providers, and AI is expected to accelerate this segment's long-term growth potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce has been the top-ranked global CRM software provider for 11 consecutive years, according to IDC, with market share that totals more than its No. 2 through 4 CRM competitors on a combined basis. But what's particularly exciting about Salesforce is the company's focus on agentic AI -- i.e., using virtual agents as assistants that can work side-by-side with humans and other virtual assistants.\n\nOne potential catalyst that explains Mandel's selling activity is simple profit-taking. Lone Pine is a relatively active fund, with the average holding time for all 30 positions currently clocking in at six quarters, or 18 months. Shares of both Amazon and Salesforce have performed well in the current bull market.\n\nPerhaps the bigger concern is that Lone Pine Capital's chief is paring down his stakes due to valuation. Although Amazon's multiple relative to cash flow is notably lower than it was throughout the 2010s, it's not exactly an inexpensive stock at 29 times forward-year earnings. It's a similar story for Salesforce, which is commanding a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 28.\n\nWhile neither Amazon nor Salesforce are egregiously overpriced, the stock market is, collectively, trading at one of its highest valuation multiples when back-tested 154 years. The S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio (also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio)), has been hovering around 38, which is more than double its 154-year average.\n\nStephen Mandel has navigated valuation bubbles before. If the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests will happen at some point, shares of Amazon and Salesforce will almost certainly be weighed down.\n\nThe scorching-hot stock billionaire Stephen Mandel bought hand over fist in 2024\n\nIn spite of the stock market being historically pricey, Mandel's fund opened positions in 17 new stocks in 2024, as well as increased its stake in a handful of other existing holdings. Arguably no stock was purchased more aggressively in 2024 than tobacco behemoth Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%).\n\nWhen 2023 came to a close, Lone Pine was holding just over 3 million shares of Philip Morris. But when the bell tolled on Dec. 31, 2024, Mandel had overseen the addition of 3,462,581 shares, which increased his fund's stake by a cool 115% in this high-yielding stock.\n\nThe headwinds for tobacco stocks are well-known. As the public has become aware of the long-term dangers of smoking tobacco products, adult-use cigarette smoking rates in a number of developed markets have declined. In the U.S., for example, the adult cigarette smoking rate has fallen from the 42% range in the mid-1960s to an estimated 11.6% in 2022, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A market with a shrinking pool of consumers can be a challenge to operate in.\n\nThe silver lining for Philip Morris is that isn't bound to developed markets. It has operations in more than 180 countries worldwide, which means that if regulations become more stringent in a developed market, it can lean on faster-growing emerging markets, where tobacco often remains a luxury, to pick up the slack.\n\nTo build on this point, tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. Existing smokers have been willing to absorb sizable price hikes, which helps Philip Morris International offset cigarette volume weakness in select developed markets.\n\nBut what's really allowing Philip Morris to shine is its smoke-free business, which includes its Zyn nicotine pouches, as well as its IQOS heated tobacco system. The company sold 22% more Zyn pouches in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, compared to the prior year period, while international sales of Zyn pouches more than doubled. Meanwhile, heated tobacco unit shipments grew by 11.6% in 2024 to nearly 140 billion units.\n\nPhilip Morris International's ongoing shift to promote its smoke-free segment is helping to reaccelerate its sales and profit growth. Whereas some domestic tobacco stocks are struggling with declining cigarette shipments, Philip Morris is expected to deliver greater than 7% sales growth in 2026, with earnings per share projected to jump by more than 10%.\n\nThe icing on the cake for investors is the juicy dividend tobacco stocks are known to deliver. Philip Morris International is doling out $1.35 per share in dividends each quarter to its investors, equating to an annual yield of 3.5%!",

            "content": "Thomas Bailey Shropshire, a Past Grand Sire Archon of the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity (The Boul\u00e9), was a transformative figure in the brewing industry. He played a critical role in establishing Miller Brewing Company as one of the top brewers in the world. Shropshire was born on October 15, 1925, in Little Rock, Arkansas, to William Shropshire, a railroad worker, and Irene F. Bailey Shropshire, a schoolteacher. There were two other sons, Atty. Jackie Lamond Shropshire and Dr. William Bruce Shropshire.\n\nAfter graduating from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Little Rock in 1943, Shropshire served two years in the United States Navy during World War II. Once discharged from the Navy he continued his studies, enrolling at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, and earning a Bachelor of Science in 1950. While there he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. Shropshire completed a Master of Business Administration degree at the New York University School of Business Administration in 1951.\n\nShropshire began his career in 1952 as a sales representative for Philip Morris, initially working in Brooklyn before relocating to Chicago. He eventually covered much of Africa, taking on increasingly significant responsibilities for sales, distribution, personnel training, marketing and program development.\n\nIn 1961, Shropshire led distribution and sales for Philip Morris in West and Central Africa. By 1967, he had been promoted to the Coordinator of Marketing and Sales for Africa. In 1968, he became the managing director and CEO of Philip Morris in Lagos, Nigeria, where he trained over 1,000 Nigerian employees and established a 1,200-acre experimental farm to teach farmers efficient methods for growing and curing tobacco. This achievement made him one of the first African American in corporate America to reach that position. In 1972, Shropshire moved from Nigeria to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to work for Miller Brewing Company, then a subsidiary of Philip Morris.\n\nAfter Philip Morris acquired Miller Brewing Company in 1970, Shropshire became vice president at Miller, overseeing sales, distribution, marketing, strategic planning, and business development. He was pivotal in launching \u201cLite Beer\u201d and \u201cMiller Genuine Draft,\u201d significantly contributing to Miller\u2019s ascent as the second-largest brewer in the United States.\n\nIn 1982, Shropshire served a ten-year term on the Board of Trustees at Howard University, an HBCU in Washington, D.C. Three years later in 1985, Shropshire retired after serving as assistant to the president, senior vice president, treasurer, and board member of Miller Brewing Company and vice president of Philip Morris, Inc.\n\nDuring Shropshire\u2019s tenure as Grand Sire Archon of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, from 2000 to 2002, the fraternity witnessed significant developments under his leadership. He established a Public Policy Committee and initiated a study that resulted in a fraternity-wide strategic plan. His leadership and initiatives left a lasting impact on the fraternity. Throughout his career, Shropshire received numerous accolades, including honorary doctorates from Miles College and Talladega College, the Alpha Phi Alpha Distinguished Service Award, the B\u2019nai B\u2019rith Human Rights Award, the Lincoln University Distinguished Alumnus Award, and the NAACP Freedom Award for Business.\n\nThomas B. Shropshire married Jacqulyn Calloway, a civic leader from Kansas City, Missouri, and was the father of Terilyn Alyce Shropshire and Thomas Jr. He died on August 14, 2003, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 77.",

Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat, said he opposes replacing cigarettes, which contain tobacco, with nicotine pouches, noting that he wants to keep the flavored pouches away from young kids.\n\n\u201cThis product is distinguishable from other smokeless tobacco products because they do not contain tobacco leaf, rather contain nicotine derived from tobacco or synthetic nicotine,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in his bill memo, according to the New York Post.\n\n\u201cRegardless, nicotine in any form and in any product is a highly addictive substance. This legislation would align New York values in prohibiting enticing flavors for all nicotine products \u2014 including nicotine pouches,\u201d he added.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA BILL WOULD BAN SMOKING INSIDE CARS WHILE CHILDREN ARE PASSENGERS\n\nAssemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, also a Democrat, is introducing a companion bill to ban nicotine pouches in the state legislature\u2019s lower chamber, the New York Post reported.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot greater awareness about nicotine patches,\u201d said Rosenthal, who first introduced a version of her bill in 2020.\n\nLast month, the FDA approved 10 flavors of Philip Morris International\u2019s Zyn brand of nicotine pouches, including cinnamon, coffee, mint, menthol and peppermint. This was the first time the agency authorized sales of nicotine pouches.\n\nNicotine pouches are held in the mouth and dissolve between the tongue and gum. In contrast to cigarettes and chewing tobacco, Zyn does not contain harmful substances linked to risks of cancer or other diseases, according to the FDA.\n\nData also shows that a significant number of adults who used cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products switched entirely to Zyn, the FDA said. But Hoylman-Siegal is concerned about the product\u2019s youth appeal.\n\n\u201cOur bill is targeted at the flavored products most likely to be used by young people,\u201d he told the New York Post. \u201cWith our bill, we\u2019re trying to stop young people from getting hooked on favored Zyn products.\u201d\n\nHowever, federal data shows that fewer than 2% of high school and middle school students in the country use nicotine pouches. The FDA also put in place restrictions to prevent companies from marketing nicotine pouches to the youth.\n\nTobacco companies now turn to alternatives to cigarettes amid a dip in smoking rates.\n\nPOPULAR ITALIAN CITY OFFICIALLY BANS CIGARETTE SMOKING OUTDOORS\n\nNew York has already banned flavored e-cigarettes, although critics argue that the law is not adequately enforced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very similar to the issue involving flavored vapes,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said.\n\nBrian Erkilla, director of regulatory science at Philip Morris International, which produces Zyn, argues against New York banning Zyn and other nicotine pouches, saying that the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d include leaving 1.6 million tobacco smokers with fewer alternatives and that a ban could even lead to an uptick in smoking.\n\n\u201cThe most harmful product is the combustible smoking cigarette. We should let smokers know there are other options out there. We shouldn\u2019t take away their choice,\u201d Erkilla told the New York Post.",

It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates but full-year EPS guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nIs Boston Beer a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Boston Beer\u2019s revenue to be flat year on year at $391.2 million, improving from the 12% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted loss is expected to come in at -$1.33 per share.\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Boston Beer has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Boston Beer\u2019s peers in the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Coca-Cola delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 4.2%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 6.5%, and Philip Morris reported revenues up 7.3%, topping estimates by 2.8%. Coca-Cola traded up 6.5% following the results while Philip Morris was also up 10.2%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Coca-Cola\u2019s results here and Philip Morris\u2019s results here.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market has been optimistic as of late due to a soft landing. This is an economic situation where rate hikes successfully quelled inflation but did not send the economy into a recession. Furthermore, recent rate cuts and Donald Trump's triumph in the 2024 Presidential election have been tailwinds for the market, and while some of the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 2.5% on average over the last month. Boston Beer is down 9.5% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $292.77 (compared to the current share price of $230).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

            "content": "Photo: RNZ\n\nThe misuse of data, scamming, fraud, tax evasion and lax rules around lobbying are all contributing to New Zealand's drift down the global corruption index rankings.\n\nIt is another one of those world rankings that would not mean a lot to most New Zealanders.\n\nOur position on the latest global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is four.\n\nFourth in the world - not bad. But we used to be first - or first equal with Denmark - and we are now on a downward slide, overtaken for third by Singapore.\n\nAnd for trade, business and the economy, that matters.\n\nToday on The Detail we talk about the repercussions of being seen as lax when it comes to watchdogging issues that could lead to corruption.\n\nThey include the misuse of data, not being on top of stopping scams, obfuscation around government spending or who contracts are handed out to, bribery, fraud, tax evasion, shady lobbying, as well as government spending cuts that could remove checks and balances in the system and leave it open to abuse.\n\nIt is all happening here, and they are all contributing to a chipping away of our international reputation.\n\nPerceptions matter. \"Brand New Zealand\" is a key driver behind our export industry, including tourism. That brand has taken decades to build up, but could be torn down very quickly.\n\nA drop in the corruption ranking makes it harder for companies to trade or do business with us, affects the cost of accessing finance, which eventually trickles down to household mortgages, and also influences big multi-national firms when it comes to entering the New Zealand market.\n\nThe CPI ranking came out on 11 February, just a week before the release of the Public Service Commission's inquiry into how government agencies did or didn't protect personal information for the 2023 census.\n\nThat forced the resignation of government statistician and Stats NZ chief executive Mark Sowden.\n\nTransparency International NZ chief executive Julie Haggie says our drop in the CPI has been dramatic and we are now seven points behind Denmark.\n\n\"That's a fairly good indication that we're not going to get back up to the top.\"\n\nShe says that while our ranking is still good, and that we still have really good systems in New Zealand such as the Auditor-General and Ombudsman to protect us, there is a huge risk that we are not doing enough to counter the increasing threats from corruption, from both outside and inside the country.\n\nFor example there are no rules over lobbying; we don't have a beneficial ownership register to reveal who might be in control of trusts and shell companies; and there's no independent watchdog for corruption.\n\nTransparency International NZ says lobbing here is \"unrestrained and opaque\", with no professional standards, and no public register of lobbyists or the clients they represent.\n\nThe group sees this as a risk, with no accountability of how the private sector engages with one part of the executive wing of government, undermining the impartial and transparent advice provided by the public service.\n\nHaggie explains in the podcast how the CPI is determined, which includes looking at nine different surveys on public sector integrity.\n\nThat includes conflicts of interest, lobbying, and questions over the judiciary's ability to respond to appeals on things like procurement for example.\n\nTransparency International wants a national approach to corruption and has been arguing for it for a long time now.\n\n\"We haven't got a single agency like a lot of countries do... that's got the responsibility for strategy, monitoring and coordination.\n\n\"I'm afraid now we're starting to see the pressures that are on New Zealand, internally and externally... really put pressure on what we've been somewhat complacent about. We've sort of thought 'we're fine', you know, 'nothing to see here'.\n\n\"But we've said for some time 'no there really are risks and we're not really addressing them properly'.\"\n\nShe says in recent years we've seen prosecutions for corruption in roading contracts, bribes in transport infrastructure where large contracts were involved, big cases of tax evasion, immigration officials bribed, and pressure on our financial systems as people try to use and abuse it.\n\nJust yesterday a former Auckland Council building inspector was sentenced for taking $35,000 in bribes over home renovations.\n\nHaggie says we are also too lax about countering the increasing number of scams targeting New Zealanders.\n\nA lack of transparency in the lobbying industry, and government attempts to hide information worry environmental campaigner Adam Currie, from 350 Aotearoa.\n\nThe latest issue for him is that the Ombudsman had to force the Environment Ministry to release a personal wish-list of fast track projects from MPs that - for nearly a year - it had denied existed.\n\nCurrie says we are increasingly seeing the government pressure agencies not to reveal information they should be releasing, as well as lobbying groups pressuring the government to withhold information.\n\n\"This is just one example - it's happening over and over again,\" he says. \"Government agencies become black boxes of secrecy. It's a blatant attempt to keep New Zealanders in the dark.\n\n\"[There are] basic questions that we used to get serious answers to, and now they get treated as OIAs, and often take six months to respond. It's incredibly untransparent and it really is a marked change from what it used to be just two or three years ago.\n\n\"Quite often they'll say that documents don't exist that we literally know exist... you know, maybe we've got a friend that works for MfE or whatever that isn't able to provide the documents to us but lets us know they exist. We OIA them, they say they don't exist, and then six months later they appear magically out of the blue... it's incredibly frustrating.\n\n\"There's this global tide of disbelief in democracy and conspiracy theories and all this stuff, and the government should be pushing for transparency, showing they don't have anything to hide, engaging with people, building trust... this has never been more important.\"\n\nCheck out how to listen to and follow The Detail here.\n\nYou can also stay up-to-date by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter.",

The pouches are sold in two different strengths.\n\n\u201cThe data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA also questioned whether nicotine pouches truly are the rage among youths, pointing to government survey data showing fewer than 2% of American high school and middle school students used nicotine pouches last year.\n\n3 The FDA also questioned whether nicotine pouches truly are the rage among youths. AP\n\nIt would be a mistake for New York to ban Zyn and other nicotine pouches, said Brian Erkilla, director of regulatory science at Philip Morris International, which produces Zyn.\n\nThe \u201cunintended consequences\u201d include leaving 1.6 million tobacco smokers with fewer alternatives to kick the deadly habit, and could even lead to additional smoking, he said.\n\n\u201cThe most harmful product is the combustible smoking cigarette. We should let smokers know there are other options out there. We shouldn\u2019t take away their choice,\u201d Erkilla said.\n\nStill, Hoylman-Sigal pointed out that the FDA also warned firms not to market nicotine pouches to youths and that no tobacco product is safe.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents said a ban would hurt local convenience stores, and could even boost criminal trafficking in the black market.\n\n\u201cThe New York border with Canada has historically been a thoroughfare for criminal trafficking and the ports create increased vulnerability. Banning these products would just create a new cash crop for these dangerous criminal cartels that will exploit this lucrative market,\u201d said Jobe Dickinson, president of the Border Security Alliance.\n\n\u201cThe truth is law enforcement resources are currently stretched across the board and with every new policy that bans a currently legal product, they\u2019ll be stretched even thinner.\u201d\n\nThe New York Association of Convenience Stores said not only would removing these products from their members\u2019 shelves cost them business and hurt state tax revenues, but that driving these products to the black market may actually end up increasing access to children.\n\n\u201cThese nicotine pouches are a growing part of the sector and banning them would not only limit adults\u2019 access to a less harmful alternative to smoking, but would create a lawless Wild West with no rules on age restrictions, no quality control, less tax revenue for the state and will only hurt legitimate businesses that follow the rules. We need to enforce the laws we have,\u201d NYACS President Alison Ritchie said in a statement.",

            "content": "Even if you've only been investing a short time, you've likely learned the importance of spreading out your risk by diversifying your portfolio. Diversification comes in a variety of flavors, from gaining exposure to different sectors to buying stocks that have varying market capitalizations.\n\nIncome investors, in particular, can benefit from diversifying their sources of passive income with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that pay out more than the benchmark S&P 500's current yield around 1.2%. There are a variety of choices out there, but the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE 2.96%) iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY 1.95%), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU 1.92%) are all at the top of the heap for best ETF opportunities to generate strong passive income.\n\nPower your passive income streams with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund\n\nFor those eager to generate passive income and gain exposure to leading businesses in the energy sector, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund is a great choice. Mitigating the risk of investing in an individual energy stock, the fund attempts to offer investors a thorough representation of industry-leading oil and gas businesses to those that specialize in energy equipment and services, and consumable fuel businesses. Currently, it has a yield of 3% as well as a low expense ratio of 0.08%, so investors won't lose a significant portion of their dividends to fees.\n\nOf the 22 holdings in the ETF, oil supermajors ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips represent the top three positions, with a combined weighting of about 38%. Pipeline stocks also figure prominently in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund: Williams Cos. and ONEOK represent the fourth- and sixth-largest positions.\n\nGain exposure to a broad swath of industries with the iShares Select Dividend ETF\n\nInvestors who are committed to reducing the risks associated with a downturn in a particular stock market sector will find the iShares Select Dividend ETF particularly appealing. The fund, which currently has 98 holdings, is made up of U.S. stocks with a five-year history of paying dividends. Including stocks from a wide swatch of industries, the ETF also has stocks that represent varying market caps. The ETF has a yield of 3.6% and a moderate expense ratio of 0.38%.\n\nUtilities and financials stocks make up the most sizable positions -- 29% and 28%, respectively -- in the iShares Select Dividend ETF; however, tobacco stocks Altria Group, the top holding in the fund, and Philip Morris International, the third-largest position, actually represent the largest positions.\n\nWhile the fund prioritizes stocks that have records of paying dividends for five years, it's worth noting that the ETF includes tickers that have impressive streaks of hiking their payouts for decades. Altria, for example, has boosted its dividend every year for more than five decades, which makes it a Dividend King, while Chevron has paid an increasingly higher dividend for 37 years.\n\nPut the Vanguard Utilities ETF to work, without having to pay an arm and a leg in fees\n\nOftentimes, investors looking to supplement their passive income streams with conservative options will turn to utility stocks since they generate dependable cash flows. The Vanguard Utilities ETF, therefore, is a great candidate for those less concerned with growth and more focused on dependability. With the stated goal to \"track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the utilities sector,\" the Vanguard Utilities ETF includes a variety of utilities including electricity, water, gas, and independent power producers.\n\nRenewable energy stalwarts NextEra Energy and Constellation Energy represent the top two positions in the fund with weightings of 11.2% and 7.2%, respectively. Southern Co., with a 7% weighting, and Duke Energy, with a 6.6% weighting, follow closely behind, rounding out the four largest positions.\n\nThe Vanguard Utilities ETF has a yield of 2.9% and an extremely low expense ratio of 0.09%.\n\nIs now the time to ramp up your passive income with these dividend ETFs?\n\nInvestors interested in the opportunities that sector ETFs afford should certainly dig deeper into the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Utilities ETF -- both of which charge tiny management fees. On the other hand, those looking for exposure to a wider swath of industries will find the iShares Select Dividend ETF appealing.",

And additional investors include Group 11, Tru Arrow, Tau Capital and Aleph. Dream will further enhance its product capabilities and global market reach with this funding round.\n\nGovernments have to navigate complex environments that include legacy systems, cloud infrastructure, and hybrid architectures, all while managing vast amounts of security data. And at the same time, cyberattacks are becoming more advanced with attackers utilizing AI to outsmart traditional defenses and exploit blind spots in organizations that lack full visibility into their data and vulnerabilities.\n\nDream is rebuilding cybersecurity with a suite of proprietary AI-based models designed to think like both a defender and an attacker. And by fusing advanced posture management with AI predictive detection, Dream created a robust data ecosystem that not only anticipates but actively eliminates threats before they materialize.\n\nThe company was created by Sebastian Kurz, former Prime Minister of Austria; Shalev Hulio, a serial entrepreneur and former founder of NSO Group; and Gil Dolev, a cyber expert. And after leaving government and the NSO Group, the founders brought their firsthand knowledge to Dream and quickly earned the trust of global government entities responsible for national cyber defense.\n\nIn just two years since being founded, Dream has amassed over $130 million in annual sales in 2024 to governments and national cybersecurity organizations, proving its critical role in global cyber defense.\n\nThis funding round accelerates the development of Dream\u2019s Cyber Language Model (CLM), a first-of-its-kind family of Language Models specifically trained for cybersecurity operations. With this knowledge, Dream\u2019s customers can better understand their networks and their breach-points, without requiring any installation or integration, in record-breaking time, helping prevent sophisticated nation-state cyber-attacks on their networks.\n\nThe funding will also advance the company\u2019s expansion into additional markets, with a strategic focus on markets where cyber threats continue to pose significant national security challenges.\n\nAs part of the funding round, two distinguished industry leaders, Enrique Salem and Shlomo Yanai, will join Dream\u2019s Board of Directors. And Enrique Salem, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, previously served as CEO of Symantec and Chairman of Mediant. MG. (Res.) Shlomo Yanai is the former CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals and currently serves on the board of Philip Morris.\n\nThe addition to the board further strengthens Dream\u2019s vision of building cyber resilience on a national and global scale. And they will join current board members Dovi Frances, Michael Eisenberg and the founders of the company.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\u201cNever before has a company been founded with the primary mission of providing national cybersecurity protection for a country or a government. We founded Dream to deliver a solution that truly works for nations, specifically because it was designed with their needs in mind.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Shalev Hulio, co-founder and CEO of Dream\n\n\u201cSophisticated cyber-attacks on our critical infrastructure are increasing in both prevalence and complexity. During my time as Prime Minister I saw firsthand how these attacks can cause real human damage, and have the capacity to disrupt society at large. By founding Dream, we are on a mission to empower nations against what is the defining national security concern of our era.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Sebastian Kurz, co-founder and President of Dream\n\n\u201cThe Dream team has a proven track record of developing industry-leading security products and providing them to the most sophisticated customers, government leaders, as well as leading nation states. Dream\u2019s rapid growth in such a short time is a testament to their expertise, and I can\u2019t think of a better team to solve the fundamental problem of incomplete visibility and too many alerts.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Enrique Salem, partner at Bain Capital Ventures",

After all, building wealth is about removing money stress from your life. Otherwise, aren't you missing the point?\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThe hardest part might be finding the types of companies you can buy and hold while sleeping well at night, knowing you made the right choices. FHere are three winners you can count on. Each stock is an industry leader with a proven past and a bright future.\n\nConsider adding them to a diversified portfolio. These easy wealth builders will do all the work for you.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThere might be no better example of a wealth builder than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce and cloud computing giant has turned a modest $1,000 investment into over $2.3 million in under 30 years. Now, with a $2.4 trillion market cap, Amazon probably won't repeat those returns over the next few decades. However, Amazon still has a clear path to long-term growth.\n\nE-commerce still represents just 16% of total retail spending in the United States. Amazon (which accounts for 40% of e-commerce in the U.S.) will directly benefit as that percentage increases over time. Additionally, Amazon is the world's leading cloud computing platform, with an approximately 33% market share. Demand for cloud services continues to grow, and the additional tailwinds from artificial intelligence (AI) should only add to it.\n\nThese two industries represent most of Amazon's current revenues but don't dismiss emerging opportunities in digital advertising, telehealth, video and live sports streaming, and smart devices (Alexa). Amazon has demonstrated its ability and willingness to pursue growth in almost any industry. There's a good chance Amazon will continue creating wealth for shareholders, making it a no-brainer for virtually any long-term investor.\n\n2. Philip Morris\n\nMany investors think tobacco stocks are a dying breed due to the multidecade decline in cigarette use. However, nicotine is rapidly evolving from cigarettes to popular smoke-free products, like oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) has established itself as the leader of the new-age nicotine industry. Following its spin-off from Altria, the company spent years developing IQOS, which heats tobacco to create a vapor (not smoke). Then, Philip Morris acquired the leading oral nicotine brand, Zyn, when it bought Swedish Match.\n\nThe company has a diverse business selling Marlboro cigarettes in non-U.S. markets and a strong global portfolio of new-age nicotine products. Smoke-free products contributed 40% to total revenue in Q4 2024. Additionally, shipment volumes for both smoke-free products and cigarettes grew in Q4. Remember, nicotine is notoriously addictive, which gives Philip Morris another growth lever (pricing power) to pull when needed. The company may grow revenue faster than inflation for the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestors also get a famous dividend that Philip Morris has raised annually since splitting from Altria. At the current share price, investors can get a 3.5% yield, which should only grow as analysts estimate the company will enjoy high-single-digit earnings growth over the long term. This might be one of the best dividend stocks you can buy and hold.\n\n3. Axon Enterprise\n\nGreat companies evolve. Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON) started selling nonlethal weapons like Tasers and became a global leader in law enforcement technology. Today, Axon sells nonlethal weapons, body cameras, software, and cloud services to law enforcement and other emergency personnel worldwide. Modern society's need for safety for officers and citizens has fueled Axon's remarkable growth. The stock has turned a $1,000 investment in 2001 to nearly $1.2 million today.\n\nAxon dominates the body camera market but has penetrated only about 14% of the United States. In other words, body camera adoption is a big-picture growth trend with plenty of life left. Axon's body camera and Taser sales also create business relationships, making cross-selling its cloud-based software easier. The software is a potential game-changer for customers because it modernizes evidence management, reporting, and dispatching. For Axon, it creates recurring and profitable revenue.\n\nThe bottom line? Investors shouldn't feel like they've missed the boat. Axon generated over $1.9 billion in revenue over the past four quarters compared to an estimated $77 billion total addressable market. Axon still has tons of growth ahead in the U.S. and is just starting in Europe and Asia. The company must continue executing as it has, but Axon's current momentum could last for years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "The Peterborough Musicians Benevolent Association (PMBA) has received the largest donation in its history, but has done so with the heaviest of hearts.\n\nLynn Morris, a fervent and passionate supporter of Peterborough musicians who was a familiar face at live music events in the city, died last Monday (February 17) following a lengthy battle with cancer. She was 67.\n\nTwo days earlier, at the monthly PMBA blues jam fundraiser at The Social, headlining act Rob Phillips, cheque in hand, announced that Morris had gifted $50,000 to the association.\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nTo put that in perspective, the PMBA, which provides financial assistance to musicians in need, raised just more than $8,500 during the period from its January 2014 inception until August 2016.\n\nPeterborough real estate agent Jo Pillon, a member of the PMBA\u2019s founding board, says Morris was in palliative care at Peterborough Regional Health Centre on the day her donation was announced. Pillon recorded the announcement at PMBA with her phone and shared it with Morris.\n\n\u201cShe hearted it, so I know she saw it,\u201d says Pillon. \u201cThe show was dedicated to Lynn. He (Phillips) brought up the cheque, donated it to us, and talked a little bit about the PMBA and what we do. I recorded the whole thing and sent it to Lynn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours with her earlier on the day of the show,\u201d adds Pillon. \u201cWe had a really good visit. I felt good about being able to say goodbye to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a fighter, for sure, but during her recovery from chemotherapy and radiation treatments, she fell at home and broke her hip. She was hospitalized again for hip surgery. She rallied from that and, even though it was difficult for her, she still came out to PMBA events, sometimes on her own.\u201d\n\nMorris asked Pillon to organize her celebration of life and she\u2019s in the process of doing just that, with help from Al Black and Phillips.

She picked out what she wanted. I expect a fair number of people will come out that day.\u201d\n\nAs a lasting tribute to Morris, Pillon says an award presented annually by the PMBA to the Peterborough Folk Festival\u2019s Emerging Artist will be renamed the Lynn Morris Memorial Award.\n\nMorris\u2019 love of music, and those who perform it, was rooted in her relationship with the late Al Kirkcaldy. He produced and hosted Blue in the Face on Trent Radio for 15 years, and brought a number of top blues acts to Peterborough before he died of cancer in February 2009.\n\nBinding Pillon\u2019s more than 30 years of friendship with Morris was the fact that she too lost her partner prematurely, when singer and keyboardist Phil \u2018Mr. Deluxe\u2019 Marshall died suddenly in December 2013.\n\nWanting to keep alive Marshall\u2019s tradition of helping musicians in need, she approached Don McBride, Norm Kastner, former Pig\u2019s Ear Tavern owner John Punter, and Black to help her establish the PMBA. Debuting in January 2014, the monthly jam was initially held at the Pig\u2019s Ear before moving, first to Dr. J\u2019s BBQ and Brews, and most recently to The Social.\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nMorris was also a regular patron of the weekly Sunday Blues Jam at Jethro\u2019s on Hunter Street West. In November 2023, she was quoted in a feature article on the jam published by kawarthaNOW.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the calibre of the entertainment that brings me out,\u201d she said, adding \u201cYou never know who\u2019s going to show up.\u201d\n\nAs for Pillon, she is sad that her friend is gone but knows Morris be there in spirit at her celebration of life.\n\n\u201cShe was a strong personality \u2014 she knew what she wanted and she knew what she liked, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to tell people. I\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d",

What I want to emphasize today is that according to trade data and news articles in the Philippines, most non-compliant cigarettes in the Philippines originate from ASEAN countries and India, and from China for non-compliant e-cigarettes,\u201d said Van Dooren.\n\nHe outlined key recommendations, including compliance with destination market regulations, harmonization of transit country regulations, leveraging international trade agreements, and expanding cooperation beyond customs authorities.\n\n\u201cAn export without a corresponding import should trigger international cooperation,\u201d Van Dooren said, as he called on ASEAN nations to adopt a shared responsibility framework. He also emphasized using platforms like the World Customs Organization and World Trade Organization to facilitate enforcement.\n\nVan Dooren noted that the Philippines has implemented several measures, including a Bureau of Internal Revenue whitelist of approved manufacturers, importers, exporters, and brands; a temporary ban on online sales of e-cigarettes; and amendments to the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Bill to include tobacco products.\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nDespite these efforts, illicit trade persists due to high demand and price gaps between legal and illegal products. \u201cIt\u2019s really about supply and demand\u2014once there is demand, there\u2019ll be supply,\u201d Van Dooren said.\n\nREAD: Tobacco industry regulator ups fight vs illegal trade with int\u2019l summit\n\nArticle continues after this advertisement\n\nAustralian security expert Rohan Pike, who has studied illicit tobacco markets globally, echoed this view. In a May 2024 interview with ABC News, he pointed out that Australia\u2019s high tobacco prices have fueled a black market dominated by organized crime.\n\n\u201cThe number one driver of the problem is the enormous price of tobacco,\u201d Pike said, noting that even law-abiding citizens turn to illicit products when prices reach extreme levels. Speaking at the summit, Pike emphasized that government action should not rely on seizures alone. \u201cSimply seizing tobacco and illicit products is not nearly enough. Seizures have no relevance whatsoever in stopping an illicit market,\u201d he said.\n\nNTA Administrator Belinda Sanchez also cited the need for a holistic approach. \u201cThe increasing illicit trade in tobacco is a growing concern, undermining our efforts and threatening the livelihoods of countless individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a holistic approach to tackle this problem, one that addresses not just the symptoms but also the root causes. A multifaceted approach that combines regulation, education, and community engagement.\u201d\n\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

The company\u2019s leadership is optimistic about the sustained growth of its smoke-free portfolio, which includes products like IQOS and Zyn. This growth is expected to be driven by the international success of IQOS, the robust expansion of Zyn, and the anticipated launch of IQOS in the U.S., positioning Philip Morris as a standout in the consumer packaged goods sector.\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s smoke-free revenue has significantly increased, reflecting progress towards its goal of generating two-thirds of its revenue from smoke-free products by 2030. The profitability of these smoke-free products has also seen an increase, outpacing traditional combustible products. Despite current supply constraints, Philip Morris remains confident about Zyn\u2019s growth potential in the U.S., highlighting an expanding market opportunity. Serotta\u2019s confidence in the company\u2019s ability to meet its financial targets through 2026 underpins the Buy rating.\n\nSerotta covers the Consumer Defensive sector, focusing on stocks such as Celsius Holdings, Philip Morris, and Altria Group. According to TipRanks, Serotta has an average return of -10.4% and a 47.83% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released on February 17, J.P.

            "content": "Yesterday, Philip Morris International participated in the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference in Orlando, Florida. Chief Executive Officer Jacek Olczak and Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau spoke about the company\u2019s work toward a smoke-free future, current financial models, and future opportunities.\n\n(Some quotes were edited for brevity and clarity.) Highlights included:\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nWorking toward a smoke-free company\n\n\u201cWe have been quite successful for the first 10 years of the transformations and our quest to become predominantly a smoke-free company. A way to look at what we achieved is [comparing] Marlboro International, which is by far the biggest premium brand in the category. Two years ago in 2023, IQOS for the first time surpassed the revenues of Marlboro and last year exceeded $11 billion. If we take this from that perspective, it took Philip Morris International about 60 or 70 years to get Marlboro to that level, and IQOS, our heat-not-burn brand, has managed to get to that level of performance in roughly 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean for us when we set this aspirational target of having two-thirds of our revenue come from smoke-free products by 2030? Obviously, it\u2019s a nice number that looks very nice on a PowerPoint, but the reality is that unless we become a majority smoke-free company, country-by-country, market-by-market, while we operate\u2026 the miracle will not happen at the group consolidated level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some countries in the world that despite the science and knowledge and evidence about the new products in terms of the risk profile versus cigarettes, they will not ban cigarettes. But they [essentially] will ban the smoke-free product by allowing cigarettes to continue.\u201d\n\nZYN, the company\u2019s acclaimed oral nicotine pouch\n\n\u201cZYN in the U.S. is essentially approaching $2 billion in revenues. However, it\u2019s especially exciting for us that ZYN today is the No. 4 nicotine brand as of last quarter, and definitely is the No. 1 smoke-free brand on the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nNicotine and the FDA\n\n\u201cThe FDA and others should finally start clarifying what is nicotine. Maybe we don\u2019t wait for FDA clarification. This is what we say about nicotine, and I am not saying what we know, we are just repeating what is known to the public health organizations including the FDA and many other reputable institutions: Nicotine is addictive and, obviously, is not risk-free, but it\u2019s not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything else that you find in tobacco smoke is bad, but it\u2019s not the nicotine. Now historically, because we only knew that nicotine can be consumed from cigarettes, nobody had to pay attention to the details or accuracy of the language and whether you call it nicotine or cigarette or smoking, there was not much difference. But over the last 10 years, this has become the fundamental difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing, and I will be repeating this until we succeed, nicotine doesn\u2019t cause cancer. And this is not PMI research. This is research that was done over the last 60 or 70 years when any public authority in the world was looking into cigarettes and the harm caused by cigarettes. And nobody has come up with any conclusion even close that nicotine causes harm and definitively not causes cancer. So that\u2019s the starting point and the industry, and definitely PMI, is going in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Nicotine products] have no reason to be given to kids. So we, and Swedish Match, stand very strongly behind responsible sales practices, which go into the product design flavors, et cetera.\u201d\n\nFuture of the industry\n\n\u201cI think the future will be more complicated, but it will actually create more opportunities. The smokers will not go away. They\u2019re actually looking at these products from the repertoire perspective, because all of these products deliver a different opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the best strategy one can have is to actually keep on with the pace of developing these products and offering them to the consumers without spending too much time [wondering which] one category will win one versus the others.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nRevenue growth\n\n\u201cLet me start with a summary of our best-in-class growth and return. The first element is we are a strong growth company in terms of top-line with three drivers. The first one we talk about is growing volumes. If we achieve our objective of growing volume again in 2025, it will be five years in a row of growth in volume. It\u2019s a total change of paradigm for the nicotine industry. Second is price increase, and you have seen over the last two years we\u2019ve been growing and increasing our prices. First on combustible of course, but also on the smoke-free portfolio where we have started to post some nice price increases. Third is the very positive mixed impact that is coming from the growth of our smoke-free portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I think is super important is the mix impact and understanding of why the growth on smoke-free products is a very positive element for our growth, both at the top-line level and at the margin progression as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we are spending a lot of time on AI and what AI can mean for us in terms of notably saving on our back-office cost. We believe that AI is pervasive to the organization. To be clear, AI will have a lot of impact in the way we connect with the consumer and in the way we develop our marketing activity. It\u2019s also going to have a very positive impact on cost, in terms of standardization, in terms of automatization, and we\u2019re going to leverage that.\u201d\n\nSmoke-free products\n\n\u201cLook at IQOS versus combustible cigarettes. IQOS reaches $80 per thousand in revenue, which is around 2.2 times higher than the average of our combustible portfolio. Therefore, when we grow IQOS, not only do we come with volume growth, but we accelerate the revenue growth with this positive mix effect on revenue. The level of gross profit is $54 per thousand. This is around 2.4 times higher than a combustible cigarette.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the most spectacular impact in terms of positive contribution is the U.S. ZYN number. The revenue per thousand is about 6 times the average of our cigarette business. And at this level, the gross profit is $185, which is about 8 times the profit that we make on average for our combustible business.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo obviously, when we grow IQOS and ZYN, we are growing very nicely in volume, remember close to 14% growth in volume for our smoke-free portfolio in 2024.\u201d\n\nFor more than 50 years, CAGNY has been connecting investors, management teams, and the media dedicated to the consumer industry. It asserts to be \u201cthe largest not-for-profit of its kind\u201d and hosts various events throughout the year, highlighted by the CAGNY conference in Boca Raton, Florida.",

In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.\n\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco and/or nicotine use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine ; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of natural disasters and pandemics on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies.

PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.\n\nPhilip Morris International : Delivering a Smoke-Free Future\n\nPhilip Morris International is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match\u2019s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA. As of December 31, 2024 , PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates that 38.6 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 39% of PMI\u2019s total full-year 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI has a long-term ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

            "content": "Yesterday, Philip Morris International participated in the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference in Orlando, Florida. Chief Executive Officer Jacek Olczak and Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau spoke about the company\u2019s work toward a smoke-free future, current financial models, and future opportunities.\n\n(Some quotes were edited for brevity and clarity.) Highlights included:\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nWorking toward a smoke-free company\n\n\u201cWe have been quite successful for the first 10 years of the transformations and our quest to become predominantly a smoke-free company. A way to look at what we achieved is [comparing] Marlboro International, which is by far the biggest premium brand in the category. Two years ago in 2023, IQOS for the first time surpassed the revenues of Marlboro and last year exceeded $11 billion. If we take this from that perspective, it took Philip Morris International about 60 or 70 years to get Marlboro to that level, and IQOS, our heat-not-burn brand, has managed to get to that level of performance in roughly 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean for us when we set this aspirational target of having two-thirds of our revenue come from smoke-free products by 2030? Obviously, it\u2019s a nice number that looks very nice on a PowerPoint, but the reality is that unless we become a majority smoke-free company, country-by-country, market-by-market, while we operate\u2026 the miracle will not happen at the group consolidated level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some countries in the world that despite the science and knowledge and evidence about the new products in terms of the risk profile versus cigarettes, they will not ban cigarettes. But they [essentially] will ban the smoke-free product by allowing cigarettes to continue.\u201d\n\nZYN, the company\u2019s acclaimed oral nicotine pouch\n\n\u201cZYN in the U.S. is essentially approaching $2 billion in revenues. However, it\u2019s especially exciting for us that ZYN today is the No. 4 nicotine brand as of last quarter, and definitely is the No. 1 smoke-free brand on the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nNicotine and the FDA\n\n\u201cThe FDA and others should finally start clarifying what is nicotine. Maybe we don\u2019t wait for FDA clarification. This is what we say about nicotine, and I am not saying what we know, we are just repeating what is known to the public health organizations including the FDA and many other reputable institutions: Nicotine is addictive and, obviously, is not risk-free, but it\u2019s not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything else that you find in tobacco smoke is bad, but it\u2019s not the nicotine. Now historically, because we only knew that nicotine can be consumed from cigarettes, nobody had to pay attention to the details or accuracy of the language and whether you call it nicotine or cigarette or smoking, there was not much difference. But over the last 10 years, this has become the fundamental difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing, and I will be repeating this until we succeed, nicotine doesn\u2019t cause cancer. And this is not PMI research. This is research that was done over the last 60 or 70 years when any public authority in the world was looking into cigarettes and the harm caused by cigarettes. And nobody has come up with any conclusion even close that nicotine causes harm and definitively not causes cancer. So that\u2019s the starting point and the industry, and definitely PMI, is going in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Nicotine products] have no reason to be given to kids. So we, and Swedish Match, stand very strongly behind responsible sales practices, which go into the product design flavors, et cetera.\u201d\n\nFuture of the industry\n\n\u201cI think the future will be more complicated, but it will actually create more opportunities. The smokers will not go away. They\u2019re actually looking at these products from the repertoire perspective, because all of these products deliver a different opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the best strategy one can have is to actually keep on with the pace of developing these products and offering them to the consumers without spending too much time [wondering which] one category will win one versus the others.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nRevenue growth\n\n\u201cLet me start with a summary of our best-in-class growth and return. The first element is we are a strong growth company in terms of top-line with three drivers. The first one we talk about is growing volumes. If we achieve our objective of growing volume again in 2025, it will be five years in a row of growth in volume. It\u2019s a total change of paradigm for the nicotine industry. Second is price increase, and you have seen over the last two years we\u2019ve been growing and increasing our prices. First on combustible of course, but also on the smoke-free portfolio where we have started to post some nice price increases. Third is the very positive mixed impact that is coming from the growth of our smoke-free portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I think is super important is the mix impact and understanding of why the growth on smoke-free products is a very positive element for our growth, both at the top-line level and at the margin progression as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we are spending a lot of time on AI and what AI can mean for us in terms of notably saving on our back-office cost. We believe that AI is pervasive to the organization. To be clear, AI will have a lot of impact in the way we connect with the consumer and in the way we develop our marketing activity. It\u2019s also going to have a very positive impact on cost, in terms of standardization, in terms of automatization, and we\u2019re going to leverage that.\u201d\n\nSmoke-free products\n\n\u201cLook at IQOS versus combustible cigarettes. IQOS reaches $80 per thousand in revenue, which is around 2.2 times higher than the average of our combustible portfolio. Therefore, when we grow IQOS, not only do we come with volume growth, but we accelerate the revenue growth with this positive mix effect on revenue. The level of gross profit is $54 per thousand. This is around 2.4 times higher than a combustible cigarette.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the most spectacular impact in terms of positive contribution is the U.S. ZYN number. The revenue per thousand is about 6 times the average of our cigarette business. And at this level, the gross profit is $185, which is about 8 times the profit that we make on average for our combustible business.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo obviously, when we grow IQOS and ZYN, we are growing very nicely in volume, remember close to 14% growth in volume for our smoke-free portfolio in 2024.\u201d\n\nFor more than 50 years, CAGNY has been connecting investors, management teams, and the media dedicated to the consumer industry. It asserts to be \u201cthe largest not-for-profit of its kind\u201d and hosts various events throughout the year, highlighted by the CAGNY conference in Boca Raton, Florida.",

            "content": "Serial entrepreneur Atul Devani has been part of the Civil Service Commission for just over two years. He tells CSW about his background and role\n\nTell us about your career \u2013 what was your first job, and what shaped your career path?\n\nI began my career at British Telecommunications as an apprentice technician at 16. The three-year apprenticeship gave me hands-on technical experience and helped me understand the foundational workings of a large and complex organisation. I was fortunate to receive BT full sponsorship for a BSc in electronic engineering, combining academic knowledge with practical application.\n\nThe turning point in my career came when I moved into sales and business leadership. I discovered a passion for building and scaling businesses, from launching startups to leading successful exits. Over the years, I\u2019ve taken companies public, raised significant investment capital both privately and from venture firms, and driven business turnarounds.\n\nI would say that three core factors have shaped my career: curiosity, an entrepreneurial mindset, and a willingness to take risks. I\u2019ve always been drawn to emerging technologies and their potential to disrupt industries, from telecoms and fintech to digital healthcare. My entrepreneurial mindset has driven me to found startups, lead IPOs, and advise on high-value investments. Lastly, my willingness to take risks has enabled me to enter new industries, face challenges, and make bold decisions that have often led to successful outcomes.\n\nWhat made you want to be a civil service commissioner, and what do you enjoy about the role?\n\nAfter decades in the private sector, particularly in high-growth technology and investment environments, I was drawn to the Civil Service Commission by a strong belief in meritocracy, fairness, and good governance. Having built companies and led investment funds, I have seen first hand how the right leadership can transform organisations. The civil service plays a vital role in shaping national policies and services, and ensuring senior appointments are made on merit is fundamental to maintaining public trust.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my role is the ability to make a tangible impact on public service leadership. As a commissioner, I chair senior recruitment competitions for influential government roles such as director generals and CEOs. These positions are not just jobs: they are positions that shape the future of the country. The ability to ensure they are filled fairly, transparently, and without bias is both a challenge and a privilege.\n\nI enjoy the broader aspect of the role, advising government departments on strengthening civil service values. Upholding impartiality, objectivity, honesty, and integrity is vital for the civil service\u2019s effectiveness, and I take great pride in reinforcing these principles.\n\nDoes your entrepreneurial mindset influence your approach as a commissioner?\n\nWithout a doubt. Entrepreneurs thrive on efficiency, problem-solving, and innovation qualities that are essential in leadership and regulatory roles. My background gives me a unique perspective on recruitment and governance. I\u2019m always looking for ways to streamline processes, improve decision making and ensure recruitment is not just fair but also forward-thinking.\n\nIn business, success depends on having the right people in the right roles. The same principle applies to civil service recruitment. My entrepreneurial approach means I focus not just on filling roles but on ensuring departments are hiring individuals who bring fresh thinking, leadership, and adaptability \u2013qualities that are crucial in our rapidly changing world.\n\nAn entrepreneurial mindset also means being pragmatic. The civil service operates under a necessary framework, but that doesn\u2019t mean processes can\u2019t be improved. I approach my commissioner role with the same strategic thinking I use in business: understanding challenges, identifying solutions, and ensuring decisions lead to the best long-term outcomes.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges in Senior Civil Service recruitment today, and what frustrates you?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is attracting and retaining top-tier talent, especially from outside the public sector. The civil service offers incredible opportunities to make a real difference, but it competes with the private sector, where salaries and benefits can be more attractive. This is particularly true in areas like digital transformation, technology, and data-driven decision-making, where corporations can offer higher compensation and faster career progression.\n\nAnother challenge is diversity \u2013 both in representation and experience. Government departments need leaders who bring fresh perspectives, challenge the status quo and drive innovation. Ensuring recruitment processes encourage broad applicant pools and create pathways for individuals from different industries and backgrounds is crucial.\n\nWhat frustrates me most is the length of time it takes to make key appointments. In the private sector, senior hiring decisions are made quickly to maintain agility. While the civil service\u2019s structured process is essential for fairness, it can sometimes slow down decisions to the point where departments lose strong candidates to other opportunities.\n\nHow do you manage your different roles effectively?\n\nIt comes down to time management, clear priorities, and surrounding myself with the right people. I believe in setting a clear vision and empowering others to take ownership of their responsibilities. Whether chairing investment committees, advising startups, or overseeing civil service recruitment, I focus on areas where I can add the most value.\n\nI also rely on structured decision-making \u2013 every role has a specific purpose, whether it\u2019s driving investment growth, ensuring good governance, or improving recruitment processes. Staying outcome-focused allows me to manage multiple commitments without spreading myself too thin.\n\nBalance is key. My schedule is often demanding, but I make time to step back, reflect, and recharge. This prevents burnout and means I can approach each role with renewed energy and perspective.\n\nWhat would you say to someone considering a role in the Senior Civil Service?\n\nIf you\u2019re passionate about making a difference and shaping policies that impact millions, the civil service offers an incredibly rewarding career. Success here isn\u2019t measured by financial outcomes but by creating long-term, meaningful change.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to understand the challenges. The pace of change can be slower than in the private sector due to essential regulations and governance frameworks, and decision-making often requires balancing political, economic, and social factors.\n\nThat said, if you value integrity, public service, and strategic problem-solving, it can be an incredibly rewarding path. There are strong long-term career prospects and, often overlooked, one of the most generous pension schemes I\u2019ve ever encountered.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s regulatory role, in your own words?\n\nThe commission plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of government recruitment. At its core, we ensure that appointments are made on merit through a fair and open process. This is vital because the civil service delivers policies and services that impact every aspect of society \u2013 from healthcare and education to national security and economic policy.\n\nBeyond recruitment, the commission serves as a safeguard against bias and undue influence by hearing appeals under the civil service code. We ensure that the civil service remains impartial and that appointments are based on skills and suitability, not personal connections or political affiliations. This is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring government operates effectively.\n\nFinally, how do you like to spend your spare time?\n\nI have a strong interest in investing, from stocks and shares ISAs to early-stage companies. I enjoy analysing markets and staying ahead of trends \u2013 it\u2019s both intellectually stimulating and rewarding.\n\nI also enjoy hands-on projects and DIY. There is something deeply satisfying about building things \u2013 whether it\u2019s a business, an investment portfolio, or fixing up a property, it brings me a lot of satisfaction.\n\nI love following Formula 1, analysing team strategies, and seeing how technology evolves in the sport. Lastly, I enjoy playing golf, which is a fantastic way to relax and challenge myself. It requires patience, focus, and strategy \u2013 qualities that translate well into business and leadership.\n\nAtul Devani will be taking part in a free \"Meet the Commissioners\" online event on recruitment into the Senior Civil Service on 18 March\n\nRead the most recent articles written by CSW staff - Smart defence: Empowered with AI",

            "content": "While investors in the tobacco space have tended to be more focused on dividends over the years, Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) has quietly turned itself into a strong growth company as its smoke-free business continues to drive strong results. The company's shares were once again climbing following its fourth-quarter earnings results. The stock is now up around 20% year to date and about 60% over the past year, as of this writing.\n\nWith the stock near all-time highs, let's take a closer look at its most recent results to determine whether the stock is still a buy.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nZyn continues to be a growth driver\n\nZyn, a brand of nicotine pouches made with nicotine powder and flavoring instead of tobacco that Philip Morris acquired at the end of 2022, continues to be Philip Morris' biggest growth driver. Zyn volumes surged 46.2% in Q4 to 183.8 million cans. Meanwhile, the company forecast Zyn volumes to grow between 34% to 41% in 2025, reaching between 780 million to 820 million cans.\n\nThe company also continues to see strong sales of heated tobacco units (HTUs), including its IQOS system. HTU volumes rose 5.1% to 35.7 billion units in the quarter. Excluding the net effect of estimated distributor and wholesaler inventory movements, volumes were up 13%, led by Japan and Europe. The company also highlighted the strength it was seeing in its VEEV brand vaping business, especially in Europe.\n\nTraditional cigarette volumes also rose, increasing 1.1% to 152.8 billion units. Its market share excluding the U.S. and China edged down 0.1% to 23.5%, although its HTU market share rose 0.5% to 5.4%.\n\nOverall, organic revenue, which excludes currency effects, acquisitions, and dispositions, rose 7.2% year over year to $9.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 14% to $1.55.\n\nOn an organic basis, combustible tobacco revenue rose 6.2%, driven by a high-single-digit price increase and modestly growing volumes. The smoke-free business saw organic revenue increase 9%.\n\nZyn HTUs Cigarettes Smoke-free Total Volume growth 46.2% 5.1% 1.1% N/A 2.3% Organic revenue growth N/A N/A 6.2% 9% 7.3%\n\nGross profits grew faster than revenue, rising 12.6% organically, as both Zyn and IQOS have higher gross margins than the company's traditional cigarette business. Adjusted gross margins for smoke-free products were 490 basis points higher than combustible gross margins in Q4.\n\nLooking ahead, Philip Morris guided for organic revenue to grow by between 6% to 8%, with volume growth of around 2%. It expects smoke-free volumes to increase by between 12% to 14%. It is looking for adjusted EPS of between $7.04 to $7.17, which would represent growth of 10.5% to 12.5% in constant currency.\n\nGuidance Organic revenue growth 6% to 8% Adjusted EPS $7.04 to $7.17 Adjusted EPS growth excl. currency 10.5% to 12.5% Volume growth 2%\n\nData source: Philip Morris International.\n\nIt expects to produce operating cash flow of about $11 billion, while spending $1.5 billion on capital expenditures to expand Zyn capacity in the U.S.\n\nPerson vaping.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it too late to buy Philip Morris stock?\n\nPhilip Morris is a rare combination of a growth stock in a defensive industry. It also pays a robust quarterly dividend of $1.35, which is good for a forward dividend yield of 3.7% as of this writing.\n\nZyn continues to be Philip Morris' biggest growth driver, with the company seeing no signs of its volume growth slowing down. IQOS, meanwhile, is also seeing solid growth. Importantly, both have much higher unit economics than its traditional cigarette business, which is leading to earnings growth outpacing revenue growth as its gross margins expand. Meanwhile, with no exposure to the U.S. cigarette market, its cigarette business is still a solid grower through price increases and modest volume growth.\n\nWith the company having bought back IQOS rights in the U.S., it sees this as a nice opportunity in the next two to three years. Given that it does not sell cigarettes in the U.S., there would be no cannibalization like there is in international markets.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 20 times based on the analyst consensus for 2025, with a PEG (price/earnings-to-growth ratio) ratio of under 0.4. Stocks with PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued, so a PEG that low puts Philip Morris squarely in undervalued territory.\n\nPM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nPM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance, Philip Morris still offers investors the rare combination of growth in a defensive industry with a robust yield trading at an attractive valuation. As such, I don't think it is too late to buy the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Philip Morris International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Philip Morris International wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NYSE:PM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nEmily Rowland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, joined a discussion on CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on February 13 to share her insights on the markets and the upcoming PPI (Producer Price Index) report. She thinks that the S&P earnings are highly underappreciated right now. She noted that the market\u2019s reaction to inflation data has been asymmetric. While higher inflation numbers are often shrugged off, any relief from softer inflation prints tends to cause bigger moves in the markets. This was evident in the response to the CPI (Consumer Price Index) report. Regarding market performance, Rowland highlighted that the S&P 500 earnings were coming in with strong growth (16% year-over-year for the fourth quarter) and this growth is broad-based across sectors like healthcare and utilities. Financials also showed significant gains with a 50% increase.\n\nOn discussing President Trump\u2019s announcement of retaliatory tariffs via Truth Social, Rowland said that her team avoids making tactical investment decisions based on political outcomes due to their unpredictability and rapid changes. In terms of attractive sectors for investment within US markets, she highlighted healthcare and industrial companies as promising areas due to their strong fundamentals and potential benefits from ongoing supply chain reshoring activities within the US. While acknowledging political factors can influence sector performance, her strategy focuses on longer-term economic trends rather than short-term political developments when considering investments in key indices like those represented by major US equities such as those found in the S&P 500 index.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the best-performing S&P 500 stocks. We then picked the top 10 stocks with the highest year-to-date performance, as of February 17. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance. We\u2019ve also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock which was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nYear-to-Date Performance as of February 17: 25.02%\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco company that offers cigarettes and smoke-free products, which include heat-not-burn (IQOS), vapor, and oral nicotine (ZYN) products, as well as other consumer accessories. It also offers wellness and healthcare products.\n\nIts transformation into a smoke-free company is fueling its stock surge, with shares up around 60% over the past year. This is driven by the performance of its smoke-free products, particularly ZYN nicotine pouches and IQOS heated tobacco units. Q4 2024 saw ZYN volume surge 46.2% to 183.8 million cans, and the company forecasts continued momentum with 2025 volumes projected to reach 780 to 820 million cans. This represents 34% to 41% growth. IQOS contributed with Q4 heated-tobacco-units volume up 5.1% due to the demand in Japan and Europe. The VEEV vaping business is also performing well in Europe.\n\nSmoke-free products like ZYN and IQOS have higher gross margins than traditional cigarettes. In Q4 2024, revenue increased 7.2% year-over-year to $9.7 billion. Looking ahead, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) anticipates 6% to 8% revenue growth in 2025. Smoke-free volumes are expected to increase by 12% to 14%. The company plans to invest $1.5 billion in capital expenditures to expand ZYN production capacity.\n\nBroyhill Asset Management highlighted the company\u2019s 21% Q3 gain. The firm attributed it to the shift towards reduced-risk products, the Swedish Match acquisition (including the popular Zyn), and low youth usage despite overall popularity. It stated the following in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) gained 21% in Q3. Philip Morris was by far the largest contributor for the quarter. Our core thesis focuses on the shift in business mix from combustible cigarettes towards reduced risk products as well as the company\u2019s re-entry to the US market with its acquisition of Swedish Match. This year, Zyn has become wildly popular. So much so that the company can barely keep it in stock, even as it expands production. We recently discussed how youth usage of these products, a common critique of the company, remains under 2%, even as its overall popularity drives higher volume.\u201d\n\nOverall PM ranks 10th on our list of the best performing S&P 500 stocks so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Shares of Godfrey Phillips continued their winning streak for the second straight session, climbing as much as 20 percent to Rs 7,170 apiece on February 17, fueled by strong third-quarter earnings. Over just two days, the tobacco giant\u2019s stock has skyrocketed by an impressive 44 percent.\n\nThe company reported a robust 48.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) surge in net profit for the December quarter, reaching Rs 316 crore. Meanwhile, revenue from operations jumped 27.3 percent YoY to Rs 1,591 crore, driven by substantial growth in its core business of cigarettes, tobacco, and related products.\n\nCatch all the market action on our LIVE blog\n\nOn the operational front, Godfrey Phillips\u2019 EBITDA soared 57.6 percent to Rs 359 crore in Q3FY25, with EBITDA margins expanding sharply by 440 basis points YoY to 22.6 percent.\n\nNotably, the company holds an exclusive sourcing and supply agreement with Philip Morris International for manufacturing and distributing Marlboro cigarettes in India, with tobacco making up the bulk of its gross sales.\n\nThe domestic cigarette industry has faced headwinds in recent years due to rising taxes, stringent regulations, and a surge in illicit trade\u2014particularly in the premium segment\u2014posing significant challenges to legal cigarette manufacturers.\n\nHowever, recent government crackdowns on illegal cigarette sales, coupled with moderate price hikes within the cigarette portfolio, are expected to drive stronger volume growth, according to Mirae Asset Sharekhan.\n\nIn terms of ownership, the company\u2019s shareholding pattern remained largely stable. Promoter holdings were unchanged, while foreign institutional investors (FIIs) marginally reduced their stake to 10.6 percent from 10.8 percent. On the flip side, mutual funds slightly increased their holdings to 1.8 percent in the December quarter, up from 1.78 percent in the previous quarter.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

            "content": "Tobacco seller Philip Morris International (PM) recently soared to new heights on the back of its blockbuster Q4 2024 earnings results, thereby throwing its hat into the ring as a titan value and growth stock rolled into one. Based on my experience monitoring the tobacco industry\u2019s ever-shifting landscape, I would argue there is plenty of room for more upside.\n\nFrom strong results in traditional combustibles to rapid gains in heated tobacco units (HTUs) and oral nicotine products, Philip Morris continues to lead in the space. PM\u2019s momentum is only gaining steam, yet the market valuation is lagging. That can only mean bullishness is warranted for this smoky profiteer.\n\nA Surprising Surge in Combustibles\n\nDespite a broad shift away from traditional tobacco, Philip Morris\u2019 Q4 results showed an available market capacity for expansion in combustibles. For years, unease about falling smoking rates and challenging regulatory environments have weighed heavily on the entire industry. Philip Morris has certainly felt that pressure, historically witnessing mid-single-digit declines in cigarette shipments.\n\nYet, as we\u2019ve seen in the most recent quarters, this story has more nuance than many expected. In Q4 specifically, cigarette shipments climbed by 1.1% year-over-year, catching analysts off guard. A few key markets stood out, including Turkey, India, and Egypt, where combustible demand has remained unexpectedly robust. Moreover, Philip Morris\u2019 emphasis on premium pricing, which drove high-single-digit price increases, pushed organic revenue for the combustibles segment up by 6.2%.\n\nThis revenue boost, mainly due to higher prices, resulted in a 10.8% spike in gross profit for combustibles. That\u2019s quite a victory, given the many issues tobacco companies have wrestled with. So, while I\u2019m still keeping a close eye on regulatory strains, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the resilience in traditional cigarettes makes for a solid foundation for Philip Morris stock.\n\nSmoke-Free Takes Center Stage\n\nIn addition to the strong performance of combustibles, Philip Morris\u2019s smoke-free products have also delivered great results. Its HTU and oral nicotine categories recorded double-digit gains in Q4, emphasizing Philip Morris\u2019 leadership in transitioning smokers to less harmful alternatives. Total smoke-free net sales neared a staggering $15 billion in 2024, accounting for roughly 40% of the company\u2019s total net sales and an even higher share of its gross profit.\n\nHeated tobacco shipments hit 139.7 billion units for the entire year, up 13.5% year over year. This increase was powered by gains in Japan and Europe, where the IQOS ILUMA line, in particular, has found real traction thanks to its refined design and improved user experience. At this point, IQOS has over 38.5 million adult users worldwide, which is undoubtedly an impressive statistic that demonstrates Philip Morris\u2019s strong foothold in the HTU market.\n\nMeanwhile, ZYN continues to blaze a trail in the oral nicotine category. In the United States alone, Q4 shipments jumped by 42%, totaling 165 million cans. Moreover, some of the supply-chain issues that once cramped ZYN\u2019s growth are beginning to subside, and Philip Morris now forecasts shipments topping 800 million cans in 2025. Beyond the U.S., ZYN is now offered in 37 markets worldwide, stressing the company\u2019s incredible capacity to scale up profitable products quickly.\n\nOutlook for 2025: More Records in Sight\n\nLooking ahead, Philip Morris projects 6% to 8% organic revenue growth for 2025. This is expected to be primarily fueled by double-digit HTU expansion and continued gains in the oral category. Even with the regulatory uncertainties present, ranging from flavor bans in the EU to shifting tax structures globally, the company appears set to benefit from a strong pipeline of product innovations and the broader consumer acceptance of smoke-free alternatives.\n\nHowever, what I found more noteworthy was the guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 10.5% to 12.5% on a currency-neutral basis, which signals another year of record-setting profitability.\n\nValuation: Still Appealing, Even at All-Time Highs\n\nDespite the share price surge, Philip Morris remains attractively valued relative to other quality consumer staples. The stock seems priced or cheap at about 21x 2025 earnings estimates, given its accelerating revenue growth, strong margins, and the kind of brand loyalty and cash flow predictability most consumer companies can only dream about.\n\nAdd in 2024, marking the 17th consecutive year of dividend increases, and you have a powerful blend of growth and income from a quality company in the space. In fact, with institutional investors increasingly viewing Philip Morris as a growth stock, I expect the current valuation expansion narrative to shift even more, allowing the stock\u2019s valuation to move toward the mid-20s. Thus, there is no reason to believe the recent share price surge will limit shareholders\u2019 total return prospects in the near term.\n\nIs PM a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, Philip Morris now features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buy, zero Hold, and one Sell ratings obtained over the past three months. PM\u2019s average price target of $150.50 per share implies less than 1% upside potential compared to current levels. However, I expect multiple analysts to revise their targets upwards in the coming days.\n\nTobacco Titan Has Room to Run\n\nI see Philip Morris as a standout in a legacy industry rapidly reinventing itself. Given its laser focus on next-generation products and enduring growth in legacy combustibles, the company offers the best of both worlds. While risks like regulation and tax hikes shouldn\u2019t be ignored, I believe the stock is positioned to thrive in the coming years, especially given that its valuation seems fair. Despite hitting new highs, Philip Morris may just be warming up.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

They are now available in 95 country markets.\n\nPMI CEO Jacek Olczak said: \u201c2024 was a remarkable year for PMI. We delivered very strong full-year results driven by the continued growth of IQOS and ZYN in addition to a robust combustibles performance.\n\n\u201cThe long-awaited US FDA authorisation of all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed in the USA [see our story here] is further evidence of the compelling science supporting smoke-free products. We hope our other pending FDA applications will be accelerated.\n\n\u201cWe also hope other countries follow the example of the USA and embrace effective tobacco harm reduction measures. This is especially important in places where smoke-free products are banned, resulting in the perpetuation of combustible cigarette consumption.\u201d \u2708\n\nPMI Duty Free Vice President Beste Ermaner discussed the company\u2019s strong focus on developing its smoke-free products business during last October\u2019s TFWA World Exhibition in Cannes.

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match\u2019s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA. As of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates that 38.6 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 39% of PMI\u2019s total full-year 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI has a long-term ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

            "content": "While investors in the tobacco space have tended to be more focused on dividends over the years, Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%) has quietly turned itself into a strong growth company as its smoke-free business continues to drive strong results. The company's shares were once again climbing following its fourth-quarter earnings results. The stock is now up around 20% year to date and about 60% over the past year, as of this writing.\n\nWith the stock near all-time highs, let's take a closer look at its most recent results to determine whether the stock is still a buy.\n\nZyn continues to be a growth driver\n\nZyn, a brand of nicotine pouches made with nicotine powder and flavoring instead of tobacco that Philip Morris acquired at the end of 2022, continues to be Philip Morris' biggest growth driver. Zyn volumes surged 46.2% in Q4 to 183.8 million cans. Meanwhile, the company forecast Zyn volumes to grow between 34% to 41% in 2025, reaching between 780 million to 820 million cans.\n\nThe company also continues to see strong sales of heated tobacco units (HTUs), including its IQOS system. HTU volumes rose 5.1% to 35.7 billion units in the quarter. Excluding the net effect of estimated distributor and wholesaler inventory movements, volumes were up 13%, led by Japan and Europe. The company also highlighted the strength it was seeing in its VEEV brand vaping business, especially in Europe.\n\nTraditional cigarette volumes also rose, increasing 1.1% to 152.8 billion units. Its market share excluding the U.S. and China edged down 0.1% to 23.5%, although its HTU market share rose 0.5% to 5.4%.\n\nOverall, organic revenue, which excludes currency effects, acquisitions, and dispositions, rose 7.2% year over year to $9.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 14% to $1.55.\n\nOn an organic basis, combustible tobacco revenue rose 6.2%, driven by a high-single-digit price increase and modestly growing volumes. The smoke-free business saw organic revenue increase 9%.\n\nZyn HTUs Cigarettes Smoke-free Total Volume growth 46.2% 5.1% 1.1% N/A 2.3% Organic revenue growth N/A N/A 6.2% 9% 7.3%\n\nGross profits grew faster than revenue, rising 12.6% organically, as both Zyn and IQOS have higher gross margins than the company's traditional cigarette business. Adjusted gross margins for smoke-free products were 490 basis points higher than combustible gross margins in Q4.\n\nLooking ahead, Philip Morris guided for organic revenue to grow by between 6% to 8%, with volume growth of around 2%. It expects smoke-free volumes to increase by between 12% to 14%. It is looking for adjusted EPS of between $7.04 to $7.17, which would represent growth of 10.5% to 12.5% in constant currency.\n\nGuidance Organic revenue growth 6% to 8% Adjusted EPS $7.04 to $7.17 Adjusted EPS growth excl. currency 10.5% to 12.5% Volume growth 2%\n\nIt expects to produce operating cash flow of about $11 billion, while spending $1.5 billion on capital expenditures to expand Zyn capacity in the U.S.\n\nIs it too late to buy Philip Morris stock?\n\nPhilip Morris is a rare combination of a growth stock in a defensive industry. It also pays a robust quarterly dividend of $1.35, which is good for a forward dividend yield of 3.7% as of this writing.\n\nZyn continues to be Philip Morris' biggest growth driver, with the company seeing no signs of its volume growth slowing down. IQOS, meanwhile, is also seeing solid growth. Importantly, both have much higher unit economics than its traditional cigarette business, which is leading to earnings growth outpacing revenue growth as its gross margins expand. Meanwhile, with no exposure to the U.S. cigarette market, its cigarette business is still a solid grower through price increases and modest volume growth.\n\nWith the company having bought back IQOS rights in the U.S., it sees this as a nice opportunity in the next two to three years. Given that it does not sell cigarettes in the U.S., there would be no cannibalization like there is in international markets.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 20 times based on the analyst consensus for 2025, with a PEG (price/earnings-to-growth ratio) ratio of under 0.4. Stocks with PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued, so a PEG that low puts Philip Morris squarely in undervalued territory.\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance, Philip Morris still offers investors the rare combination of growth in a defensive industry with a robust yield trading at an attractive valuation. As such, I don't think it is too late to buy the stock.",

            "content": "Philip Morris International PM, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world, has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few years. As cigarette smoking continues its decades-long decline, PMI has aggressively expanded into smokeless alternatives, with Zyn \u2013 its flagship nicotine pouch brand \u2013 emerging as a major driver of growth.\n\nZyn's rapid adoption in the U.S. market has played a key role in PMI's resurgence. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized 20 Zyn products for sale, determining that these pouches contain \"substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes and most smokeless tobacco products.\" This regulatory green light reinforced Zyn's positioning as a lower-risk alternative to traditional tobacco products.\n\nPMI's $16 billion acquisition of Swedish Match, the original manufacturer of Zyn, in 2022 has proven to be a strategic coup. The company reported shipping 238 million cans of Zyn in the U.S. that year, with projections indicating that this number will more than double in 2024. According to CNBC, PMI has committed over $832 million to expand Zyn's production capacity, including new manufacturing plants in Aurora, Colorado and Owensboro, Kentucky.\n\nThis shift aligns with PMI's broader corporate strategy: by 2030, the company aims for two-thirds of its revenue to come from smoke-free products, with an eventual goal of moving entirely away from cigarettes. As Goldman Sachs senior analyst Bonnie Herzog told CNBC, \"The beauty of this transformation is that they're actually generating faster top-line and faster profitability given the pivot to these businesses.\"\n\nWith Zyn's meteoric rise, PMI has demonstrated that nicotine pouches are more than just a passing trend. They represent a scalable, profitable and consumer-friendly alternative to traditional tobacco products. The question now is: can a similar shift happen in the cannabis industry?\n\nFrom Nicotine To Nootropics: Pouches Are Just Getting Started\n\nWhile Zyn has reshaped the nicotine industry, its success is part of a broader shift in how consumers approach smokeless and discreet consumption. Pouches, as a delivery system, are gaining traction across multiple categories, including cannabinoids, caffeine and nootropics. This trend suggests that the appeal of pouches extends far beyond nicotine replacement, opening the door for new product innovations.\n\nNick Kenny, lead advisor at KBS Strategic Advisory, has worked closely with major tobacco companies exploring these adjacent markets. He points out that Zyn's success has fueled renewed interest in pouches as a delivery method for other substances.\n\n\"The widespread adoption of oral nicotine pouches by regulators and adult consumers has spurned renewed interest in the category as a delivery method for cannabinoids,\" Kenny told Benzinga in an exclusive interview. \"Big Tobacco [companies] are consistently looking to diversify and enhance their portfolio of offerings, and where they can leverage existing technology to differentiate, such as in the case of pouches, it's a natural adjacency to take advantage of.\"\n\nBeyond nicotine, companies are expanding into new bioactive substances that fit well within the pouch format. Cannadips, a California-based company specializing in smokeless, spit-free pouches, has pioneered THC and CBD-infused alternatives to traditional oral tobacco. Co-founder Case Mandel has been at the forefront of this shift, developing pouches infused with THC, CBD, caffeine and nootropics.\n\n\"We participate in all those different categories (\u2026) we have brands in all the different verticals,\" Mandel told Benzinga. \"Pouches are becoming an acceptable way to consume many different things.\"\n\nThe appeal of pouches is rooted in their smoke-free, discreet and fast-acting nature. Unlike traditional edibles or tinctures, which must pass through the digestive system, pouches deliver active ingredients through oral absorption, leading to a quicker onset of effects. This efficiency has made them particularly attractive for consumers looking for functional products, whether for focus, energy, relaxation or mood enhancement.\n\nCaffeine pouches have already started to take off, following a similar trajectory to nicotine pouches. Mandel notes that the market has grown significantly, with his company seeing success in partnerships like Upperdeckys, a high-dose caffeine pouch brand that has gained popularity through influencer marketing.\n\n\"We have the highest-dose caffeine pouch product on the market,\" Mandel said. \"Every pouch is almost like an energy drink.\"\n\nMeanwhile, nootropic pouches infused with compounds aimed at enhancing cognitive function have also started to gain momentum. Mandel's company has developed nootropic pouches under the Rebel brand, leveraging ingredients like Alpha-GPC and Cognizin to cater to consumers looking for performance-enhancing alternatives.\n\n\"We see that the new age of consumers want healthier products, they want to know where their ingredients are from and they want cutting-edge delivery systems,\" Mandel said.\n\nWith consumer behavior shifting toward discreet, functional and efficient consumption, pouches are proving to be a format with applications far beyond nicotine. The question now is whether cannabis pouches can follow the same path, carving out a substantial market segment like Zyn did in the nicotine space.\n\nCan THC Pouches Follow In Zyn's Footsteps?\n\nWhile nicotine and functional ingredient pouches have gained mainstream traction, cannabis-infused pouches remain a niche product. Forbes' Will Yakowicz recently reported on the rise of THC-infused pouches, spotlighting companies like Cannadips and Juana Dips that are leading the charge in this emerging category. These companies are working to establish THC pouches as a viable segment within the cannabis industry, but the path to success is far from straightforward.\n\nWhile Mandel sees major potential, he acknowledges the significant barriers to scaling THC pouches. \"We believe THC pouches are going to be a big market in the future,\" he said. \"But due to the incredibly high capital expenditure costs of pouching machines and intellectual property \u2013and this really poorly fragmented state-by-state regulatory model due to lack of federal reform\u2013 it's been very hard for us or anyone else to get significant traction in the THC pouch space.\"\n\nUnlike nicotine pouches, which can be sold nationwide in convenience stores, THC-infused pouches are limited by the patchwork of U.S. cannabis laws. Without federal legalization, each state enforces its own licensing and distribution rules, creating barriers to scaling production and streamlining sales.\n\nWithout centralized production and wider distribution, THC pouches won't easily compete with dominant cannabis formats like flower and vapes.\n\n\"At some point, we, as well as others, will be able to have a factory in one location, provide product to the country and get it for a price that consumers can afford and can build into their daily routine versus like a novelty,\" Mandel said.\n\nPrice is another major factor. Cannabis pouches are significantly more expensive than nicotine pouches, making it difficult to drive widespread adoption. While a can of nicotine pouches typically costs around $6, THC pouches can be three to four times more expensive due to taxes, compliance costs and limited production scalability.\n\n\"When consumers see a circular can, especially if they use Rogue or any of these products, they expect the product to be the same price or close to it,\" Mandel said. \"No one\u2019s going to switch from a $6 product to a $30 product and use it at the same frequency. It's just really hard.\"\n\nFor THC pouches to reach mainstream consumers, Mandel argues that the industry will need some level of federal reform to reduce costs and streamline production.\n\n\"Really, in my opinion, it\u2019s going to have to be about commoditization,\" he said. \"Until we can normalize the price of a THC pouch to be at least close to a nicotine pouch, it will be hard for it to be anything more than a novelty product that people use occasionally rather than incorporating into their daily routine.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, companies like Cannadips are focusing on regions with strong smokeless tobacco traditions to drive early adoption. The company has launched in Arkansas, Missouri and Kentucky, among others, where dip products are already popular, in an effort to establish pouches as a daily-use product rather than a novelty.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking at areas of strength where we can put our attention to and really show that this isn't just a novelty product,\" Mandel said. \"This is a product that people are building into their daily lives.\"\n\nFor THC pouches to reach mass-market success, pricing, regulations and consumer awareness will need to improve. If those barriers are addressed, they could become a major category within the cannabis industry. The next question is whether Big Tobacco and large cannabis operators will step in to accelerate growth\u2014or if THC pouches will remain a niche product.\n\nWho Will Fund The Rise Of Cannabis Pouches?\n\nAs cannabis pouches attempt to carve out a foothold in the market, the key question remains: Will large-scale industry players, whether Big Tobacco or major cannabis operators, step in to accelerate their adoption?\n\nNick Kenny believes tobacco companies are closely monitoring the category but will only invest if they see clear market potential and broad distribution opportunities. \"Big Tobacco [companies] have the desire and ability to make the category successful. However, they will only do so if they can deliver a product that can differentiate in experience and attain widespread distribution,\" he said.\n\nKenny also noted that consumer adoption and regulatory barriers will both play critical roles in determining the success of THC pouches. Unlike nicotine pouches, which benefit from nationwide distribution, THC pouches face restrictions due to fragmented state-by-state cannabis laws, making it difficult for companies to scale efficiently.\n\nDespite these challenges, Case Mandel sees long-term potential. \"We created the category. We\u2019ve been doing this now for nine years,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve solved a lot of the issues when it comes to delivery of cannabinoids.\"\n\nStill, affordability remains a major hurdle. Without economies of scale, THC pouches are significantly more expensive than nicotine pouches, limiting mass adoption.\n\n\"Recreational cannabis is really expensive, and it's really expensive compared to traditional [illicit] markets in a lot of states,\" Mandel said.\n\nOne potential avenue for wider availability is hemp-derived THC pouches, which fall under the 2018 Farm Bill. However, Mandel points out that regulations on THC content per pouch make them less competitive than edibles, vapes and drinks. \"Because a pouch is only 500 milligrams, you\u2019re looking at a milligram and a half of THC per pouch,\" he explained.\n\nRather than trying to force national expansion too early, Mandel's strategy is to focus on regions with strong smokeless tobacco traditions, where dip users may be more likely to embrace the format.\n\n\"We\u2019re kind of looking at areas of strength where we can put our attention to and really show, \u2018Hey, this isn't just a novelty product. This is a product that people are building into their daily life,'\" he said.\n\nThe future of cannabis pouches will depend on major industry investment, evolving regulations, and consumer demand. If a major player\u2014either in cannabis or tobacco\u2014commits to mass production and distribution, the market could scale quickly.\n\nFor now, THC pouches remain a niche product, but the potential is there. If a dominant player enters the space, cannabis pouches could redefine consumption\u2014just as Zyn did with nicotine.\n\nLead image via Shutterstock",

Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nMolson Coors missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 3.4% last quarter, reporting revenues of $3.04 billion, down 7.8% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\nIs Molson Coors a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Molson Coors\u2019s revenue to decline 3% year on year to $2.71 billion, a reversal from the 6.1% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.13 per share.\n\nMolson Coors Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Molson Coors has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Molson Coors\u2019s peers in the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Philip Morris delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 7.3%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.8%, and Coca-Cola reported revenues up 4.2%, topping estimates by 6.5%. Philip Morris traded up 10.2% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Philip Morris\u2019s results here and Coca-Cola\u2019s results here.\n\nInvestors in the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco segment have had fairly steady hands going into earnings, with share prices down 1.6% on average over the last month. Molson Coors\u2019s stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $62.85 (compared to the current share price of $54.55).\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Korea Philip Morris\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 Officials are introducing the device at a recent launch event of the Korean Philip Morris cigarette-type e-cigarette \"Icos Illuma i\" held at Lotte Hotel in Seoul. Yonhap News Agency\n\nThe new cigarette-type e-cigarette \"Icos Illuma i\" series, which was introduced by Philip Morris Korea on the 5th, is making a splash even before the official sale. Even in the extreme cold of minus 12 degrees Celsius, a long procession of people continued at the Icos store.Philip Morris Korea began pre-purchasing the iCOS Illuma i series through nine iCOS stores and iCOS official online stores nationwide on the 7th. The company explained that customers have been visiting since the first morning of the pre-purchase.The iCOS Illuma i series has a variety of new features. One of the characteristics of this series is the touchscreen. Through the touch screen of the holder, the preheating state of the device, the remaining use time, and the remaining number of uses can be known at a glance. Pause mode is a new feature that allows you to stop using the device for up to 8 minutes. It can be useful when you have to stop using it for a while due to urgent calls or unexpected meetings. If you push down the touchscreen to pause it and then push it up again, you can resume using it without wasting the stick. When the pause mode is not in use, it can be used up to three consecutive times with only one charge.A \"FlexPuff\" function has also been added. Considering that each IQOS user has different usage patterns and suction speeds, it can be inhaled up to four times for up to six minutes by analyzing individual usage patterns.This new product will be introduced in two lineups: \"Icos Illuma i Prime\" and \"Icos Illuma i\". The \"Icos Illuma i Prime\" is a top-end flagship model that features aluminum and a wrap cover, and comes in three colors: Breeze Blue, Midnight Black, and Garnet Red. 'Icos Illuma i' comes in four colors: Breeze Blue, Midnight Black, Vivid Terracotta, and Digital Violet. Both products apply a \"smart core induction system\" similar to the existing IQOS Illuma series to heat cigarettes uniformly from the inside, and there is no need to clean the device because there is no residue left after use. A company official said, \"The pre-purchase response of the Icos Illuma i series was hotter than expected, so we were able to confirm customers' expectations for the new product.\" He added, \"In particular, there were many people who felt attractive, saying that new functions that did not exist before would be useful in real life.\"The pre-purchase of the iCOS Illuma i series was held at nine iCOS directly managed stores and iCOS official online stores nationwide until the 12th. Then, from the 13th, when official sales begin, the iCOS Illuma i series will also be available at convenience stores nationwide. The recommended consumer price of the iCOS Illuma i Prime is 129,000 won and the iCOS Illuma i is 89,000 won.Meanwhile, Philip Morris Korea was established in April 1989 as a local subsidiary of Philip Morris International. About 1,000 executives and employees are working at the headquarters in Seoul, at the Yangsan plant, and at sales offices across the country. In 2017, it launched iCOS, a cigarette-type electronic cigarette device that heats without burning under the goal of \"a future without cigarette smoke,\" and Hit's, a dedicated cigarette product. In 2022, we introduced the iCOS Illuma series, the next generation of cigarette-type e-cigarette devices.[Reporter Lee Hyoseok]",

The number of heated tobacco devices also outstripped the number of cigarettes, with 56.9 billion heated tobacco devices, compared to 47.7 billion cigarettes.\n\nLooking at the wider, global market, Vietnam (+14.4%), Egypt (+11.1%) and Turkey (+9.5%) performed remarkably strongly, while there was a big decrease in the estimated total market for cigarettes and heated tobacco units in Canada (-12.3%), Thailand (-13.7%), the UK (-12.6%) and France (-125%), according to PMI\u2019s data.\n\n\u201c2024 was a remarkable year for PMI. We delivered very strong full-year results driven by the continued growth of IQOS and ZYN in addition to a robust combustibles performance,\u201d said Jacek Olczak, PMI Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAn evolving market\n\nPMI has been at the forefront of the smoke-free revolution in the Tobacco sector in recent years. While the company continues to supply combustible tobacco products, since 2008, PMI has invested more than $14bn in the development, science and commercialisation of smoke-free products. In 2023, its flagship IQOS device overtook the iconic Marlboro brand in terms of revenue, signifying a landmark moment for the company\u2019s plans.\n\nAccording to the new figures, in 2024, PMI\u2019s quarterly shipments of heated tobacco products and oral smoke-free products exceeded 40 billion units for the first time, with the smoke-free business accounting for 40% of the company\u2019s total net revenue. At the same time, PMI\u2019s combustible products offer saw a 4% grown in revenue across the year, driven by strong pricing and growing volumes in markets such as India and Turkey, where smoke-free products are not permitted.\n\nAs reported, PMI recently hailed the authorisation of ZYN by the FDA in the US, boosting the presence of the nicotine pouch brand in the country. ZYN became part of the PMI offer after the company acquired Swedish Match in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe long-awaited US FDA authorization of all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed in the US is further evidence of the compelling science supporting smoke-free products.,\u201d Olczak added. \u201cWe hope our other pending FDA applications will be accelerated. We also hope other countries follow the example of the US and embrace effective tobacco harm reduction measures. This is especially important in places where smoke-free products are banned, resulting in the perpetuation of combustible cigarette consumption.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cWith strong momentum across all categories, we are confident that our smoke-free transformation and unparalleled brand portfolio will continue to deliver excellent performance and create value for our shareholders in 2025 and for the long term.\u201d",

People are less inclined to pay to go listen to original music of bands they don\u2019t know, and prices are sky-high. On the venue side, some operators view tribute bands as a safe bet to fill the house.\n\nIn fact, Petty Rewind plays the Cain Center for the Arts May 9.\n\nOakes was an executive at Altria (formerly Philip Morris) started playing music in 2014 with Antiquity neighbor Nick Elhini.\n\nThe H.C. Oakes Band developed a regional following\u2013with plenty of airplay on WSGE\u2014playing original tunes and covers. The demand for covers was unmistakable.\n\n\u201cA tribute concert is not merely a tribute but a testament to the enduring power of music and its ability to transcend time. By paying homage through immersive live performances, fans can experience the magic again and keep the spirit of beloved musicians alive,\u201d Oakes says.\n\nMembers of Petty Rewind, in addition to Oakes and Elhini, include Paul Marshburn, Mike Robertson and Tommy Keys.

( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Frederic de Wilde, the President of South & Southeast Asia recently netted about US$2.2m selling shares at an average price of US$145. That's a big disposal, and it decreased their holding size by 18%, which is notable but not too bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhilip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Non-Executive Chairman, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$13m worth of shares, at about US$130 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$144. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.6% of Andre Calantzopoulos's holding.\n\nIn the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$308m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold Philip Morris International shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

            "content": "Italy Implements Cigarette Price Hikes Starting February 2025 New tax laws trigger additional costs for smokers across popular brands, raising affordability concerns.\n\nStarting February 8, 2025, smokers across Italy will see another rise in the cost of cigarettes as the country implements substantial price increases on many brands, including Camel, Winston, and Benson. This follows another hike just weeks prior on January 23, which had already left many smokers feeling the pinch.\n\nThe latest price adjustments have sparked frustration among consumers and tobacco retailers alike, who are grappling with the financial strain of these continual increases. According to the latest updates from the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (ADM), smokers can expect to pay 6 euros for Camel blue and white packs and 5.50 euros for Winston red, silver, and blue variants.\n\nThe recent price increments originate from legislative changes aimed at increasing taxes on tobacco. The Italian government has acted to raise the fixed excise duty on cigarettes from 28.20 euros to 29.50 euros for every thousand units sold. This tax hike is part of the broader economic measures issued under the 2023 and 2024 Budget Laws.\n\nEarlier February saw already existing brands like Marlboro, Philip Morris, and Chesterfield register similar price hikes earlier this year. Smokers are now faced with steep costs, as individual packs now range from about 5.50 to 6.50 euros, depending on the brand and type.\n\n\"I don't know how long I can keep up with these prices,\" expressed local smokers burdened by the financial ramifications. This sentiment reflects across various demographics, highlighting growing concerns over affordability.\n\nThe current situation is not expected to improve, as the increased excise duties are part of Italy's long-term strategy to deter tobacco use for public health. According to government officials, this initiative is aimed at reducing the overall consumption of tobacco by making it less accessible to many households.\n\nFor consumers, the impact is felt on everyday budgets, as reported increases combine to form significant changes over time. The weight of such adjustments may see shifts where some habitual smokers reconsider their choices.\n\nLooking at the cigar market, similar trends are evident, with Balmoral A\u00f1ejo Torpedo Mk 52 now costing 204 euros for 20 and Wintermans Corona packs priced at 8.50 euros for just five. Such increases don't merely affect cigarette smokers, but also those who enjoy cigars, reinforcing the broader taxation policies set by the government.\n\nData released on the ADM's website lists precise costs for each brand, satisfying consumer demand for transparency. Smokers can check the most recent tallies to evaluate their options, reinforcing how these price hikes are pervasive across the smoking spectrum.\n\nDespite the adverse reactions from smokers, the Italian government remains committed to their strategy. \"This is part of the broader strategy to reduce cigarette consumption for public health,\" stated officials. They expect this policy to yield health benefits by making smoking increasingly less appealing financially.\n\nWith the knowledge of these upcoming price hikes, smokers find themselves at a crossroads, weighing the cost against their habits. The continuing rise will challenge many to reconsider their relationship with tobacco and may lead to increased advocacy for cessation support.\n\nThese latest price hikes are just another chapter in the complex narrative surrounding tobacco consumption and regulation within Italy. Looking to the future, as the country tightens its grip on tobacco taxes, both smokers and the industry must adapt to the realities of this financial burden.\n\nWhile these legislative changes are prompting expected pushbacks from those within the smoking community, the response from various segments of society remains to be seen as the country navigates through these price adjustments for the foreseeable future.",

So do Eagles fan Sylvester Stallone and Phillies principal owner John Middleton.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Eagles win Super Bowl 59, deny Chiefs chance at historic three-peat The Philadelphia Eagles got the best of Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 59, preventing the latter's chance at a historic three-peat. Sports Pulse\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are once again Super Bowl champions, dominating the Kansas City Chiefs with their 40-22 win Jan. 9 in New Orleans.\n\nAnd while the Eagles' victory was a cause for jubilation in the City of Brotherly Love, the team also has strong ties to Palm Beach through majority owner Jeffrey Lurie.\n\nLurie is known to spend time at his Palm Beach mansion on the Intracoastal Waterway, about a quarter-mile south of The Mar-a-Lago Club, the home of President Donald Trump.\n\nWe've rounded up some details about Lurie\u2019s lavish Palm Beach digs, plus a look at a couple of other the town's homeowners who have strong feelings about Philadelphia \u2014 Hollywood icon Sylvester Stallone, whose film character Rocky Balboa made those stairs outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art famous; and John S. Middleton, principal owner of the Philadelphia Phillies major-league baseball franchise.\n\nEagles owner's Palm Beach estate faces a bird sanctuary, believe it or not\n\nLurie is one of at least 65 billionaires who have a house in Palm Beach or other residential ties to the wealthy island town,\n\nLurie\u2019s vacation mansion faces the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Beach on the stretch of coastal road known to locals as Billionaires Row. It\u2019s an apt spot for Lurie who, with his family, has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $5.3 billion.\n\nRead more: Trump appears headed to Palm Beach this weekend before Super Bowl, per FAA notice\n\nLurie\u2019s ownership company bought the house for a recorded $28.75 million in 2013, six months after he married Tina Lai. The previous year, he and his then-wife, Lori Christina Weiss, divorced and she retained a minority ownership stake in the Eagles as part of their settlement. Jeffrey Lurie still has an 85% ownership stake.\n\nCompleted in 2008, the Palm Beach estate fronts 185 feet of waterfront and comprises nearly 2 acres. The mansion encompasses 17,113 square feet of living space, inside and out, Palm Beach County property records show.\n\nThe home offers wide views of the Intracoastal Waterway from every major room, and was designed for entertaining with extensive open-air loggias, one of which features a fireplace, according to a previous sales listing.\n\nWith a dock, the property faces an island in the Intracoastal Waterway that is a designated Audubon bird sanctuary \u2014 which seems especially appropriate for the owner of Eagles.\n\nNo word if the estate has a home theater among its amenities. Lurie\u2019s maternal grandfather, Philip Smith, founded the General Cinema theater chain, which eventually became Harcourt General. Lurie, a former college professor who holds a doctorate in social policy from Boston University, bought the Eagles in 1994 from Norman Braman for a reported $195 million, using a $190 million loan with his mother to do it.\n\nYo, the Stallone estate in Palm Beach has its own sandy beach\n\nStallone, who owns a lakefront estate on the North End of Palm Beach, has made no secret that he is a heavyweight fan of the Eagles and Philadelphia. The first \u201cRocky\u201d movie in 1976 kickstarted his film career. There\u2019s even a statue of Stallone as Rocky at the base of those steps at the city\u2019s art museum, where the character trained for boxing by running up and down, just as thousands of tourists do each year.\n\nStallone posted an Instagram video of the start of the Eagles' Jan. 26 NFC Championship game against the Washington Commanders, with the theme for \"Rocky\" being played in Lincoln Financial Field. Philadelphia won, 55-23, setting up a rematch with the Chiefs, who the Eagles lost to, 38-35, two years ago in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nBut his allegiance to the Eagles goes back even further. In 2018, Stallone posted on Instagram that he was rooting for the Eagles in their third Super Bowl appearance, which capped the 2017 season. The Eagles ended up winning that game, 41-33, against the New England Patriots, a team owned by Robert Kraft, another Palm Beach billionaire resident.\n\nStallone bought his Palm Beach compound in 2020 for $35.375 million, using the Southpaw Trust, a name that nods at his famous left-handedness.\n\nStallone and his wife, Jennifer Flavin Stallone, have made improvements to the Bermuda-style property, which was completed in 2014 on 1\u00bd acres with 253 feet of lakefront featuring a dock and a sandy beach beyond the seawall.\n\nThe estate includes a main house, a separate pool cabana and a guesthouse.\n\nPhillies' Middleton completed seaside custom mansion in 2015\n\nPhiladelphia native, tobacco heir and billionaire Middleton \u2014 the majority owner of the Phillies with a 48% stake \u2014 completed his custom Palm Beach estate on 1.8 oceanfront acres in 2015.\n\nMiddleton used a limited lability company in 2010 to buy the vacant property at 947 N. Ocean Blvd. for $19.32 million from Kraft, who had once considered building his own estate there.\n\nKnown as Turtle Bluff, Middleton\u2019s British Colonial-style house faces about 215 feet of shoreline and has extensively landscaped gardens \u2014 so extensive that in 2019, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach recognized the property with its major landscape award.\n\nThe grounds include two swimming pools, fountains and a lily pond. The house itself has five bedrooms and 25,390 square feet of living space, inside and out.\n\nForbes estimates Middleton\u2019s net worth at $4.1 billion. Married to Leigh Middleton, he sold his family\u2019s tobacco business in 2007 to Philip Morris\u2019 parent company, Altria, for $2.9 billion.\n\n*\n\nPortions of this story were published previously in the Palm Beach Daily News.\n\nPalm Beach Post reporter John Bisognano contributed to this story.\n\ndhofheinz@pbdailynews.com\n\nDarrell Hofheinz is a USA TODAY Network of Florida journalist who writes about Palm Beach real estate in his weekly \u201cBeyond the Hedges\u201d column.

            "content": "Ben Shuleva from Fidelity Investments anticipates a return to normalcy for the consumer staples sector in 2025. He suggests this based on a broadly stable economic environment with healthy employment and steady real wage growth. In addition, the Fed is expected to begin cutting interest rates, which could boost dividend-paying stocks. Lastly, consumer spending has remained strong and is expected to remain resilient in 2025, thereby indicating positive sales growth for the sector. Shuleva anticipates that these factors will lead the sector to outperform the broader market in 2025. However, there could be a few uncertainties that could hamper the growth trajectory. The new presidential administration may introduce changes in tariff policies, which could affect certain consumer staples products. Although most consumer staples are manufactured domestically, so the direct impact of tariffs might be limited. Moreover, a strengthening US dollar can negatively affect consumer staples companies with international operations by reducing their foreign earnings when converted back into dollars. Shuleva emphasizes focusing on core fundamentals when investing in consumer staple companies, such as those operating in favorable market structures and maintaining strong underlying growth profiles.\n\nOn December 10, 2024, Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager shared his outlook for the sector in a report published on Fidelity Investments. The consumer staples sector had a positive year but lagged behind the broader market due to investors favoring higher-growth stocks. The high interest rates and concerns about GLP-1 weight-loss drugs affecting food consumption also impacted performance negatively. However, despite these challenges, the sector still posted strong absolute gains. Compared to the S&P 500 index the consumer staple sector gained 16.7% on a year-to-date basis as of December 9, whereas the S&P 500 index gained 26.9% during the same time.\n\nConsumer staples refer to essential daily-use products such as packaged food, toothpaste, and dish detergent. These products often run out quickly off the supermarket shelves and are considered \u201cdefensive\u201d because consumers continue to purchase these necessities even during economic downturns. Moreover, consumer staple companies are mostly mature dividend payers.\n\nWe recently published a list of 12 Best FMCG Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo complete the list of the 12 best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. We selected pure-play Fast-Moving Consumer Goods-producing companies from the holdings of these two ETFs and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them at the close of the third quarter. The number of hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter 2024 database.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) the Best FMCG Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a leading global tobacco company. Its product portfolio includes cigarettes and smoke-free products, which include heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products. On January 31, Eric Serotta from Morgan Stanley initiated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $140. The company has been undergoing a strategic transformation towards smoke-free products to reduce smoking-related health risks.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter results for 2024, which were released recently, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) reported revenue of $9.71 billion, exceeding analyst expectations by 2.8%. The company acquired Swedish Match back in November 2022 to enhance its portfolio with the ZYN brand, later FDA authorized all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed in the US. During the quarter its smoke-free segment accounted for 40% of total net revenues and around 42% of gross profit. The segment growth was driven by strong performances from IQOS and ZYN nicotine pouches. Looking ahead, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) expects an adjusted EPS between $7.04 and $7.17, indicating potential growth up to about 9% compared to previous estimates. It is the best FMCG stock to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nBroyhill Asset Management stated the following regarding Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) gained 21% in Q3. Philip Morris was by far the largest contributor for the quarter. Our core thesis focuses on the shift in business mix from combustible cigarettes towards reduced risk products as well as the company\u2019s re-entry to the US market with its acquisition of Swedish Match. This year, Zyn has become wildly popular. So much so that the company can barely keep it in stock, even as it expands production. We recently discussed how youth usage of these products, a common critique of the company, remains under 2%, even as its overall popularity drives higher volume.\u201d\n\nOverall, PM ranks 1st on our list of best FMCG stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Sometimes, in the thicket of your SBIFF fest-going daily plan, themes can seemingly pop up serendipitously. Early on Friday, some of us encountered that situation at the Riviera Theater, where two successive films dealt persuasively with subjects involving governmental misdeeds and brutal crackdowns from radically different points in history and geography.\n\nWaves is a clean and well-crafted Czech drama chronicling the Soviet military action responding with tanks and bloody siege to the Prague Spring in 1968. Errol Morris\u2019s fine new film Separation is a ground level investigation and indictment of the Trump-ian family separation tragedy at our southern border during his first term. It\u2019s not a leap to find common narrative threads between these two films. A certain f-word, \u201cfascism,\u201d hovers overhead.\n\nSeparation qualifies as a must watch film, regardless of political bent \u2014 assuming the viewer has a fundamental empathy for children. Morris once again proves his mastery as a documentary stylist, deftly blending objective reportage, storytelling instincts, and cinematic flair. He inserts himself subtly into the process, in sharp contrast to another American documentary virtuoso, Frederick Wiseman (who, incidentally, had a surprise cameo in the SBIFF\u2019s opening film, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life).\n\n\u2018Separated\u2019| Credit: Courtesy\n\nThe lucid and startling power of Separated, exposing the barbaric \u201czero tolerance policy of Trump,\u201d relies on a tightly woven fabric of incisive interviews, especially with news clips and archival footage and, for a more personal humanizing touch, an initially questionable but ultimately impressive dramatization of a Guatemalan mother and son making the perilous trek to the U.S. border. Once there, they are subjected to the draconian separation policy allegedly designed by Stephen Miller and Thomas Homan, the current \u201cbad hombre\u201d ICE-man. Adding an extra layer of drama inside the machine Intel, unclassified emails and texts are typed out and suggest the evil scheming unfolding in real time.\n\nFamiliar Morris elements are in place, including a calculatedly bland but coolly emotive music score from Philip Glass and Morris\u2019s signature use of the \u201cInterrotron\u201d camera setup in interviews, but these artistic touches can seem a bit slick and distracting in the face of the dire subject at hand, a subject which could once again become valid in the next four years. Consider Separated a piece of historical record but also a kind of cautionary horror story.\n\nIn writer-director Ji\u0159\u00ed M\u00e1dl\u2019s Waves, we get a long arc of a narrative leading up to the \u201cthawing\u201d of Czech government and the heady \u201cPrague Spring,\u201d building up from roots in 1967 and clamped down by the arrival of Soviet bloc military in the streets of Prague in 1968. The story is told through the prism of brave media coverage of Czech Radio. Student revolts are met with bloody police response and censorship rears its ugly head, but the radio freedom soldiers on. Giving a more flesh-and-blood angle to the larger story, a radio engineer (Vojt\u011bch Vodochodsk\u00fd, looking like David Bowie\u2019s straighter brother) is tempted into service as a mole on the radio team, to stave off secret police threats to his younger brother. At some point, the solidarity-building radio airwaves are forced to function from underground.\n\n\u2018Waves\u2019| Credit: Courtesy\n\nWaves is an engaging and entertaining historical-political thriller, with some of the usual genre cliches and manipulative tactics, reminiscent of the East Germany Stasi\u2013related Lives of Others. But the film also serves the valuable function of filling in historical blanks in knowledge of the Prague Spring and its sobering aftermath, especially among westerners.\n\nBiking to Work\n\nFor something completely more innocent \u2014 or relatively so \u2014 a packed and rapt crowd filled the Film Center #2 theater later on Friday for the delightful variation on the \u201crock doc\u201d theme, The Song Cycle, written, directed, starring and all about Nick Kelly. No, this had nothing to do with song cycles of the sort Schubert wrote, but a multi-pronged concept cooked up by veteran Irish musician Nick Kelly, formerly of the band The Fat Lady Sings. His film had its U.S. premiere at SBIFF, and the crowd approved heartily.\n\nKelly\u2019s idea was to actually book a mini-tour from his home in Dublin on bicycle with an old musician ally, on their way to a humble opening slot at the legendary Glastonbury Festival in Wales, where the first of two gigs was actually on his 60th birthday.\n\nKelly and his compact belongings \u2014 guitar, tent, ultra-light camera gear, and a few essentials \u2014 tooled along country roads and stopped in several stops, pub gigging along the path \u2014 sometimes a challengingly hilly path at that. An important underscoring theme of the film and overall project concerned climate change and the awareness of reducing carbon footprints, an issue for touring bands and other living organisms and organizations.\n\nThe charismatic, confessional, and witty Irishman showed up for one of the more creative post-screening Q&A sessions, with bicycle and guitar in tow. Before busting out his green acoustic guitar and performing the touching song about his father, \u201cRepublic,\u201d Kelly spoke about surprising thematic links in his pet project.\n\n\u201cAs you get older,\u201d he said, \u201cas you somehow managed to not become the next U2, and are just demographically unlikely to do that, you can kind of feel \u2018is there any point at all to what you do? Are you just fooling yoursel?\u2019\n\n\u201cI started to think that was kind of a parallel about how we feel about climate change and how, even not as artists but as humans as we get older, we feel useless and not able to add much. I don\u2019t believe it and I think it\u2019s really important. There aren\u2019t enough young people to fix this problem. Unfortunately, we\u2019re all going to have to get involved in this and group efforts, people of a certain age are all going to have to get involved as well.\n\n\u201cSo I started to think about these things and it all sort of joined up for me.\u201d",

            "content": "Citi analyst Simon Hales reiterated a Buy rating on Philip Morris (PM \u2013 Research Report) today and set a price target of $163.00.\n\nSimon Hales has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors, primarily the strong performance and positive future outlook for Philip Morris. The company has shown remarkable growth towards the end of 2024, and the forecast for 2025 indicates continued strength. Notably, there is an expected 10.1% growth in heated tobacco unit volumes and significant expansion in the US nicotine pouch market.\n\nFurthermore, Philip Morris\u2019s robust revenue and margin growth in both combustible and smokeless products contribute to the positive outlook. Despite a slightly increased tax rate, the company\u2019s earnings per share are projected to rise, with an upgraded forecast compared to previous guidance. The increased capacity for Zyn products in the US and the ongoing expansion of gross margins are expected to sustain this growth, leading to an updated price target of $163. These factors collectively underpin the Buy rating, highlighting a favorable risk to earnings profile.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Hales is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 4.3% and a 57.61% success rate. Hales covers the Consumer Defensive sector, focusing on stocks such as Diageo, Altria Group, and Philip Morris.\n\nIn another report released today, Bank of America Securities also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $160.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

The company said this was fueled by Zyn nicotine pouch growth in the U.S. Shipments in the U.S. reached nearly 165 million cans, representing growth of nearly 42% versus prior year, the company said.\n\n\u201cOur smoke-free business is large, profitable and growing fast,\u201d CEO Jacek Olczak told investors on the earnings call.\n\nLast month the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued marketing granted orders to 20 Zyn nicotine pouch products. Philip Morris International bought Zyn maker Swedish Match North America in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe long-awaited U.S. FDA authorization of all Zyn nicotine pouches currently marketed in the U.S. is further evidence of the compelling science supporting smoke-free products,\u201d Olczak said. \u201cWe hope our other pending FDA applications will be accelerated. We also hope other countries follow the example of the U.S. and embrace effective tobacco harm reduction measures.\u201d\n\nOlczak said that the FDA authorization is especially important in places outside the U.S. where smoke-free products are banned, resulting in the perpetuation of combustible cigarette consumption.\n\nPMI\u2019s global corporate headquarters is in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nMembers help make our journalism possible.

No significant new market openings are assumed in the guidance, and growth is expected to be organic from existing markets.\n\nQ: What are your expectations for margin improvements, and how do investments impact this?\n\nA: Emmanuel Babeau explained that they expect margin improvements driven by pricing contributions and economies of scale. Investments in new markets and products are ongoing, but they anticipate positive contributions from these investments over time.\n\nQ: How do you view the growth potential for ZYN in the US, given current supply constraints?\n\nA: Emmanuel Babeau noted that despite supply constraints, demand for ZYN remains strong. They expect production capacity to improve in the second half of 2025, which should help meet demand and potentially improve pricing dynamics.\n\nQ: Can you provide insights into the impact of the EU characterizing flavor ban on your business?\n\nA: Emmanuel Babeau mentioned that the flavor ban has caused some disruption, particularly in Italy and Poland. However, they expect a gradual recovery as consumers adjust to the new regulations.\n\nQ: What is your outlook for smoke-free product growth and its impact on overall company performance?\n\nA: Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, emphasized that smoke-free products are expected to drive significant growth, with a focus on expanding their presence in the US and internationally. The company aims to achieve sustainable growth and improve margins through their smoke-free portfolio.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

Over to you, Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone. We delivered an outstanding performance in 2024, with all key elements of the business, contributing strongly to deliver best-in-class organic scope, and bottom-line growth. There has resulted in significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in both currency neutral and, equally importantly, dollar terms as we mitigated substantial currency headwinds. Our business outperformed the industry and consumer packaged goods overall, with growth across all categories, to deliver our fourth consecutive year of positive volumes. IQOS continued its strong underlying momentum with continued excellent growth in Japan, robust progress in Europe despite the EU characterizing flavor ban and further strong growth in our global markets.\n\nImportantly, the growth of IQOS is increasingly profitable as the benefits of scale and pricing more than offset continued substantial growth investments including brand building activities, and innovations on devices and consumables. Then once again delivered strong growth in the US as 2023 demand acceleration continued in 2024. This resulted in short-term supply challenges, which we have progressively addressed throughout the year, working towards our goal of matching existing user demand. As we unlock further capacity, we will be in a position to explore the full potential of this dynamic Outside the US, shipments grew by 75% as we increased our global presence in nucup and pouches to 37 markets. Any Vyper. VIV is progressively contributing to growth with encouraging volume momentum in closed spots and strengthening market position with a premium offer.\n\nOur combustible business performed well on all metrics. We delivered double-digit gross profit growth in quarter four of last year, and around 7% organically for the year. Led by strong pricing, resilient volumes in certain markets, and ongoing benefits of our Cost actions. Yeah. Overall, our strong performance across all categories and regions drove meaningful operating leverage, notably in our smoke-free business, alongside cost efficiency initiatives across the entire value This enabled us to deliver over deliver operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS above our expectations at the start of the year despite ongoing currency and input cost headwind. Our transformation journey and growth drivers have excellent momentum and we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and returns in 2025 and beyond.\n\nOver the past year, we achieved several key milestones in our smoke-free journey. Including the ten-year anniversary of IQOS and ZYN. Our smoke-free business is large, profitable, and growing fast. Our total smoke-free net revenues reach almost $15 billion in 2024. Combined with a strong combustible performance our company also surpassed $10 billion in adjusted net earnings for first state. Our smoke-free business reached 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter, and around 42% of adjusted gross profit. As our transformation becomes increasingly profitable. In our top five markets, by operating income, around 60% of net revenues were smoke-free. We have deployed our smoke-free multi-category strategy across almost half of the 95 markets with smoke-free products and we closed the year with over 38.5 million estimated adult users across Kidnodbir, Oral, and e vapor.\n\nOur smoke-free business surpassed one billion pounds including 644 million cans of nicotine pouches. The ZYN brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine consumers across the US, where it is the number one smoke-free brand and the fourth biggest nicotine brand and also grows international. We\u2019re also very pleased that the robust science and responsible marketing practices behind ZYN were recognized by FDA through the recent marketing authorization of all currently commercial commercialized US invasions. Making ZYN the first and the only authorized nicotine pouch brand in the United States. We remain at the forefront of the effort to increase understanding of smoke-free products and advanced tobacco harm reductions among consumers and regulators.\n\nWe are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopt adopting tobacco reduction policies to incentivize switching to reduce nicotine product instead of containing to smoke. Which is a sound public health policy. A number of markets also moving favorably with regards to robust regulation of nicotine pouches and evapro. Now regretfully, there is also resistance in many places, often driven by ideology not fact and science and therefore a considerable amount of work it\u2019s stealing from the bus. While reaching important milestones is pleasing, after ten years, we are still in the early stages of transformation. With our strong brands and our innovative and commercial capabilities, we have many years of opportunities and growth ahead. I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming CAGNY conference on February nineteenth.\n\nI will now hand over to Emmanuel to this discuss our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you, Jacek. I will start with the headline financials for the year. As Jacek said, this was a truly outstanding year of growth across our business, as the rapid progress of IQOS and USIN was complemented by emerging growth contribution from Veeve and ZYN internationally at a much improved combustible performance. We delivered in line or above our last communicated expectation across KeyMetrix. Organic net revenue growth of plus 9.8% adjusted IMS and shipments of HTUs, and convertible pricing of plus 8.7% were strong. Excellent total shipment volume growth of plus 2.9%, including zinc and combustible volumes performed at the top end of our expectation. Coupled with accelerated cost efficiencies this led to better than expected plus 14.9% organic operating income growth and plus 15.6% currency neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.\n\nOur clear focus on delivering performance in dollar terms was reflected in the plus 9.3% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As a result, we achieved record operating cash flow of $12.2 billion which was significantly above both our initial and most recent forecast supported by excellent profit delivery and favorable working capital. Combined with strong adjusted EBITDA, this allowed us to significantly improve our leverage ratio which I\u2019ll come back to Later. We closed the year strongly in Q4 with organic net revenue growth of plus 7.3% despite the impact of timing and comparison effect most notably related to red sea disruption the EU characterizing favor ban for HTUs and prelaunch Iluma iDevice shipments. This was driven by total volume growth of plus 2.3% alongside positive smoke-free mix and robust pricing.\n\nNow Combined with the operating leverage and manufacturing efficiencies, we delivered close to plus 12% organic operating income growth and plus 10% currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income increased plus 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew plus 14% to $1.55 This includes a positive currency impact of six cents which reflects an unfavorable transactional impact in the prior year in Argentina as well as a move to hyperinflationary accounting in Egypt, which also a negative impact on our organic growth of around one point on net revenues and two points on operating income. So The noncash impairment of our RBH equity investment had no impact on our adjusted financials. In future, we may benefit from Airbnb\u2019s dividend income but we do not include any impact in our 2025 forecast at this time.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and consider 2024 in the context of the last few years. Our organic top line delivery has been consistently strong since the pandemic and further accelerated this year as both smoke-free product and combustible step up than combustible step up their trajectory. Clearly, 2024 was all also a standout year for adjusted diluted EPS growth. The profitability of our smoke-free business accelerated due to the operating leverage of IQOS increasing scale favorable unit economics, pricing, efficiency, and the impressive accretion from ZYN\u2019s rapid growth at superior US margins. We also benefited from a notably robust combustible performance which provide important structural support for our transformation journey. These dynamics are further demonstrated by the organic top line and gross profit growth of both category in the year.\n\nOur smoke-free business accelerated to plus 17% net revenue growth and plus 23% gross profit growth reaching close to $10 billion in gross profit. This drove an impressive plus 330 basis points of organic gross margin expansion fueled by the factors I just mentioned. On the combustible side, net revenue and gross profit grew organically by plus 6% and plus 7% respectively, leading to plus 60 basis point of organic gross margin expansion. Our combustible business is once again contributing positively with pricing and cost efficiency more than compensating for the third year of significant input cost headwinds which we expect to ease in 2025. I would also note that adjusted gross margin for smoke-free product were plus 490 basis points higher than combustible in Q4.\n\nAnd plus 270 basis points higher for the year overall at 66.6%. While we continue to target gross margin expansion in combustible, we expect this gap to grow over time as we continue to drive profitable growth from smoke-free product, investing in new market Brand building. And innovation. Taking a a closer look now at our volume performance, we delivered our fourth consecutive year of shipment growth up plus 2.3% in the fourth quarter and close to plus 3% for the full year. Including our viv e vapor business in equivalent unit This growth was plus 2.4% and plus 3% respectively. Our total 2024 smoke-free volume growth including Viiv was plus 13.5% or 19 billion unit equivalent acceleration compared to 2023. For IQOS, we delivered HTU adjusted in market sales growth of close to 13% and shipment volumes of 139.7 billion both broadly in line with our expectation.\n\nAdjusted IMS growth accelerated in h two to close to 14%, essentially in line with our target of plus 14% to plus 15%. This includes dynamic growth of close to plus 11% in Europe with strong momentum across the large majority of markets. As I touched on earlier, q four HTU shipment growth includes the impact of additional shipment in the prior year to prepare for the EU characterizing flavor ban and the phasing effect of additional shipment to Japan in h one notably due to retail disruption. Our oral smoke-free business grew 2024 shipment volume by plus 24.6% including ZYN\u2019s US growth of plus 51% to 581 million cans. Snuff and moist snuff volumes were stable. Cigarette shipments grew by plus 0.6% approximately in line with the estimated growth of the international industry.\n\nThe growth of the cigarette market can be largely attributed to growth in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted such as Turkey, Brazil, and India. Excluding such markets, we observe a low single digit decline consistent with historic trends. Our strong full year top line growth of almost plus 10% was again achieved through a combination of volume growth, pricing, and the positive mix impact of the shift to smoke-free product. Pricing contributed plus 6.2% reflecting almost plus 9% combustible pricing and plus 2% for smooth free product. Smoke free also drove a positive mix impact of plus 1.9% with with higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS HD overall smoke free product contributed plus 2.2% to overall group top line growth for the year demonstrating Jean\u2019s role as a meaningful accelerator As in prior years, geographically, was negative primarily due to combustible, but to a lesser degree given robust networking growth Moving down to adjusted operating margins, we delivered full year organic expansion of plus 180 basis points and plus 100 digits points in dollar terms, comfortably achieving our objective of extension on both basis.\n\nThis reflects one q four with OI margin expanding organically by plus 140 basis points, As gross margin expansion, I will create SG and A investment. Full year gross margin increased organically by plus 160 basis points and by plus 120 basis points in dollar term. SG and A grew plus 20 basis points of margin expansion enabled by cost efficiency action despite significant reinvestment commercial support, Vienna was moved to the next and US capabilities. Especially We delivered over $750 million in gross cost efficiency for the year, discuss productivity across more free and combustible, and continue back office savings. This places us well on track for our twenty four, twenty six target of $2 billion. Focusing on our smoke free business. We grew our estimated user base by over five million people in 2024, Reached approximately 38.6 million legal edge users as of December the first.\n\nThis includes an estimated certificate of two million IT users five point seven million forward users, and one million users. I am pleased to report robust iCUSE growth of plus three point four million dollars versus prior year, and plus one point five million during This growth is both based and consistent with recent years, despite limited new market opening and the easy characterizing Facebook bank. Overall, added plus one point five million user year on year driven by this continued strong traction with legalized nicotine consumer in the US, despite the flight concern. Zooming in now on IQOS. Home user momentum is reflected in adjusted IMS volume with 2024 growth of over 16 billion units in line with the prior year despite This growth is also in line with the five year average and more than one billion units above when excluding contributions from markets launched in the current fiscal year.\n\nImportantly, following the rollout of HycoCinema and with increased scale of the business, the profitability of Sycos is growing strongly. In in this way, this here with the index product contribution over time as compared to January. As we\u2019ve explained before, the outcome cost of the business to consumer operation results in declining in passive per per user over time as the user can grow in the market. This is a dynamic We expect to continue in the future. Turning to IQOS in Europe. As expected, HTU adjusted IMS growth accelerated strongly in HP to almost plus 11% following h one progression of around 80%. This resulted in robust plus 9% focus on growth overall for the year, despite the significant disruption, of the characterizing This double digit adjusted aims gross image was driven by strong progress, in the last number of markets including growth of around 20% or more in markets such as Bulgaria, Greece, Germany, Romania, and Spain.\n\nWhile growth was less dynamic, in Poland, Czech Republic. Recovery in Italy is ongoing following the discipline of the paper band. Although at a slightly slower pace than expected, The continued momentum in the region drove q four. I just share growth of plus zero point nine point zero net to ten point six percent with adjusted IMS volume reaching thirteen point five billion units on the fourth quarter moving average. Inflow shipment volume increased by just six percent against prior comparison, which included additional volumes related to the implementation of the standard band notably limited. The is now receiving all that speech you mark it? This is a generally consistent pattern of short term disruption followed by a return to the prebound growth trajectory.\n\nFollowing an impact of around two billion units in 2024 we expected a 2025 impact of around one billion on goods shipment and IMS including annualization effect is the most prominent effect in the first in the first quarter of 2025. We also continue to roll out the I device and new consumer variants such as Vydia and Vydia to more market providing an increasing test profile and press one button. Looking at the toxicity of textures in Europe, we reached a number of important milestones with Budapest achieving over 40% share, Rome over 30%, and London approaching 10%, and is Madrid not far behind. Japan delivered outstanding results yet again with adjusted IMS growth of close to plus 13% in both the quarter and the full year to reach an adjusted P4 share of thirty point six Let\u2019s three point one point Hi, Eur.\n\nYear on year. This was supported by continued schedules of Tera and Thinka, as well as a positive fraction of the IQOS Filima I device as we reach over nine point five million adult users. Cost per share in Tokyo for the overall entertainment category Which fifty two point eight percent in December. With the addition of cheese vodka and Amamad Suites in the ten cities and five pictures. Exceeding the fifty percent share On the National of Tech Davis, forty seven percent of the total industry is now Outside of Europe and Japan, adjusted in market sales continued to grow slowly in q four. Promising growth in a number of markets will be respected by TCT shares in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Mexico. Continuous innovation is a key driver of these goals, with stereo variant and capsule in Indonesia driving an up list in the quarter and some good initial results from the trial of Wound our lower tie our lower tier offering.\n\nIQOS continues to perform well in payroll, though off the chair performance was impacted by the dynamic of the convertible market, where competitors supply normalize and the very strong prior quarter following the long I will get the free HP of the chair increase Nike. As we start to harness the strength of our multi category portfolio, drive sales of IQOS, v Yeah. That\u2019s Coming out to the US where our IQOS would be the first complain campaign in your team is progressing well. And we expect to comment direct sales of device and HPE in our spin around the end of q one. We are seeing high interest from consumers with over four thousand added smoker on our way. As we learn from this initial consumer engagement, We are planning the rollout of pilot for the city.\n\nAs you know, Steve, our focus will be on selective adult consumer engagement and giving awareness to category and brand education in the legal edge market community. We do not assume any significant volume from US IQOS before the at the launch of IQOS Illumina. And we continue to hope for an every authorization in HP 2025. Teaching categories now to ZYN where we continue the where continuous demand supported q four new achievement going growth of plus forty two Sent you on mute. One hundred and sixty five million cap. Despite ongoing production limitation, this reflects an acceleration to a new record sequential increase of plus sixty million ten hundred sixty three. On a full year basis, shipment volumes grew by plus one hundred and ninety six million tons versus 2023.\n\nHighlighting both the magnitude of growth and the tremendous effort made to maximize our pollution capacity. Win category share incrementally improved to the second ad reaching sixty five point nine percent in q four as we progress in increasing production further supported the growth of the category. Indeed. Category goes slow to me considering the summer peak of our supply constraint as shown on this chart. As the situation started to gradually improve, ZYN was again leading and outpacing the category. I am pleased to share that underlying demand for games from adult continued to grow in q four. And was higher than previously as We continue to experience some out of stock at retail, And while production capacity continues to increase, we now target full normalization sometime in the second half of 2025.\n\nWe continue to target around nine hundred million tons of for the full year from our Kensington facility And as supply continues to improve, we will look to further extend growth beyond our existing consumer base to other legal entities. Our greenfield site, which is what I do, is due to come online in early twenty And we believe we are well positioned to capture this potential over the coming years. Responsible regulation of the industry is fundamental in supporting sustainable future growth for the dynamic category. We are therefore encouraged by the recent FDA authorization for the marketing and sale of all the nicotine pouches currently marketed in the US, following extensive As mentioned, this makes them the first and only authorized pet in the market.\n\nAmong several consideration, we have a substantially lower amount of harmful constituent that\u2019s fixed. And all the smokeless tobacco product as well as current low use cigarette lighter. The FDA\u2019s authorization marks an important step in the protection of public health by recognizing the role that Bing can play in providing better alternative direct and other traditional tobacco product or legal edge either. We remain committed to driving industry standard in the twenty one prevention. This policy and initiative designed to help prevent this access. Further, combating trade initiative that co an interesting product remain a core priority and we dedicate a significant level of resources is performed before. ZYN, also has an exciting future outside of video.\n\nWhile still in its very early stages. International nicotine pulp shipments grew by twenty seven million tons or plus seventy five percent And we already see strong volume momentum in international market which is Pakistan, South Africa, Mexico, the UK, and Google, We launched nicotine vouchers in six new market during the quarter, reached a total of thirty seven worldwide including Italy, Romania, Using e vapor, we continue to see strong consumer traction behind Vibone. The brand holds the top sweet post proposition in thirteen European market, and add the number one position in five including Italy. V plays an important role within our multi category strategy as an increasingly trusted choice for small group category fully users as a source of incremental growth is improving Our primary focus for the combustible business is to maximize value over time while supporting the growth of the smoothivity.\n\nPricing and cost efficiency are the key leaders, drive performance, while maintaining our category leadership. We delivered another robust volume quarter with growth of plus one point one percent. All regions contributed to twenty four organic net revenue growth, of plus six point two percent is gross profit increasing by ten point eight Full year pricing of plus eight point seven percent includes contributions from Germany, and thirteen. We expect organic twenty twenty five predictable pricing to normalize to plus five to plus six percent past year reflecting GDP to higher inflationary accounting. In twenty twenty four. Category share was flat in q four with positive contribution from Turkey and India. Offset by decline in Egypt and Indonesia, with continued growth in the below tier one segment.\n\nOn a full year basis, we grew category share plus zero point one points. Reaching all time high for both Marlboro and our global brands This brings me to the outlook for 2025. Where we expect another year of strong growth from all categories driving stuff, and bottom line delivery. We anticipate the fifth consecutive year of positive volumes with growth of up to plus two percent notably driven by another year of strong growth in smoke free products, at around plus twelve percent to plus fourteen percent. So I close we expect the continuation of strong momentum with the absolute growth in HPU adjusted IMS volume expected to be at a similar level to 2024, translating\n\nJames Bushnell: ten percent.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: The the expression goes We expect shipping growth to be broadly in line with this double digit trajectory subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing inventory. We expect ongoing strong growth dynamic within the US in cutting pouch category. Despite the supply constraint I mentioned before, we forecast a US in volume shipment range of seven eighty to eight hundred and twenty million tons for the year, supported by capacity expansion. This represents another year of sequential acceleration in volumes with an expected increase of opportunity two hundred to two hundred and forty million cans compared to the one hundred and ninety six million can increase This supports the total TMI forecast of plus six to plus eight percent organic net revenue growth.\n\nThis includes a headwind of over a hundred basis points due to higher inflationary accounting energy, and the technical impact of implementing a new financial model in Indonesia below tier one premium. The change in Indonesia has no effect on the. Moving down to the p and l, we expect ongoing small clinic effect operating leverage and cost efficiency, to drive double digit adjusted operating growth, operating the growth. Of plus ten point five and plus twelve point five. This includes single spot gross With those gross and adjusted operating margin forecast to expand in both organic and adjusted the last term. At seventy six hundred. We expect SG and A cost to increase increase broadly in line with net revenue on an organic basis as we invest behind our small ticket.\n\nWe forecast currency neutral adjusted, deleted, EPS growth of plus ten point five percent\n\nJames Bushnell: and plus twelve point five percent.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: This factor is in essentially stable net interest expense and an increase in our Corporate tax rate to approximately twenty two point five to twenty two point five percent due to tax increases in language OECD plus the global minimum tax. And the mix of international earnings. In dollar terms. We forecast growth of plus seven plus nine percent to a range of seven that are four to seven the last seventeen. This includes an unfavorable forecast currency impact of twenty two cents at revenue exchange rate percent, primarily driven by the growth trends of the Bellard mitigated by our AGI For the first quarter of 2025, we expect a strong start to the year with net revenue and operating income growth growing in line with our full year objective despite the leap year comparison.\n\nWe forecast HTU adjusted INR growth of around plus ten percent which factors in the large annualization impact from the easing weather ban in the quarter with a progressive improvement Goody. We forecast shipment volume of thirty five to thirty six billion for HPUs and one hundred seventy one hundred and eighty million times for USU. In project q one adjusted diluted EPS of one dollar fifty eight, one dollar including a negative currency values of four cents at the revenue rate, And then if you incorporate tax rate, two to three points higher than the prior year quarter. These are our 2024 delivery and 2025 outlook, we are well positioned to meet or exceed all metrics of the twenty four, twenty six target targets presented at our twenty twenty two investigate.\n\nThis is especially true at the level of operating income growth. As well as for ECS delivery, where our algorithm assumes instant. This level of top and bottom line growth reflects the best in class growth profile within the context of flash cap consumer technology. Importantly, we\u2019re also well on track to deliver high single digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in dollar term across the twenty twenty four, twenty twenty six period after any Indeed, we measure our cash flows in dollar and after a record delivery in twenty twenty.\n\nJames Bushnell: Four\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: we expect to deliver operating cash flow of around eleven billion dollars, fourteen Thank you. Five. This is forty nine with twenty twenty four. Once accounting costs in nonrecurring payments with a total impact of around one billion dollars. While we continue to achieve the German tax for such space. We have decided to make a zero point eight billion dollar payment this year. And we also anticipate the final transition tax payment rated to the US tax Yes. We anticipate capital expenditure of around one point five billion dollars Is the last portion of this related to you? As we prioritize the investment behind our most successful. Our sprint twenty twenty four cash flow and EBITDA growth combined with a favorable impact from our euro balance sheet AGI, allowed us to reduce our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by zero point five times point sixty six.\n\nAhead of our expectation. And representing a dramatic of power delivery. We expect further progress in twenty twenty five placing us on track for our target ratio of around two times by the end of twenty twenty six. I will now send you back to Yaczek for confirming email.\n\nJacek Olczak: Thank you, Emmanuel. In summary, 2020 was a remarkable year for PMI. Our financial result that comprises this of our strategy and the success of our transformation the underlying momentum it took bolstered by our practice measures and pricing and cost. I remain confident in our position as the global smoke As we continue to identify on our multi category strategy, your premium brand,\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: I cost I\u2019m Our key strategic priorities for 2025 are clear. As we continue to support a function and development of our smoke to business, what is the UI, and international. We expect continued strong momentum in 2025. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our our twenty twenty four, twenty twenty six growth target as we progress towards our ambition of becoming substantially smarter by twenty thirty Finally, and importantly, our strong growth output and highly cost generative business enables us to continuously reinvest in our small footprint transformation while returning cash to shareholders. In September we increased our annual dividend for the seventeenth consecutive year in line with our long term Thank you.

Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith: Yeah. Speaking to Manuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Good morning. May I ask who\u2019s calling?\n\nMatt Smith: The 2025 outlook calls for HTU shipments in\n\nOwen Bennett: in numbers or in market sales growth fairly in line with what you saw in 2024. But could you talk about the the composition of the growth? If it\u2019s overall in line, a different contribution by geography in in your outlook and can you remind us on if there has been any progress in new markets contributing to growth in 2025 or if you\u2019ve made any progress in those markets as you look out to your 2026 goals.\n\nJacek Olczak: Now so in the guidance, our financials continue seeing good growth in Japan. And in the you know, number of parts in Europe, I mean, a manual man about the Italy, Czech, Poland, right, when the group is a a bit below what would expect at this stage, especially Italy and Czech following the the flavored ban But we also see that there is some recovery coming in, so I think you know, hopefully, in the second part of the year, we should bring Italy another geography that part to what the rest of the euro Europe is going through. And we have not, in the guidance, assume any significant new market opening in terms of the volume. As you know, we\u2019ve you know, we\u2019re gonna head into my remarks. Mean, we\u2019re dealing with this rational world, fighting with the irrational world.\n\nI hope that, you know, the most recent authorizations of FDA following the authorizations of Kid Not Birth, now the vouchers. Will be a good incentive or encouragement by other governments which to be very frank, to be stupidly oppose smoke free products while allowing cigarettes. But in the guidance, we have not put any significant volume coming from the new geography. So this is all organic growth, and as you could saw it in the for the quarters of this year, Despite the fact even if you look at Japan when almost half of the market is already on a on a smoke free products, the growth continues there.\n\nOwen Bennett: Thank you, Yasuk. I\u2019ll pass it on.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Monica of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alright. Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel and Yancek. I am No. I\u2019m good. Had a question on your margins. You\u2019re guiding robust\n\nBonnie Herzog: operating leverage on a currency neutral basis. This year. So hoping you could highlight the, you know, some of the key drivers behind this. Also, so I wanted to verify if your guidance assumes a potential entry of a loom US or you know, just possibly continued investments without, you know, any corresponding Sales. And then how should we think about the margin contribution from ILUM in the US and how long it might take after your entries in the market for for those margins to really be meaningful.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe I start, Bonnie, the good morning. Is that I mean, yes. We\u2019re looking for a robust margin, like expansion this year, maybe not precisely to the same level as we had last year, but still it\u2019s gonna be robust searching in a hundred basis points of territory, this is what we\u2019re looking into. Is that, you know, combinations of a few factors, we still looking at the pricing contributions, pretty obvious. There\u2019s obviously positive Mix, right, between a categories and especially now that we have a free smoke free categories, on the positive to margin path including the vape. So, you know, the recircheated. You know, our strategy of going selectively, but you know, with the right impacts in the geographies that is needed in order receiving money, you know, behind if you like or marching behind.\n\nSo this will contribute. And, you know, we\u2019ve had in the past that you remember quite a headwinds headwinds coming from a COGS. And I think those have I think they are behind us. this base here and there, Okay? Then obviously, this whole, you know, conversations especially coming from the US about the tariffs and so on. But, you know, the way we organize our supply chain as you know, US on the ZYN is essentially self sufficient. Our supply chains in Europe I mean, we organized our supply chain almost by blocks, so I don\u2019t see at this at this stage that they should be on a surprises coming on the tariff side. I think we\u2019re pretty confident where we\u2019ll land with the COGS for the year. There is obviously ongoing support coming from the scale of IQOS, especially devices.\n\nWhen the okay. There was a con be of scale. There was a robustness of the device in terms of a quality, etcetera. So we actually don\u2019t have this like, in the past, a bit of a pressure on the margins coming from a device sales. This this we have well stabilized for twenty twenty four towards behind the margin expansion. And I think we we we should expect the same expecting the same in a twenty five. Now your questions with regards to Illuma margins US, okay, maybe one by one, we still expect that hopefully you know, we will get the authorization for I CONSULUMA around the mid of the year. Again, on the one hand, one could read this as encouragement that a As we said, it\u2019s total scientific, etcetera, review FDA has gave authorizations for all variants of the I I wouldn\u2019t be my wouldn\u2019t be myself if I wouldn\u2019t comment that obviously, if something takes five years, it must be thorough because otherwise, I cannot fix explain, you know, the length of the process.\n\nBut I do hope that, you know, FDA We\u2019ll move faster and, you know, already I could do my spending for a while. And by the way, if you have it also authorization, for for Zendesk. So the the margin story, I would repeat my self that, obviously, when we start adding support behind the behind the Lumen, I mean, at the initial period, will be a negative. Right? But in a scheme of the things, in the PNL size equal, like, of our business in the US, I don\u2019t think it should be something which is you know, that much worried. And I believe US will go in the similar path as had on a heat not burning in other places. So two to three years, we should I could should be net net contributor to to the bottom line. Bearing in mind, as always, reminding everyone that we don\u2019t really have the headwind of cannibalization.\n\nRight? So we don\u2019t really we\u2019re we\u2019re we\u2019re in a better starting position. And we know, we had a growing confidence in the ICOSI Lumen international, but we know where ICONZYLUM are brought us on international over the last three years. And it continues, you know, generating the growth user acquisition. So I believe it\u2019s really a great proposition for for adult smokers in the\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Maybe just just to compliment on on the margin side, Bonnie. As you can, you know, judge from our guidance, we have significant ambition in terms of margin improvement in 2025 And what is driving that is the fact that we are flying on several engine here on margin improvement, and everything is coming together put it positively at the same time. So indeed, you know, we have of course, the mix evolution that is very favorable to to to to us with smoke free product coming with a higher margin, and they are growing very fast. Among those multi products, we have the US and ZYN that is growing even faster and which, as we already said, is best in class in terms of margin. So that\u2019s obviously a plus. We\u2019re also increasing price.\n\nYes. Of course. We\u2019re not gonna continue to deliver eight percent plus price increase on combustible, but it\u2019s gonna remain extremely robust. And we also have the ambition to grow our price, not at the same level, but significantly on our smoke free portfolio. And then when we look at our COGS, we are working on productivity. They are scale effect. That are delivering positively And as you know, we were facing until now a significant headwind on cost, notably on the combustible business. This is easing. Twenty five should be better. And twenty six could be even better than than twenty five, by the way. So we are going in the right direction there, and that is making us clearly targeting nice margin improvement both organically and in dollar term for twenty five.\n\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Super helpful. And actually, I\u2019m just gonna ask a quick follow-up because you kinda touched on this, but you also mentioned this morning about, you know, targeting or you continue to target gross margin expansion in combustibles, And then you did say that you expect the gap to grow relative to your smoke free product gross margin. So, you know, previously, you guys have talked about, I think, a ten point gap. So know, as your your gross margins expand on, you know, combustibles, I think what I\u2019m hearing you say is that, you know, not only is that an opportunity, but also continued margin expansion on Smokefree is what you just mentioned. So do you foresee that gap expanding? I mean, does it go to fifteen points? Spread or, you know, could it go to twenty? It\u2019s just kinda trying to think through that in the next couple of years.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Look. On on the consumable, we we\u2019ve already highlighted the fact that there was a ten percentage point gap and and it has been expanding in the last few years. So, indeed, we have the ambition to do better on, the gross margin for combustible, and we explained why. But as we continue to progress also rapidly on smooth free products, and both, you know, with the mix effect coming from from ZYN, but separately on IQOS and and and ZYN, we want to continue to progress. So we could have indeed a gap that could continue to expand between smoke free product and and combustible in the in the coming years.\n\nBonnie Herzog: Alright. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Thank you, Ben.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Grav Jay of\n\nGaurav Jain: Good morning. Emmanuel and Jace.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you for asking my questions.\n\nGaurav Jain: Kevin, I have a couple of questions. One is on Zendesk. So if I look at the scatter data,\n\nJacek Olczak: the volumes have decelerated to mid teens growth. And your guidance is for thirty four percent to forty one percent growth.\n\nGaurav Jain: Then you also mentioned that the supply normalization would only happen in two h twenty five.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: So, you know, just wanted to understand what gives us the confidence that the sooner we can we\u2019ll be accelerating to\n\nGaurav Jain: This almost forty percent growth rate again.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So I I would take it, girl. Good morning, So we look also you know, how the volumes were evolving in a q four of the weeks of the last quarter. We see the growing velocities behind ZEN. Actually, there was the only brand I think, over the last few weeks which was growing in the velocities, not the rest of the at least the big four other brands or smaller, but big other brands. Look. We all also have to understand that we\u2019re reading all this data. We\u2019ve No full supply of the supply constraint environment. Right? So it\u2019s a bit difficult that you see at the retail. It depends even in which stores you\u2019re looking at that something which be significantly different than what we\u2019re shipping to the to the trade. But, you know, q four as we predicted, you know, with the increased capacity in Owensboro, We had the first quarter with the significant sequential quarter on quarter growth.\n\nEven if you will take the run rate of what we see the last weeks, etcetera, I think that the the the guidance is somehow reflect what we see there. Now our comments that you know, we should we think that we should be meeting the demand by about mid of this year, I have to make one reservation. Is that it\u2019s difficult to actually read what the demand is. Because we know what is the level of out of stock. We know what is the existing users of Zena demand for the product and knowing that this this purchases or the purchases somehow impact by the fact that, unfortunately, they are confronted with the lack of a bill lack of availability out of stock, and that is the you know, all the positive momentum, which doesn\u2019t have. I\u2019ve also the FDA authorizations, which know, on the one hand, one could read product was in the market, so there is no change.\n\nActually, I think it gives a lot of you know, visibility and stability to all the market participants, including the trade. And I believe also consumers that the product now has the full fledged, you know, my language authorization and all the flavor variants So all of these things I I think, will translate into the volumes which we prefer. Project of the volumes which will reflected in our in our guidance.\n\nGaurav Jain: Sure. And and follow-up\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Question to that. You know,\n\nGaurav Jain: to build clearly in supply shortage, retailers have been putting their markups I think you increased prices by thirty cents last year while retail has increased prices by one dollar or\n\nJacek Olczak: you know, three dollars, five dollars.\n\nGaurav Jain: How do you control retail price? And is there a way for you to as supply normalizes, to reduce retail price so that that will also have a positive effect on your volume.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So, you know, if you have a degree of the out of stock as Zen is experiencing, it\u2019s obviously managing the price at the at the retail level is you know, is a little bit more challenging. Right? I mean, it\u2019s pretty obvious. But I believe with the growing demand sorry. With the growing supply of the product, I think this pricing will come to the sum sort naturally to the normalization So I have to also admit that, look, we are very happy with the support we\u2019re getting from you know, retailers handling our products and, you know, it\u2019s not that easy for them also to be confronted with product which on the one hand has the demand on the other hand, they cannot realize their margins and, you know, they take from a certain price and you know, I hope but again, I think that, you know, the pricing situations in the market will will sort out somehow not surely the moment when the product will be in a full, unconstrained suppliers, as we said.\n\nYou know, second half of the twenty five, we should start seeing we should start seeing improvement on this\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Sure. And if I could just squeeze in one last question on Zendesk.\n\nGaurav Jain: Could you just talk about that ELTA, what the product is, and then you think we can see it in the market?\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So, obviously, as well, as we all know, right, the the authorization came Essentially, last days or hours of the one administration is now I guess we\u2019ll have to wait for the for the new author sorry, for the new administration Look. As I said in the You know, in the answers to the questions before that, I do hope that you know, period of four or five years waiting for authorization, Is too much. It\u2019s too long. And I do believe that there will be some I hope there will be some accelerations in the processing because of the authorizations. And you know, we have to also understand that, you know, partially the challenge which the US market has very much on the vape product is by the fact that the legal part of the market has not been created So on the one hand, you know, FDA is doing a lot of right things in terms of law enforcement and chasing the illegal Chinese or whatever import.\n\nBut on the other hand, there is a demand among the smokers adult nicotine users for this type of a product. And unless we create in a fast manner the legal part of that market, and then, you know, we essentially wasting our time and and money. So I do believe that the FDA will take this also into considerations that know, this situation shouldn\u2019t happen in our product category. And\n\nGaurav Jain: there is a demand for the product. So let\u2019s rest.\n\nJacek Olczak: For the law enforcement, etcetera, the illicit mark But you cannot just control the illicit market if you haven\u2019t provided the legal solutions in the market which are available. So I do believe that, you know, the ICOS sorry, ICOS as well, but ZYN has some\n\nGaurav Jain: pending\n\nJacek Olczak: authorizations or applications, I should say. I do believe that they\u2019re gonna be processed in a faster in a faster manner than before.\n\nGaurav Jain: Thank you so much. Thank you, Rob.\n\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question, please press star one one. And our next question comes from Eric Serrano of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nEric Serrano: Morning, mate. Hoping you could get hopefully, I just give some color in terms of\n\nCallum Elliott: what you\u2019re seeing in Italy, You mentioned that the fourth quarter was a little bit softer than you had anticipated anticipated after the nice recovery you saw in the third quarter from the characterizing flavor ban. And then in terms of Poland, can you remind us when, you know, when you expect to see some disruption from the ban being implemented and what sort of an impact you expect in terms of overall European combustors combustibles business? And then lastly, on FX, it seems like the FX headwind that you called out for the year and the guidance was know, a bit less than what seems to be implied based on spot rates and your typical yen hedge Wondering if there\u2019s been any change in the hedging policy or if there\u2019s any reason why it may be a bit lower than anticipated. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe I take the last one. It\u2019s the easiest one, and I come back to Italy, which is a bit the longer story. I mean, in a twenty two cents at spot rates right now, I mean, frankly speaking, the biggest contributor to the negative is the Russian ruble. And that\u2019s well above the sixty percent of the variance. The year actually goes in a cent. I guess it was if I recall, about the four cents in our estimate that the spot rate, obviously, As we all know, we\u2019re living in the pretty dynamic times. As we speak, but this is what it is. There was a big and coming from the Egyptian fund, right, when you know, it\u2019s we had to take the heat. That obviously will not be repeat re repeated in the will not repeat in the in twenty five.\n\nActually, this will result in a positive currency value, but this is on the currency. So frankly speaking, at this stage, it\u2019s a ruble and and as I said, four cents or so on the end, and the rest is just the bag due to our international footprint. The manual wants to add\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: add something. I want to add something because I think I mean, you know, the volatility we\u2019re seeing on the currency market today be a good touch of trust from, you know, how things are are working for us. I should first remind you that we have a natural important edging in our balance sheet with more than sixty percent of our debt that is in euro. And therefore, when we have a weakness in the euro versus dollar, which is a situation we\u2019ve seen recently, course, we have a negative impact on our p and l, but we have also a decrease of our debt in dollar terms, and we\u2019re also benefiting from lower cost of the debt in euros plus, of course, lower interest rate interest cost in euros translated into dollars. So that has been certainly helping our trajectory in twenty four.\n\nAnd if there was continued weakness of the euro, that would continue to help us in the future. Probably, what is not fully captured by the market is the fact that indeed on top of that, we have two significant edge position, one on our exposure to the yen for twenty twenty five. We have around sixty percent of our exposure that is covered at a rate of around one hundred and thirty eight yen for one dollar. So that means that we we we are not impacted by the possible deterioration of the yen for that part of of our exposure. And we have also a lower exposure to a lower aging, sorry, on on euro. Where we have around a bit more than one fifth sorry, one fourth of our exposure to euro, where we are covered at one twelve. Which is also limiting a bit the impact on the PNL when the euro is going down.\n\nSo with everything I\u2019ve been saying, you have all the explanation. What has been showing with you on the forex impact for us today.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. Now on the on Italy. So I think, yes, the second half was a bit weaker than we would maybe expect. I mean, Tally was going this know, many others, not all, but many other to to member states of the EU for that flavor ban. I think what we see is that okay, some smokers, some users have a hop temperal. Right? But the return to cigarettes, which always was that risk. So Also explains in the same geography is the cigarette trend are slightly or better than one could you know, expect or could think. There is some polyols between the vape product very much, and that\u2019s, I believe, maybe partially also explains why beef proposition has advanced most in Italy. Right? And this was in a in a in a in a closed system.\n\nVery shortly after short period of time, jump to travel to the number one proposition. I think we need to maybe look at, you know, the category of a smoke free over period of time on a total basis because there will be some poll usage and sometimes driven by the event. Like this by this flavor But we also have a geography in Europe that very shortly after the implementation of the of the of the of the flavors one. I mean, they actually returned to the the growth rates which we had before. So, you know, maybe Tally is our player. We\u2019re looking into this whole pay. But as I said, Part of our multi category strategy is also Should there be any leakage that they keep not burn users, we can capture this with other proposition. Then I guess we need a bit more time to see the stabilization.\n\nPoland, you asked me about the Poland. I don\u2019t think Poland has put the stick in the ground which moment they really want to fully implement the bar Right? Later in the week, it will happen. I think somewhere in the twenty five, but it has to be this is not you know, if this speaker has not been put in the ground, It is more towards the end of a of a busy year.\n\nCallum Elliott: Great. Thanks so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator: And our next question comes from Hamed of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nHamed: Good morning, guys. Thank you for for the questions. Hi, guys. A couple from me as well.\n\nHamed: Firstly, on on on ZYN again in the US, We we noticed a couple of your peers have have launched synthetic moist nicotine products. And according to the scanner data, have seen some initial uptake. How how do you see the moist versus dry dynamic in the US and where do you think the consumer may end up in in the future recognizing that in Europe, most products are are moist. And and the second question maybe comes back to your comments around Italy. But but but just longer term, we see the vapor category continuing to grow quite quite strongly, and we can discuss its flaws around flavors, marketing, underage use, etcetera. But but do you see this as a headwind for for the tobacco industry, or do you believe the total pie can continue to grow with limited impact on tobacco?\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So maybe the second part, I take it. I think the total price grows despite the fact that, you know, the the movements between the categories within a smoke free you know, there is some dynamics, right, between a heat not burn and an e vape. And the pouch is now depends how market is organized and regulated. We also know that know, the most difficult actually to read category due to the way the the market is organized currently is the eBay category. Right? Because you have a a a disposables, you have parts. You have open tank systems still, and some products Okay. You know, under the regulations and properly authorized depends on a jurisdiction. Some products are just popping up in the market, so you could call it the different forms of illicit trade, but I think, you know, you see this in the US, but also in Europe, in the UK, and a few other places.\n\nThe regulators, governments, taking more a serious look into properly organizing that market. I can\u2019t tell you whether this will be completed in the twenty five, but definitely, there is a the moves the movements the moves are in the right direction. So I believe twenty five, twenty six, the category should be normalized by the five that it\u2019s gonna be properly regulated. And then we take it from the I\u2019m not the one to talk about the youth exposure, etcetera, because, you know, we know, follow-up is you know, our policy, you know, with our reviews on this one. But, definitely, it\u2019s difficult to control of the discipline in the market. If you\u2019re dealing with You know, all of the different emanations of the product coming essentially legal to the marketplace that obviously also enjoys the less distantly in trade channels.\n\nSo completely, you know, invisible trade channels, if you like, etcetera. When it comes to your questions about the synthetic vent versus dry, So just to take it from a perspective, the way we look at the data in the US, for example, this whole new things which are coming into the market, there is a quite a long list of different SKUs and you know, the moist flowers and know, This whole market, the debt part of the market, if I\u2019m not miss mistaking, move year on year by barely twenty basis points. In a scheme of these things, there\u2019s presumably a lot of dynamic on the on the on the weekly basis, but doesn\u2019t seem that it\u2019s, you know, has any any major attractions, etcetera. The insights which we\u2019ll have when we talk over consumers, we see and obviously, you know, when you read that consumer insight, it\u2019s not a pure mathematical accuracy and the exact number, but I think that the moist products moist pouch products is more appealing to the moist snuff.\n\nType of a users. Right? Like snows, etcetera. While what we see in the marketplace that the dry product has a more appeal towards the smokers and evapor. Or evapist. That is what I can tell you at this stage.\n\nHamed: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate that. Alright. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question today comes from Phillips\n\nPhillip Stein: Stein of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nPhillip Stein: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I just had I just had one question, please.\n\nPhillip Stein: It was just on the HTU guidance. If I look at where the volumes landed at the at the end of twenty four and then I look at the guidance range you\u2019ve the ten to twelve percent you\u2019ve guided to for for twenty five. But then just extrapolating that out for twenty six and looking at your guidance there of the hundred and eighty to two hundred million of of of shipment volume. Just trying to get a sense of what gives you confidence in like, my math said implies, you know, we acceleration in the growth in twenty twenty six. And I just want to understand, I suppose, what gives you that confidence You will see that reacceleration, in twenty twenty six. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak: Yeah. So as I said earlier, I mean, in the guidance for this year for twenty five. We essentially stayed very low into we essentially focus on organic growth in a market that Obviously, if you open the, you know, twenty five and beyond, twenty think it\u2019s becoming maybe more prudent of her to assume that there will be some geographies also coming finally and opening the the markets to the new proposition. There is one point which I maybe we haven\u2019t articulated well in the in our remarks and that the answers to the questions before is that There is still about the twenty or so percent of the volumes on the heat not burn that we don\u2019t really do We would can\u2019t really realize the full growth potential. And I\u2019m referring here to to the geographies of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nNow for obvious reasons. But I was just look at the numbers of twenty four I think we have left behind about point six, maybe even more point of a growth which we would normally expect to deliver. If all these markets were you know, subject to the same sort of market conditions as other place Right? The Zillooma, etcetera. So okay. Let\u2019s see how this unwind. I think the the graph which we projected very much focused on organic organic meaning, you know, the geographies which we have today on hand. I think, is a good growth. Volume terms is essentially the same volume growth as we used to have in the past. But also in a broader sense, we more and more see the potential of the multi category and the total volumes of the smoke through products is just the one category.\n\nAnd as we know very well, the margin from the margin per perspective, they all they all essentially create a great opportunities. I mean, I think they all greatly accretive to to where we are today and to especially to the combustibles. Second thing is and I think we will zoom a little bit tomorrow. Try to zoom a bit more to this at our CAGNY con at our CAGNY presentations. But from the user\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s actually pretty nice economic proposition. Because we\u2019re essentially then leveraging all the investments through the user acquisitions, etcetera. And, you know, one of the category of your of of acquiring the user, but all the average product categories are actually very nicely benefit from this whole thing. So you will hear from us more and more talking.\n\nObviously, we\u2019ll give you the granularity about the KidNotverbi vaping as in. But I think in the next few years, the focus will be more and more turning into total of a smoke free rather than just the individual. Because this also somehow reflects the the user directions, the user consumer dynamics.\n\nPhillip Stein: Thank you very much.\n\nHamed: Thank you. Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions.\n\nOperator: At this time. I would like to turn it back to James for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell: Thank you. Before closing our call, I\u2019d like to remind you that as Yacine mentioned, we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on February nineteenth and we hope you\u2019ll be able to join us either in person or virtually. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. And have a great day.\n\nHamed: Thank you. Thank you. Speak to you soon.\n\nJacek Olczak: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.",

            "content": "Analyst Lisa Lewandowski of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on Philip Morris (PM \u2013 Research Report), retaining the price target of $143.00.\n\nLisa Lewandowski\u2019s rating is based on Philip Morris\u2019s strong financial performance and growth outlook. The company reported a solid fourth-quarter performance, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) exceeding expectations, driven by significant growth in both combustible and smoke-free product sales. Additionally, the company\u2019s operating income and profit margins showed impressive improvements, reflecting efficient cost management and revenue growth.\n\nLooking ahead, Philip Morris has provided optimistic guidance for 2025, projecting a 7-9% increase in adjusted EPS, or even higher when excluding foreign exchange impacts. The company\u2019s strategic focus on expanding its smoke-free product offerings aligns with global trends toward reduced-risk products, further strengthening its growth prospects. This commitment to innovation, along with a focus on shareholder returns, underpins Lisa Lewandowski\u2019s Buy rating for the stock.\n\nIn another report released yesterday, Stifel Nicolaus also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $145.00 price target.\n\nPM\u2019s price has also changed moderately for the past six months \u2013 from $114.200 to $145.320, which is a 27.25% increase.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "STAMFORD, CT--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) today announces its 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year results.1\n\n\"2024 was a remarkable year for PMI. We delivered very strong full-year results driven by the continued growth of IQOS and ZYN in addition to a robust combustibles performance,\" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer.\n\n\"The long-awaited U.S. FDA authorization of all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed in the U.S. is further evidence of the compelling science supporting smoke-free products. We hope our other pending FDA applications will be accelerated. We also hope other countries follow the example of the U.S. and embrace effective tobacco harm reduction measures. This is especially important in places where smoke-free products are banned, resulting in the perpetuation of combustible cigarette consumption.\"\n\n\"With strong momentum across all categories, we are confident that our smoke-free transformation and unparalleled brand portfolio will continue to deliver excellent performance and create value for our shareholders in 2025 and for the long term.\"\n\nResults Highlights Expand\n\nSmoke-free business (SFB): Quarterly shipments of HTU and oral smoke-free products exceeded 40 billion units for the first time, driving our smoke-free business to a superior performance, with full-year net revenues increasing by 14.2% (16.7% organically) and gross profit increasing by 18.7% (22.7% organically). In the fourth quarter, we delivered 9.2% net revenue growth (9.0% organically) and 15.1% gross profit growth (both reported and organically), despite a tough comparison due to shipment phasing. The smoke-free business accounted for 40% of our total net revenues and around 42% of gross profit (up by 0.7pp and 0.9pp respectively, versus fourth-quarter 2023), with 38.6 million estimated adult users of our smoke-free products (up by 5.3 million versus December 2023), which are now available in 95 markets.\n\nQuarterly shipments of HTU and oral smoke-free products exceeded 40 billion units for the first time, driving our smoke-free business to a superior performance, with full-year net revenues increasing by 14.2% (16.7% organically) and gross profit increasing by 18.7% (22.7% organically).

Inhalable smoke-free products (SFP): IQOS continues to strengthen its overall position as the second largest nicotine \u2018brand\u2019 in markets where present (gaining 0.7pp of combined cigarette and HTU industry volumes in the fourth quarter) and driving the growth of the heat-not-burn category (over 75% of global category volumes). HTU adjusted in-market sales (IMS) volume, which excludes the net impact of estimated distributor and wholesaler inventory movements, was up for the full year by an estimated 12.6%, with an acceleration, as expected, in the second half to close to 14%, with growth of around 13% in the fourth quarter. In Japan, ILUMA i fueled the growth of IQOS, with adjusted IMS up by around 13% for the full year and the fourth quarter, the 9 th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. IQOS HTU adjusted market share increased by 3.1pp to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. In December, the overall HTU category exceeded 50% of total nicotine offtake share in 10 major cities and 5 prefectures. In Europe, IQOS HTU adjusted market share increased by 0.9pp in the fourth quarter to 10.6%. Adjusted IMS grew by an estimated 9.4% for the full year with an acceleration in the second half to almost 11%. This includes close to 10% estimated growth in the fourth quarter, with strong double-digit growth in many markets, including Spain, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Germany. IQOS HTU offtake share reached a number of milestones in key cities, crossing 40% in Budapest, 30% in Rome, 15% in Belgrade, and approaching 10% in London and Vienna, with Madrid not far behind. Outside Europe and Japan, strong adjusted IMS growth continued and offtake share increased in key cities across the globe, including Riyadh, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Mexico City.\n\ncontinues to strengthen its overall position as the second largest nicotine \u2018brand\u2019 in markets where present (gaining 0.7pp of combined cigarette and HTU industry volumes in the fourth quarter) and driving the growth of the heat-not-burn category (over 75% of global category volumes). HTU adjusted in-market sales (IMS) volume, which excludes the net impact of estimated distributor and wholesaler inventory movements, was up for the full year by an estimated 12.6%, with an acceleration, as expected, in the second half to close to 14%, with growth of around 13% in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the vaping category, VEEV is an increasingly trusted choice among IQOS legal-age poly-users, and an important part of our smoke-free multi-category strategy, which we continue to deploy across our markets. VEEV is a top 3 pod brand in 13 European markets (holding the #1 position in 5 markets, including Italy, Romania and Czech Republic).\n\nOral SFP 2 : Full-year shipment volume increased by nearly 28% in cans (nearly 25% in pouches or pouch equivalents). Fourth quarter shipment volume increased by 25% in cans (22% in pouches or pouch equivalents), fueled by ZYN nicotine pouch growth in the U.S., where shipments reached nearly 165 million cans, representing growth of nearly 42% versus prior year. Outside the U.S., our nicotine pouch quarterly shipment volume more than doubled, with notable contributions from Pakistan, South Africa, the UK and Mexico. The number of markets where our nicotine pouch products are available increased to 37, including recent launches in Italy, Romania and Thailand.\n\nFull-year shipment volume increased by nearly 28% in cans (nearly 25% in pouches or pouch equivalents).

Combustibles: Full-year net revenues grew by 4.0% (5.9% organically) predominantly driven by strong pricing. Fourth quarter net revenues grew by 6.0% (6.2% organically), driven by another quarter of high single-digit pricing and growing industry volumes in markets where smoke-free products are not allowed, including Turkey, India, Brazil and Vietnam. Strong pricing and productivity improvements resulted in gross profit growth of 10.7% (10.8% organically). Our global brands portfolio and Marlboro both achieved further market share gains.\n\nFull-year net revenues grew by 4.0% (5.9% organically) predominantly driven by strong pricing.

Excluding a total 2025 adjustment of $0.49 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of 7.2% to 9.1% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $6.57 in 2024. Also excluding an adverse currency impact of $0.22, at prevailing exchange rates, this forecast represents a projected increase of 10.5% to 12.5% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $6.57 in 2024, as outlined in the above table.\n\n2025 Full-Year Forecast Assumptions\n\nThis forecast assumes:\n\nAn estimated total international industry volume decline of around 1% for cigarettes and HTUs, excluding China and the U.S.;\n\nTotal cigarette and smoke-free product shipment volume growth for PMI of up to 2% driven by smoke-free products volume growth of 12% to 14%. This factors absolute growth in HTU adjusted IMS volumes at a similar level to 2024, translating into 10% to 12% growth, with the HTU shipment growth rate broadly in line subject to shipment timing and trade inventory movements, and an acceleration in U.S. nicotine pouch shipment volume to reach 780 to 820 million cans, representing growth of 34% to 41%;\n\nNet revenue growth of around 6% to 8% on an organic basis;\n\nOrganic operating income growth of 10.5% to 12.5%;\n\nFull-year amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.49 per share, including the amortization of IQOS commercialization rights in the U.S. related to the agreement to end our commercial relationship with Altria Group, Inc. covering IQOS in the U.S.;\n\ncommercialization rights in the U.S. related to the agreement to end our commercial relationship with Altria Group, Inc. covering in the U.S.; An effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax events, of approximately 22.5% to 23.5%;\n\nOperating cash flow of around $11 billion at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements. This takes into account non-recurring payments relating to the German tax surcharge and the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which amount to approximately $1 billion;\n\nCapital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, including further investments in ZYN capacity in the U.S.;\n\ncapacity in the U.S.; Further net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improvement as we continue to target a ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026;\n\nNo dividend income from Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (our deconsolidated Canadian affiliate);\n\nNo share repurchases in 2025; and\n\nFirst quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.58 to $1.63, including an estimated adverse currency impact of 4 cents at prevailing exchange rates.\n\nFactors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.\n\nUpdate on CCAA Proceeding in Canada Expand\n\nIn October 2024, PMI was informed by its deconsolidated Canadian affiliate, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH), that the court-appointed mediator and monitor in RBH\u2019s Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) proceeding filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement outlining certain terms of a comprehensive resolution of tobacco product-related claims and litigation in Canada against RBH and its affiliates. See PMI's Form 8-K dated October 18, 2024 for additional details.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the proposed plan with the CCAA court. The positions taken by RBH in this objection, the positions taken by other parties in related filings, and other related developments narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI\u2019s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the plan, PMI concluded that, the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.3 billion in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a recognized subsequent event, with an adverse impact on reported diluted EPS of $1.49.\n\nAdditionally, PMI has determined that if the CCAA court approves the plan as proposed and it is subsequently implemented, RBH would likely remain deconsolidated under U.S. GAAP. Since the first quarter of 2019, and to date, PMI\u2019s reported and adjusted EPS, net debt and other financial results have excluded RBH. However, subject to the terms and requirements of the proposed plan, the payment of certain dividends from RBH to PMI would be permitted going forward, which would be incremental to PMI\u2019s cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS.\n\nNew Segment Structure Expand\n\nFollowing the sale of Vectura Group Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining units of Vectura Fertin Pharma in the Europe segment as of the first quarter of 2025. We plan to disclose select historical financial information for the 2022 to 2024 period reflecting this change in the coming weeks.\n\nConference Call Expand\n\nA conference call hosted by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 6, 2025.

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match\u2019s General snus and ZYN nicotine pouches and versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of IQOS devices and consumables and General snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product authorizations from the FDA. As of December 31, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets, and PMI estimates that 38.6 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 39% of PMI\u2019s total full-year 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI has a long-term ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.\n\nPMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco and/or nicotine use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of natural disasters and pandemics on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to introduce, commercialize, and grow smoke-free products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our smoke-free products performance.\n\nPMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and the Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, which will be filed later today. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures, Glossary and Explanatory Notes\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures in this release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures can be found in Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K dated February 6, 2025, and at www.pmi.com/2024Q4earnings. A glossary of key terms, definitions and explanatory notes is available in the aforementioned Exhibit 99.2 and on the same webpage, where additional financial schedules, as well as adjustments and other calculations have also been made available.\n\nManagement reviews net revenues, gross profit, operating income, operating income margin, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or \"EPS,\" on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, restructuring costs, tax items and other special items. Additionally, starting in 2022 and on a comparative basis, for these measures other than net revenues and operating cash flow, PMI includes adjustments to add back amortization expense on acquisition related intangible assets that are recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to PMI\u2019s revenue generation, as well as impairment of intangible assets, if any. While amortization expense on acquisition related intangible assets is excluded in these adjusted measures, the net revenues generated from these acquired intangible assets are included in the company's adjusted measures, unless otherwise stated. Currency-neutral and organic growth rates reflect the way management views underlying performance for these measures. PMI believes that such measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results. Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI\u2019s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management.\n\nNon-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nDiluted EPS reconciliation Expand\n\nFourth-Quarter Full Year 2024 2023 2024 2023 $(0.38 ) $1.41 Reported Diluted EPS $4.52 $5.02 0.01 \u2014 Restructuring charges 0.10 0.06 \u2014 \u2014 Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 0.01 0.44 0.11 0.07 Amortization of intangibles 0.40 0.25 \u2014 0.02 Charges related to the war in Ukraine \u2014 0.03 0.05 \u2014 Megapolis localization tax impact 0.05 \u2014 0.14 (0.14 ) Income tax impact associated with Swedish Match AB financing 0.14 (0.11 ) \u2014 \u2014 Egypt sales tax charge 0.03 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Loss on sale of Vectura Group 0.13 \u2014 1.49 \u2014 Impairment related to the RBH equity investment 1.49 \u2014 0.13 \u2014 Fair value adjustment for equity security investments (0.27 ) (0.02 ) \u2014 \u2014 Tax items (0.03 ) 0.11 \u2014 \u2014 Other adjustments impacting 2023 only* \u2014 0.23 $1.55 $1.36 Adjusted Diluted EPS $6.57 $6.01 0.06 Less: Currency (0.38 ) $1.49 $1.36 Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding Currency $6.95 $6.01 (*) Represents adjustments impacting 2023 only: South Korea indirect tax charge (11 cents), Termination of agreement with Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (7 cents), Termination of distribution arrangement in the Middle East (4 cents), Swedish Match AB acquisition accounting related items (1 cent) Note: The Income tax impact associated with Swedish Match AB financing was due to a deferred tax impact for unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings, while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in the consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity.

Specifically, the division's growth was led by a 46% increase in unit sales of nicotine pouches like ZYN. In addition, its gross margin, EPS, and EPS guidance were higher than Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this quarter had some key positives.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $145.35, up 10.9% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Philip Morris? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nPhilip Morris\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. Moves this big are rare for Philip Morris and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nPhilip Morris is up 20% since the beginning of the year, and at $145.32 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Philip Morris\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,686.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

            "content": "Philip Morris International exceeded earnings expectations for Q4, propelled by its expanding smoke-free product lineup.\n\nGlobal tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings on Thursday, Feb. 6, that exceeded analysts' consensus expectations. Adjusted EPS of $1.55 came in just ahead of the estimated $1.50 and revenue of $9.71 billion surpassed the forecasted $9.44 billion. The smoke-free portion of the business now accounts for 40% of overall revenue and around 42% of gross profit.\n\nOverall, the quarter highlighted Philip Morris's strategic shift towards smoke-free products, supporting a strong financial performance despite lingering reliance on traditional tobacco products.\n\nMetric Q4 2024 Analysts' Estimate Q4 2023 Change (YOY) EPS $1.55 $1.50 $1.36 14% Revenue $9.71 billion $9.44 billion $9.05 billion 7.3% Adjusted operating income $3.52 billion -- $3.05 billion 15.3% Smoke-free revenue $3.9 billion -- $3.6 billion 9.2% Combustibles revenue $5.8 billion -- $5.4 billion 6%\n\nPhilip Morris International: Legacy and Transformation\n\nPhilip Morris International is a leading global company in the tobacco sector, best known for its flagship brand, Marlboro. It is committed to shifting from conventional tobacco products to smoke-free alternatives. This transformation forms the crux of its strategy, aiming to significantly reduce smoking-related health risks.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent focus on smoke-free growth is underscored by its investment in Swedish Match in November 2022, boosting its portfolio with the ZYN brand. This investment is part of a broader strategy to expand the availability of smoke-free products, now present in 95 markets worldwide.\n\nQuarter Highlights and Developments\n\nDuring Q4 2024, the company reported notable strides in its smoke-free product segment. Revenue from smoke-free products grew by 40%, demonstrating the company's successful push in this area. Heated Tobacco Units (HTUs) shipments rose by 5.1%, and cigarette shipments increased marginally by 1.1%. This aligns with the company's goal of transitioning consumers from traditional smoking to healthier alternatives.\n\nRegulatory successes were crucial, as the U.S. FDA authorized ZYN nicotine pouches and IQOS devices as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. Such regulatory endorsements are critical in building credibility and legitimacy for smoke-free alternatives.\n\nThe geographic expansion also played a pivotal role. Notably, adjusted International Market Share (IMS) grew significantly in Japan and Europe, with smoke-free products gaining traction in key markets like Italy and Spain. This geographic focus underscores PMI's strategic segmentation to penetrate diverse markets and mitigate localized risks.\n\nPhilip Morris still faces challenges such as ongoing litigation and related impairment charges. For instance, a non-cash impairment charge of $2.3 billion was recorded related to the Canadian affiliate RBH. This reflects the complexity of navigating regulatory landscapes and managing tobacco-related claims. Despite these challenges, traditional products remain a significant revenue contributor, with Marlboro accounting for 39% of the cigarette shipment volume.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nPhilip Morris has set an optimistic outlook for 2025, projecting an adjusted EPS between $7.04 and $7.17, representing an increase of up to 9.1% in adjusted EPS from 2024. That comes in ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate of $6.99 a share. The company anticipates further growth in its smoke-free segment and continued geographic expansion as key drivers.\n\nThe company is investing in increasing the production capacity for ZYN products and expects its effective tax rate to stabilize between 22.5% and 23.5%. Investors are advised to watch the progress in smoke-free product marketing and regulatory developments. These factors will be critical for PMI\u2019s growth trajectory as it continues its transformation to a smoke-free future.",

Here\u2019s what to look for.\n\nPhilip Morris beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 2.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $9.91 billion, up 8.4% year on year. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and a decent beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\nIs Philip Morris a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Philip Morris\u2019s revenue to grow 4.4% year on year to $9.44 billion, slowing from the 11% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.50 per share.\n\nPhilip Morris Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Philip Morris has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Philip Morris\u2019s peers in the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco segment, some have already reported their Q4 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Altria delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 1.6%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.6%, and Tilray reported revenues up 8.9%, falling short of estimates by 3.6%. Altria\u2019s stock price was unchanged after the results, while Tilray was down 13.5%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Altria\u2019s results here and Tilray\u2019s results here.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market has been optimistic as of late due to a soft landing. This is an economic situation where rate hikes successfully quelled inflation but did not send the economy into a recession. Furthermore, recent rate cuts and Donald Trump's triumph in the 2024 Presidential election have been tailwinds for the market, and while some of the beverages, alcohol, and tobacco stocks have shown solid performance, the group has generally underpeformed, with share prices down 3.8% on average over the last month. Philip Morris is up 7.9% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $136.93 (compared to the current share price of $130.93).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

With a market cap of $202.7 billion, Philip Morris has a presence in over 180 countries across the globe.\n\nThe tobacco giant has significantly outperformed the broader market over the past year.

Her remarks came as she expressed hope that the electronic cigarette industry would receive more support from the Korean government. Authorities have highlighted the harmful effects of both traditional cigarettes and heat-not-burn products.\n\nYun acknowledged that, as a cigarette company, it has often faced criticism regarding public health. She added that the company\u2019s efforts to encourage smokers to quit by promoting a potentially less harmful alternative have rarely received outright support from outside the industry.\n\nThe government has consistently criticized smoking without distinguishing between smoke-free products and traditional cigarettes or acknowledging the potential benefits of the former.\n\n\u201cWe hope the government understands that our e-cigarette business is not about pursuing our own business interests. It is rather our campaign promoting a better way to smoke based on scientific data,\" Yun said at a press conference in Seoul, where Philip Morris International (PMI) and its Korean subsidiary unveiled a new model for its flagship e-cigarette device brand IQOS to Korea.\n\nDuring the event, Philip Morris Korea unveiled IQOS Iluma i, the latest version of the brand for the company's heat-not-burn devices. IQOS was first launched globally in 2014 and in Korea in 2017.\n\nAs of last October, the company occupied a 40 percent share of Korea\u2019s heat-not-burn market, while KT&G led with 49 percent and BAT Rothmans accounted for 11 percent. Meanwhile, JTI Korea, a Korean subsidiary of Japan Tobacco International, also released its new e-cigarette device model, Ploom X Advanced, in October.\n\n\u201cOne out of every five adults in Korea are now smoking heat-not-burn products,\u201d Yun said. \u201cWe believe we are truly doing the right thing by helping the rest four out of every five adults quit cigarette smoking.\u201d\n\nVassilis Gkatzelis, PMI\u2019s president of East Asia, Australia and Duty Free Region, said during the press conference that PMI aims to log two-thirds of its entire sales from e-cigarette products by 2030.\n\n\u201cWhat is truly expected of a tobacco company? The answer is straightforward,\u201d Gkatzelis, who hails from Greece, said. \u201cIt is introducing the smoke-free future.\u201d\n\nThe president said that among PMI\u2019s 180 market countries, Korea \u201cholds a very special place\u201d because it is among the top five countries in its global smoke-free product market.\n\n\u201cIQOS is accelerating the transition away from cigarettes,\u201d Gkatzelis said. \u201cIt is ushering in the world where combustion smoking is increasingly becoming obsolete and will [just be seen in] a museum.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The \"Icos Illuma i Prime\" is a top-end flagship model that features aluminum and a wrap cover, and comes in three colors: Breeze Blue, Midnight Black, and Garnet Red. 'Icos Illuma i' comes in four colors: Breeze Blue, Midnight Black, Vivid Terracotta, and Digital Violet.\n\nBoth products apply a \"smart core induction system\" similar to the existing IQOS Illuma series to heat cigarettes uniformly from the inside, and there is no need to clean the device because there is no residue left after use.\n\nThe new iCOS Illuma i series will be sold at official iCOS stores, convenience stores, and iCOS online stores (IQOS.com ) nationwide from the 13th.\n\nPrior to this, pre-purchases will begin at nine iCOS direct management stores and iCOS official online stores nationwide from the 7th. The recommended consumer price of the iCOS Illuma i Prime is 129,000 won and the iCOS Illuma i is 89,000 won.\n\nYoon Hee-kyung, CEO of Philip Morris Korea, said at a press conference held at Lotte Hotel Seoul on the same day, \"One in five adult smokers in Korea is choosing non-combustible alternative products such as IQOS,\" adding, \"We will focus on developing better new products while continuing our journey to help smokers escape from regular cigarettes.\"",

However, it aims to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030, investing over $12.5 billion in developing and commercializing alternatives products since 2008. With a market cap of $202.7 billion, Philip Morris has a presence in over 180 countries across the globe.\n\nThe tobacco giant has significantly outperformed the broader market over the past year. Philip Morris\u2019 stock prices have surged 40.2% over the past 52-week period and 8.3% on a YTD basis, outpacing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 21.8% surge over the past year and 2.7% gains in 2025.\n\nZooming in further, Philip Morris has also outperformed the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s XLP modest 6% gains over the past year and a marginal 1 basis point gain in 2025.\n\nPhilip Morris has continued to observe a strong momentum across all regions and categories leading to a robust growth in revenues and earnings in Q3 2024 which led to its stock prices soaring 10.5% after the release of its Q3 results on Oct. 22. The company reported an impressive 8.4% year-over-year growth in net revenues, reaching $9.9 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s topline estimates by a notable 3.6%. The company has been experiencing favorable pricing and rising demand for its smoke-free products. This has also resulted in record-high earnings with its adjusted EPS rising 14.4% year-over-year to $1.91 and exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates by 4.4%.\n\nObserving the solid business momentum Philip Morris raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance, further bolstering investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nPM is set to announce its fiscal 2024 earnings tomorrow. Analysts expect PM to deliver an 8.2% year-over-year growth in earnings to $6.50 per share. However, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it has surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it has missed the estimates on one other occasion.\n\nPM stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Among the 12 analysts covering the stock, seven recommend \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d one advocates \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d three advise \u201cHold,\u201d and one suggests a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d rating.\n\nThis configuration has been mostly stable over the past months.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Barclays\u2019 BCS analyst Gaurav Jain reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on PM while setting a price target of $145.\n\nPM\u2019 mean price target of $134.90 represents a modest 3.5% premium to current price levels.

            "content": "Philip Morris International will start selling its IQOS Iluma i series in Korea on Feb. 13, the tobacco company said Wednesday.Hannah Yun, Philip Morris Korea\u2019s managing director, said the product would further the firm's vision for a \u201csmoke-free future\u201d at a news conference for the launch at Lotte Hotel in Jung District, central Seoul, on Wednesday.\u201cThere was a time when Philip Morris couldn\u2019t be talked about without mentioning Marlboro. But now, we\u2019re packing the cigarettes to the museum,\u201d Yun said.The newest lineup of IQOS devices adds features including a touch screen, extra puffs that extend usage time and a temporary pause function. The lineup for Korean consumers consists of two models \u2014 the IQOS Iluma i Prime and the standard IQOS Iluma I \u2014 and comes in five colors.The IQOS Iluma i rolled out last year in Japan, which is a key market for IQOS: The brand accounted for 26.7 percent of the country\u2019s total heated tobacco and cigarette sales in 2023. There are three devices in the IQOS Iluma i series in Japan, one more than will initially launch Korea.The line provides a \u201cbetter alternative for adult smokers who cannot quit,\u201d said Yun.The IQOS brand entered the Korean market in 2017 and initially led the heated tobacco market but has recently been trailing behind KT&G\u2019s lil.\u201cMarket share is, of course, important but that\u2019s a secondary issue; we are instead focusing on shifting the market from cigarettes to heated tobacco products,\u201d managing director Yun said. \u201cThe market for heated tobacco products that are created using science-backed technology must grow, and we are proud that we created a market that didn\u2019t exist before by launching IQOS in 2017.\u201dExecutives repeatedly emphasized the IQOS Iluma i as part of a broader \u201ctransition away from cigarettes.\u201dBut Philip Morris has a steep hill to climb. Evidence from studies worldwide suggests that electronic cigarettes, including heated tobacco and vaping products, may act as a gateway to, or complement, cigarette smoking, rather than act as a replacement. Dual use of cigarette types also increases the risk of adverse health effects. A 2020 survey showed that 96 percent of Korean IQOS users concurrently smoked cigarettes at the time. A more recent survey, conducted in 2023 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said those who only used heated tobacco devices like IQOS made up only 7 percent of smokers; 40.8 percent smoked a combination of electronic cigarettes and cigarettes.The number of cigarette smokers of all types in Korea increased for the first time in four years in 2023, which had dropped from 2019, according to the latest annually-conducted survey by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Experts say the variety of types of e-cigarettes attracted new smokers, especially those that had less smoke and smell.Philip Morris supports smokers transitioning completely to heated tobacco products or quitting smoking altogether at all IQOS stores, online and through the IQOS members club by \u201cpersonalizing IQOS [marketing] communications to consumers in a way that suits their lifestyles,\u201d a spokesperson for Philip Morris told the Korea JoongAng Daily.The IQOS Iluma i Prime and the IQOS Iluma i will cost 129,000 won ($90) and 89,000 won, respectively. The products will be sold at IQOS stores and online mall starting Feb. 13, with preorders starting from Feb. 7.BY KIM JU-YEON [ [email protected]",

This content is produced by commercial departments and does not involve Euronews editorial staff or news journalists. The funding partner has control of the topics, content and final approval in collaboration with Euronews\u2019 commercial production department.\n\nAs the World Economic Forum 2025 unfolded in Davos, a recurring theme dominated the discussions: Europe\u2019s position in an increasingly polarised and competitive global landscape.\n\nAt an exclusive Davos roundtable hosted by Massimo Andolina, European CEO of Philip Morris International (PMI), and Claus Strunz, CEO of Euronews, this theme was central to a candid discussion among prominent public and private sector leaders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe high-level discussion, moderated by CEO of World Minds, Christoph Keese, highlighted the need for Europe to become more competitive, innovative and united amidst an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape and rising uncertainty for EU-US relations following Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nAmong those seated at the roundtable were key figures from across the European Union including the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, Romania\u2019s Minister of Economy, Ivan Bogdan and Deputy General of the European Space Agency, Josef Aschbacher.\n\nRepresenting the private sector alongside Andolina, were a broad range of business leaders across technology, media and strategic sectors, including the Senior Vice President at Huawei Europe, Fredrikson Kenneth, and Chief Economist at Active Owners Denmark, Bo Sandberg.\n\nThe challenges facing Europe\n\nTo kick off the roundtable, participants highlighted the stark challenges facing Europe in a changing global landscape, citing sluggish economic growth, multilateral fragmentation and an inability to compete with the innovation engines of the United States and China.\n\nThe discussion also touched on domestic political instability in major EU economies, such as Germany and France, and the rise of populist movements, which have further complicated efforts to craft a unified European strategy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies and his pursuit of a \u201cGolden Era\u201d for the US, Andolina posed the same question for Europe: \u201cWhat do we collectively need to do together \u2013 Brussels, the public and the private sector \u2013 in order to build the Golden Era for Europe?\u201d\n\nThe Draghi Report: a wake-up call\n\nA key reference point for the discussion was the Draghi Report (The Future of European Competitiveness \u2013 A Competitiveness Strategy for Europe), authored by Mario Draghi, former President of the European Central Bank and Italian Prime Minister. Presented to the European Commission in September 2024, the report outlines a bold plan to address Europe\u2019s economic stagnation and declining global influence.\n\nThe 69-page main report offers stark insight into the future of European competitiveness. Key statistics highlight that the EU is growing 30 per cent slower than the United States, while China now directly competes with eurozone firms in nearly 40 per cent of sectors, up from 25 per cent in 2002. Mounting geopolitical tensions have also been shown to exacerbate Europe\u2019s slow trade growth, an area which accounts for nearly 45 per cent of Europe\u2019s GDP.\n\nThe report urges swift action to mitigate these trends, recommending a \u201cfar more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace economically with rivals the United States and China.\u201d\n\nIf Europe is to avoid \u201csleepwalking into catastrophe\u201d, Andolina warned during the discussion \u2013 \u201ccatastrophe for jobs, for competitiveness and for economy\u201d \u2013 EU leaders need to see the Draghi report as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d and drive forward bold reforms.\n\n\u201cThe Draghi Report is a lucid wake-up call for what needs to happen in Europe in order to restore our competitiveness, our ability to focus on innovation, to allow companies to thrive here and build a successful Europe for the next generation.\u201d Massimo Andolina President of Philip Morris International in Europe\n\nTo do this, Andolina encourages EU leaders and policymakers to lean more on Europe\u2019s strengths. \u201c[We need to remember] what made us strong in the first place; the ingenuity of our people, our ability to innovate and our ability to embrace innovation rather than oppressing it with narrow-minded regulation and blocks.\u201d\n\nCalls for urgent policy reform\n\nBoth public and private sector voices spoke up about the stifling effects of Europe\u2019s regulatory environment on growth and innovation, particularly in AI and digital markets.\n\nFormer European Council President, Charles Michel, defined the EU landscape as one of suspicion and urged reform. \u201cWe should talk less and act more in Europe,\u201d he said, sharing his belief that Europe is regulating in a way that no longer works.\n\n\u201cA shift in mindset is crucial,\u201d Andolina stressed, further emphasising the need to reimagine regulatory frameworks on industrial policy and foster an environment where businesses can thrive. Other participants mirrored this sentiment, calling for decisive action and collaboration among member states to secure a competitive future for Europe on the global stage.\n\nRaising investment and shifting mindset\n\nAccording to the Draghi report, \u201cEU companies spent around \u20ac270 billion less on R&D than their US counterparts, causing Europe to lag behind in innovation and competitiveness, particularly in strategic sectors. To tackle this, the report proposes an annual investment of \u20ac800 billion, equivalent to 4.7 per cent of Europe\u2019s GDP, to stimulate growth and competitiveness,\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo bridge this gap, the roundtable proposed increased investment in strategic sectors such as renewable energy, defence and advanced manufacturing, as Draghi recommends.\n\nCharles Michel advocated for increasing the European Investment Bank\u2019s (EIB) capitalisation to boost economic growth and foster innovation. \u201cWe must find the resources to invest in defence and business,\u201d he said. With increased support for the private sector, Europe could reduce its energy dependency and work towards net-zero goals while fostering homegrown technological advancements.\n\nPMI\u2019s Andolina highlighted the necessity for structural reform to solidify investment benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve this problem by just throwing money at it,\u201d Andolino said. \u201cIf there is a shift in mindset to put economic productivity and competitiveness first, [we can] create a favourable environment for companies to thrive and for society to become optimistic again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bo Sandberg, Chief Economist at Active Owners Denmark, highlighted the need to mobilise private capital. \u201cThe issue is not the availability of money but getting institutional investors to act, similar to the US,\u201d he argued.\n\nA path forward\n\nThe Davos roundtable concluded with a consensus on the need for unity, bold leadership and proactive policymaking in order to navigate geopolitical tensions, stimulate growth and collectively rise to Europe\u2019s challenges.\n\nParticipants agreed that the Draghi Report offers a viable roadmap but stressed that its implementation requires overcoming entrenched national interests and political inertia.\n\nAs the forum concluded, one message was clear: Europe must act swiftly to compete in the 21st century. The stakes are high, but so too is the potential for renewal and growth.",

Quote\n\nThings to Know About PM\u2019s Upcoming Results\n\nPhilip Morris\u2019 ability to leverage strong pricing has been a key driver of its revenue and operating income growth. Smokers\u2019 propensity to absorb price increases, given the addictive nature of cigarettes, has enabled the company to sustain revenue growth.\n\n\n\nThe company has also been benefiting from its significant strides toward a smoke-free future. Smoke-free products accounted for 38% of the company\u2019s net revenues in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the success of IQOS, its leading heat-not-burn device. Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov. 11, 2022, which has been delivering impressive performance due to ZYN. Smoke-free revenues for 2024 are expected to increase by double digits organically to nearly $15 billion.\n\n\n\nThese upsides bode well for the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total smoke-free product revenues (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) for the fourth quarter is pegged at $3,867 million, indicating an increase from $3,489 million recorded in the year-ago period. Apart from this, Philip Morris\u2019 cost-saving measures and strategic initiatives to enhance its margins have been working well.\n\n\n\nHowever, volatile currency movements have been a concern for the tobacco giant. Philip Morris\u2019 third-quarter 2024 financial performance was affected by currency fluctuations, particularly with weaknesses in the Egyptian Pound and Argentine Peso, alongside a strong Swiss Franc. On its last earnings call, management stated that it anticipates an ongoing unfavorable currency impact of 40 cents for the full year. Apart from this, strict government regulations, such as mandatory precautionary labels and self-critical advertisements, hinder cigarette consumption.",

Revenues are forecasted to be $9.36 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.5%.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Philip Morris metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Revenues- Wellness and Healthcare' will likely reach $70.67 million.

            "content": "During market complexities and low points where consumers try to restrain their extra spending, a demand surge is observed towards consumer staples, resulting in bright prospects for the consumer staples market. Amid this, investors trying to avoid high risks could also turn to consumer staple stocks as their defensive strategy.\n\nGiven the industry\u2019s bright prospects, it could be wise to buy fundamentally sound consumer staples stocks PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP), Philip Morris International Inc. (PM), and Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) with massive growth potential.\n\nDespite numerous market downturns and uncertainties, certain industries and segments remain unaffected mostly and sometimes even thrive in such situations. Companies operating in the consumer staples industry and delivering products of essential or necessary nature generally fall in this category. Their inelastic demand keeps them resilient and growing.\n\nStocks of consumer staples companies also act as defensive investments and offer investors favorable opportunities and long-term growth during economic volatility. During the past year, S&P 500 Consumer Staples exhibited impressive performance at a rate of 12.5%.\n\nFurther, the staple market is expected to grow from $229.21 billion in 2025 to $335.44 billion by 2034, exhibiting growth at a CAGR of 4.3%. The market growth is attributable to factors like increased demand for essential consumer goods and industrial products and the evolving trends around sustainability and eco-friendly materials.\n\nHence, around the lingering market uncertainties due to Trump\u2019s unclear policy frameworks and clouded prospects on interest rate cuts, turning to defensive investing is suitable. Therefore, investors could consider fundamentally sound consumer staples stocks PEP, PM, and KMB for defensive investing.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (PEP)\n\nPEP is engaged in the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of various beverages and convenient foods worldwide. The company operates through seven segments: Frito-Lay North America; Quaker Foods North America; PepsiCo Beverages North America; Latin America; Europe; Africa, Middle East and South Asia; and Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, PEP completed the acquisition of Garza Food Ventures LLC, dba Siete Foods, for $1.2 billion. With the acquisition of Siete, PEP will further expand its portfolio of products, emphasizing nutritious, simple foods and ingredients and serving wider audiences.\n\nAlso, on November 22, 2024, PEP acquired the remaining 50% interest in Sabra Dipping Company, LLC and PepsiCo-Strauss Fresh Dips & Spreads International GmbH. After the agreement, PEP became the sole owner of the companies. The acquisition expanded PEP\u2019s positive choice portfolio and accelerated innovation in refrigerated fresh dips and spreads.\n\nFor the third quarter that ended September 7, 2024, PEP reported net revenue of $23.32 billion. Its gross profit increased 1.1% from the year-ago value to $12.92 billion. The company\u2019s net income attributable to PepsiCo amounted to $2.93 billion and $2.13 per common share for the quarter.\n\nIn addition, as of September 7, 2024, the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and total assets stood at $7.31 billion and $100.51 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect PEP\u2019s revenue and EPS for the fourth quarter (ended December 2024) to increase marginally and 9.1% year-over-year to $27.89 billion and $1.94, respectively. Further, the company has topped consensus EPS estimates in all four trailing quarters, which is impressive.\n\nShares of PEP have plunged 0.9% over the past month to close the last trading session at $150.69.\n\nPEP\u2019s bright prospects are reflected in its POWR Ratings. The stock has an overall rating of B, which translates to a Buy in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings are calculated by considering 118 different factors, each weighted to an optimal degree.\n\nThe stock has an A grade for Quality and a B for Growth. PEP is ranked #11 out of 31 stocks in the B-rated Beverages industry.\n\nTo check POWR Ratings of PEP for Value, Momentum, Stability, and Sentiment, click here.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (PM)\n\nPM operates as a tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sectors. Its product portfolio includes cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products, primarily under the IQOS and ZYN brands.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, PM declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.35 per common share, which was paid on January 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of December 26, 2024.\n\nPM pays an annual dividend of $5.40, which translates to a yield of 4.15% at the current share price. Its four-year average dividend yield is 5.09%. Moreover, the company\u2019s dividend payouts have increased at a CAGR of 2.8% over the past five years.

            "content": "One evening in Richmond\u2019s East End, a 42-year-old father of two overdosed on fentanyl in his car while his children waited inside their apartment. A neighbor, recognizing the signs, administered Narcan before paramedics arrived. He survived, but the overdose was his third in a year. He had tried to quit opioids before, cycling through short-term treatment programs, but the addiction kept pulling him back.\n\nHis story is not unique. Richmond, while overdoses are decreasing, is in the grip of addiction, with opioids, alcohol, and nicotine leading the charge. While the city has a storied history of tobacco production and a thriving craft beer scene, the legacy of these industries has made quitting even harder for those battling addiction. A new wave of research, including a study from Virginia Tech\u2019s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, sheds light on why certain substances\u2014particularly opioids\u2014are so difficult to escape. Richmonders seeking help face systemic barriers, treatment gaps, and deeply ingrained cultural attitudes that complicate the fight for recovery.\n\nAccording to a Virginia Tech analysis, the number of quit attempts reflects adjusted, estimated marginal means for each substance, averaged across varying levels of substance use disorder severity.\n\nThe Hardest Addictions to Quit in Richmond\n\nA ranking of the most addictive substances published by The Daily Mail lists alcohol, nicotine, and opioids as the top three. In Richmond, these addictions are particularly relevant:\n\nNicotine : Richmond is a tobacco town\u2014home to Philip Morris USA and generations of workers in the industry. While cigarette smoking has declined, vaping has surged, particularly among young people. Local high schools report increasing rates of e-cigarette use, and many adults find quitting just as difficult as traditional smoking.\n\n\n\n: Richmond is a tobacco town\u2014home to and generations of workers in the industry.

Alcohol : Richmond\u2019s craft beer boom and active nightlife make drinking deeply embedded in the city\u2019s culture. With bars, breweries, and music venues everywhere, alcohol dependency is socially normalized, making recovery more difficult.\n\n\n\n: Richmond\u2019s craft beer boom and active nightlife make drinking deeply embedded in the city\u2019s culture. With bars, breweries, and music venues everywhere, alcohol dependency is socially normalized, making recovery more difficult. Opioids: Richmond has been at the center of Virginia\u2019s opioid crisis, with fentanyl driving a record number of overdoses in 2021. Prescription painkillers were widely available in the early 2000s, contributing to long-term dependency. Today, synthetic opioids like fentanyl have replaced heroin as the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the city.\n\nVirginia Tech Study: Opioid Addiction is the Hardest to Quit\n\nVirginia Tech\u2019s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute recently published findings confirming that opioid addiction has the highest relapse rate among substance dependencies. The study found that those attempting to quit opioids face neurochemical changes that increase cravings and compulsive use, making long-term abstinence incredibly difficult.\n\nThe research also points to the necessity of medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which includes methadone and buprenorphine to ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. However, access to MAT in Richmond remains inconsistent. Clinics like the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA) provide these treatments, but long waitlists and insurance barriers often delay care, increasing the risk of relapse.\n\nRichmond\u2019s Addiction Crisis: The Numbers Tell the Story\n\nRichmond\u2019s addiction problem is not just anecdotal\u2014it is backed by stark statistics:\n\nDespite these challenges, access to treatment in Richmond remains uneven. Those with private insurance or financial resources have more options, while lower-income residents often face limited availability, transportation barriers, and gaps in harm reduction programs.\n\nWhy Addiction is So Hard to Overcome\n\nThe difficulty of quitting a substance depends on how it interacts with the brain\u2019s reward system. Opioids and nicotine activate powerful pleasure pathways, creating a cycle of reinforcement that leads to persistent cravings. Withdrawal symptoms also play a major role\u2014opioid withdrawal can be debilitating, while alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening in severe cases.\n\nAccessibility further complicates recovery. Nicotine and alcohol, despite their addictive properties, are widely available and socially normalized, making avoidance difficult. Meanwhile, illicit drugs like heroin and fentanyl come with legal and social consequences that can prevent users from seeking medical help until they reach crisis points.\n\nIn Richmond, addiction recovery is further shaped by economic and racial disparities. The opioid epidemic has hit certain communities harder, particularly lower-income neighborhoods where access to treatment is limited. Criminalization also remains a barrier, as some individuals fear seeking help due to the legal risks associated with drug use.\n\nThe Need for Better Treatment Strategies in Richmond\n\nResearch from Virginia Tech and other institutions reinforces that willpower alone is not enough to overcome addiction. More comprehensive, science-backed solutions are needed, particularly for opioid addiction. Richmond\u2019s path forward requires:\n\nExpanded access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) at local clinics and hospitals.\n\nat local clinics and hospitals. More funding for recovery programs , including affordable counseling, transitional housing, and job training.\n\n, including affordable counseling, transitional housing, and job training. Harm reduction strategies , such as wider Narcan distribution, safe use education, and needle exchange programs.\n\n, such as wider Narcan distribution, safe use education, and needle exchange programs. Community-led efforts to change how addiction is viewed and treated, reducing stigma and increasing support for those in recovery.\n\nThe opioid crisis continues to take lives, and youth vaping and alcohol dependency remain persistent problems in Richmond. Addressing these challenges requires a shift in public policy, medical treatment availability, and cultural attitudes toward addiction and recovery. Without systemic changes, addiction will continue to claim lives and destabilize communities across the city.\n\nRichmond\u2019s struggle with addiction is not just a public health crisis\u2014it is a test of how the city chooses to support its most vulnerable residents. Whether through increased access to treatment, expanded harm reduction efforts, or changes in public perception, the city has an opportunity to reshape its response to addiction and offer a path to recovery for those in need.\n\nSupport Richmond Independent Media Like RVA Magazine\n\nIn a world where big corporations and wealthy individuals shape much of the media landscape, RVA Magazine remains fiercely independent, amplifying the voices of Richmond\u2019s artists, musicians, and community.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., himself a former Richmond mayor and civil rights lawyer, recounted Marsh\u2019s mentorship.\n\nAs a student at Virginia Union University, Marsh testified before state lawmakers to oppose Virginia maintaining separate public schools for Blacks and whites.\n\nMarsh then attended Howard University law school, sharing a room with L. Douglas Wilder, who followed Marsh as Richmond\u2019s mayor and later became the nation\u2019s first Black governor.\n\nMarsh joined with Samuel L. Tucker to form a law firm in 1961. Together, they won legal battles involving Philip Morris and seniority for Black employees, and the establishment of single-member districts in both chambers of the General Assembly.\n\nScott said Saturday that Marsh was lead attorney on nearly 50 lawsuits to end segregated schools in Virginia.\n\nMarsh was later appointed by then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe as commissioner of the state\u2019s Department of Alcohol Beverage Control.\n\nMarsh\u2019s wife, Diane, a dentist, died in 2020. His survivors include three children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

(NYSE:PM) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now.\n\nA notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market\u2019s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nFor example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company\u2019s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

            "content": "If Montana allows cigar bars, residents and tourists will be able to enjoy a \u201cpremium, hand-rolled cigar\u201d on their visits, one proponent argued.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks are looking for a particular hospitality experience when they come visit our state and other areas, and we believe Senate Bill 150 goes a long way in allowing for this unique opportunity in limited circumstances,\u201d said Jessie Luther, on behalf of the Hospitality & Development Association of Montana.\n\nBut the bill, heard Thursday in the Senate Business, Labor and Economic Affairs Committee, would hurt workers who don\u2019t have a choice about the air they breathe, and it would undermine the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act passed in 2005, opponents said.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s like a step backwards in time if we allow this to occur,\u201d said Mitch Bradley, who said he saw his father suffer the consequences of smoking.\n\nSen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, said he\u2019s been bringing similar legislation since 2017, and it\u2019s a heavy lift. But Galt said 12 other states exempt bars from their clean indoor air acts, and he believes Montana can allow cigar bars with a narrowly crafted exception too.\n\n\u201cWe are not new in any of this,\u201d Galt said.\n\nA representative for the Cigar Association of America said the bill has \u201cpretty good sideboards,\u201d and the group would support the bill with an unspecified amendment, although Galt said he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d consider it friendly.\n\nThe bill would allow a cigar bar endorsement for businesses under certain conditions, including ones that hold an all-beverages license and gaming or gambling license, only offer cigars sold on site, and don\u2019t allow other tobacco or marijuana products, among other conditions.\n\nOpponents at the hearing, including high school students and public health representatives, argued the bill would reverse progress in Montana and set a dangerous precedent that would open the door for marijuana bars and hookah bars.\n\nSeveral other bills related to smoking and vaping also are under consideration at the Montana Legislature.\n\nIn a separate hearing on Thursday, Sen. Becky Beard, R-Elliston, pitched Senate Bill 98, which would tax traditional cigarettes and ones that are \u201cheat-not-burn,\u201d (HBN), differently. Beard said HBN would be taxed at 85 cents a pack compared to traditional cigarettes at $1.70 a pack.\n\nBeard said one in eight Montana adults smoke, most from lower income levels, and the bill would provide harm reduction and help people quit. The products heat tobacco, releasing a vapor as opposed to actually burning the cigarette.\n\nPhilip Morris International supported the bill and argued a product with less risk should also be taxed less.\n\nHowever, representatives from the American Lung Association of Montana, the Montana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Montana Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Heart Association spoke in opposition to the bill.\n\nJackie Semmens, with the American Heart Association in Montana, said heat-not-burn cigarettes are a new area for the tobacco industry, which has \u201chistorically and consistently\u201d misled the public about the health impacts of its products.\n\n\u201cThese products have not been around long enough to fully understand their dangers,\u201d said Semmens, who also said HNB cigarettes are not approved cessation devices.\n\nAt the hearing about cigar bars, one opponent pointed to a poll that shows 89% of Montanans support the Clean Indoor Air Act. A 2021 study from New Bridge Strategy also found three quarters of Montanans were concerned about tobacco use.\n\nDr. Richard Sargent, co-author of a medical study that showed heart attacks dropped 40% in Helena when a local smoking ban was enforced a couple of decades ago \u2014 and ticked back up after the ban was overturned \u2014 said cigar smoke is not special or different than cigarette smoke.\n\nSargent said the legislation would be a violation of the Clean Indoor Air Act, which protects employees and nonsmokers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really think that anybody should be granted their own personal exemption from that law,\u201d Sargent said.\n\nSargent also said the amount of ventilation that would be needed to ensure clean air indoors is cost prohibitive based on studies from engineers.\n\nSen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, said people have to breathe in smoke during forest fires, but with cigar smoke, they can choose. Phalen also said he wears a nicotine patch to prevent disease.\n\n\u201cI see no problem with a cigar bar,\u201d Phalen said.\n\nSargent said nicotine is a normal neurotransmitter in the brain but there is no benefit to the human body from excess. In response to a question, he also said an N95 mask will only filter about 5% of the particles in \u201cside stream\u201d smoke, or smoke from a cigar or cigarette that goes directly into the air.\n\nA fresh air supply through a vented suit would be needed to truly protect an employee from contaminants, Sargent said.\n\nChair Mark Noland, R-Bigfork, said if the bill passes, he would like to ensure health inspectors have access to full respirators, which he estimated at $275 apiece.\n\n\u201cWe can do that to safeguard anybody going in so they don\u2019t have to be exposed,\u201d Noland said.\n\nLisa Dworak, with the Confluence Public Health Alliance, representing nearly every health department in the state, opposed the bill, in part because she said the enforcement piece is confusing.\n\nDworak said it appears the Department of Public Health and Human Services would enforce the bill, but doing so would run contrary to its mission.\n\nC.B. Pearson, who has worked on tobacco disease prevention for 45 years including in Montana, said the state\u2019s act was a compromise in 2005. He said one concern at the time was that the legislation never be penetrated.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re seeing that, and we have seen that before, but I think this is a more serious challenge,\u201d Pearson said.\n\nThe American Heart Association, Montana Medical Association and Association of Montana Public Health Officials also opposed the bill.\n\nThe committee did not take immediate action on the cigar bar bill, and Galt said he will bring an amendment for minor changes, including to drop the amount of gross income businesses need to generate from cigars to operate to be more realistic.\n\nThe bill to assess taxes differently for heat-not-burn cigarettes also had not been voted on Thursday, according to an online legislative status update.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been corrected to note Galt said the number of exempted entities from state clean air acts was bars, not cigar bars.\n\nDaily Montanan is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

            "content": "Table of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nBeatrice Wood (born March 3, 1893, San Francisco, California, U.S.\u2014died March 12, 1998, Ojai, California) was an American ceramicist who was dubbed the \u201cMama of Dada\u201d as a result of her affiliation with the Dada movement and artist Marcel Duchamp. She gained celebrity for her pottery, for her unusual lustreware in particular, and inspired a character in the book Jules et Jim (1953; film 1961) as well as the 101-year-old Rose character in the film Titanic (1997).\n\nAt age five Wood moved with her family from the West Coast to New York City. Raised in a well-to-do household that was governed by the social conventions of the turn of the 20th century, Wood rebelled against her affluent, society lifestyle when in 1910 she went to Paris as a teenager to study art at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. At the outbreak of World War I, Wood returned to New York City at the request of her parents and chose to pursue theatre and acting. Her fluency in French allowed her to join the French National Repertory Theatre. It was during that period that she met Dada artist Duchamp. He introduced her to French diplomat and writer Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 and the wider New York City Dada circle and encouraged her interest in modern art. Among her acquaintances were Walter and Louise Arensberg, a couple who helped finance and enliven the modern art movement through their elaborate evening soirees. With Roch\u00e9 and Duchamp, Wood founded the short-lived Dada magazine The Blind Man in 1917. She also created drawings and posters for other Dadaist magazines, made whimsical and autobiographical drawings, watercolours, and collages, and began exhibiting her work at Society of Independent Artists shows. It was at that point that she became known as the \u201cMama of Dada.\u201d\n\nAfter time spent abroad and in New York City, Wood moved in 1928 to the Los Angeles area to be closer to Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti and her former benefactors the Arensbergs. Wood gravitated toward Eastern religion and Krishnamurti\u2019s philosophy, which soon began to shape her lifestyle, artistic output, and aesthetic. In 1933, at age 40, the artist took an interest in ceramics and enrolled in an adult education course at Hollywood High School. By the late 1930s, she had begun to study with University of Southern California artist Glen Lukens, but she ultimately found her most-influential mentors in Gertrud and Otto Natzler. The Natzlers shared their techniques and glazes with Wood, though they worried that her work bore too close a resemblance to their signature style. She moved on to work independently and became a pioneer of in-glaze lustres that were singular in colour palette. Department stores such as Neiman Marcus and Marshall Field\u2019s began carrying her functional ceramic wares, while museums such as such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art began to exhibit her work.\n\nIn 1948 Wood moved northwest of Los Angeles to Ojai, California, to be nearer to Krishnamurti, who had settled there earlier. While selling her dinnerware and vessels to department stores, she worked part-time as a ceramics instructor at Happy Valley School (now Besant Hill School). In 1961 she was invited by the U.S. State Department on behalf of the Indian government to do a 14-city tour of India, lecturing and exhibiting her pottery. During that trip, the first of a number she would make to that region of the world, she adopted the sari as her preferred style of dress.\n\nThe 1960s and \u201970s saw the inception of Wood\u2019s series of small sculptures that she called \u201csophisticated primitives.\u201d In those figural works Wood expressed her pessimism toward sexual relations and marriage as well as variations on the idea of prostitution. In the 1980s she exhibited her figurative sculptures and others, though they generally were not as well received as her non-figural works.\n\nLate in life, Wood published a number of books. The first, The Angel Who Wore Black Tights (1982), is an autobiographical novel based on her time spent as an adolescent in France. With the encouragement of her friend writer Ana\u00efs Nin, Wood published an autobiography, I Shock Myself: The Autobiography of Beatrice Wood (1985). The travel memoirs Pinching Spaniards (1988) and 33rd Wife of a Maharajah: A Love Affair in India (1992) followed. Wood also continued to work as a ceramicist until her death at age 105.",

Video screens and posters promote devices that deliver nicotine by heating tobacco rather than burning it. The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices. Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.\n\nTobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco. Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom. Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law. CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal. \"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC. \"It's taking the mick, is my view.\" There is limited evidence regarding the health effects of heated tobacco, according to Prof Lion Shahab, co-director of the tobacco and alcohol research group at University College, London. \"As it involves no combustion, heated tobacco is likely less harmful than cigarettes,\" he said. \"Current findings suggest that heated tobacco may be more harmful than e-cigarettes, and less effective at helping smokers give up cigarettes long-term.\"\n\nIn June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\". Two months later, he wrote to thank them for \"agreeing to comply with our request to stop advertising and promoting the iQos device\". PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop. A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"\n\nTobacco counter in Morrisons, London, showing adverts for heated tobacco devices",

CVN regularly and often exclusively covers trials ending in major defense wins that without CVN would only be witnessed by a small handful of attorneys and a court reporter before quietly slipping through the cracks.\n\nSome defense attorneys reasonably have concerns about cameras in the courtroom, but CVN\u2019s editorial team is rigorously committed to non-biased, non-disruptive objective coverage. Tremendous advances in camera technology have made electronic media access to the courtroom less obtrusive than even just a few short years ago. Having successfully covered hundreds of trials without incident over more than a decade, CVN hopes more defense attorneys will come to see this type of respectful coverage as distinct from the way cameras in courtrooms used to operate - and thus not something to automatically oppose.\n\nThe trials listed below make up the 10 most impressive defense verdicts CVN covered in 2024, taking into consideration the facts of the case, the attorneys involved, and the potential broader impact on other litigation. These trials (limited to cases CVN had the opportunity to film) feature some of the most elite, highly sought defense counsel in the country arguing in high-stakes cases before real judges and real juries and going up against some of the most dynamic plaintiff attorneys practicing today. Watching advocates of this caliber firsthand in real trials is an invaluable experience for any attorney.\n\nSign up today for a monthly or annual CVN video library subscription and get unlimited access to all of these trials, in addition to all the trials on our top 10 plaintiff list and hundreds more - including all the trials on our top 10 defense verdict lists from years past.\n\nHave any questions about CVN?

Jason Rankin, Emilee Bramstedt (HelperBroom LLC), Shirleitha Franklin (Jones Day)\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\nWhy it made the list:\n\nLawsuits over claims that cows milk-based baby formula given to premature infants in hospital settings can cause serious bowel injuries constitute one of the most closely watched emerging mass torts in the country. By last November the first two trials against formula manufacturers resulted in a $60 million verdict over Mead Johnson\u2019s Enfamil brand formula in Illinois and a $495 million verdict against Abbott over their Similac brand formula in Missouri.\n\nThe third NEC formula trial would mark the first time both Mead and Abbott went before a jury simultaneously, in addition to showing whether or not a third consecutive jury would return a plaintiff verdict - an outcome that could have a significant impact on the contours of any eventual large scale settlement of NEC formula cases.\n\nFollowing a five-week trial a St. Louis jury delivered a defense verdict for both companies, essentially resetting the board for the NEC trial landscape leading up to the first federal bellwether trial in May. It\u2019s the type of win that has major industry-wide implications and drew scrutiny from attorneys and analysts throughout the United States, and it\u2019s the clear pick for the most impressive defense verdict CVN covered in 2024.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#2 - Urologist And Hospital Land Defense Win In Pelvic Mesh Malpractice Trial\n\nTamarie Richards v.

While not consolidated in MDL\u2019s like mesh product cases were, many of these cases are proceeding quietly in state court dockets and largely under the radar, as malpractice cases don\u2019t draw the same attention as high-profile mass torts.\n\nThis mesh medmal trial CVN covered last summer in Portland involved the considerable defense challenge of overcoming evidence that a urologist implanted a mesh device despite allegedly knowing the FDA issued warnings against its use days before (and then again just hours before) the plaintiff's surgery. It\u2019s the type of \u201cbad fact\u201d that requires deft and precise framing for a jury to properly contextualize.\n\nFacing off against a plaintiff team with deep expertise in pelvic mesh litigation, the defense attorneys in this case pulled off that significant achievement, thus making this the second most impressive defense verdict CVN covered in 2024.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#3 - Florida Jury Clears Johnson & Johnson In Cosmetic Talc Trial\n\nMatthey v. Johnson & Johnson - Sarasota, FL\n\nDefense attorneys: Morty Dubin (pictured), Kathryn Lehman (King & Spalding LLP)\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\n2024 saw some of the first cosmetic talc trials take place in Florida, a state with a massive population known for its aggressive plaintiff bar. Both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma-related talc trials have been playing out around the country for the last decade (with many covered by CVN), but how Florida juries would weigh in on these high-profile cases remained a largely unanswered question.\n\nAfter one trial in March ended in a deadlocked jury in Miami, a subsequent jury in Sarasota rejected claims that J&J\u2019s baby powder caused the ovarian cancer death of a woman who used the product for decades.\n\nThe plaintiff - represented by a powerhouse firm with a national footprint - maintained J&J knew for years that talc-based products like Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder contained asbestos but withheld that knowledge from consumers. However J&J successfully argued those conclusions were based on flawed scientific studies and that the plaintiffs\u2019 medical history made her especially likely to develop ovarian cancer.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#4 - Nissan Cleared In $42M Trial Over Allegedly Defective Airbag\n\nJohn Paxin Jr., et al., v. Nissan North America, et al - Las Vegas, NV\n\nDefense attorneys: Tom Klein (pictured), Greg Gilmer, Melissa Wilner (Klein Thomas Lee & Fresard)\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\nWhy it made the list:\n\nA Nevada state court jury returned a defense verdict last July in a product liability trial over allegations an airbag in a Nissan vehicle accidentally deployed and paralyzed the driver.\n\nThe Clark County jury reached their verdict on July 11 in a trial that kicked off on May 28. Plaintiff John Paxin sued Nissan following a 2017 accident, when he drove his 2012 Titan truck off the road. While the vehicle remained upright, the side curtain airbag meant to protect passengers in rollovers - known as a SCAB - inflated and supposedly fractured Paxin\u2019s neck.\n\nPaxin was rendered a quadriplegic and died in 2020 of pneumonia. Attorneys for his family sought $42 million in damages, however Nissan successfully argued Paxin suffered from a medical condition that made his neck brittle and especially prone to injury, and that the SCAB system\u2019s software designed to predict rollovers before they occur functioned properly.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#5 - California Jury Rejects $45M+ Childbirth Malpractice Lawsuit\n\nMatthew G.

Philip Morris - Miami, FL\n\nDefense attorneys: Lindsey Heinz (pictured), Bruce Tepikian (Shook Hardy & Bacon LLP)\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\nWhy it made the list:\n\nLast summer jurors cleared Philip Morris of responsibility for the laryngeal cancer a Florida woman developed after years of smoking the company\u2019s \"Virginia Slims\" cigarettes.The state court jury, in Florida's 11th circuit, capped an eight-day trial by finding in favor of Philip Morris on a design defect claim related to its Virginia Slims, which Tomasa Santana, who began smoking in the 1970s, favored for much of her life.\n\nThe case against Philip Morris is a relatively unusual Florida tobacco lawsuit that is not among the thousands of so-called \u201cEngle progeny\u201d cases spun from an earlier class action against the nation\u2019s cigarette companies. Unlike \u201cEngle progeny\u201d suits, in which design defect are already resolved against tobacco defendants, the Santana case required plaintiff to prove his design-defect claim in order to prevail.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#7 - Georgia Jury Clears ER Doctor in Med Mal Trial Over Patient's Catastrophic Stroke\n\nBarnett v. Johnson, M.D., et al. - Marietta, GA\n\nDefense attorneys: John Hall (pictured), Beth Kanik, Nichole Hair (Hall Booth Smith PC)\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\nWhy it made the list:\n\nLast October a Georgia jury cleared an emergency room physician of responsibility for the catastrophic fallout from a brain-stem stroke that one of her patients suffered.\n\nThe Cobb County (Georgia) State Court jury\u2019s decision capped a seven-day trial over the February 2013 stroke Jennifer Barnett suffered, which has left her with a range of disabilities and needing assistance to perform daily activities. Jurors concluded Dr. Richisa Hamilton-Salazar was not grossly negligent in her emergency treatment of Barnett after she arrived in the Atlanta Medical Center\u2019s ER, complaining of numbness, weakness, and confusion, among other symptoms that could be associated with a stroke.\n\nThe trial turned in large part on Hamilton-Salazar\u2019s workup of Barnett after her arrival in the hospital. During Wednesday\u2019s closings, Barnett\u2019s attorney, the Bell Law Firm\u2019s Lloyd Bell, detailed evidence he said showed Hamilton-Salazar violated the standard of care by failing to take a proper medical history of Barnett and failing to order a neurologic consult on the case, despite Barnett showing multiple symptoms of an ongoing stroke.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#8 - California Jury Rejects Age Discrimination Lawsuit\n\nManuel Banderas v. Pentair Water Pool & Spa Inc., et al. - San Bernardino, CA\n\nDefense attorneys: Reginald Roberts (pictured) - Sanders Roberts LLP, Marissa Lyftogt - Wilson Turner Kosmo LLP\n\nClick here to watch the full trial\n\nWhy it made the list:\n\nA California state court jury sided with a large pool equipment supply company last October in an age discrimination lawsuit filed by a former employee who claims he was illegally forced out of his job.\n\nThe San Bernardino County jury returned their verdict on October 10 in a trial that began on September 19. Plaintiff Manuel Banderas accused Pentair, a publicly traded company with roughly 10,000 employees, of using the threat of termination to get him to quit his longtime warehouse laborer job due to his age.\n\nHowever Pentair argued Banderas voluntarily resigned, and that repeated workplace infractions - specifically numerous safety violations and a refusal to comply with updated company policies for how employees must clock in and clock out - could have served as reasonable grounds for his termination. While the jury found Banderas was fired they also determined Pentair's decision to terminate an at-will employee did not run afoul of age discrimination laws.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#9 - Jury Finds Casino Security's Negligence Didn\u2019t Cause Patron\u2019s Death\n\nJonathan Jung v.

While they found the security staff negligent the jury also determined their actions were not a substantial factor in the man's death.\n\nThe family of Jonathan Jung sued Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens in 2022 following his death claiming poorly trained security agents used excessive force to restrain him in a parking lot. His attorneys sought $132 million in damages, but the casino successfully argued that Jung died from methamphetamine toxicity.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\n#10 - Jury Clears ATV Rental Company Of Liability For Rollover Accident\n\nBeatrice Smith v. SunBuggy Fun Rentals - Las Vegas, NV\n\nDefense attorneys: M.

Plaintiff Beatrice Smith sought nearly $500,000 in past and future damages for injuries she sustained in 2018 during an ATV tour operated by SunBuggy Fun Rentals.\n\nSmith broke her ankle when her ATV rolled over on a hill, and she accused the tour operator of ignoring a complaint she made about the vehicle\u2019s steering earlier in the tour. She argued SunBuggy did not perform adequate maintenance on her ATV and had a systemic practice of failing to properly document similar accidents, but the company successfully convinced jurors the waiver Smith signed prior to the tour absolves them of all responsibility for her injuries.\n\nRead more via the CVN News Blog\n\n***\n\nE-mail David Siegel at dsiegel@cvn.com",

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables and Swedish Match\u2019s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. Renewal applications for these IQOS products are pending before the FDA. As of June 30, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and PMI estimates that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 38% of PMI\u2019s total first-nine months 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI has a long-term ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

            "content": "The market expects Philip Morris (PM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $9.36 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.03% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",

            "content": "It\u2019s okay if you know Phil Morris from his five episodes as flamboyant attorney Jackie Chiles on Seinfeld, but even though that was a momentous role for the actor and it changed his life, the last time he played that part was more than 25 years ago.\n\nHe\u2019s done literally hundreds of other roles since, in a career that spans more than four decades, so there\u2019s obviously a lot more to him than that. Over the last quarter century, while Morris still works plenty in front of the camera, he has become a very successful voice actor, as well, voicing video games, animated TV shows and movies, and more than once working as a substitute for Eddie Murphy. Yes, really. That should tell you just how much of a badass Phil Morris is. He spoke to us from his home in Los Angeles.\n\nDraw from your own life and interests to add depth to your characters, as Morris did with his knowledge of comics and martial arts.\n\nExpand your range by exploring different types of acting, including voice work, and continually seek to improve your skills.\n\nTo succeed in voice acting, focus on embodying the character, not just having a good voice. Acting workshops can help develop this skill.\n\nHow did you become an actor in the first place?\n\nMy father\u2019s Greg Morris, who was in the original Mission: Impossible series in the \u201860s. He was the electronics wizard that Ving Rhames now affects in the movies. So I\u2019ve been around it my whole life. When the show started, it was 1966, I was seven. So it changed our lives exponentially, like overnight, and I was introduced to an entirely new world of entertainment and high-level television. At first, I resisted its until I had an experience with my dad on location when I was 17, just out of high school. It was an Air Force film that never got completed, called Contact 303 with my father, Billy Dee Williams, Henry Fonda, Chad Everett, Merle Haggard, Buck Henry. They did all the exteriors on location in the Mojave Desert. When they came back to Paramount, they really had no money left, which is why I think it was there specifically for me to get started. I got back to LA, I went to an acting class and I haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nYou had already been working steadily for two decades when you first showed up on Seinfeld as Jackie Chiles in 1995. It was the number one show on TV, back when that meant tens of millions of people watching. What did that do for your career?\n\nIt was great. Seinfeld was so in the zeitgeist, so there were more eyes on that than anything I\u2019d ever done. Most people looked at me as a dramatic actor, and if I was in a comedy, I was mainly a setup guy, a straight man. I think I was a really funny guy in real life, but I was so concerned with significance in my acting career, it was hard for me to be funny on camera. It\u2019s really hard to let go and be funny when you\u2019re looking at yourself. You know, comedic characters have no idea they\u2019re being funny, and that\u2019s what\u2019s funny about them, right? But you have to loosen up your gear in order to get to that place, and it took me a minute to get there. Jackie Chiles was such a great dynamic character for me. It allowed me to fly freely.\n\nDid the character come naturally to you?\n\nI remember one time distinctly on set after we read the first script at the table, we\u2019re going to rehearse with director Andy Ackerman. Jerry\u2019s sitting there off set, he\u2019s not directing, just sitting there watching. You\u2019ve got five days to do the show, I\u2019ve never done Jackie before, and I\u2019m trying to figure out, how do I do him? What are the setups? The rhythms? I\u2019m working on stuff, and Jerry just goes, \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, you know, I got five days, man, to figure this guy out. I gotta work on some stuff.\u201d He goes, \u201cWhoa, nope, nope, nope, nope. I need you to be exactly the way you were when you were in my office, when you got the job. Can you do that?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, hell yes, I can do that.\u201d (Laughs) I spent the next five days just grooving that, and that\u2019s what we saw for however many episodes I did.\n\nObviously, you still do a lot of on-camera work, but you\u2019re also becoming known more and more for your voice acting. How did you transition into that field?\n\nMy sister Iona, who was the original voice of Storm when the X-Men cartoon first came out, before they moved all the voices to Canada and shipped out all the work away from the United States, she was always telling me, man, you got a good voice. You should get voiceover work. I always said, I\u2019m a face guy, right? That\u2019s what we call on-camera actors, so I never really followed that thread. Then one day, my agent said, there\u2019s a role at Disney for this movie, The Legend of Mulan. They wanted somebody to approximate what Eddie Murphy would do as Mushu the dragon, so the animators could get started on their process. Eddie was not going to be involved with this project for three years, which is what it takes for traditional animation features to realize themselves. So I would come in and I would approximate what Eddie would do. They\u2019d give me Eddie\u2019s scratch and then I would do his dialogue. So I got that job, then a show called The PJs came up.\n\nI remember that. The guy who did the California Raisins commercials, right?\n\nThat whole thing. Eddie was the lead of this incredibly funny, urban, animated comedy. But he didn\u2019t feel like doing every episode. So they knew I\u2019d done this thing for Disney and thinking that I\u2019m the Eddie Murphy guy. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just a dude who would approximate what Eddie would do, right? So I come in and I auditioned for them and I get it. So now I\u2019m doing The PJs in a separate booth from the entire cast so that if Eddie wants to do it, they will just lift my voice out and put his in. So if you watch The PJs, there\u2019s a bunch of times where Thurgood sounds just a little bit different. That\u2019s me. Anyway, to answer your question, that got me into voiceovers. I\u2019ve never taken a voiceover class. I don\u2019t think I ever will. It\u2019s all acting. It\u2019s just a different medium.\n\nYou\u2019ve played your share of known characters in animation. I\u2019m curious if there is an added level of pressure to that, playing somebody people already know from one medium or another, like the DC Comics characters you\u2019ve played.\n\nI\u2019m a card-carrying comic book guy. I have 20,000 comics in long boxes, so I know these guys. I went in for Young Justice, and they start saying, okay, explain to Phil about the universe. And I go, whoa, whoa, let\u2019s not waste any time on explaining something I already know. Let\u2019s test-drive these voices and see how they sound. They were flabbergasted. No actors ever know this. I worked with Tom Welling on Smallville. He had no idea about the Superman mythos, zero. None. I know these guys. I grew up with them. I live with them. So there\u2019s no one who needs to be satisfied more than I do.\n\nDo you have a favorite of those experiences?\n\nI did Saint Walker for the Green Lantern series. The first Blue Lantern, right? He\u2019s an amazing character. I get there and I\u2019m like, \u201cGuys, this character\u2019s amazing. What were your thoughts about him?\u201d Well, you know, he\u2019s like a martial arts master. And I go, \u201cWere you reading my background? I\u2019m in two halls of fame for martial arts.\u201d They go, no, they didn\u2019t know that. They just felt from my essence that I could approximate this character. So those are the things that are so beautiful about what we do and where like your real life really finds a nexus with your professional life.\n\nIf someone wanted to get into voice acting, what advice would you give them?\n\nFind a good acting workshop. There\u2019s plenty of them, wherever you are. You have to go and figure out whether or not you can take a character and make them your own and live in their skin. You\u2019ve got to get on stage or in front of a mic and express this character to the world. That\u2019s where sometimes the disconnect happens. Because yes, you can have a good voice. You can be very funny with all your friends and your parents can think you\u2019re the cutest thing since sliced bread, but if you can\u2019t express the inner workings of this character so that it\u2019s resonant to an audience, you\u2019re not an actor. You have to start with figuring out what it is that you have to say, and read, read, keep reading, keep exposing yourself to so many different things. Go to class to learn about the work, and then go out and live life. Race cars, climb mountains, swim oceans, love people, eat good food, travel the world, expose yourself to different cultures, music, and then you\u2019ll find out what you have to say.",

Meanwhile, 28 inpatient beds are closed and the stalemate with staff specialist psychiatrists continues.\n\nMental health patients in Western Sydney hospitals are beginning the move from public to private hospitals today, says NSW Health Secretary Susan Pearce.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference today, Ms Pearce confirmed that the department was already working with private hospitals as part of their contingency plan.\n\n\u201cThis is not an abnormal thing for us, but we\u2019ve got good partnerships occurring, particularly in western Sydney, with private providers,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am advised that some patients from Western Sydney hospitals were moving into some of those private beds today and currently we\u2019re working to see, wherever possible and clinically appropriate, if people are able to move directly from the emergency department to a private hospital.\n\n\u201cAs I said, [this is only] where appropriate: [a] clinical decision, not a management decision.\n\n\u201cOur interest is in keeping our patients safe. We don\u2019t want people to have poor experience.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about whether involuntary patients would be able to be treated in private hospitals, Ms Pearce said they were working on making this a possibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely correct to say that involuntary patients can\u2019t be admitted to a private hospital,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat is required, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re currently working on, is the ability for us, under the appropriate legislative arrangements, to declare beds in private hospitals.\n\n\u201cThat means that, where possible and clinically appropriate, involuntary patients in fact can be admitted to a private hospital under those circumstances.\n\n\u201cThat is not in place yet. It is something that we have had discussions about with the private hospital providers, because in other states, they do that.\u201d\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, 55 psychiatrists have resigned and 50 have transitioned to VMO roles.\n\nNSW Minister for Mental Health Rose Jackson said that, from her understanding, 28 public inpatient beds had been removed from operation in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cI should indicate that my advice is that some of those beds are not available for reasons other than the mass resignation of psychiatrists. For example, other staffing issues or issues in particular workplaces with infrastructure,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is our intention to, over time, bring them back online.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no interest from us in having physical beds available that we\u2019re not able to have people cared for [in].\u201d\n\nMs Jackson said she remained unable to provide any costings for the VMO and locums currently replacing psychiatrists as \u201cfigures are changing every single day\u201d.\n\nAccording to a piece published by the Guardian today, leaked documents show that more than half of the staff specialist psychiatrists from Sydney LHD have resigned.\n\nHaving previously said that, if asked to by the Industrial Relations Commission, the government would pay what the psychiatrist were calling for, the Ms Jackson said today that \u201ca 25% wage increase in one year alone is not reasonable\u201d.\n\nBut Ms Pearce reiterated that \u201cthe government has been very clear in terms of abiding by [the IRC\u2019s] findings\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost in February, the hearing is during March, and it\u2019s not that far away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe really ask [staff specialist psychiatrists], please stay with us and allow that process to continue.\u201d\n\nMs Pearce said the state was not asking any professional to work beyond their scope of practice.\n\nShe said that the extensive contingency plan did not indicate that anyone that was not a psychiatrist would be asked to take on that role.\n\n\u201c[The system has] more than 500 clinical nurse consultants, nurse practitioners [and] allied health professionals, who are very, very skilled people, they are able to work at an advanced level, that is what they are trained to do [but] no one is suggesting that they take the role of a psychiatrist.\u201d\n\nMs Jackson added that under the Mental Health Act, there were particular roles that only a psychiatrist could legally play, and that the state was absolutely playing to the letter of the law.\n\n\u201cThere are still hundreds of psychiatrists, either staff specialists, VMOS, locums, operating in the system performing those roles now.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s a smaller number of them \u2026 some things will happen a little bit more slowly, but absolutely our legal obligations are a baseline requirement from us.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion that any of the requirements under the Mental Health Act are not being met.\u201d\n\nMs Jackson said she thought that the system was functioning \u201cconsidering the circumstances, as well as can be expected\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis particular issue has exacerbated some underlying and long running issues. But it\u2019s not fair to say that some of those challenges \u2026 are not things that the system was experiencing prior to this particular incident.\n\n\u201cI would challenge the idea that the sector is united in suggesting that the staff specialist wage claim is the top priority in mental health funding right now. That\u2019s not the feedback that I\u2019m receiving.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the feedback that I\u2019m receiving is transitioning to more community based care is the top priority.\u201d\n\nMs Pearce \u201ccompletely reject[ed]\u201d the sentiment that the system was easily broken.\n\n\u201cThe New South Wales health system is one of the best health systems anywhere in the world on any objective measure, and I\u2019m happy to provide you with the data,\u201d she said.\n\nThis article was updated at 5pm on 30 January to include the number of resigned psychiatrists and the number of VMOs.",

She happens to be the same friend who at parties in Williamsburg announces when she is opening a new can of Zyn to encourage what she calls \u201ccamaraderie.\u201d\n\nIf I hosted a dinner party for all of the Zyn fanatics in my life, you\u2019d have West Village Ruby, a focaccia baker named Mo, a finance guy named Aedan, a lacrosse coach named Lars, and a brand designer named Malu. The social equivalent of hitting shuffle. Over the past year, I learned Zyn users no longer look only like the frat guys in the memes on my newsfeed\u2014they look like anyone with a pulse.\n\nAs the reign of the Swedish nicotine pouches expands in America\u2014unit sales increased 641 percent between 2019 and 2022, and reported sales of the Zyn brand alone were projected to increase 51 percent between 2023 and 2024\u2014I am not alone in waking up to the idea that Zyn just might be for\u2026everyone. That is: It\u2019s not just for cowboys or fishermen. It\u2019s not just for people who voted red or for people who voted blue. It\u2019s not just white-collar and not just working-class. People use it while playing sports (Baker Mayfield, the Bucs quarterback, stirred some controversy while appearing to pack a lip on the sideline of an NFL game this season), while gambling in casinos, while cranking out decks in the office, while painting houses, and while, yes, writing magazine stories. In equal measure, it\u2019s used on the dance floor (the buzz keeps you up) and on the trading floor (it keeps you locked in, focused, ready to crush); at nighttime, morning time (there\u2019s a coffee flavor), and\u2014for some super users\u2014all-the-day time. Which sounds, yes, a whole lot like cigarettes.\n\nExcept that, in the absence of cigarette smoke (or the cartoon cloud produced by vaping, or the telltale bulge of a dipper), you might never know that Zyn users are all around you. The house of Zyn is big and diverse, but it is discreet. Its members do not need to duck out for their nicotine fix, they just tuck a pouch the size of a Sour Patch Kid above their canines and get on with it, while privately enjoying a cycle of elation followed by calm\u2014followed by the urge to Zyn again. And so a generation that grew up knowing for sure that smoking was deadly discovered why people loved it anyway. Nicotine use might be their biggest shared secret.",

In 2006 Atria Group in their 2005 Annual Report would reveal that their food segment had accounted for about 35% of the yearly revenue while their tobacco segment had accounted for about 65% of its revenues.\n\n5 Years later in the year 2000, Phillip Morris would acquire Nabisco for $55 a shares in a deal totaling $14.9 billion. Nabisco's brand portfolio at the time of acquisition included a multitude of snack brands such as: Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Fig Newtons, Wheat Thins, Planters, Ritz Crackers, Honey Maid Grahams, and others. Phillip Morris would then merge Nabisco into Kraft Foods, making Kraft Foods into a global super brand within the foods sector, second only to Nestle. (:NSRGY)\n\nJust a few years later in 1988 Phillip Morris would continue growing its food segment through its acquisition of Kraft Foods paying shareholders $106 a share in a deal valued at $13.1 billion. Like with General Foods, the deal would allow Kraft Foods to operate independently of Phillip Morris. Notable Kraft brands at the time of acquisition included: Kraft Singles, Velveeta, Kraft Mayo, Miracle Whip, Capri Sun, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. In 1989 Kraft Foods and General Foods under Phillip Morris would merge and become Kraft General Foods, Inc. In 1995 Kraft General Foods reorganized into a singular operating company and was renamed to Kraft Foods, Inc.\n\nIn 1985 with the goal of diversifying its product portfolio; Phillip Morris Cos, the world's leading tobacco company now known as The Altria Group, (:MO) acquired General Foods agreeing to pay the newly acquired company's stockholders $5.8 billion dollars in cash at $120 per share. Brands under General Foods at the time of acquisition included staples such as: Birds Eye Frosted Foods, Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, Pop-Rocks, Cool Whip, the leading cereal brand; Post, Maxwell House, Kool-Aid, and more. The deal allowed for General Foods to operate as its own company under the Phillip Morris umbrella. Upon the announcement of the acquisition shares of General Foods rose from $6.25 per shares to $117 on the NYSE Chicago Exchange before trading was ultimately closed.\n\nStory Continues\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: Altria Group 2005 Annual Report\n\nKraft Foods between 1989 and 2006 under the watchful eye of its parent company, The Altria Group, was given a free ticket to expansion as the parent aggressively acquired and merged companies into Kraft Foods. This enabled Kraft to grow from being just a simple Cheese and Dairy company to being a major competitor in the snack and grocery sector, with its Snack Segment contributing to most of the growth as seen in Kraft's 2006 Annual Report.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nA Concerning Trend of Divestiture Emerges\n\nThough Kraft contributed to a significant portion of Altria's revenue through its food segment, the 2005 report made it clear that Altria's tobacco segment greatly outperformed it and that's when discussions of a spin-off Kraft Foods began. The spin-off would commence on March of 2007 and was done so that The Altria Group could focus more on their higher performing tobacco segment and thus the newly organized Kraft Foods, Inc was formed and listed on the stock market under ticker symbol: KFT.\n\nAfter Kraft Was spun-off from its parent in 2007 we would start to see cracks form in its foundation during the same year when the company sold it's breakfast cereals division (Post), to Ralcorp, the largest US private label food manufacture, for $2.6 billion. Ralcorp would then face multiple hostile bids from ConAgra (:CAG) to take over the company, Ralcorp repeatedly denied them. Ralcorp in 2011, seeing imminent threat of a ConAgra takeover decided to spinoff their Post cereal unit into separate company: Post Holdings, (:POST) which went on to become publicly traded in 2012. After Post was spun-off ConAgra would acquire Ralcorp for $5 billion making ConAgra, (:CAG) the largest private-label food manufacturer in the North America. As for Post Holdings, (:POST) the company would go on to dramatically increase its operating income, increasing at a consistent pace from losing $0.455b in Q3, 2014 to making $0.875 billion in Q4, 2022. Meanwhile Kraft which would later Merge with HJ Heinz in 2015 to form Kraft Heinz (:KHC) would see an overall drop in Net Income dropping from a peak of $11 billion in Q1, 2018 to a tough of negative $11 billion in Q2, 2019 only for it to marginally recover to around $1.2-$3 billion in the quarters following. However the current trajectory of their incomes seems to curving downwards again with (:POST) curving upwards not to mention Post Has had a much more consistent trend in Net Income versus Kraft Heinz (:KHC) which has been volatile and quite frankly unstable during the same period:\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: MacroTrends.net\n\nDialing back to 2010, Kraft Foods, Inc sold off its frozen pizza division to Nestle for $3.7 billion, the assets of this sale included the frozen pizza brands: DiGiorno, Tombstone, California Pizza Kitchen, and Delissio, therefore selling off its throne of being the leader in frozen pizzas to its bigger competitor, Nestle.\n\nJust a few years after selling off its Post cereal unit and its frozen Pizza unit, Kraft Foods, inc on October 1, 2012 completed a spin-off from Kraft Foods Group, Inc, taking most of the Snack and Nabisco division with it and renamed itself Mondelez International, Inc and trades under the ticker (:MDLZ). The KFT ticker was retired and the Kraft Foods Group began trading under the ticker KRFT. For every 1 share of MDLZ owned, shareholders received 0.33 shares in KRFT in addition receiving to cash to cover any fractional shares of KRFT.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nKraft Foods Group was left with only it's Grocery segment after the spinoff and it can very much be implied that the newly formed Mondelez maintained most of the essence that allowed Kraft Foods to dominate store shelves while the newly formed Kraft Foods Group was just failing shell of its former greatness, this reality seems to have been baked into the companies' market caps as MDLZ, following the spinoff traded from a low of $58.27 billion in 2018 to a high of $105.63 billion in 2023.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: companiesmarketcap.com\n\nMeanwhile following Kraft Food Group's merger with HJ Heinz, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) would lose more than two-thirds of its market cap between May 30, 2017 and March 30, 2020 dropping from $112.27 billion to $30.23 billion with the majority of this decline happening rapidly and well before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic hit the markets in 2020. Since then shares of KHC have attempted a recovery, rising to a peak of $54.21 billion in May of 2022 but it has since gone back on the decline and is on a trajectory to trade at an all-time low market cap, currently sitting at $34.47 billion as of January 2025.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: companiesmarketcap.com\n\nHJ Heinz May Have Overpaid For Kraft Foods Group\n\nIn 2015, HJ Heinz under the ownership of 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, (NYSE:BRK.A) merged with the Kraft Foods Group, creating the newly merged Kraft Heinz Group, (NASDAQ:KHC) the structure of this merger left Kraft shareholders with 49% stake in the new company while 3G Capital and the Warren Buffet owned- Berkshire Hathaway retained a 51% stake in the company. Along with this, Kraft shareholders were paid a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share paid for by the owners of HJ Heinz (3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway.) The merger valued Kraft at $46 billion dollars and likely a merger that the Heinz owners greatly overpaid for given the fact that Kraft Food Group had under gone so much divestiture and spin-offs leading to the deal. It is in my opinion that the owners of Heinz greatly underestimated these factors and were instead fixated on the kind of company Kraft was prior to splitting off from Altria in 2007, rather than taking into account all of the negative aspects that happen with Kraft after the split between 2007 and 2015. HJ Heinz likely would have been much better off merging with snacks focused Mondelez as that was the better performing side of the company, though it is unclear if Mondelez would have accepted such an offer given their independent success. I think that shareholders of Kraft Heinz noticed this dynamic only after the merger which is why we see the rapid declines in KHC begin in 2017 and end with it losing over two-thirds of its value by 2020.\n\nThe Divestiture Continues...\n\nEven as a newly merged company Kraft Heinz continues the trend of selling off Kraft's segments, with the most recent one being in Q1 of 2021 when Kraft Heinz announced the selling of its entire nuts segment to Hormel Foods (:HRL) in a cash transaction for $3.35 billion, the assets included in the sale were most of the products sold under the Planters brand, including single variety and mixed nuts, trail mix, Nut-rition products, Cheez Balls, Cheez curls, and the Corn Nuts branded products. On May 13, 2024 Kraft Heinz then announced that it was exploring the sale of its Oscar Mayer segment, looking for anywhere between $3-$5 billion.\n\nFinancial Metrics\n\nFollowing the merger KHC's Total Assets almost immediately jumped up to a peak of around $121 billion in 2015 but it has since steadily declined now sitting at around $88.57 billion in 2024, representing around a 27% decrease in asset value since the merger.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: MacroTrends.net\n\nWhat's worse is that Kraft Heinz's Cash Balance has been on the decline since 2019 and now remains at the lows just around a billion dollars.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: MacroTrends.net\n\nAbove we can see Kraft Heinz's Cash Balance fall from $5.5 Billion down to $1 billion over a 3 year period; I find this concerning given the fact that KHC's Net Income remains relatively low and starting to fall again. If this trend continues the company may seek to raise cash in other ways either by raising debt, diluting its shareholders, or doing what it always has done in the past and sell off more of its intellectual properties. Lastly to add to the uncertainty, KHC's Debt to EBITDA sits at a ratio of 5.12x putting is almost 3 times above that of the industry median of 2.05x:\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: GuruFocus.com\n\nKHC's Net Debts currently sit at $19.25 billion, that adds up to be more than half of the company's present market cap of $34.4 billion.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThis puts KHC's ratios at the top of the list in terms of indebtedness when compared to its closest peers in the industry:\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: GuruFocus.com\n\nLastly, KHC's PE ratio sits at 25.68x, peaking at 138.03 over the past 10 years ranking it worse than 68.04% of 1386 companies within the same industry.\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: GuruFocus.com\n\nKHC's High Debt's paired with Falling Net Incomes, Sticky Debts, Falling Total Asset Value, and Divesting Tendencies makes me question why investors would want to pay 25.68x earnings for and share of the company especially when its peers like Hormel Foods and General Mills can potentially provide 2-3 times as much value with much less exposure to debt risks.\n\nTechnical Outlook\n\nKraft Heinz Exhibits a Concerning Trend of Divestitures and Contraction\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nKHC has been rejected from the 0.618 Fibonacci Retrace 3 times and has since formed a Bearish Head and Shoulders pattern along with a trend of making slightly lower highs on each rejection following the head, before then finding support around the same low. Upon making a third lower high the price action has broken below the supportive low and looks to be staging a breakdown to the 0.886 level down at around $17.94 which should bring the PE/Ratio down to a fairer valuation of around 15x\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

This represented a 5.65 per cent increase at the Budget last October.\n\nLabour has also vowed to created a \u201csmoke-free generation\u201d by resurrecting legislation put forward by Rishi Sunak to make it illegal for anyone currently under 16 to ever buy cigarettes.\n\nHowever, campaigners are concerned that smoking cessation rates are being slowed by a practice they describe as \u201cunder-shifting\u201d of tax rises, whereby any increase in tobacco duty imposed by the Government is largely absorbed by a company so it can keep prices of cheaper brands low in order to remain attractive to \u201cvalue-conscious\u201d smokers. They allege similar practices are deployed by companies across the tobacco industry.\n\nPMI has said its aim is to see combustible tobacco products replaced by smoke-free technology such as its IQOS heated tobacco devices \u2013 with a goal of making two thirds of its revenues from smoke-free devices by the end of this decade. Jacek Olczak, the company\u2019s CEO, has said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to make smoking history.\u201d\n\nBut critics say its tactics to keep the price of its Chesterfield brand stable are undercutting public health policies aimed at reducing smoking and weakening the use of tobacco taxation as a deterrent from smoking.\n\nConsequently, the attractiveness of cigarettes is being reinforced for price-focused smokers including young adults, according to PMI\u2019s detractors.\n\nPMI said the claims against it were \u201cwrong in numerous ways\u201d and contested the data, stating that it was up to retailers to set the price at which its products were sold.\n\nAlthough the price paid by the consumer is ultimately decided by the retailer, retail sources pointed out that cigarette prices in the UK are largely shaped by the wholesale pricing strategies of tobacco companies and the amount of tobacco duty and VAT charged by government.\n\nIn addition, small shops have reported low profit margins on tobacco for a number of years, which it is understood would limit their ability to absorb tax rises on the products.\n\nTobacco giant Philip Morris International has been accused of placing minimal price rises on its Chesterfield budget brand (Photo: Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images)\n\nFigures produced on behalf of a coalition of health campaigners suggest that the volume of sales of Chesterfield cigarettes grew by 14 per cent in 2022 \u2013 the last year for which PMI published brand-specific sales data. Traditional cigarettes, whose sales are declining in the West, still accounted for 63 per cent of the Connecticut-based company\u2019s revenues in 2023.\n\nDr Anna Gilmore, professor of public health at the University of Bath, told The i Paper that the profit levels of so-called \u201cBig Tobacco\u201d companies means they are effectively \u201cincentivised\u201d to maintain sales of combustible tobacco products.\n\nShe said: \u201cTobacco companies like PMI are so profitable that they can afford to keep some cigarette brands cheap. They do this to lure young people into smoking \u2013 the young are the most price sensitive and high prices are an important barrier to smoking uptake. Low priced cigarettes also help keep existing smokers, who would otherwise quit, hooked on tobacco.\u201d\n\nThe campaigners compared pricing data for UK retailers which showed that in the 12 months from December 2023, prices across four versions of the Chesterfield brand rose by between zero and 3.8 per cent \u2013 an average of 1.01 per cent or 20p per packet of 20 cigarettes.\n\nBy contrast the cost of Marlboro Gold King Size cigarettes rose by \u00a31.68 or 11.1 per cent to \u00a316.78. There were similar rises with other Marlboro products, including 9.8 per cent for Red King Size and 13.1 per cent for Gold Superkings.\n\nAccording to critics of the tobacco industry, the practice of \u201cunder-shifting\u201d is part of a wider problem of cigarettes and other combustible products remaining highly lucrative for their producers.\n\nAccording to evidence presented to MPs by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), an anti-smoking campaign group, tobacco companies are making some \u00a3700m a year of \u201cexcess profits\u201d in the UK by maintaining use of their cheaper brands and recouping profits from more expensive products.\n\nSuccessive governments have increased taxation on cigarettes and related products \u2013 the so-called tobacco escalator \u2013 for at least two decades in a bid to reduce consumption. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, tobacco duties will raise some \u00a38.8bn this year.\n\nCritics claim tobacco companies are in effect shaping their response to changes in taxation rates to maintain earnings. Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of ASH said: \u201cDespite regular increases in tax over the last 20 years, the tobacco industry has consistently found ways to limit their impact with the result that they maximise the number of smokers and their own profits. Despite UK government efforts to address this practice, it remains a problem.\u201d\n\nAmong the ideas being put forward by campaigners are for the Government to take control of the tobacco market by imposing a levy on combustible products which would effectively cap profits and see additional earnings diverted towards smoking cessation and public health.\n\nDr Gilmore said ministers should consider shifting to a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d strategy to ensure smoking diminishes at an accelerated rate. She said: \u201cWe have proposed a polluter pays approach because tobacco companies cause such harm and cost to society, yet remain incentivised to keep causing that harm because of the huge profits they make from cigarettes.\u201d\n\nA PMI spokesperson said: \u201cRetailers are free at all times to set their own prices.\n\n\u201cThe author of this press release fails to understand this fundamental aspect of UK retail law \u2013 and has used a price comparison website as a basis for their \u2018research\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat is indisputable is our unprecedented progress towards a smoke-free future. In PMI\u2019s most recent results, smoke-free products accounted for 38 per cent of our total net revenues (Q3, 2024). In less than a decade, our scientifically-substantiated products have already helped more than 30m adults worldwide to leave smoking behind.\u201d",

However, declining customer counts and usage rates are weighing on the group.\n\nThis article will analyze the prospects of 5 of the largest tobacco stocks that we cover in the Sure Analysis Research Database. Rankings are in order of projected total returns from worst to best.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nYou can instantly jump to any individual stock analysis by clicking on the links below:\n\nBut first, we\u2019ll take a look at the tobacco industry\u2019s primary concern, which is declining tobacco usage.\n\nIndustry Overview: Declining Smoking Rates\n\nThe percent of the U.S. population that smokes is in a continuous decline, and has been for decades.\n\nSource: American Lung Association\n\nThe percent of the U.S. smoking adult population has steadily declined from 42% in 1965, to just 11.6% as of 2021. The declines among the youth population have been even bigger.\n\nYoung people now have a smoking rate of about one in 25. This sort of decline in an industry\u2019s customer group generally spells trouble for the companies that operate within it.\n\nOther forms of tobacco usage have seen similar rates of decline, including smokeless tobacco. This has been the case with every demographic group, so it is widespread among all of the companies\u2019 potential customers.\n\nNot only are fewer people smoking, but the ones that do are smoking less than they used to.\n\nSource: American Lung Association\n\nThe number of people smoking at least 15 cigarettes a day has plummeted in the past few decades. Today, the overwhelming majority of smokers use fewer than 15 cigarettes daily.\n\nIn other words, there are fewer customers for the industry. And, the ones that remain are using fewer products. This has negatively impacted demand from two directions.\n\nThis has led to much lower volumes of total cigarettes sold, producing a declining total to be split up among the various companies selling cigarettes.\n\nAn increasing number of U.S. states have significantly raised the tax on cigarettes to reduce their budget deficits, and to reduce the potential appeal of smoking for consumers.\n\nGiven the propensity of localities to use tax increases on cigarettes, the situation will likely only get worse for tobacco stocks.\n\nIn addition, pricing increases have the impact of reducing usage further. Demand will almost certainly continue to decline as taxes and prices rise. Indeed, health organizations like the American Lung Association actively encourage localities to raise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products to discourage usage.\n\nTo make matters worse for tobacco companies, most of the world\u2019s smoking population rate looks much the same as the above chart. It has become abundantly clear that consumers around the world are eschewing tobacco products for health concerns.\n\nThese negative trends have kept many investors away from tobacco stocks. However, tobacco stocks can still generate solid total returns given that they tend to offer high dividend yields.\n\nThe key behind an investment in tobacco stocks is the inelastic demand for cigarettes relative to their price due to the addictive nature of these products.\n\nTobacco companies have been able to raise their prices to help offset declining smoking rates. As a result, they have exceptional growth records.\n\nIn addition, population growth partly offsets the effect of the declining percent of smokers.\n\nHowever, investors must keep in mind that the total volumes for the industry are in fairly steep decline, and all indications are that this is irreversible.\n\nTobacco Stock #5: Imperial Brands plc (IMBBY)\n\n5-year expected returns: 0.3%\n\nImperial Brands is a tobacco company that was founded in 1901.

            "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US governmental authority responsible for regulating foods and medical products, authorized, on 16 January 2025, the marketing of 20 ZYN nicotine pouch products. The decision is based on extensive scientific review and is the result of a long process, initiated by Swedish Match USA, a company within Philip Morris International (PMI) in March 2020.\n\nThe FDA determined that the specific products receiving marketing authorization met the public health standard legally required by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This standard considers the risks and benefits of products to the population as a whole.\n\nAmong several key considerations, the agency\u2019s evaluation showed that, due to substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes and most smokeless tobacco products, such as moist snuff and snus, the authorized products pose lower risk of serious health conditions than such products. The FDA evaluation report also refers to evidence provided from as part of the authorization process which shows that a substantial proportion of adults who use cigarette and/or other tobacco products completely switched to the newly authorized nicotine pouch products.\n\nZYN thus becomes the first and only nicotine pouch product for oral use authorized in the US. ZYN nicotine pouches, developed by the Swedish company Swedish Match, are part of the PMI portfolio and are intended exclusively for adult users.\n\n\u201cTo receive marketing authorizations, the FDA must have sufficient evidence that the new products offer greater benefits to population health than risks,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly, Ph.D., director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. \u201cIn this case, the data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes and/or smokeless tobacco products and completely switch to these products.\u201d\n\nAs part of its evaluation, the FDA reviewed data regarding youth risk and found that youth use of nicotine pouches remains low despite growing sales in recent years. The FDA will closely monitor the marketing and use of these products. To reduce the potential for youth exposure, the FDA authorizations impose stringent marketing restrictions for the advertising of these products, including measures to ensure ads are carefully targeted to adults ages 21 and older, in the U.S..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that the manufacturer market these products responsibly to prevent youth use,\u201d said Brian King, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. \u201cWhile current data show that youth use remains low, the FDA is closely monitoring the marketplace and is committed to taking action, as appropriate, to best protect public health.\u201d \u201d The FDA recent decision to authorize the marketing of ZYN nicotine pouches in the U.S. is an important confirmation of the strong scientific evidence underlying this product. The decision highlights the fact that ZYN nicotine pouches contain significantly lower amounts of harmful constituents compared to cigarettes. This is why the decision This decision represents a crucial step towards protecting public health by diversifying better alternatives to cigarettes and other tobacco products for adult smokers\u201d, said Mihai Bundoi, Head of Scientific & Medical Affairs, Philip Morris Romania.\n\nThis content was made with the support of Philip Morris Romania",

            "content": "Philip Morris has undertaken a \u201cvirtuous\u201d transformation to turn its back on cigarettes and has spent $12.5bn on research and development for this \u201csoft ending\u201d to cigarettes. Already in 2023, non-smoking tobacco products accounted for more than 36% of the revenues of the global giant, which also has a 72.8% share of the US market for nicotine sachets. On 16 January, as if in victory, the US Food and Drug Administration authorised the marketing of 20 products from its Zyn range, with doses of between 3 and 6 milligrams of nicotine per sachet.\n\nBut with this dosage, Philip Morris sachets would be de facto excluded from the Luxembourg market, according to the limit set in the bill currently making its way through the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time: in October 2023, before leaving her ministry, then-health minister (LSAP) tabled a bill on new tobacco products, which was amended in May 2024 by her successor, (CSV). Among the amendments was a proposal to regulate nicotine sachets, with the maximum nicotine concentration set at 0.048mg, as in Germany. And the German figure did not come out of the blue: it is based on the recommendations of the European Food Safety Agency, which sets the maximum level of nicotine that can be ingested per day at 0.0008mg/kg of body mass, or 0.048mg for a person weighing 60kg.\n\nA \u201chypocritical\u201d approach\n\nThe figure had met with the assent of MPs in committee before some, such as former health minister and MP (LSAP), revised their copy and questioned it. \u201cThe speaker considers the approach adopted by the government to be hypocritical insofar as limiting the nicotine content to 0.048 milligrams per nicotine sachet amounts to a de facto ban. Given that the sale of nicotine sachets is banned in Belgium and that France also intends to go down this route, the speaker believes that the government intends to create a new tax niche in order to be able to levy excise duties at the expense of our neighbouring countries. He pointed out that the ministry of finance had introduced excise duty on nicotine sachets even before the ministry of health and social security had submitted the government\u2019s amendments to regulate these products,\u201d the minutes of the meeting state.\n\nOr like (ADR), who proposed raising the rate to 20mg as in other countries, the equivalent of a cigarette without the harmful products and negative effects of smoke.\n\n\u201cWe are in favour of thoughtful and inclusive regulation,\u201d defended Philip Morris senior communications manager Ellen Bodens, who pointed out that there are few alternatives to smoking for those who want to give up. They may feel excluded because they cannot smoke in public places (and in some countries, even outside), and this does not help them to change their behaviour.\n\nBlack market stands to gain\n\n\u201cWithout an inclusive approach, everyone will lose,\u201d says the lobbyist, who is targeting 16.6mg. \u201cConsumers will miss out on an opportunity to reduce the impact of tobacco on their health. And since the need is there, demand will shift to the black market, with all that that means.\u201d is much more nuanced than that on the health risks.\n\nOn the financial side, (d\u00e9i Greng), G\u00e9rard Schockmel (DP) and Di Bartolomeo had previously insisted to the health committee of the Chamber of Deputies that the rate of excise duty should be dissuasive. In response, the health and social security minister Deprez pointed out that the specific rate of excise duty on nicotine sachets is \u20ac22 per 1,000 grams and that the VAT rate is 17%. This is 30% more than the excise duty on heating tobacco.\n\n\u201cThe Council of Government quickly agreed to go down the regulatory route rather than ban nicotine sachets, given that these products are sold over the counter in neighbouring regions and are therefore accessible to Luxembourg consumers,\u201d the minister\u2019s representative said in response to MPs, going on to point out that there are plans to ban the sale of nicotine sachets and their distribution free of charge to minors under the age of 18, as well as the consumption of nicotine sachets in educational establishments, in premises intended to receive or accommodate minors under the age of 16, and in playgrounds and sports areas where minors under the age of 16 are exercising a sporting activity.\n\nThis position has remained unchanged since the end of November, when the Council of State issued its second opinion.\n\nNo tastes like those favoured by young Americans\n\nPhilip Morris, which \u201cpositions itself as a leader in the fight against smoking\u201d--according to its three-page argument--is proposing to raise the reasonable nicotine ceiling to 16.6mg per sachet, to ban sachets with a taste reminiscent of sweets, desserts or sugary drinks (in order to reduce their appeal to young people), to increase the costs associated with notification to support regulatory controls at points of sale, including mystery visits, and to introduce child-resistant packaging to prevent accidental access.\n\nIn the same way that they were welcomed by a representative of the health minister, as part of a delegation of three industrialists, the Philip Morris representatives were also received by the health committee, an exchange deemed more constructive. But it\u2019s at the end of the dance that you pay the piper, and this end is approaching without the government having given in, whilst tobacco firm Heintz van Landewyck is already marketing its products, taking advantage of the fact that its products do not fall within the scope of the legislation currently in force.\n\nThis article was originally published in .",

In an academy organised in partnership between FIM Speedway global promoter Warner Bros. Discovery Sports, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme and Motorcycling Australia, six-time FIM Speedway world champion Rickardsson, Speedway GP star Fricke, FIM Track Racing Commission (CCP) director Castagna and FIM race director Morris coached 23 riders from Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. Australia\u2019s most successful speedway rider, triple Speedway GP world champion Jason Crump, also appeared as a VIP guest on the final day. Riders were given priceless tips on riding technique, starts and bike setup, as well as advice on making it into Europe\u2019s professional leagues. They also picked up vital information on health and fitness, anti-doping regulations and working with the media, social media and sponsors.\n\nThe 20 young guns from across Australia included the likes of SON2 bronze medallist James Pearson, 2024 SGP3 finalist Jordy Loftus and his sister, Anika Loftus, who was third in the inaugural FIM Women\u2019s Speedway Gold Trophy in Teterow, Germany last June. The Queenslander was one of two female participants along with Adelaide\u2019s Ruby Chapman. Two-time SGP4 silver medallist Cooper Antone, who attended the 2024 FIM SGP Academy in Prague, was on track in Gillman, along with Kobi Canning, who took fourth place at the first-ever SGP4 event in Malilla in 2023. New Zealand was represented by Julian Rees and Kadin Cracknell, with Britain\u2019s Senna Summers, son of Adelaide-born rider Aaron Summers, also taking part as he prepares for his second WSRA National Development League season with Oxford Chargers this year.\n\nFIM SGP Academy - Down Under coaches (from left) Armando Castagna, Phil Morris, Max Fricke and Tony Rickardsson.

I loved seeing how much better everyone became from when they started off on the first day to where they are now. \u201cEverything improved \u2013 their speed around the track, their starting techniques and I hope everyone is as happy as I am because this was a fantastic event. \u201cIt was a great opportunity for me to work with the young riders, and I hope they have learned about everything from riding techniques and bike setups to working with sponsors and the media. Well done to everyone who took part!\u201d\n\nTony Rickardsson passes on some pearls of wisdom.

He said: \u201cIt was great to see everybody at Gillman last week. I know everybody travelled a long way to be part of this event. We had everyone out on track and getting a few laps in. It was very successful on and off the track. \u201cEveryone showed some great improvement \u2013 getting better and working on lots of different things like technique, speed and starts. They have also been working to improve themselves behind the scenes as well. It has been a great event. Hopefully everybody learned loads.\u201d\n\nA few words of advice from Max Fricke. PHOTO: \u00a9 RbMotoLens - Rob Mott / WBD Sports / MA\n\nThe FIM SGP Academy \u2013 Down Under is the first of three academies taking place in 2025, with Swedish venue Malilla hosting another in early July and a third event taking place as part of FIM Speedway of Nations week in Polish city Torun, which runs from September 30 until October 4. Castagna hopes to see more academy events take place in Australia.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am extremely happy that the FIM SGP Academy \u2013 Down Under went very well, and I am sure all 23 kids who were there learned a lot during these three days. \u201cOn behalf of the FIM, I would say it was a job well done, and I really hope we can continue offering something like this for many years to come.\u201d\n\nArmando Castagna Phil Morris\n\nMorris hopes riders\u2019 participation at Gillman helps them on their path to forging a professional career in the sport.\n\nHe said: \u201cI would like to thank everyone who took part over the three days. There were a lot of familiar faces and some new ones as well. \u201cWe wanted to give the riders the best experience we could. I hope everyone took something away from it and it can help them in their careers. \u201cPart of our aim was also to give riders some information about making it into the professional leagues in Europe. We hope we have inspired them to pursue a career in the sport and that we will see as many of them as possible in FIM Speedway events and the European leagues in the years to come.\u201d\n\nThe FIM SGP Academy - Down Under stars in action. PHOTO: \u00a9 RbMotoLens - Rob Mott / WBD Sports / MA\n\nMotorcycling Australia CEO Peter Doyle commented: \u201cIt has been a real pleasure to stage the FIM SGP Academy \u2013 Down Under in partnership with the FIM and WBD Sports and bring together riders from all over Australia and beyond to learn from an outstanding coaching team. \u201cI thank everyone both in Australia and Europe, who contributed towards making last week\u2019s event at Gillman a real success. \u201cWe are delighted to have four Australian representatives in the Speedway GP series in Jason Doyle, Jack Holder, Brady Kurtz and Max Fricke this year, and we hope the FIM SGP Academy \u2013 Down Under will equip many more young riders with the skills to follow in their tyre treads in the years to come.\u201d\n\nWatching the track action closely. PHOTO: \u00a9 RbMotoLens - Rob Mott / WBD Sports / MA\n\nLaura Manciet, FIM Speedway World Championships director, commented: \u201cOn behalf of WBD Sports, I would like to say a huge thank you to our coaches Tony, Max, Armando and Phil, as well as the FIM and Motorcycling Australia for their fantastic work in delivering the FIM SGP Academy \u2013 Down Under alongside us. \u201cAs global promoter for the FIM Speedway World Championships, we are keen to put speedway in a global spotlight and develop the sport at every level \u2013 from its grassroots all the way up to elite level and Speedway GP. \u201cA strong pyramid structure starts with the FIM SGP Academies. We look forward to continuing the FIM SGP Academy programme in Malilla and Torun later this year and helping more young riders to learn the skills needed \u2013 on and off the bike \u2013 to excel in our sport.\u201d",

On that day, she issued a final judgment and 1,682-page opinion that found the companies had been covering up the health risks associated with smoking and marketing their products to children for decades.\n\nTobacco companies were ordered in Judge Kessler's 2006 decision to issue the \"corrective statements\" in newspapers and on TV. After years of appeal and delay by the defendants, the ads ran in 2017 and 2018. Subsequent court decisions in 2018 also required \"corrective statements\" on tobacco company websites and on cigarettes packs.\n\nThen in December 2022, a court order was issued requiring corrective statements to be posted at around 200,000 retail outlets across the country. These signs were required to be posted starting October 1, 2023 and are required to be up until June 30, 2025. The public can assist with ensuring retail stores are displaying these signs at www.tobaccosigntipline.com or via the Lung Association.\n\nHere are 10 of the most troubling findings of fact the judge found in her ruling against these tobacco companies:\n\n10. The tobacco companies \"concealed and suppressed research data and other evidence that nicotine is addictive.\"\n\n9. The tobacco companies \"falsely marketed and promoted low tar/light cigarettes as less harmful than full-flavor cigarettes in order to keep people smoking and sustain corporate revenues.\"\n\n8. The tobacco companies own internal records showed \"that smokers switch to low tar/light cigarettes, rather than quit smoking because they believe they are less harmful.\"\n\n7. The tobacco companies \"recognized that smokers choose light/low tar cigarettes for a perceived health benefit defendants internally recognized that smokers rely on the claims made for low tar/light cigarettes as an excuse/ rationale for not quitting smoking.\"\n\n6. Starting in the 1950s and lasting at least through 2006, different tobacco companies \"at different times and using different methods, have intentionally marketed to young people under the age of twenty-one in order to recruit 'replacement smokers' to ensure the economic future of the tobacco industry.\"\n\n5. The tobacco companies \"youth smoking prevention programs are not designed to effectively prevent youth smoking.\"\n\n4. The tobacco companies \"have publicly denied what they internally acknowledged: that ETS [secondhand smoke] is hazardous to nonsmokers.\"\n\n3. The tobacco companies' internal records \"recognized that ETS [secondhand smoke] is hazardous to nonsmokers.\"\n\n2. The tobacco companies' \"marketing is a substantial contributing factor to youth smoking initiation.\"\n\n1. \"[This case] is about an industry, and in particular these [tobacco companies], that survives, and profits, from selling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a staggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human suffering and economic loss, and a profound burden on our national health care system. [The tobacco companies] have known many of these facts for at least 50 years or more. Despite that knowledge, they have consistently, repeatedly and with enormous skill and sophistication, denied these facts to the public, the Government, and to the public health community.\"",

            "content": "The Philip Morris International factory in Klaipeda, Lithuania, has become an integral part of the seaport city\u2019s history. It stands out as one of the first foreign investments in the region\u2014most notably, the first American investment and among the earliest U.S. investments in the country. \u201cWhen Philip Morris International (PMI) invested in Lithuania more than 30 years ago, we had just regained our independence and were striving for global integration and economic growth. The company saw potential in the port city with an existing tobacco factory,\u201d Mindaugas Dacys, General Director at Philip Morris Baltic, told The Baltic Times Magazine\n\nWhen buying this factory in 1993, he says, PMI envisioned investing in the greenfield. Thus, in 1997 the company opened larger state-of-the-art facilities on the city outskirts, one of the region\u2019s first greenfield investments. \u201cWith new facilities, good and safe working conditions for the employees were ensured,\u201d M. Dacys said.\n\nIn 2002, PMI transferred the old Klaipeda Tobacco Factory landmark building to the city for a symbolic 1 litas. Now called the Klaipeda Culture Factory, it is being preserved and serves for the city\u2019s social and cultural activities.\n\nHow has the factory evolved over the years? How has the geographic distribution of your end clients shifted over time?\n\nSince PMI came to Lithuania, we invested over 400 million euros into production, processes, product quality and employee development. After product quality and packaging improvements, it started producing for other markets: in 2005 \u2013 for duty-free shops abroad, and in 2011 \u2013 for the Japanese market.\n\nToday 98 percent of the factory\u2019s production is exported to 33 markets and accounts for a significant share of the region\u2019s exports and the Klaipeda seaport\u2019s load. According to the economic overview by the Lithuanian Innovation Agency, in 2022 tobacco products accounted for 17.5 percent of Klaipeda County\u2019s exports.\n\nOver the years, production volume increased, and the factory in Klaipeda now ranks high among PMI factories worldwide \u2013 it is the second-largest PMI production facility in the EU and fourth globally. Over our history, production has increased more than 10-fold.\n\nAccording to the latest local study, in 30 years the return on investment was 13 euros for each 1 euro invested. Also, PMI companies here paid over 4 billion euros of taxes during those 30 years.\n\nI assume your Klaipeda factory is now carbon-neutral. What are your next steps in aligning with the European Green Deal, and what new sustainability goals are emerging for your operations?\n\nSustainability has always been a core priority for us, and even before the European Green Deal became a central focus, we were already committed to environmental responsibility.\n\nSince 2015, we have been working to reduce our environmental impact by investing in renewable energy sources and innovating our operations. In 2019, we achieved a significant milestone when Klaipeda factory became the first PMI facility globally certified as carbon neutral.\n\nThe factory also follows a strict \"zero waste to landfill!\" rule: all waste is sorted so it can either be recycled and turned into new products or incinerated so the extracted energy can be used as heating for the city. factory continues to implement various initiatives related to reducing Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the supply chain.\n\nThese efforts contribute to PMI\u2019s global sustainability goals and are essential because achieving carbon neutrality in our direct operations by 2025 and across our entire value chain, including indirect emissions by 2040, are key objectives for PMI. As we progress, we will continue to innovate and collaborate with our suppliers to reduce emissions and ensure we meet our ambitious sustainability targets.\n\nPhilip Morris is widely recognized as a caring, equitable, and diversity-conscious employer. Please speak about that.\n\nBeing among the first international investors, we also brought the working culture and standards of the advanced Western and an exceptional approach to the employees that had not been seen here before. Many of these are common to more businesses now, but we aim to do more, as it is crucial to the company\u2019s growth and growth of people, our business environment and Klaipeda.\n\nWe care about the culture of equality, diversity and inclusion that encourages innovation and creativity, helps to reveal our talents and thus helps us to achieve common goals. For example, in the Baltic States, women already account for 60 percent of management positions in companies \u2013 significantly higher than the EU average of 35 percent\n\nWe provide opportunities for development and career advancement. We encourage talent growth inside the organization and are proud of our talents, who now work in very responsible positions worldwide.\n\nYour ambition is to become substantially smoke-free by 2030, with your smoke-free business generating over two-thirds of total net revenues. Are you on the path to achieving it without any adjustments?\n\nThis year, we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of introducing our leading smoke-free product. Launching this innovation was a breakthrough toward our commitment to a future without cigarettes.\n\nResults also illustrate our aspiration to transform. As of June 30, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and we estimate that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. They accounted for 38% of the company\u2019s net revenues in Q3 2024, up from practically zero in 2014.\n\nTo date, we have invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products. These products are a better alternative for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. Also, different health organizations in the US, UK and other countries have publicly stated that smoke-free products are less harmful than cigarettes and that switching to them can contribute to improving public health.\n\nHow are all Philip Morris International factories doing amid the shift from the traditional cigarette to a smoke-free future? Does your Klaipeda factory stand out in a way?\n\nPMI is amid transforming its business and is massively investing in phasing out cigarettes in favor of scientifically substantiated reduced-risk smoke-free products for adult smokers who don\u2019t quit. Today, seven out of eleven countries where PMI manufactures its\u2019 smoke-free products are in Europe. Greece, Italy, and Romania alone account for almost 75 percent of PMI's heated tobacco products.\n\nThe factory in Klaipeda is one of the few throughout the EU that still produces only cigarettes. It is one of the company\u2019s most important in terms of cigarette production capacity \u2013 the third-largest facility in the EU and one of TOP5 worldwide. In most countries, such factories have already been converted to partial or full production of heated tobacco products.\n\nAs we make progress towards a smoke-free future we will continue to consider our global footprint and ensure we have enough capacity to provide those who switch to smoke-free alternatives with the product of their choice. Like other important PMI factories, Klaipeda is a key part of this assessment.\n\nWhat are you expecting from 2025?\n\nStability and predictability are essential for business and dialogue regarding the potential of the change in the tobacco market. Also, the market faces the dynamics of the illicit market and taxation policies that impact the smoke-free shift. Thus, the regulatory decisions and the state\u2019s position regarding smoke-free products play an important role in the shift of society to leave cigarettes behind.\n\nWe strongly believe that each year could bring us closer to a smoke-free future. It was successfully done in Sweden, where cigarette consumption recently fell below 5 percent, compared to 29 percent in Lithuania, 33 percent in Latvia and 25 percent in Estonia. This could be achieved if not only business but also the state and EU institutions would encourage change.\n\nWe will continue to take care of our employees\u2019 well-being, ensure sustainability in all our activities, and seek a smoke-free future globally.\n\nWhat will Philip Morris International look like in, say, 20 years from now?\n\nIt is my strong belief and motivation that in 20 years we as a society could phase out cigarettes. A smoke-free future is attainable, and the benefits it can bring both to the people who would otherwise continue to smoke and global public health are enormous. With the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society, cigarette sales can end within 10-15 years in many countries.\n\nWe hope to remain part of Klaipeda\u2019s business landscape, continuing to implement higher standards in production quality, employment, sustainability and business conduct.",

The time is now -- not later -- to build a robust portfolio that will hold up through all market environments.\n\nWhat stock should an investor buy for diversification? My bet is Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%). The global nicotine giant has a dividend yield above 4%, a clean balance sheet, and new segments that should help the company grow earnings per share (EPS) at a double-digit rate for years to come. Here's why the stock is a great buy as the company tackles the transition from cigarettes and wins the market for new nicotine-cessation products.\n\nPhilip Morris: A one-time opportunity to switch from cigarettes\n\nPhilip Morris International owns many cigarette brands, including Marlboro, Chesterfield, and Parliment, and sells them in virtually every country except China and the United States (Altria Group has the right to sell these brands in the US). With exposure to more stable cigarette smoking markets, Philip Morris International is one of the few tobacco companies facing drastic volume declines for its legacy products. In fact, its cigarette volumes grew 1.3% year over year last quarter.\n\nCompared to its American brethren, Altria Group, which had an 8.6% cigarette volume decline last quarter, Philip Morris International's legacy tobacco profits should be durable and likely grow in the years to come due to price increases on packs of cigarettes. However, the company is not sitting tight.\n\nManagement has spent billions of dollars and made a large acquisition to tackle the new-age nicotine market, which is taking the category by storm. It has the leading heat-not-burn device, IQOS, and owns Zyn, the dominant nicotine pouch brand in the United States.\n\nThese new products are not only less harmful than traditional cigarettes from a health perspective but also have a huge growth runway ahead of them. Last quarter, Philip Morris International's smoke-free revenue grew 16.8% year over year on the back of volume growth from IQOS and Zyn. Smoke-free categories now account for 38% of the company's overall revenue and will become a growing piece of the pie for years to come.\n\nUnlocking nicotine pouch supply to accelerate growth\n\nPhilip Morris International's revenue grew 11% year over year last quarter. What makes this number look even better is the supply shortage of its popular Zyn nicotine pouches. With seemingly insatiable customer demand, Philip Morris has been unable to match supply with demand in the United States. Zyn volumes still grew aggressively last quarter, but its market share fell from 75% to 65% due to the product being out of stock at retailers.\n\nOnce the Zyn shortage ends -- which management expects will occur shortly -- this should lead to an acceleration of Zyn's volume growth and Philip Morris International's topline revenue growth. The combination of Zyn and IQOS volume growth has me confident that this company can grow revenue and earnings at a double-digit rate for many years into the future.\n\nSteady dividend growth and wealth appreciation\n\nPhilip Morris stock has a dividend that currently yields around 4.2%. The company is funding these dividend payouts with profits from legacy cigarettes and growing earnings from Zyn and IQOS. Its dividend per share is currently $5.25, which is sustainably funded with its $6.46 in free cash flow per share.\n\nOver the coming years, I expect the company's free cash flow per share to keep climbing higher due to the abovementioned growth factors. When this happens, the company will have more and more room to raise its dividend per share, which will increase the income you earn from the investment each year.\n\nWith a starting dividend yield of 4.2% and a dominant position in nicotine pouches and heat-not-burn devices, I think Philip Morris International is a rock-solid pick during this one-time transition from cigarettes to safer nicotine products. Buy this stock for your portfolio and never sell.",

            "content": "On the 20th of June I published the first of two articles on attractive income shares and ETFs for investors. One article focused on opportunities for high growth and one on high yields. I\u2019m a proponent of investors creating a portfolio with a mix of both because it is more likely to align with the goal of generating passive income in the first place.\n\nMany non-retired income investors would benefit from a focus on the future income streams that can be generated. Growing income faster than inflation is the pathway to financial independence as the purchasing power of a portfolio increases over time. Retirees also need to focus on growth. Retirement may last decades and growth is needed to sustain - and ideally increase \u2013 living standards.\n\nThe two articles were a response to the bleak picture I painted in a previous article at the state of traditional income plays in our local market. And things continue to look bleak. According to Janus Henderson the ASX continues to see dividends drop while other markets have seen dividend growth. The following chart shows the percentage change in overall dividend payments in Australia, the US and globally by year.\n\nPointing out problems is one thing. I wanted to offer a solution. That was the spirit behind my original articles and progress checks on how my suggestions are faring. I published the first update a quarter after my original article and this update comes roughly six months after making the picks. I am very much a long-term income investor and not much time has passed but the results so far have been strong.\n\nMy original premise\n\nI had two long-term goals for the shares and ETFs I included on my list. For the more growth orientated bucket I wanted to achieve average income growth of 10% per year. For the higher yielding shares I was targeted average income growth of 8% annually.\n\nIn both cases this income growth comes from a combination of dividend reinvestment and dividend growth. In providing this update I used the following assumptions to calculate the results:\n\nEqual weighted portfolio: I assumed that each of the 13 picks received an equal allocation of $10,000. For the US holdings I used the exchange rate on the 20th of June which makes a $10,000 local investment into $6,654 US. I am going to assume no rebalancing so the equal weighted portfolio is only a day one exercise and the weights will fluctuate over time. Dividend reinvestment: I am assuming that dividends are reinvested at the closing price on the day of the dividend payment. This may vary slightly from how a broker processes any automatic reinvestments or how an investor might manually reinvest dividends. In all but the most extreme situations the price will not vary significantly under these scenarios from my approach. Income on 20th of June: This represents the dividends and distributions in the preceding 12 months on the 20th of June multiplied by the number of shares held on the 20th of June. Income on the 21s of January: This represents the dividends in the proceeding 12 months on the 21st of January multiplied by the number of shares held on the 21st of January.\n\nIn the following chart you can see the results of this exercise.\n\nHow are things going?\n\nThings are going well. Although I must again point out this is an extremely short time-period. An increase in total income of 6.70% in constant currency terms after six months is a strong start. Accounting for the weakening Aussie dollar since June 20th income is up 9.72% in local currency terms.\n\nCurrency matters and there will always be fluctuations. However, since this is a long-term portfolio I\u2019m more interested in what is happening in constant currency terms. I included companies that I thought would grow their dividends. The constant currency view answers this question.\n\nWe can break the performance of individual holdings into three categories:\n\nIncome levels fell: Aurizon and American Tower showed a drop in income. In both cases there has been a slight drop in dividends that have offset increases in the share count from dividend reinvestment. I'm not worried about either holdings as dividend increases are expected in 2025.\n\nAurizon and American Tower showed a drop in income. In both cases there has been a slight drop in dividends that have offset increases in the share count from dividend reinvestment. I'm not worried about either holdings as dividend increases are expected in 2025. Income levels increased: The remaining 10 picks had increases in income. This is good news. In some cases the increasee in income has been substantial which shows the power of compounding when dividend reinvestment is combined with increases in dividends.\n\nMy thesis for each of the picks hasn\u2019t changed so please revisit the original articles to understand my thinking. If there are major develops with any of the picks I will provide updates on my view of the holding in the quarterly review. But so far, so good.\n\nOn the surface this is a great start. If the 6.70% increase in income is extrapolated over a year it more than exceeds my target. However, it is important to remember the timing and frequency of when dividends are declared and when they are paid. Especially for the companies and ETF that declare and pay dividends bi-annually which include MVW, SOL, DEO, AZJ, CSL, TCL and CEN. This makes any extrapolation impossible. Regardless, I\u2019m pleased with the start.\n\nHow did the portfolio perform?\n\nI\u2019m an income investor. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want my portfolio to increase in value. I don\u2019t think those goals are mutually exclusive. In fact I believe that shares with growing dividends will outperform the market which I expailned in my article why I\u2019m an income investor. To grow dividends means growing earnings. Something the market tends to reward over the long-term.\n\nThe following chart shows the performance of each share in the portfolio. In Aussie dollar terms the return since the 20th of June was 14.82%. This was just about even with the performance of the ASX 200 but significantly trailed the Aussie dollar return of the S&P 500. Do I care? Not really. The time frame is way too short to draw any sort of conclusion.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nTo solve any problem requires a focus on the actual problem. Too many investors decide they want income and go out and buy the highest yielding shares. I\u2019m focused on generating passive investor because I want to become financially independent. My hope for this portfolio is that over time I can demonstrate the power of income growth. And I do really hope it demonstrates that since I own every one of the picks other than Washington Soul Patterson.\n\nIf you have any questions please email me at [email protected]",

            "content": "A Canadian cannabis company, Avicanna, recently entered into a research project with an international healthcare and wellness product company, Vectura Fertin Pharma, focusing on cannabinoid-based products.\n\nThe agreement between the two companies will create a joint Scientific and Medical Affairs Committee focused on improving understanding of medical cannabis access and applications in Canada.\n\nVectura Fertin Pharma was formed in March 2022 following Philip Morris International\u2019s (PMI) acquisition of Fertin Pharma, Vectura Group PLC, and OtiTopic. Vectura\u2019s website states that it operates as a separate company under PMI\u2019s ownership.\n\nAvicanna is focused on cannabinoid-based products and operates the medical cannabis care platform MyMedi.ca, the Medical Cannabis brand RHO Phyto, as well as focusing on R&D and clinical development.\n\nThe company also acquired Medical Cannabis from Shoppers Drug Mart in 2023, which it transitioned to the MyMedi platform.\n\nIn their most recent quarterly report, North American net revenue for Avicanna for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $17.5 million, compared to $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase over the nine months was a direct result of the acquisition of Medical Cannabis by Shoppers and the introduction of MyMedi.\n\nThis is not the first entry of a tobacco company into the Canadian cannabis market or the first for Philip Morris, even if indirectly. In 2016, the company invested US$20 million in the Israeli company Syqe Medical. Syqe created an inhaler for use with cannabis for medical purposes.\n\nIn 2019, Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, paid C$2.4 billion for a 45% ownership interest in Cronos Group, the Canadian cannabis company behind brands like Spinach and Peace Natural. Altria later declined options to purchase additional shares.\n\nIt\u2019s not only American tobacco companies connected to the Canadian cannabis industry. In 2019, Imperial Brands, a British multinational tobacco company, invested C$123 million in Canada\u2019s Auxly Cannabis Group. That deal also included a research and development partnership similar to other deals.\n\nIn 2021, Organigram Holdings Inc. announced a C$221 million strategic investment from a wholly-owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco (BAT). The deal has continued to evolve over the years. A third round of funding is expected in early 2025.\n\nIn 2023, Organigram said most of a $124.6 million investment from BAT would be used to create a strategic investment pool named Jupiter, focusing on emerging cannabis opportunities, including geographic expansion.\n\nIn 2024, Organigram announced a $21 million investment from its Jupiter strategic investment pool, which gave it a minority stake in German cannabis company Sanity Group GmbH and gave it a foothold in the German market.\n\nIn the same year, Organigram also announced a USD$2 million minority investment in Steady State LLC (dba Open Book Extracts or OBX) from the Jupiter fund. Based in North Carolina, OBX specializes in cannabinoid ingredient production and serves as a one-stop formulation and finished goods manufacturer.\n\nRelated Articles",

The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands.

            "content": "While technology stocks get a lot of attention from the media, there are a lot of attractive options in the consumer goods space as well. Here are four stocks in that sector that I'd buy without any hesitation.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhile often classified as a consumer goods stock, Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) is really a combination of a consumer goods company and a technology company. It operates the largest e-commerce and logistics company in the world, where it sells both its own goods and those of third parties. This continues to be a steadily growing business, with its North American sales rising 9% last quarter and international sales up 12%.\n\nOperating income for its retail businesses has been growing even more quickly, as the company has been using artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve efficiency both within its warehouses and on its delivery routes. It has also continued to see strong growth in higher-margin sponsored ads, off an already pretty large base.\n\nIts largest business by profitability, though, is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business. It's growing quickly, with revenue up 19% last quarter, as the company provides foundation models for AI and helps customers build out their own AI models and applications through its BedRock and SageMaker solutions. It is currently the largest cloud infrastructure company in the world, holding a 31% share of that market.\n\nAmazon has a long history of innovation and investing to win, and this ethos should help it continue to be a long-term winner.\n\nPhilip Morris International\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM 0.92%) is something rare -- a growth stock in a defensive industry. Though it has no U.S. exposure when it comes to traditional cigarettes, this part of the company's business is still growing through a combination of price increases and modest volume growth. However, Philip Morris' big growth driver has been its smokeless portfolio.\n\nThe company has seen huge growth from Zyn, a nicotine pouch made with nicotine powder and flavoring instead of tobacco. Last quarter, sales for the product continued to surge, with volumes jumping nearly 44%. Meanwhile, its also seeing solid sales growth for its heated tobacco Iqos system, with volumes rising nearly 9% last quarter. Philip Morris bought back the Iqos license for the U.S. from Altria, and could look to introduce the product on a wider scale here next year. It is currently looking to get the latest version of the product approved by the FDA, while testing an older version in a few select U.S. cities.\n\nOne big positive for Philip Morris is that both Zyn and Iqos have considerably better unit economics than traditional cigarettes. Management has said that in the U.S., Zyn's product contribution level is 6 times greater than cigarettes, while the product contribution level for Iqos is least 2 times better.\n\nWith strong volumes and better unit economics for its smokeless products, Philip Morris is in a strong position.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty\n\nWhile its stock had a down year in 2024, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF 8.27%) has been a huge winner the past five years -- the stock is up more than 650% over that stretch as of this writing. The company has taken tremendous market share in the mass cosmetics space in the U.S. the past few years. That could be seen in its 40% year-over-year revenue growth last quarter.\n\nE.l.f. has a strong following among younger consumers. It has successfully used a fast-follower product strategy of replicating popular prestige brand items at much cheaper prices while using social media influencers to market its products. This has led to store shelf gains and better product placements, all of which have fed into its gains.\n\nMeanwhile, the company still has large opportunities in the skincare category, where is has a smaller presence, and in international markets. Thus far, its moves in these areas have been successful.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27.7 times based on estimates for its fiscal 2026 (which ends March 2026) and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 0.52, e.l.f is a cheap growth stock.\n\nJAKKS Pacific\n\nJAKKS Pacific (JAKK 0.61%) made a big upgrade in its executive suite a few years ago when it hired John L. Kimble as CFO following his stints at Walt Disney and Mattel. Meanwhile, over the past five years, the stock is up about 165% as of this writing.\n\nKimble has helped turn the toy company around and laid the groundwork for further solid performances. Nonetheless, the stock is one of the cheapest around, trading at a forward P/E of 6.5 and a PEG of under 0.3. Notably, it's also debt free.\n\nA weak slate of kids movies hurt the stock in early 2024, but it could see a nice boost now that Moana 2 and Sonic 3 have landed at the box office. Both franchises have helped JAKKS toy sales in the past, and both had very strong showings in theaters. Sonic 3 was the best performing movie of the franchise, while Moana 2 has grossed over $1 billion globally.\n\nJAKKS has also been focused on making its non-licensed business bigger, with a focus on evergreen content. It also previously signed a deal with Authentic Brands, owner of Roxy, Juicy Couture, Quiksilver, and other brands, to make items such as beach accessories, skateboards, roller skates and other items that it began to roll out in the fall of 2024.\n\nWith an improved box office slate, the Authentic Brands deals, and a cheap stock price, JAKKS Pacific in an under-the-radar stock to consider buying.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Federal health officials last Thursday backed the public health benefits of nicotine pouches, authorizing Philip Morris International\u2019s Zyn to help adult smokers cut back or quit cigarettes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration OK\u2019d 10 Zyn flavors, including coffee, mint and menthol. It is the first time regulators have authorized sales of nicotine pouches, which are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. tobacco market.\n\nThe pouches have been available for more than a decade as the FDA reviewed company data intended to show the products can serve as an alternative to cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products. The decision doesn\u2019t mean Zyn is safe, just less harmful than older alternatives.\n\nTo remain on the market, companies generally must show that their products will reduce disease among adult tobacco users without attracting teens and adolescents.\n\nFDA officials said Thursday that Zyn contains fewer harmful ingredients than cigarettes and various types of chewing tobacco, including snuff, which are linked to cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Company data also showed \u201ca substantial portion of adults\u201d who previously smoked switched completely to Zyn, regulators said. The pouches are sold in two different strengths.\n\n\u201cThe data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA has previously granted similar authorization to several brands of e-cigarettes, a tobacco-heating device, and snus, a type of pasteurized tobacco that is popular in Scandinavian counties. Unlike snus, Zyn and other nicotine pouches don\u2019t contain tobacco, only nicotine and flavoring.\n\nFor decades, tobacco companies have tried to develop alternative products to replace dwindling sales of cigarettes as smoking levels in the U.S. and worldwide continue to fall. E-cigarettes became popular more than a decade ago but faced a backlash after they triggered a multiyear spike in underage vaping.\n\nIn recent months, antismoking groups have warned that nicotine pouches could follow a similar path, pointing to videos of young people popping Zyn and other pouches that have racked up millions of views on social media platforms. Following Thursday\u2019s announcement, advocates quickly criticized the FDA for permitting sales of flavors like citrus, peppermint and wintergreen.\n\n\u201cThe FDA should not be authorizing the sale of any flavored tobacco products given the tobacco industry\u2019s well-documented history of using flavored products to appeal to and addict kids,\u201d said Yolonda Richardson of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in a statement.\n\nThe FDA pointed to government survey data showing fewer than 2% of American high school and middle school students used nicotine pouches last year.\n\nSupporters of the pouches have noted that Zyn works the same way as nicotine gum, lozenges and other older smoking-cessation products: by releasing low levels of nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings.\n\nThe debate surrounding Zyn spilled into politics last year, pitting Democrats and Republicans against each other in another skirmish in the nation\u2019s culture war.\n\nIn late January, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York called on regulators to investigate Zyn, citing its appeal to teens. Several House Republicans then warned constituents that \u201cBig Brother\u201d intended to \u201cban nicotine.\u201d Tucker Carlson and other conservative commentators are among the public figures who have embraced Zyn.\n\nPhilip Morris has stated it does not employ online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, which is marketed in the U.S. by its Swedish Match unit. The product competes with similar ones from competitors, including Altria\u2019s On pouches.",

Three years later he and his brother Charles began processing cheese for distribution to area retailers. Two other brothers later joined the firm, and in 1909 it was incorporated as J.L. Kraft Bros. & Company.\n\nThe brothers patented a spoil-resistant processed cheese, which was sold in great quantities to the U.S. Army during World War I. As the company expanded in the postwar era, one key acquisition in 1927 was Velveeta, a process that combined bits of cheese and cheese byproducts into a blended product with a \u201cvelvety-smooth\u201d texture. The following year, the company merged with the Phenix Cheese Company (makers of another top-selling Kraft product, Philadelphia cream cheese).\n\nIn 1930 Kraft-Phenix (as it was then called) was acquired by National Dairy Products Corporation (established in 1923), which adopted the names Kraftco Corporation in 1969 and Kraft, Inc., in 1976.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Kraft introduced what would become one of its most iconic branded products: a box of dried pasta combined with a package of long-shelf-life processed cheese called Kraft Dinner. It was later rebranded as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in the U.S.\n\n1980\u20132015: Growth, acquisitions, and several new owners",

            "content": "STAMFORD, CT--( Business Wire Korea Newswire )--The challenges facing our world can overwhelm, but most people strongly believe in innovation\u2019s potential to address the most critical issues in the next 10-20 years, according to the results of a new independent survey commissioned by Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM). Conducted by Povaddo in 10 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, the survey and resultant white paper \u201c Innovation Under Pressure: Navigating Complexity to Drive Change \u201d explore the challenges innovation must overcome to drive societal change, including misinformation, outdated biases, and policymakers\u2019 inability to keep up with rapid technological advances.The multinational survey provides valuable insights into public perceptions of innovation and the challenges obstructing progress. For instance, around three in four respondents (71%) believe disruptive innovation can enable vaccine development and deployment, and nearly two-thirds (62%) think innovation can ensure quality and affordable healthcare for all. Opinions are more divided on innovation\u2019s capacity to reduce smoking rates (49%) and illegal drug use (43%), reflecting the complexities and entrenched beliefs associated with these issues.While citizens are excited about the opportunities technology and innovation can bring in the next few years (76% agree), most (74%) also agree the debate on new innovations is polarized causing consumer confusion. Moreover, eight in 10 people across the 10 countries say misinformation is undermining progress.\u201cWe are a company that has leaned heavily into science and technological innovation to create better alternatives to cigarettes, to the benefit of public health globally,\u201d said Jacek Olczak, CEO of Philip Morris International. \u201cAnd yet, sometimes it seems that the faster we move adult smokers away from cigarettes (by far the most harmful form of nicotine use), the more pushback we get. The bulk of this opposition stems from misunderstanding. Before dismissing an innovation\u2019s potential, it\u2019s vital that people\u2014policymakers especially\u2014take the time to review the scientific and public health evidence and make decisions grounded in facts rather than outdated assumptions.\u201dMr. Olczak added: \u201cThe body of evidence supporting smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes is growing. Look at Sweden, which boasts the lowest smoking rate in Europe, or Japan, which has seen the prevalence of cigarette smoking drop 45% since 2014\u2014the year heated tobacco products were introduced in that market. In any other industry, embracing such innovations and allowing them to displace more harmful products would be considered common sense. Unwarranted opposition by a small chorus of voices should not be allowed to hinder progress for the world\u2019s estimated 1 billion adult smokers and public health.\u201dThe sheer pace of innovation in the 21st century brings a spate of challenges. Indeed, around two-thirds of study participants (64%) worry that technological change is coming on too fast for society and economies to adapt. Respondents also pointed to insufficient information on the benefits and risks of these innovations, public skepticism and mistrust (often fueled by social media), and thorny ethical concerns. Citizens want their governments to act to speed the adoption of advancements poised to have a positive impact. A strong majority (90%) of respondents say it\u2019s important for governments to ensure public access to accurate information about innovations and to establish clear and fair regulations. Additionally, 87% emphasized the importance of governments tackling misinformation, 83% highlighted the criticality of collaboration between the private and public sectors, and 82% percent cited the need to foster an open and balanced public debate on emerging innovations.The \u201c Innovation Under Pressure: Navigating Complexity to Drive Change \u201d white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current innovation landscape, highlighting opportunities and challenges in industries including clean energy, AI, and biotechnology. In it, PMI calls on governments, public health authorities, and civil society to embrace positive change and engage in good faith dialogue grounded in science and evidence. By bringing relevant parties together to address the complexities involved, society can unlock the full potential of innovation to drive positive change and address some of humanity\u2019s most pressing issues.The white paper is based on an international survey conducted by Povaddo between December 13 and 27, 2024. The survey included 10,250 general population adults aged 21 and older in 10 countries: Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The results are accurate to a margin of error of \u00b11 percent at the overall level.Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match\u2014a leader in oral nicotine delivery\u2014creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables and Swedish Match\u2019s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. Renewal applications for these IQOS products are pending before the FDA. As of June 30, 2024, PMI\u2019s smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and PMI estimates that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI\u2019s smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 38% of PMI\u2019s total first-nine months 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

Opinions are more divided on innovation\u2019s capacity to reduce smoking rates (49%) and illegal drug use (43%), reflecting the complexities and entrenched beliefs associated with these issues.\n\nWhile citizens are excited about the opportunities technology and innovation can bring in the next few years (76% agree), most (74%) also agree the debate on new innovations is polarized causing consumer confusion. Moreover, eight in 10 people across the 10 countries say misinformation is undermining progress.\n\n\u201cWe are a company that has leaned heavily into science and technological innovation to create better alternatives to cigarettes, to the benefit of public health globally,\u201d said Jacek Olczak, CEO of Philip Morris International. \u201cAnd yet, sometimes it seems that the faster we move adult smokers away from cigarettes (by far the most harmful form of nicotine use), the more pushback we get. The bulk of this opposition stems from misunderstanding. Before dismissing an innovation\u2019s potential, it\u2019s vital that people\u2014policymakers especially\u2014take the time to review the scientific and public health evidence and make decisions grounded in facts rather than outdated assumptions.\u201d\n\nMr. Olczak added: \u201cThe body of evidence supporting smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes is growing. Look at Sweden, which boasts the lowest smoking rate in Europe, or Japan, which has seen the prevalence of cigarette smoking drop 45% since 2014\u2014the year heated tobacco products were introduced in that market. In any other industry, embracing such innovations and allowing them to displace more harmful products would be considered common sense. Unwarranted opposition by a small chorus of voices should not be allowed to hinder progress for the world\u2019s estimated 1 billion adult smokers and public health.\u201d\n\nThe sheer pace of innovation in the 21st century brings a spate of challenges. Indeed, around two-thirds of study participants (64%) worry that technological change is coming on too fast for society and economies to adapt. Respondents also pointed to insufficient information on the benefits and risks of these innovations, public skepticism and mistrust (often fueled by social media), and thorny ethical concerns. Citizens want their governments to act to speed the adoption of advancements poised to have a positive impact. A strong majority (90%) of respondents say it\u2019s important for governments to ensure public access to accurate information about innovations and to establish clear and fair regulations. Additionally, 87% emphasized the importance of governments tackling misinformation, 83% highlighted the criticality of collaboration between the private and public sectors, and 82% percent cited the need to foster an open and balanced public debate on emerging innovations.\n\nThe \u201cInnovation Under Pressure: Navigating Complexity to Drive Change\u201d white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current innovation landscape, highlighting opportunities and challenges in industries including clean energy, AI, and biotechnology. In it, PMI calls on governments, public health authorities, and civil society to embrace positive change and engage in good faith dialogue grounded in science and evidence. By bringing relevant parties together to address the complexities involved, society can unlock the full potential of innovation to drive positive change and address some of humanity\u2019s most pressing issues.\n\nSurvey Methodology\n\nThe white paper is based on an international survey conducted by Povaddo between December 13 and 27, 2024. The survey included 10,250 general population adults aged 21 and older in 10 countries: Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The results are accurate to a margin of error of \u00b11 percent at the overall level.\n\nPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future\n\nPhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match\u2014a leader in oral nicotine delivery\u2014creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables and Swedish Match\u2019s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. Renewal applications for these IQOS products are pending before the FDA. As of June 30, 2024, PMI\u2019s smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and PMI estimates that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI\u2019s smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 38% of PMI\u2019s total first-nine months 2024 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

            "content": "According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global alcoholic beverages market was estimated to have reached a value of $544.19 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% during 2025-2029 to reach a value of $709.13 billion by the end of the forecast period. There is a growing demand for ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages and flavored drinks, especially among younger consumers. The demand for low-alcohol beverages and cocktails made with natural ingredients is also rising as consumers seek healthier options. The 2023 Bacardi Global Consumer Survey found that 44% of respondents in Canada and 43% of younger respondents in the United States plan to consume more cocktails made with natural ingredients in 2024. Additionally, consumers are increasingly willing to pay more for premium and high-quality products. This is another key trend driving growth in the alcoholic beverages industry.\n\nIn the US, the gambling market is flourishing. Since the Supreme Court struck down a federal law prohibiting sports betting in 2018, gambling and sports betting has grown remarkably. According to the American Gaming Association, sports betting is now legal and operational in 38 states and Washington, D.C. as of January 14, 2025. We could see more markets open up and legalize gambling and sports betting in the near future. Another key trend driving growth in the gambling industry is the surge in popularity of online gambling and iGaming. Online gambling is also attracting young bettors. According to a 2023 survey by the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), 58% of those aged 18 to 22 had placed at least one wager in 2023.\n\nIt is important to note that sin stocks can offer unique benefits. By providing goods and services that people always want, companies involved in such sectors often thrive in tough times and even during recessions. Industries that may be seen as immoral or unethical like gambling, alcohol, and tobacco enjoy consistent consumer demand as people usually continue to purchase their products and services even during economic slowdowns. Some investors argue that this makes sin stocks relatively recession-proof.\n\nSin stocks are shares of companies involved in activities that are often seen as immoral or unethical. Such companies are involved in a range of sectors such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and adult entertainment. Some investors believe that sin stocks profit from human weaknesses and vices. While some ethical investors may be looking to avoid such stocks due to ethical concerns, others may see them as strong investment opportunities.\n\nWe recently published a list of 10 Best Sin Stocks to Invest in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against other best sin stocks to invest in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSurveys in the United States have shown that the use of tobacco and marijuana has been fluctuating. Gallup, a global analytics and advisory firm, highlighted in its 2023 update on cigarette smoking that 12% of US adults were smoking cigarettes, slightly up from 11% in 2022. On the other hand, according to combined Gallup data from 2023 and 2024, 15% of US adults reported that they smoked marijuana. Since 2013, the percentage of Americans who report they smoke marijuana has more than doubled. In 2013, when Gallup added the question to its annual Consumption Habits survey for the first time, 7% of US adults reported they smoked marijuana.\n\nOverall, industries like gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are experiencing growth, suggesting that now might be a good time to consider investing in sin stocks.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 best sin stocks to invest in 2025, we looked for stocks related to gambling, tobacco, alcohol, and other businesses that fall into the category of \u201cunethical\u201d or \u201csin\u201d stocks. We reviewed our own rankings, financial media reports, and various online resources to compile a list of the best sin stocks. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best sin stocks to invest in 2025 are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) the Best Sin Stock to Invest in 2025?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that manufactures and offers cigarettes and smoke-free products in more than 180 markets around the world. PMI is one of the best sin stocks to invest in. The company\u2019s portfolio of cigarette brands includes Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield. In 2022, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) acquired Swedish Match to create a strong global leader in smoke-free products, featuring the brands IQOS and ZYN.\n\nBroyhill Asset Management, an investment advisor, noted in its Q3 2024 investor letter that the shares of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) surged by 21% in the third quarter of 2024. The investment management firm also pointed out that the company is focused on transitioning from combustible cigarettes to reduced-risk products. Broyhill Asset Management emphasized the growing popularity of Zyn, which has become very popular and is often out of stock despite increased production efforts by the company.\n\nThe company is strategically focused on growing its smoke-free business segment. In Q3 2024, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) reported that the shipment of smoke-free products reached nearly 40 billion units, with the products being available in 92 markets. In the third quarter of 2024, the smoke-free business made up 38% of the company\u2019s total net revenues and 40% of its gross profit.\n\nOn January 16, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed by Swedish Match. This move makes ZYN the first and only authorized nicotine pouch in the US.\n\nOverall, PM ranks 1st on our list of best sin stocks to invest in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of sin stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

( PM ), headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, is a leading global tobacco company dedicated to delivering innovative and science-based alternatives to traditional cigarettes. With a market cap of $189.1 billion , Philip Morris is at the forefront of transforming the tobacco industry with its smoke-free products, aiming to create a future without cigarettes. The company is set to release its Q4 earnings before the market opens on Thursday, Feb. 6.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect Philip Morris to report a profit of $1.51 per share , up 11% from $1.36 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The company surpassed the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on one other occasion.\n\nIn fiscal Q3, the company reported an EPS of $1.91, which topped the consensus estimates by 4.4%. The earnings beat was driven by strong demand, higher sales volumes, and effective cost management, resulting in higher-than-expected revenue and earnings.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts expect Philip Morris to report an adjusted EPS of $6.50, up 8.2% from $6.01 in fiscal 2023 .

Net revenues increased 8.4% year over year to $9.9 billion. The smoke-free business saw significant growth, with nearly 40 billion units shipped, accounting for 38% of net revenues. At the same time, IQOS solidified its position as the second-largest nicotine brand, driving a 14.8% increase in heat-not-burn product sales.\n\nThe consensus opinion on the PM stock is moderately bullish , with an overall \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating.

            "content": "That said, high yields aren\u2019t automatically a bad sign. In fact, dividend yield plays an important role when investing in dividend stocks, as it shows how much income an investor can expect relative to the stock's price. However, to fully benefit from high yields, other factors like the company\u2019s cash flow, payout ratio, and dividend growth must also be considered. If these metrics are strong, high-yield stocks can still be appealing. Some reports have pointed out the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields increase, returns generally rise, and risk decreases. Hartford Funds conducted research factoring in annualized standard deviation, which measures a portfolio\u2019s return volatility, with a higher standard deviation indicating greater historical risk. The report found that from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios delivered an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps\u2014companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.\u201d\n\nOne such example is a report published by Newton Investment Management. According to the report, high-yield dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during high inflationary periods between 1940 and 2021. The report also revealed that investment portfolios with high-yield dividend stocks outperformed those with low or no dividends in terms of value-weighted performance. High-yield portfolios surpassed low-yield ones by 199 basis points and zero-yield portfolios by 330 basis points. While this result provides useful information, it doesn\u2019t offer details about the market conditions at the time, giving only a broad picture of high-yield stock performance. Analysts have paid close attention to how dividend stocks perform during market volatility, as the need for consistent income becomes more pronounced in such times. As a result, they suggest considering high-yield stocks only if these companies also have a strong history of dividend growth.\n\nDividend stocks have been investors\u2019 favorites for a long time now. Over the years, these equities have performed better than the broader market. That said, when it comes to dividend investing, opinions often split down the middle between those seeking high yields and those favoring dividend growth. Though analysts recommend buying stocks with proven tracks of dividend growth, the appeal of high yields is hard to ignore. According to analysts, investors should steer clear of yield traps and focus on companies that consistently increase the value returned to shareholders. However, those advocating yields have plenty to say about the significance of dividend yields.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks To Invest In . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stands against the other high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe ideal situation would be when dividend growth and high yields go hand in hand, as many companies have demonstrated that this is achievable. With that being said, we will now take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with high yields to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks that have yields above 4%, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge fund investors having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(PM) Best Low Volatility Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA man exhaling smoke from a cigarette indicating the use of tobacco products.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nDividend Yield as of January 20: 4.44%\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that also offers a wide range of related products. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenues of $9.9 billion, marking an 8.4% increase from the previous year. This exceeded analysts' expectations by $220 million. The company\u2019s operating income reached $3.7 billion, reflecting an 8.4% year-over-year growth. Philip Morris expressed confidence in its financial stability, projecting around $11 billion in operating cash flow for 2024.\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has a clear strategy to achieve $20 billion in operating income over the next five years, positioning the company to generate significant value for shareholders. It plans to return most of these earnings through dividends and share buybacks, reflecting its commitment to shareholder-friendly capital allocation. This strong outlook makes it challenging for long-term investors to face losses over a 10-year period, as PMI\u2019s market leadership and earnings potential offer a solid base for both growth and stability. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 31.5%.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has raised its payouts for 15 consecutive years, which makes PM one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock offers a dividend yield of 4.44%, as of January 20.\n\nBroyhill Asset Management made the following comment about PM in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) gained 21% in Q3. Philip Morris was by far the largest contributor for the quarter. Our core thesis focuses on the shift in business mix from combustible cigarettes towards reduced risk products as well as the company\u2019s re-entry to the US market with its acquisition of Swedish Match. This year, Zyn has become wildly popular. So much so that the company can barely keep it in stock, even as it expands production. We recently discussed how youth usage of these products, a common critique of the company, remains under 2%, even as its overall popularity drives higher volume.\u201d\n\nThe number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) jumped to 75 in Q3 2024, from 70 a quarter earlier. These stakes have a total value of more than $12.2 billion.\n\nOverall PM ranks 2nd on our list of the best high-yield dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for PM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while Philip Morris International ( ) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Philip Morris International:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.31 = US$14b \u00f7 (US$67b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThus, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 31%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 21% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Philip Morris International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nIn terms of Philip Morris International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 47% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Philip Morris International might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.\n\nOur Take On Philip Morris International's ROCE\n\nBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Philip Morris International's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 88% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.\n\nIf you want to continue researching Philip Morris International, you might be interested to know about the that our analysis has discovered.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free\n\nIf you're looking to trade Philip Morris International , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

They\u2019re accused of designing and marketing ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) to be addictive to children, causing chronic disease.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed at the end of December 2024 in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Bryce Martinez, a Pennsylvania resident who alleges he developed type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease at age 16 as a result of consuming those companies\u2019 products.\n\nMorgan & Morgan, which claims to be \u201cAmerica's largest injury law firm,\" brought the case, calling it a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind lawsuit.\u201d If those words are taken literally, it could indeed be the first of a spate of lawsuits of this kind.\n\nThe filing is an exhausting read but has several provocative historical nuggets:\n\n\u201cIn the 1980s, Big Tobacco took over the American food environment. Phillip [sic] Morris bought major U.S. food companies, including General Foods and Kraft. RJ Reynolds purchased Nabisco, Del Monte, Kentucky Fried Chicken and others. Collectively, Phillip [sic] Morris and RJ Reynolds dominated the U.S. food system for decades. During this time, they used their cigarette playbook to fill our food environment with addictive substances that are aggressively marketed to children and minorities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cScientists who supervised human electrode tests on nicotine\u2019s addictiveness at a secret Phillip [sic] Morris laboratory in Germany regularly consulted with Kraft and General Foods on the development of UPF. In doing so, Big Tobacco companies intentionally designed UPF to hack the physiological structures of our brains.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a 1999 \u201cclosed doors\u201d meeting in Minneapolis, James Behnke of Pillsbury and Michael Mudd of Kraft tried to convince top executives of Nestle, Kraft, Nabisco, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola, Mars, Pillsbury, Cargill and Tate & Lyle that \u201ctheir companies had gone too far in marketing their products and engineering UPF to maximize their consumption,\u201d the lawsuit states \u2013 although the term UPF had not been coined yet.\n\nThe lawsuit includes claims for conspiracy, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation and unfair business practices. It seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThat connection to Big Tobacco is interesting but limited. While Kraft Heinz and Mondelez arguably are descendants of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, respectively, the rest of the defendants have no connection whatsoever to tobacco companies.\n\nSome of the more notable allegations in its introductory points:\n\nUltra-processed foods are industrially produced edible substances that are imitations of food. They consist of former foods that have been fractioned into substances, chemically modified, combined with additives, and then reassembled using industrial techniques such as molding, extrusion and pressurization.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPF are alien to prior human experience. They are inventions of modern industrial technology and contain little to no whole food. However, the prevalence of these foods exploded in the 1980s, and have come to dominate the American food environment and the American diet. The issue is particularly pronounced in children, who now derive over 2/3 of their energy from UPF on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explosion and ensuing rise in UPF in the 1980s was accompanied by an explosion in obesity, diabetes, and other life-changing chronic illnesses.\n\nThe parallels the suit draws with the tobacco industry are ominous in another way. Few gave much of a chance to the initial, individual 1980s lawsuits against Big Tobacco. But those mushroomed into filings by the attorneys general of 46 states and a proposed Congressional settlement. Eventually, the four biggest cigarette-makers \u2014 Philip Morris USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. \u2014 agreed to pay $206 billion over 25 years, according to Wikipedia.\n\nThere are a couple of holes in the lawsuit\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cThere is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultraprocessed foods,\u201d says Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Assn., the industry\u2019s trade group. \u201cAttempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any precedent for courts finding food manufacturers liable for health effects attributed to over-indulgence,\" comments David Joy, a partner at law firm Keller & Heckman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s problematic that most studies reported so far are just observational and don\u2019t establish causality,\u201d says Leslie Krasny of Krasny Law Office, with a specialization in FDA and food regulatory matters.\n\n\u201cAnother concern about the allegations in the complaint is that estimates of eating patterns seem to show that a majority of the calories consumed in America may be from foods that are arguably UPFs,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf those estimates prove to be accurate, there may not be an adequate baseline group of those who do not eat significant amounts of UPFs in order to justify comparisons regarding incidence rates of certain diseases.\n\n\u201cAlso, the relative risks are not high for some of the illnesses cited in the complaint, which can make it challenging to summarize any apparent health effects of UPFs,\u201d Krasny concluded.\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to picture a world in which food manufacturers could be required to pay damages in response to this type of claim,\" said Joy. \"Would we no longer have snack foods and desserts?\"\n\nBut even current (as of this writing anyway) FDA officials have expressed concern about UPFs. Commissioner Robert Califf has said that ultraprocessed foods are likely addictive, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Dept of Health and Human Services, has targeted them.\n\nWe\u2019re not at 46 state attorneys general yet, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month issued an executive order asking state agencies to look into the harm caused by ultraprocessed foods.\n\nIt could be just another nuisance lawsuit, like the one claiming there aren\u2019t enough strawberries in strawberry Pop-Tarts. Then again\u2026",

            "content": "Philip Morris International (PMI), the renowned tobacco giant, has been consistently expanding its operations beyond the traditional tobacco market. The company\u2019s recent moves indicate a growing commitment to medical cannabis. Through a partnership with Canadian company Avicanna, specializing in cannabinoid therapy, PMI is advancing its diversification strategy.\n\nBut why is the world\u2019s largest tobacco company investing in medical cannabis? What sets it apart from its competitors and what are its long-term plans? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nPhilip Morris and Avicanna: A new medical cannabis partnership\n\nPhilip Morris International has partnered with Avicanna, a Canadian biotech company specializing in cannabinoid-based medical products. A key element of this partnership is the MyMedi.ca platform , which offers patients pharmaceutical support and access to expertly selected medical cannabis products.\n\nThis collaboration is no accident. Canada, with its well-regulated cannabis market, is an ideal environment for testing new strategies and gaining experience in patient care. Aaron Grey, an expert at Alliance Global Partners, notes:\n\n\u201cPMI has been focused on medical cannabis applications for years. The partnership with Avicanna is a logical continuation of that strategy.\u201d\n\nWhy Philip Morris International chooses medical applications of cannabis?\n\nPhilip Morris has been working to transform its image for years. The introduction of smokeless products such as IQOS and investments in medical solutions show the company\u2019s drive to innovate and respond to changing consumer preferences.\n\nYounger generations are increasingly moving away from traditional tobacco in favor of healthier alternatives such as hemp and wellness products. The partnership with Avicanna allows PMI to reach a new group of consumers who value science-based and health-based solutions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Philip Morris has ventured into the medical market. In 2016, the company invested in Israeli Syqe Medical, which developed an inhaler for administering cannabis-based medications. In 2023, PMI acquired Syqe Medical, confirming its long-term interest in developing medical cannabis.\n\nPMI vs. Competition: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nWhile other tobacco companies like Altria and British American Tobacco (BAT) have focused on the recreational market, PMI has taken a different path.\n\nCompetition Investments\n\nAltria: In 2018, it invested $1.8 billion in Cronos Group, a company focused on recreational cannabis applications.\n\nBAT: In 2023, it entered into a partnership with Organigram, committing $125 million in research and development.\n\nPhilip Morris is focusing on medical applications, avoiding the risks associated with the more unpredictable recreational market. With Avicanna, the company is building expertise in cannabinoid-based therapies and gaining valuable experience in patient care.\n\nAvicanna: A key player in PMI\u2019s strategy\n\nAvicanna is a company known for its commitment to research and development of cannabinoid therapies. Its innovative approach includes:\n\nMyMedi.ca Platform: Integration of patient services and access to specialized medical products.\n\nResearch partnerships : Collaborations with institutions such as University Health Network and SickKids Hospital in Canada allow Avicanna to develop therapies for patients with epilepsy, dermatological disorders and chronic pain, among others.\n\nWhat will the future bring?\n\nExperts wonder whether PMI\u2019s cooperation with Avicanna is not a prelude to a full takeover. A similar scenario occurred in the case of Syqe Medical, which initially received investment support and was then fully acquired by PMI.\n\nWhile Canada is a strategic entry point, Philip Morris\u2019 long-term plan may include entering the U.S. market. However, as Todd Harrison of CB1 Capital notes: \u201cThe speed of integration will depend on changes in U.S. regulations.\u201d\n\nPhilip Morris International is charting a new course by diversifying its medical cannabis strategy. The partnership with Avicanna reaffirms the company\u2019s commitment to developing innovative health solutions and adapting to changing consumer preferences.\n\nWith a focus on research, regulated markets, and patient care, PMI is building a solid foundation for its future in the cannabis industry.\n\n__\n\n(Featured image by alokmallick33444968 via Pixabay)\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article was written by a third party contributor and does not reflect the opinion of Born2Invest, its management, staff or its associates.

            "content": "IQOS\u2019s success in Egypt signals a promising opportunity for the introduction of additional smoke-free products to the market, according to Tommaso Di Giovanni, Vice President for International Communication and Engagement at Philip Morris International (PMI). With an estimated 15 million adult smokers in the country, IQOS has already made significant progress in providing a reduced-risk alternative to traditional cigarettes.\n\nIn an interview with Daily News Egypt, Di Giovanni highlighted the considerable potential of the Egyptian market for expanding PMI\u2019s portfolio of smoke-free products, including heated tobacco devices.\n\nTransforming Tobacco\n\nThe transformation of Philip Morris International (PMI) began with the recognition that change was necessary. \u201cWe were\u2014and we are\u2014selling a product that causes diseases and is addictive: cigarettes,\u201d Di Giovanni noted. This awareness has fueled the company\u2019s drive to innovate and offer better alternatives for both society and consumers. \u201cAnyone who sells a product that causes disease and is addictive would like to do better,\u201d he said, stressing PMI\u2019s dual responsibility to society and to the company itself.\n\nHe further emphasized that improving the health of adult smokers is not only a moral obligation but also a sound business strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for our company and for public health,\u201d he explained, adding that addressing societal concerns can help PMI stay ahead of the competition while positively impacting global health.\n\nA Focus on Science and Innovation\n\nPMI\u2019s transformation is grounded in scientific evidence, Di Giovanni noted, highlighting the critical role of research and development in driving the company\u2019s shift toward less harmful products. \u201cScientific evidence has been a key driver in our choices,\u201d he said, explaining that this approach has enabled PMI to offer innovative alternatives, such as heated tobacco and e-vapor products, which aim to reduce health risks compared to traditional cigarettes.\n\nEgyptian Market Potential\n\nTurning to Egypt, where approximately 15 million adults smoke, Di Giovanni expressed optimism about introducing smoke-free products like vapes and nicotine pouches to the market. The success of IQOS, which has already gained a foothold in Egypt, provides promising prospects for future launches and efforts to \u201ctake Egyptians who smoke away from cigarettes.\u201d\n\nCulturally, these products are expected to resonate well with adult smokers, with vapor from these devices resembling traditional water pipes, making them a good cultural fit. However, he emphasized that the right regulatory and commercial environments are crucial for encouraging widespread adoption.\n\nSustainability as a Core Value\n\nSustainability is a fundamental pillar of PMI\u2019s strategy. Di Giovanni sees it as key to reducing the societal impact of the company\u2019s activities. \u201cFor us, the first goal of sustainability is to address the public health issues posed by cigarettes,\u201d he said, adding that replacing cigarettes with better alternatives is at the heart of their mission to improve society.\n\nBy focusing on a comprehensive range of smoke-free products, PMI aims to ensure a future where innovation and responsibility are aligned. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to offer a portfolio of products that meets the diverse needs of the market while supporting sustainability goals,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nPMI remains committed to its transformative journey, with a firm focus on transparency, science-driven solutions, and societal well-being. \u201cOur mission is clear: to lead the way toward a smoke-free future, driven by innovation, step by step,\u201d Di Giovanni concluded.",

Innovation remains central to our strategy.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that globally, approximately one billion people smoke, many of whom are aware of the health risks but still do not quit.

He further emphasized that, according to the World Health Organization, the global smoking population is projected to grow due to population increases, despite ongoing anti-smoking policies and campaigns. While restrictions on tobacco marketing and higher taxes have reduced accessibility in some regions, overall smoking growth remains uncurbed.\n\nPMI, he explained, is dedicated to transparency and providing adult smokers with all necessary information about their smoke-free products. This approach aligns with PMI\u2019s commitment to offering better choices and ensuring that decisions are made based on complete knowledge of the facts, upholding both innovation and humanity\u2019s principles.\n\nOlczak disclosed that around 36.5 million adults globally now use PMI\u2019s smoke-free products. He highlighted the company\u2019s success in countries like Japan and Sweden, where the legalization of smoke-free products, including IQOS, has contributed to notable reductions in smoking rates. In Japan, the first market for IQOS, newly released public health data shows a 46% decrease in cigarette-smoking prevalence since 2014, dropping from 19.6% of all adults to 10.6% in 2022.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, smoke-free products accounted for 38% of PMI\u2019s total net revenues, with IQOS surpassing Marlboro in revenue by late 2023, according to Olczak.\n\nRegional Insights on Market Adoption\n\nAndrzej D\u0105browski, Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa at PMI, noted that the use of smoke-free products is not solely dependent on a country\u2019s income level. For instance, while Qatar, a high-income economy, does not allow smoke-free products, Egypt has been more receptive, with IQOS products accounting for 9.5% of the market share in Cairo. D\u0105browski also pointed to Lebanon, where PMI\u2019s products maintain a strong presence despite the country\u2019s economic challenges, and the UAE, which has embraced PMI\u2019s smoke-free offerings. He emphasized that PMI remains open to discussions about its smoke-free products in all markets.\n\nCollaboration for a Smoke-Free Future\n\nAndrea Gontkovicova, Vice President of External Affairs for South & Southeast Asia, CIS, and the Middle East and Africa at PMI, shared her perspective on efforts to reduce the number of conventional smokers. She highlighted PMI\u2019s range of smoke-free alternatives, including IQOS, first introduced in Japan in 2014.\n\n\u201cNon-combustible products can be tailored to suit everyone, but we need regulators to oversee these alternatives to traditional combustible products. We possess the alternatives, the science, and the experts focused on making this shift,\u201d Gontkovicova said. She emphasized that every adult smoker should have access to alternative products, which must be readily available to meet their needs.\n\n\u201cOperating in more than 90 markets globally, we strive to offer better alternatives to everyone, everywhere. This is a priority for us, as 36.5 million adults around the world use alternative products,\u201d she added. \u201cThis effort needs everyone involved.\u201d\n\nIndustry Challenges and Consumer Preferences\n\nFred Roeder, Managing Director of the Consumer Choice Center, acknowledged that the nicotine market is evolving and that many consumers now prefer alternative ways of consuming nicotine.\n\nRoeder noted that while several countries have adopted harm-reduction approaches for adult smokers, pricing remains a critical issue, as some nations impose heavy taxes on alternative products, making them less accessible. He pointed to the competition among products in the market, with some countries embracing less harmful alternatives and seeing positive outcomes, while others have rejected them.\n\n\u201cThis divergence underscores the need for continued innovation and flexibility in addressing consumer needs and regulatory challenges,\u201d Roeder explained. He also highlighted the challenge of educating smokers, particularly in emerging economies, where many adult smokers are unaware of the harmful effects of smoking. In such regions, the cost of smoking tends to be higher when alternative options are inaccessible, illustrating the profound impact of government policies on the adoption of harm-reduction innovations.\n\nRoeder concluded: \u201cIn the coming generation, we are likely to witness a significant shift. We aim to remain neutral in terms of technology, acknowledging that many consumers prefer consuming nicotine in alternative ways.\u201d",

Governments are losing billions in tax revenues and consumers are being exposed to unregulated products. Ankur Modi , Cluster Head \u2013 South Asia & Indochina, Philip Morris International PMI ) sheds light on the urgent need to eliminate illicit tobacco trade and PMI\u2019s ongoing anti-illicit efforts to combat the menace.\n\n1.Illicit tobacco trade is a constant calamity across the world. How profound has been the impact of this illegitimate trade?\n\nIllicit tobacco trade is a drain on global economies and livelihoods, leading to $40.5 billion in tax losses for governments across the globe. Reports suggest approximately 12% of the global cigarettes consumed are illicit. Due to counterfeit and contraband cigarettes, Governments in Europe lost an estimated \u20ac11.6 billion in tax revenue in 2023, according to a KPMG global study. Euromonitor report indicates one in four cigarettes consumed in India is illicit, causing approximately $2 billion in tax losses. As per TRACIT report, the market for counterfeit products in Southeast Asia is worth approximately USD 35 billion annually. Counterfeit and contraband products is a transnational problem and is interconnected across the source, transit, and destination countries.\n\n2. How big, in terms of numbers is the size of illicit tobacco trade in India?\n\nThe Tobacco Institute of India (TII) highlights that the illegal cigarette trade, which includes internationally smuggled and locally manufactured tax-evaded cigarettes, accounts for nearly one-fourth of the cigarette industry in India. The FICCI Cascade report suggests that the total loss to the Govt. of India estimated on account of illicit tobacco trade was \u20b913,331 crore in 2022. Illicit cigarette volumes in India reached 30.2 billion sticks in 2022, trailing only behind China and Brazil as per Euromonitor International\u2019s 2023 report.\n\nIntelligence reports suggest that illicit cigarettes are smuggled into India via ports, airports and land borders. While law enforcement agencies have been successful in seizing illegal cigarettes across many Indian cities, they face challenges such as misdeclaration of illicit cigarettes as food products, carpets, garments etc. 65% of the smuggled cigarettes are concealed in containers, while 23% are driven in by road vehicles, and 5% enter as air cargo.\n\nThis necessitates a transnational solution.\n\n3. Like other industries, the Government would surely be looking for support from the industry. How is PMI in India curbing this menace of illicit cigarette trade?\n\nEliminating illicit trade has been a longstanding priority for us. We have devised a comprehensive strategy to combat illicit tobacco trade. The first step is to conduct rigorous research and intelligence to understand the evolving strategies deployed by black marketers. This is followed by undertaking robust security measures to protect the supply chain through enhanced partnerships with the Government. We have also stepped-up co-operation with law enforcement agencies to disrupt illicit networks. Moreover, we are actively raising awareness amongst citizens on the perils of using illicit products. We also ensure that there is no diversion of genuine products from the intended market of sale (where the taxes are paid), to other markets of the world. We also have a worldwide program in place that ensures higher risk countries are implementing necessary measures to prevent these issues.\n\n4. What could be some solutions that you feel will help eradicate this menace?\n\nStrict regulation and deterrent penalties have mitigated the menace of counterfeit compared to excessive taxation on consumer goods, or even prohibition. Additionally, there is need to leverage existing free trade agreements under World Trade Organization (WTO), as there are provisions to drive extended cooperation between member countries. Supply chains also need to be bolstered by deploying new-age technologies such as digitally verified track-and-trace systems, holograms, and QR codes for monitoring and detecting counterfeit products.\n\nA multi-faceted approach that complements strong law enforcement with awareness campaigns, a predictable fiscal and regulatory environment and coordinated and committed public-private partnerships are vital to eradicate illicit tobacco trade.\n\nEnd of article",

Philip Morris\u2019s commitment has had a significant impact on global public health.\u201d\n\nVolpetti revealed that in 2021, PMI took another major step by focusing on health, healthcare, and investing in technologies to deliver alternatives that do not rely on combustion. \u201cBy 2024, we have smoke-free products available in over 90 markets, reflecting a 38% increase. Our goal is to provide more options for adult smokers, and we are fully dedicated to leveraging technology to ensure the success of our mission. The data shows the positive results of our efforts in this field,\u201d he explained. Volpetti further shared that around 36.5 million adults are currently using PMI\u2019s smoke-free products, including 30.8 million IQOS users, with 22.1 million having fully switched to IQOS.\n\nXavier Ducarroz, Vice President of the Smoke-Free Products Category for SSEA, CIS, and MEA at PMI, emphasized the company\u2019s focus on catering to diverse consumer preferences. \u201cIn the Philippines, for example, we offer various nicotine options. What we are doing is crucial, as we aim to promote these products effectively to adult smokers. This includes overcoming social pressures, engaging with consumer programs, and providing information and support to our customers,\u201d Ducarroz said.\n\nAnkur Modi, Area Vice President for South Asia and Indochina at PMI, discussed the company\u2019s commitment to encouraging smokers who are unwilling to quit to switch to better alternatives, while also safeguarding young people. \u201cOur goal is to create a balance by offering less harmful alternatives to adult smokers seeking better choices. In some countries, such as India, the illegal tobacco trade has surged due to high costs and weak product offerings, showing that banning and restricting alternatives doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Modi explained. \u201cWe believe that governments, media, and healthcare professionals must recognize the positive changes in countries where alternative products are allowed and witness the real impact on consumers\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that PMI is focused on working with governments, adding, \u201cOur vision is not solely centred on prohibition and restriction by authorities and regulators. Instead, we prioritize informed choices and ensure that the alternatives we offer are accessible, beneficial, and safe.\u201d\n\nLindsey Mark Lewis, Executive Director and Board Member of the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, highlighted PMI\u2019s role in advancing better alternatives to traditional cigarettes. \u201cA decade ago, such alternatives didn\u2019t exist, but now PMI is taking calculated risks to help one billion adult smokers switch to better choices,\u201d Lewis noted. He stressed the critical role of governments in supporting this shift, citing scientific evidence that these alternatives are significantly less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\nIn countries like India, with 300 million smokers, Lewis sees a tremendous opportunity for governments to lead harm-reduction efforts. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that in the next 10 years, many nations may eliminate traditional cigarettes altogether, driven by innovation and global efforts to move away from smoking,\u201d he concluded.",

In 2024, the team received on loan larger, more complex VEX robots from the Manitoba Association of Educational Technology Leaders (MAETL).\n\nMAETL has a STEM lending library to encourage science, technology, engineering, and math and they lend out different equipment to schools across the province to achieve this. MAETL has donated two $1,600 robots and a 12-foot x 12-foot ring for the students to build and practice with before the school commits to buying its own equipment.\n\nThe VEX robots have to accomplish multiple tasks such as picking up rings and placing them on a stake, climbing a four-foot high ladder, and pushing their opponents. Each task has a set of points and the team with the most number of points wins the tournament.\n\n\u201cThe top robots of the world can do all three,\u201d said Jamieson. \u201cBut it\u2019s that learning process, on do you spend a month working on one task and then move on to the other task? So, you try different strategies to get different points within the time limits.

And it's not chewing tobacco, because there's no tobacco or spitting required. It's called Zyn, a brand of nicotine pouches that have gained popularity, especially among younger demographics.\n\nSome proponents of the pouches say it gives them a rush, while others hope it'll help them kick a smoking habit. So-called \"Zynfluencers\" can be seen popping the little white pouches between their gums and cheeks on social media.\n\nOthers, however, have warned against the product, noting health concerns. In addition to nicotine, the pouches also contain plant-based fibers, sweeteners and flavorings like cinnamon, citrus and coffee.\n\n\"We are hooking a whole new generation of young people on to nicotine,\" Dr. Nidhi Kumar previously told CBS New York. \"The marketing strategies, the packaging looks like candy, flavors like cinnamon and mint and even names like 'smooth' or 'chill.' I mean, who are these products appealing to? Young people.\"\n\nHere's what to know about health risks and concerns of Zyn.\n\nIs Zyn FDA approved?\n\nOn Jan. 16, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Philip Morris International, the parent company of Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, to sell the product to help adult smokers cut back or quit cigarettes. The authorization included 10 Zyn flavors, including coffee, mint and menthol.\n\nIt's the first time regulators have authorized sales of nicotine pouches, which are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. tobacco market.\n\nThe pouches have been available for more than a decade as FDA reviewed company data intended to show the products can serve as an alternative to cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products. The decision doesn't mean that Zyn is safe, just less harmful than older alternatives.\n\nAdvocates quickly criticized the FDA's decision.\n\n\"The FDA should not be authorizing the sale of any flavored tobacco products given the tobacco industry's well-documented history of using flavored products to appeal to and addict kids,\" Yolonda Richardson, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement to the Associated Press.\n\nGovernment survey data shows fewer than 2% of American high school and middle school students used nicotine pouches last year, according to the FDA.\n\nZyn smokeless nicotine pouches at the Swedish Match AB concept store in central Stockholm, Sweden, on Monday, Oct. 31, 2022. Jonas Ekblom/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nCriticism over the pouches isn't new. Last year, Sen. Chuck Schumer issued a warning about Zyn, describing them as a \"pouch packed with problems.\"\n\n\"These nicotine pouches seem to lock their sights on young kids \u2014 teenagers and even lower \u2014 and then use the social media to hook 'em,\" he said at a press conference.\n\nAre Zyns better than vaping?\n\nUnlike smoking and vaping, Zyn is smoke- and tobacco-free \u2014 but the pouches still contain nicotine, an addictive chemical.\n\nThis makes the product legal only for those 21 and above. The brand's warning label states the product is not intended for use by \"minors, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or persons with or at risk of heart disease or high blood pressure.\"\n\n\"If you do not currently use nicotine, ZYN is not for you,\" the brand's website declares. Users of the website must verify their age before perusing the page.\n\nKumar told CBS New York that the pouches are \"marketed as being products that can help you quit smoking,\" but said that experts \"have no data to substantiate that.\"\n\nPhilip Morris International told CBS News it has not marketed the product for smoking cessation, and says all of its products \"fully meet and exceed the regulations governing the industry.\"\n\n\"Our marketing practices\u2014which prohibit the use of social media influencers\u2014are focused on preventing underage access and set the benchmark for the industry. Real-world evidence shows this approach is working: the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA show oral nicotine pouch use by those under the legal age remains exceptionally low,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nEven if using these products as an alternative to smoking, Dr. Mustali Dohadwala, medical director and practitioner at cardiology-focused private practice Heartsafe, says he wouldn't consider it a lesser of the two evils. Instead, \"it's certainly a different evil.\"\n\n\"It's supposed to serve as a methodology for weaning, and you could argue that it can be even more difficult to quit a use of nicotine due to the flavor profiles... that are being marketed, manufactured and the way they're making it stylish to consume these products,\" Dohadwala says.\n\nDoes Zyn raise blood pressure or cause gum damage?\n\nWhile we don't know the long-term effects of Zyn yet, health experts say there are several health concerns to be aware of when it comes to nicotine use, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and oral health impacts.\n\n\"We know that it increases heart rate (and) blood pressure,\" Dohadwala says. \"In particular to oral nicotine pouches, what I worry about is periodontal disease. There are toxic chemicals in these pouches, which can lead to injury of the gums. Persistent, recurrent injury can end up leading to inflammation, infection but most importantly cancer.\"\n\nKumar echoed the concerns of periodontal and gum disease.\n\n\"If you're using these products, just Google nicotine pouches and dental disease \u2014 you'll spit it out right away,\" she said.\n\nThere can also be gastrointestinal effects, she added, including nausea and vomiting. Some users have also reported experiencing hiccups and diarrhea.\n\nIt can also increase your risk of diabetes in the long run, she said, since nicotine interacts with your cells to make you glucose and insulin intolerant.\n\nNicotine, addiction and mental health impacts\n\nThe negative impacts of nicotine go beyond physical health and into mental health as well.\n\nWhile nicotine produces an immediate sense of relaxation, Kumar explained that the feeling is short-lived.\n\n\"When it wears off, there's a spike in edginess and anxiety, even stressful types of feelings,\" she said. \"So it creates this vicious cycle because then you have cravings that wants you to get that relaxation feeling again but in the end it ends up increasing your anxiety level and your stress level when you use these products.\"\n\nAnother impact that's top of mind? Addiction, Kumar said, adding young brains are particularly vulnerable to the condition.\n\nIf you're dealing with nicotine addiction, Dohadwala says seeking professional help, like seeing an addiction specialist or psychologist, is important.\n\n\"It's important, too, for any person who ends up struggling with this addiction of consumption to understand that it is an addiction,\" he says. \"It is something that's going to take time. This is not a sprint by any means, it is a marathon.\"\n\nHe also warns young people to be aware of the potential consequences if they're choosing to dabble in these pouches for fun.\n\n\"There are so many things out there that are trendy, and something that is artificial, that's potentially toxic to your body, you would want to really be cautious,\" he says. \"There are untoward effects that are related to experimenting with these things, and at times those experimentations end up becoming habits and addictions.\"\n\nIf you or a loved one is experiencing a problem with substance use, help is available via the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

Zyn pouches have been on the market for about a decade. But only this past summer did popularity grow to such a level that it contributed to a shortage.\n\nThe products contain powdered nicotine and when placed in a user's mouth along their upper gums it dissolves and enters the bloodstream.\n\nZyn, which is owned by tobacco giant Philip Morris, was originally created to help existing nicotine users kick their habit. But while Zyn doesn't contain harmful tobacco, it's still addictive: Zyn notes that the FDA requires it to have the warning: \"This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\"\n\nAs interest in the product exploded thanks to users on TikTok and other social media sites, younger people have been drawn to the products. Philip Morris previously told NPR that its research indicates the average age of Zyn users is 39 and that the company has not paid any so-called \"Zynfluencers\" to advertise their products online.\n\nContributing to the nationwide shortage last summer was a subpoena from Washington, D.C.'s attorney general to Philip Morris, alleging that its online sales violated the District's ban on flavored nicotine. The company suspended all online sales in response, and in December the attorney general said Zyn's makers will pay $1.2 million to resolve the investigation.\n\nThe FDA said it will continue monitoring the advertising and use of the products to ensure ads are specifically targeted to adults 21 and up.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the marketing of nicotine pouches for the first time, the agency announced on Thursday.\n\nThe marketing authorization covers 20 Zyn-branded nicotine pouch products. These items \u2014 which are tobacco free \u2014 are small synthetic fiber pouches containing nicotine that can be placed between a person\u2019s gum and lip.\n\nNicotine pouches have become popular in convenience stores as cigarette sales plunge, and the FDA\u2019s first marketing approval of these products sets the stage for continued growth.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSales of nicotine pouches grew 50% from 2022 to 2023, and were expected to surge by another 50% to 60% last year, according to data from Don Burke, who recently retired from his role as senior vice president of Management Science Associates. Sales of Zyn surged so much that production could not keep up with demand in 2023, resulting in supply shortages and leading Philip Morris International, owner of the brand, to invest in expanded production.\n\nBurke said in an interview last year that the \u201cmodern oral\u201d category \u2014 which includes nicotine pouches \u2014 could soon become one of the largest nicotine categories in retail if this growth continues. He called it an \u201cexciting opportunity\u201d for c-stores.\n\nWhen it came to Zyn\u2019s marketing approval, the FDA determined that these items met the public health standard required by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which considers the risks and benefits of products to the general population.\n\nAdditionally, the administration found that since Zyn\u2019s pouches contain significantly smaller amounts of harmful substances than cigarettes and other smokeless tobacco products, they pose a lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions.\n\n\u201cTo receive marketing authorizations, the FDA must have sufficient evidence that the new products offer greater benefits to population health than risks,\u201d Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the announcement. \u201cIn this case, the data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes and/or smokeless tobacco products and completely switch to these products.\u201d\n\nThe FDA emphasized that Zyn nicotine pouches must be marketed responsibly to prevent youth use. The administration also said Zyn\u2019s approval does not mean these products are necessarily safe.\n\n\u201cWhile current data show that youth use remains low, the FDA is closely monitoring the marketplace and is committed to taking action, as appropriate, to best protect public health,\u201d Brian King, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in the announcement.",

Company data also showed \u201ca substantial portion of adults\u201d who previously smoked switched completely to Zyn, regulators said. The pouches are sold in two different strengths.\n\n\u201cThe data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA has previously granted similar authorization to several brands of e-cigarettes, a tobacco-heating device, and snus, a type of pasteurized tobacco that is popular in Scandinavian counties. Unlike snus, Zyn and other nicotine pouches don\u2019t contain tobacco, only nicotine and flavoring.\n\nFor decades, tobacco companies have tried to develop alternative products to replace dwindling sales of cigarettes, as smoking levels in the U.S. and worldwide continue to fall. E-cigarettes became popular more than a decade ago, but faced a backlash after they triggered a multiyear spike in underage vaping.\n\nIn recent months, antismoking groups have warned that nicotine pouches could follow a similar path, pointing to videos of young people popping Zyn and other pouches that have racked up millions of views on social media platforms. Following Thursday\u2019s announcement, advocates quickly criticized the FDA for permitting sales of flavors like citrus, peppermint and wintergreen.\n\n\u201cThe FDA should not be authorizing the sale of any flavored tobacco products given the tobacco industry\u2019s well-documented history of using flavored products to appeal to and addict kids,\u201d said Yolonda Richardson, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a statement.\n\nThe FDA pointed to government survey data showing fewer than 2 percent of American high school and middle school students used nicotine pouches last year.\n\nSupporters of the pouches have noted that Zyn works the same way as nicotine gum, lozenges and other older smoking-cessation products: releasing low levels of nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings.\n\nDebate surrounding Zyn spilled over into politics last year, pitting Democrats and Republicans against each other in another skirmish in the nation\u2019s culture war.\n\nIn late January, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, called on regulators to investigate Zyn, citing its appeal to teens. Several House Republicans then warned constituents that \u201cBig Brother\u201d intended to \u201cban nicotine.\u201d Tucker Carlson and other conservative commentators are among the public figures who have embraced Zyn.\n\nPhilip Morris has stated it does not employ online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, which is marketed in the U.S. by its Swedish Match unit. The product competes with similar ones from competitors, including Altria\u2019s On pouches.",

Your boy's down like 30 pounds in a month. O-Zyn-pic. It works.\"\n\nThe pouches, resembling tiny tea bags, release nicotine into the bloodstream when placed between the lip and gum.

The FDA\u2019s authorization of all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed by Swedish Match in the U.S. is an important step to protect the public health by providing better alternatives to cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products for adults 21+.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 45 million Americans regularly consume nicotine and about 30 million of them smoke, the most harmful form of nicotine consumption,\u201d said Tom Hayes, president of Swedish Match North America, LLC. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s decision recognizes the role that ZYN can play in the protection of the public health by helping people switch from cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products.\u201d\n\nThe FDA authorized the following products:\n\nZYN Cool Mint 3 mg\n\nCool Mint 3 mg ZYN Cool Mint 6 mg\n\nCool Mint 6 mg ZYN Peppermint 3 mg\n\nPeppermint 3 mg ZYN Peppermint 6 mg\n\nPeppermint 6 mg ZYN Spearmint 3 mg\n\nSpearmint 3 mg ZYN Spearmint 6 mg\n\nSpearmint 6 mg ZYN Wintergreen 3 mg\n\nWintergreen 3 mg ZYN Wintergreen 6 mg\n\nWintergreen 6 mg ZYN Citrus 3 mg\n\nCitrus 3 mg ZYN Citrus 6 mg\n\nCitrus 6 mg ZYN Coffee 3 mg\n\nCoffee 3 mg ZYN Coffee 6 mg\n\nCoffee 6 mg ZYN Cinnamon 3 mg\n\nCinnamon 3 mg ZYN Cinnamon 6 mg\n\nCinnamon 6 mg ZYN Smooth 3 mg\n\nSmooth 3 mg ZYN Smooth 6 mg\n\nSmooth 6 mg ZYN Chill 3 mg\n\nChill 3 mg ZYN Chill 6 mg\n\nChill 6 mg ZYN Menthol 3 mg\n\nMenthol 3 mg ZYN Menthol 6 mg\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision can be found here.\n\nU.S. Marketing Practices Support 21+ Access Only\n\nSwedish Match N.A. LLC is a subsidiary of Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI). PMI\u2019s U.S. affiliates are committed to responsible marketing practices focused on limiting access to adults 21 years of age and older. PMI\u2019s U.S. affiliates do not use social media influencers in the U.S. or people under the age of 35 in marketing materials. They also employ independent age-verification systems like \u201cDouble Verify\u201d to direct digital advertising to those over 21, and owned digital platforms are age-gated at the point of access and restricted to current nicotine users of legal age. Swedish Match North America is a Manufacturer Advisory Council member of the We Card Program, a national nonprofit serving retailers of age-restricted products, and a founding board member and investor in TruAge\u00ae, a free retail technology that provides stores with a more accurate way of age verification, including the ability to detect fake IDs to ensure 21+ access only.\n\nPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future\n\nPMI (PMI) (NYSE: PM) is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company\u2019s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested over $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match \u2013 a leader in oral nicotine delivery \u2013 creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies\u2019 IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI\u2019s IQOS devices and consumables and Swedish Match\u2019s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. Renewal applications for these IQOS products are pending before the FDA. As of June 30, 2024, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 90 markets, and PMI estimates that 36.5 million adults around the world use PMI's smoke-free products. The smoke-free business accounted for approximately 38% of PMI\u2019s total first-nine months 2024 net revenues.

            "content": "For some people who smoke, vaping doesn\u2019t seem to work well as a replacement. It may simply be an experience too unlike smoking for them to get used to. After all, no vaping product actually tastes like burning tobacco. And with vaping, there is no defined beginning or end to the experience: smokers light a cigarette and then put it out a few minutes later, but with vaping it can just go on and on.\n\nTobacco companies have worked hard to come up with products that replicate smoking without causing all the harms of inhaling combusted tobacco, and they think they\u2019ve accomplished that with modern heated tobacco products (HTPs), which are also sometimes called heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco products.\n\nThe best-known of these is IQOS, which is sold in many countries by Philip Morris International (PMI). The device has been available since 2014, and has been successful in converting large numbers of smokers\u2014especially in Japan, where IQOS and other HTPs have contributed significantly to a huge decline in cigarette sales. According to PMI, millions of smokers around the world have switched completely from cigarette smoking to IQOS.\n\nOutside of the United States, PMI now sells a variety of IQOS-branded HTPs, including the IQOS ILUMA and BONDS BY IQOS, both of which use different tobacco stick refills than the original IQOS devices. In Europe, PMI has also used the IQOS brand name for other reduced-risk products, most notably beginner e-liquid pod vapes like VEEV. That no longer seems to be the case.\n\nFun fact: a lot of people believe that \u201cIQOS\u201d is an acronym for \u201cI Quit Ordinary Smoking.\u201d It\u2019s not. PMI says the name is a meaningless term, \u201ca brand name, created to denote an innovative product.\u201d",

According to an investigation by the independent outlet Proekt, Megapolis is also linked to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) \u2014- in particular to its former head, Nikolai Patrushev. The profits made by the owners of Megapolis are reportedly used to fund the lifestyles of current and former FSB employees. Nearly three years after Russia unleashed a full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the company also appears to be profiting from the tobacco market in Ukraine.\n\nMoscow\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine led to a mass exodus of Western firms from Russia. However, PMI and JTI continue to dominate the country\u2019s tobacco market, producing the majority of cigarettes consumed by Russians. The distribution of their products is handled by Megapolis, a company owned by billionaires Igor Kesaev and Sergei Katsiev. The two also play a major role in Russia\u2019s alcohol market, owning the retail chains Krasnoe & Beloe (lit. \u201cRed and White\u201d) and Bristol.\n\nIn 2013, PMI and JTI each acquired a 20% stake in Megapolis. However, in June 2024, the company was added to Russia\u2019s list of economically significant organizations. Due to wartime laws, Western corporations are now stripped of voting rights and cannot receive dividends from Megapolis.\n\nThe primary connection between the billionaires and the Patrushev family is Vladimir Anisimov, chairman of the board of the Degtyaryov Plant \u2014 a major Russian defense manufacturer \u2014 and vice president for security at the Mercury Group. Kesaev and Katsiev gained control of the Degtyaryov Plant in 2005, and Mercury has been under Kesaev\u2019s control since the early 1990s. It is through Mercury he began importing Western cigarettes into Russia.\n\nIn the late Soviet period, Anisimov served in the KGB in Karelia, where he was initially a driver and later an aide to Nikolai Patrushev \u2014 who in 1999 succeeded Vladimir Putin as the head of the FSB and remained in the post until 2008. After Patrushev moved to Moscow, Anisimov was appointed as his deputy, heading the FSB\u2019s internal security service.\n\nAnisimov and Kesaev have been linked since at least 2003, when both were honored with a prestigious award \u2014 the Order of St. Sergius of Radonezh \u2014 for their involvement in building a church in the village of Podomo, located in Russia\u2019s northern Arkhangelsk Region. The project was initiated by none other than Nikolai Patrushev, then head of the FSB. By 2009, Patrushev had become head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, and Anisimov was listed as a member of the leadership team in Kesaev\u2019s companies.Kesaev, along with his business partner Katsiev, has been a key financier of extrabudgetary expenses for FSB personnel. As far back as 2003, the Monolit Foundation was created to streamline this support. The foundation\u2019s vice president, Yuri Khalturin, was a former officer in the 3rd Directorate of FSB Military Counterintelligence and also part of Patrushev\u2019s church-building initiative.\n\nSince 2006, Monolit and Kesaev have jointly owned the Mikhail Frunze Sanatorium in Sochi \u2014 a popular retreat for FSB employees. Viktor Patrushev, Nikolai Patrushev\u2019s brother, served on the sanatorium\u2019s board of directors.\n\nIn 2007, Kesaev acquired 22 land plots \u2014 previously the site of an FSB-run departmental kindergarten \u2014 in the prestigious Rublyovka district west of Moscow. These plots were privatized by FSB employees, with Kesaev reportedly paying $50 million as part of the deal. This sum effectively provided an average of $2.5 million for each FSB general, paid out under the guise of regular transactions, while the recipients received a discount over the market rate for the land. Today, Kesaev\u2019s personal estate is located on this territory.\n\nKesaev is also connected to the family of Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev \u2014 Nikolai Patrushev\u2019s son. In 2014, the offices of the World Fashion TV channel moved into Kesaev\u2019s Mercury Tower in the Moscow City skyscraper district. The channel's director and co-owner was Marina Artemyeva, Dmitry Patrushev\u2019s de facto wife.\n\nIn exchange for financial contributions, the FSB has repeatedly aided Kesaev and Katsiev by using force to eliminate the entrepreneurs\u2019 competitors. For instance, in 2018, FSB agents raided Krasnoe & Beloe. The chain\u2019s then-owner had initially resisted merging with Kesaev and Katsiev\u2019s Bristol, but he eventually gave in under pressure from the state security organ.\n\nMegapolis continues to handle the distribution of tobacco products alongside other goods, including Red Bull energy drinks, Lavazza coffee, and Reckitt Benckiser items such as Durex and Contex condoms.\n\nIn 2013, Kesaev and Katsiev entered the Ukrainian market under the Megapolis-Ukraine brand. Within three years, they controlled nearly 99% of the country\u2019s tobacco market. In 2015, the Ukrainian branch of Megapolis was transferred to companies linked to British nationals Richard Fenhalls and Richard Taylor-Duxbury. Sources cited by Proekt claim that both men are acting as fronts for Kesaev and Katsiev.\n\n",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal health officials on Thursday backed the public health benefits of nicotine pouches, authorizing Philip Morris International\u2019s Zyn to help adult smokers cut back or quit cigarettes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration OK\u2019d 10 Zyn flavors, including coffee, mint and menthol. It\u2019s the first time regulators have authorized sales of nicotine pouches, which are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. tobacco market.\n\nThe pouches have been available for more than a decade as FDA reviewed company data intended to show the products can serve as an alternative to cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products. The decision doesn\u2019t mean that Zyn is safe, just less harmful than older alternatives.\n\nTo remain on the market, companies generally must show that their products will reduce disease among adult tobacco users without attracting teens and adolescents.\n\nFDA officials said Thursday that Zyn contains fewer harmful ingredients than cigarettes and various types of chewing tobacco, including snuff, which are linked to cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Company data also showed \u201ca substantial portion of adults\u201d who previously smoked switched completely to Zyn, regulators said. The pouches are sold in two different strengths.\n\n\u201cThe data show that these nicotine pouch products meet that bar by benefiting adults who use cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products,\u201d said Matthew Farrelly of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA has previously granted similar authorization to several brands of e-cigarettes, a tobacco-heating device, and snus, a type of pasteurized tobacco that is popular in Scandinavian counties. Unlike snus, Zyn and other nicotine pouches don\u2019t contain tobacco, only nicotine and flavoring.\n\nFor decades, tobacco companies have tried to develop alternative products to replace dwindling sales of cigarettes, as smoking levels in the U.S. and worldwide continue to fall. E-cigarettes became popular more than a decade ago, but faced a backlash after they triggered a multiyear spike in underage vaping.\n\nIn recent months, antismoking groups have warned that nicotine pouches could follow a similar path, pointing to videos of young people popping Zyn and other pouches that have racked up millions of views on social media platforms. Following Thursday\u2019s announcement, advocates quickly criticized the FDA for permitting sales of flavors like citrus, peppermint and wintergreen.\n\n\u201cThe FDA should not be authorizing the sale of any flavored tobacco products given the tobacco industry\u2019s well-documented history of using flavored products to appeal to and addict kids,\u201d said Yolonda Richardson, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, in a statement.\n\nThe FDA pointed to government survey data showing fewer than 2 percent of American high school and middle school students used nicotine pouches last year.\n\nSupporters of the pouches have noted that Zyn works the same way as nicotine gum, lozenges and other older smoking-cessation products: releasing low levels of nicotine that are absorbed into the gums, reducing cravings.\n\nDebate surrounding Zyn spilled over into politics last year, pitting Democrats and Republicans against each other in another skirmish in the nation\u2019s culture war.\n\nIn late January, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, called on regulators to investigate Zyn, citing its appeal to teens. Several House Republicans then warned constituents that \u201cBig Brother\u201d intended to \u201cban nicotine.\u201d Tucker Carlson and other conservative commentators are among the public figures who have embraced Zyn.\n\nPhilip Morris has stated it does not employ online influencers or endorsements to promote Zyn, which is marketed in the U.S. by its Swedish Match unit. The product competes with similar ones from competitors, including Altria\u2019s On pouches.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "content": "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.\n\nThe rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.\n\n\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the proposed rule.\n\nThough vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.\n\nIt will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"\n\n\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nA related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.\n\nThe FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.\n\nAgency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.\n\n\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nTobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.\n\nWhy didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?\n\nProgress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.\n\n\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.\n\nThe FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.\n\nZeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.\n\n\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.\n\nUnder President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.\n\n\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.\n\nCaliff defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"\n\n\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.\n\nHow can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?\n\nZeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.\n\n\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.\n\nThe Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.\n\nA major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015 that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.\n\n\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.\n\nOther companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.\n\nWhile feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.\n\nIf successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes far less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.\n\nThe proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.\n\nREAD MORE: FDA authorizes first menthol-flavored e-cigarettes for adults\n\nTrump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government\u2019s approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.\n\nThe FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that cutting nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.\n\n\u201cThis action, if finalized, could save many lives and dramatically reduce the burden of severe illness and disability,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters Wednesday.\n\nUnder the agency\u2019s plan, nicotine in cigarettes would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d Companies would have two years to reformulate their products after the publication of a final regulation. The agency posted its 334-page proposal online Wednesday morning and said will take public comments for nine months before taking any further steps.\n\nAntismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.\n\n\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments.\n\nSmoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. officials confiscate over 1.4 million illegal e-cigarettes from overseas manufacturers, including the maker of Elf Bars\n\nThe idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.\n\nCaliff said the expectation of industry lawsuits explains the slow, deliberative pace of FDA\u2019s work on the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we\u2019ll get in court,\u201d Califf said.\n\nUnder the law, the agency can regulate nicotine but cannot remove it completely. The limits on nicotine proposed Wednesday would apply to cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco, but not electronic cigarettes, nicotine pouches or other lower-risk products. While many e-cigarettes have not undergone extensive testing, the FDA has endorsed several major brands, including NJOY and Vuse, as less harmful alternatives for smokers.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that about 50% of smokers will transition to these other products, whether that\u2019s e-cigarettes or other noncombustibles,\u201d FDA\u2019s tobacco director Brian King told reporters.\n\nCurrently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.\n\nThe latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low, with 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.\n\nLow-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The highest index of the day remained at 115,044.79 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 113,836.61 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp, said, \u201cStocks closed bullish led by blue scrips in the earning season rally at the PSX on strong valuations.\u201d He said that easing political noise, higher global crude oil prices and speculations over SBP policy announcements played a catalyst role in the bullish close at the PSX.\n\nThe KSE-30 index increased by 118.33 points or 0.33 per cent to 36,102.28 points against 35,983.94 points.

Of the 463 companies active in the session, 269 closed in green, 137 in red, and 57 remained unchanged.\n\nAnalyst Naveed Nadeem at Topline Securities said the PSX witnessed a robust trading session, with the KSE-100 index reaching an intraday high of 815 points before closing at 114,804, up by 574 points or 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe pharmaceutical sector saw strong performance, with BFBIO maintaining its upward momentum and hitting its upper circuit. EngroH weighed heavily on the index, contributing a loss of 145 points.\n\nKey drivers of the positive market movement included UBL, MARI, SYS, ATRL and PSO, collectively adding 486 points to the index. Investors remained optimistic, buoyed by strong performances in multiple sectors, further solidifying the market\u2019s upward trend.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Hallmark Company Limited, which rose by Rs84.54 to Rs950.05 per share, followed by Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited, which increased by Rs70.90 to Rs789.76 per share. A significant decline was noted in Nestle Pakistan Limited, which fell by Rs58.04 to Rs7,435.93 per share; Pakistan Engineering Company Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs56.55 to Rs600.01 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said that the PSX saw further gains on Tuesday as the KSE-100 index reached the 115,000 level, reflecting a strong continuation of this week\u2019s recovery. The recovery appears to be gaining momentum, with solid support at the 112,000 level strengthening market confidence. The index\u2019s early achievement of 115,000 has set the stage for a potential move towards the upper end of the trading range later this week.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains positive as market participants look to capitalise on the ongoing recovery.

Those contributions continue a tradition of big businesses helping to finance presidential inaugurals. But what makes the fundraising different this time is that a number of the corporate backers had condemned the attack by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol four years ago.\n\n\u201cMany do feel if they can hitch their wagon, they are going to benefit,\u201d said Gary Rose, a professor of politics at Sacred Heart University. \u201cThat\u2019s really what it's about and what it always has been about \u2014 to ingratiate themselves with the incoming administration.\u201d\n\nSupport from some big Connecticut companies\n\nStamford-based tobacco producer Philip Morris International is one of the companies that has acknowledged it is contributing to the inauguration because it wants to build relationships with the new Trump administration.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cPMI\u2019s U.S. affiliates expect to contribute to each presidential inauguration and this year will give $500,000,\u201d the company said in a written statement. \u201cAs we ramp up our employee base and manufacturing footprint in the U.S., we believe actively participating in the democratic process and recognizing changes in administration are important. These activities provide the opportunity to familiarize incoming teams with our mission and business. Our group also will contribute to the American Legion Salute to Heroes inaugural event that recognizes Medal of Honor recipients.\u201d\n\nWhile PMI\u2019s statement indicates that it routinely gives to inaugurations, Federal Election Commission records do not show any contributions in the company\u2019s name to Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration or President Joe Biden\u2019s inaugural in 2021. A follow-up inquiry to the company about its contributions to previous inaugurations was not returned.\n\nStamford-based Charter Communications, the provider of Spectrum-brand phone, cable and internet services, confirmed that it is contributing $1 million. It declined to comment on its reasons for giving. Charter contributed $250,000 to the 2017 inauguration and $500,000 to the 2021 inaugural, according to FEC records.\n\nA number of other companies, including New Britain-based toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker, are also contributing $1 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Stanley contributed $25,000 to the 2017 inaugural, according to FEC data. Messages left for Stanley were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMore than $170 million has been raised for this year\u2019s inauguration, The Associated Press reported last week, citing an unnamed source familiar with the fundraising. The person said Trump\u2019s inaugural committee is expected to eventually raise more than $200 million, which would shatter the previous inaugural fundraising record of $107 million that Trump set in 2017 and nearly triple the $62 million raised by Biden in 2021.\n\nCT Insider also reached out to the other Connecticut-based companies that are members of the S&P 500 index to inquire whether they were contributing to this year\u2019s inauguration. None of them responded. Those firms are Cigna, Travelers, The Hartford, Booking Holdings, Synchrony, Otis Worldwide, Amphenol, United Rentals, W.R. Berkley, Gartner and Hubbell.\n\nThe only one of those companies that contributed to the 2017 or 2021 inaugurations was Travelers, according to FEC records. The Hartford-based property-and-casualty insurer made a $100,000 contribution to the 2017 inaugural.\n\nFor many years, corporations have made up a large share of donors to inaugurations. Barack Obama refused corporate donations for his 2009 inauguration, but he dropped that opposition for his inaugural in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nContributions from businesses and individuals support events planned by the presidential inaugural committee, which is appointed by the president-elect. Those events include opening ceremonies, galas, balls and a parade. A federally funded congressional committee plans and finances inaugural events held at the U.S. Capitol, including the swearing-in ceremony and a congressional luncheon for the president and vice president.\n\nThose who have given $1 million or raised $2 million for this year's inauguration were supposed to be entitled to six tickets each to six inaugural events, including the swearing-in ceremony and a \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d on Sunday with Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, The New York Times reported last week.\n\nA message left for the inaugural committee for Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance was not returned.\n\nConnecticut Republican State Chairman Ben Proto, who plans to attend Trump's swearing-in and one of the inaugural balls, said that he was not tracking which companies contributed to the inauguration.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cIt happens every four years, and companies and businesses are engaged in it every four years,\u201d Proto said.\n\nChanging views in corporate America\n\nWhile corporations have helped to pay for inaugurations for many years, some of the companies contributing this year face greater scrutiny because their leaders were among those who expressed outrage about the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe condemn the disturbing and horrifying storming of the U.S. Capitol,\u201d Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s then-CEO, James Loree, was quoted as saying in a post on Jan. 8, 2021, on the website of the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cWith President-elect Joe Biden rightfully certified as the 46th POTUS, we call on all Americans to persevere and move forward with a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\n\nThe association post links to a page on Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s website that apparently contained Loree\u2019s full statement, but a message on the page says the link is broken.\n\nA number of other large companies that showed disapproval of the Jan. 6 attack have subsequently sought to repair their relationships with Trump and other Republicans. Amazon, which is one of the largest employers in Connecticut, is contributing $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. The e-commerce giant had suspended contributions to the Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. But the company made contributions to several of those legislators in September 2022, Popular Information reported.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile some companies\u2019 willingness to move past Jan. 6 could anger some customers, it is not a shocking reversal given that corporations are prone to changing their positions on political and social issues. In 2020, many companies committed to new diversity, equity and inclusion programs, in response to nationwide protests sparked by the killings that year of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. But a number of companies have recently cast aside or scaled back their DEI programs, a shift accelerated by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturn in 2023 of affirmative action in college admissions.",

            "content": "In 2023, US and EU companies paid approximately $3.5 billion in taxes on profits in Russia, bolstering the Kremlin\u2019s finances despite international calls for businesses to exit following Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Financial Times reported.\n\nAccording to estimates by campaign group B4Ukraine and the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, businesses based in G7 and EU nations accounted for 17 of the top 20 contributors to Russian corporate profit tax last year. While hundreds of multinational corporations have left or scaled back operations in Russia since the invasion, nearly 2,000 companies continued to operate, collectively paying $21.6 billion in various taxes, including value-added, payroll, and exit taxes.\n\nSince the invasion, these companies have paid an estimated $41.6 billion in taxes\u2014equivalent to about 10% of Russia\u2019s projected government expenditure in 2025. This revenue supports a record $133.6 billion defense budget earmarked by Russia\u2019s finance ministry.\n\nUS companies led foreign contributions, with Philip Morris International, PepsiCo, Mars, Procter & Gamble, and Mondelez paying a total of $1.2 billion in corporate taxes. Mondelez\u2019s chief executive previously told the Financial Times that shareholders had not pressured the company to exit Russia, with some investors reportedly indifferent to the moral implications.\n\nGerman firms were the second-largest contributors, paying $693 million, including $42.3 million from Adidas, which suspended operations in Russia after the invasion. Austrian companies followed, contributing $579 million, with Vienna-based Raiffeisen Bank International accounting for over 80% of the total. The bank, under pressure from the European Central Bank, has been reducing its Russian operations and loan portfolio while seeking to deconsolidate its Russian subsidiary.\n\nThe Kremlin has imposed strict exit taxes and discounted asset sale requirements for businesses from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, complicating withdrawal efforts. According to economist Vasily Astrov of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, companies that delayed their exit are now facing significant financial and operational hurdles.\n\nB4Ukraine\u2019s Nataliya Popovych criticized the companies for prioritizing short-term gains, noting they now face rising taxes, military support demands, and risks of asset expropriation. She described them as \u201chostages to their own greed.\u201d",

            "content": "Nigel Farage and Liz Truss were spotted attending the launch of the UK branch of a Donald Trump-backed think tank that has been leading the charge in denying climate change.\n\nJames Taylor, president of The Hartland Institute, describes the organisation as a \u201cfree-market think tank known globally as the world\u2019s most prominent think tank supporting scepticism about man-made climate change\u201d.\n\nThe US-based lobby group \u2013 which is one of the organisations involved in the Project 2025 agenda for a second Donald Trump term \u2013 has made extreme statements sceptical of climate change. The think tank launched its UK-EU branch in December, aiming to leverage \u201cscience-based work pushing back at climate alarmism and schemes such as Net Zero from London\u201d.\n\nMr Farage, who was the guest of honour at the launch, was joined by former prime minister Ms Truss and Tory shadow trade minister Andrew Griffith.\n\nHere, The Independent takes a look at the controversial group.\n\nThe Heartland Institute and Tobacco Lobbying\n\nThe institute was founded in 1984 by Chicago investor David H. Padden.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Heartland Institute worked with the tobacco company Philip Morris to question the science linking second-hand smoke to health risks, and lobbied against government public health reforms. Philip Morris commissioned Heartland to write and distribute reports.\n\nA former president of the group, Joe Bast, once claimed that \u201cmoderate\u201d smoking doesn\u2019t raise lung cancer risks, and that there were \u201cfew, if any, adverse health effects\u201d associated with smoking.\n\nClimate Change Denial\n\nThe Heartland Institute rejects the prevailing scientific consensus on climate change. The group promotes false claims that climate change is not potentially catastrophic to the world and it could actually be \u2018beneficial\u2019.\n\nIt has also incorrectly claimed that heatwaves and temperatures in the US are not increasing as a result of climate change.\n\nAuthor Naomi Klein wrote in her book This Changes Everything that staff at the Institute \u201crecognize that climate change is a profound threat to our economic and social systems and therefore deny its scientific reality.\u201d\n\nNaomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway wrote in their 2010 book Merchants of Doubt that the institute was known \"for its persistent questioning of climate science, for its promotion of 'experts' who have done little, if any, peer-reviewed climate research, and for its sponsorship of a conference in New York City in 2008 alleging that the scientific community's work on global warming is fake.\"\n\nFormer prime minister Liz Truss with James Taylor, the president of the Heartland Institute (The Heartland Institute)\n\nComparing advocates of human-made global warming to terrorists\n\nHeartland began an advertising campaign in 2012 which featured a photo of the Unabomber, a US terrorist who killed three people and injured others. The picture was accompanied by text, which read: \u201cI still believe in global warming, do you?\u201d The group withdrew the billboards a day later.\n\nThe institute planned for the campaign to feature murderer Charles Manson, communist leader Fidel Castro and the founder of al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe group justified the billboards at the time, saying: \u201cThe most prominent advocates of global warming aren\u2019t scientists. They are murderers, tyrants, and madmen.\u201d\n\nLinks to Nigel Farage and Reform UK\n\nMr Farage was the \u201cguest of honour\u201d at the launch of the Heartland Institute\u2019s UK/European branch in December.\n\nIn a statement at the time of the launch, Heartland president James Taylor said: \u201cDuring recent years, a growing number of policymakers in the UK and continental Europe have requested Heartland establish a satellite office to provide resources to conservative policymakers throughout Europe.\n\n\u201cWith our UK and European launch, we aim to fulfill this requested impact throughout Europe.\u201d\n\nLois Perry, Executive Director of Heartland UK/Europe, addresses those gathered in London for the launch party. (The Heartland Institute)\n\nReform UK has called for the UK\u2019s 2050 net zero emissions target to be scrapped.\n\nHeartland\u2019s European branch will be run by Lois Perry, a climate science denier who has said it\u2019s her \u201cpersonal belief\u201d that climate change \u201cis happening\u201d but \u201cis not man-made\u201d. Ms Perry is the former leader of Ukip \u2013 though she stood down after just 34 days.\n\nMs Perry also formerly ran the anti-net zero pressure group CAR26, which has claimed that carbon dioxide is \u201cessential to all life\u201d and that its \u201cwelcome growth has greened our planet saving countless human and other lives\u201d.\n\nIn July last year, Mr Farage said in an interview with Jordan Peterson: \u201cI do find it extraordinary that people call carbon dioxide a pollutant, because as I understand it, plants don\u2019t grow without carbon dioxide.\u201d",

Murphy salutes Morris man who exposed farm tax break abuses Gov. Phil Murphy's 2025 State of the State address on Tuesday included a call to curb abuses in the state's farmland assessment tax deduction.\n\nJack Curtis has been to Trenton before during his multiyear mission to expose thousands of \"fake farmers\" who claim big tax breaks on their properties with little or no genuine farming involved.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Mendham Township man was back in the state capital as a guest of honor, finally seeing his long campaign gaining traction. Curtis was invited by Gov. Phil Murphy to sit in the Statehouse gallery during the Democrat's 2025 State of the State address. He received a shoutout and a round of applause as Murphy endorsed bipartisan legislation to reform the farmland assessment program, whose abuses were detailed in a NorthJersey.com investigation last summer.\n\n\"I invited Jack to join us today to thank him,\" Murphy told the packed audience. \"He has raised our attention to a flaw in New Jersey's farmland assessment tax system that allows the wealthiest among us to avoid paying their fair share. That's wrong. If our state's law-enforcement officers, veterans, nurses and other working people are paying their fair share, so, too, should those at the top of our economic ladder.\"\n\nMurphy threw his weight behind legislation sponsored by two Morris County Republicans, Sen. Joe Pennacchio and Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, that would create a commission to reform the system.\n\n\"Jack, stand up and take a bow,\" the governor added. \"Your wife, Mary, is with us. Mary, you've got to stand up and take a bow. Let's go.\"\n\nHe called on lawmakers \"to eliminate this flaw once and for all.\"\n\n\"I thought I was just there as a guest that would just be in a position to listen to the speech,\" Curtis, 78, a former Dover alderman and Roxbury school principal, said in an interview after the address. \"I didn't have any idea he was going to speak about me.\"\n\nNJ Farmland Assessment Act co-opted?\n\nCurtis has spent much of his retirement researching what he sees as abuses of New Jersey's Farmland Assessment Act of 1964. The law was crafted to help farms that were being squeezed out of business as demand for suburban housing drove up land values \u2014 and the taxes that went with them.\n\nBut critics complain that the act has been co-opted over the years by well-off property owners who can claim a small amount of their estates as farmland, with little documentation, to lower their taxes. Statewide, about 35,000 landowners currently enroll some part of their properties in the program, which can discount a real estate tax bill by up to 98%.\n\nWhen the act passed six decades ago, the state required that farmers produce at least $500 a year in revenue to qualify, whether through sales of produce, firewood or other products or the value of livestock kept on site. That minimum would equate to about $5,000 in today's dollars, but when legislators raised the threshold in 2013, it was increased only to $1,000.\n\n\"Now, this topic may seem obscure, but it matters,\" Murphy said during Tuesday's address. \"It shows we are listening when the people of New Jersey speak up. And at the end of the day, taking this step will ensure our tax system is stronger and fairer for everyone.\"\n\nStory continues after gallery.\n\nPennacchio's bill to establish a nine-member Farmland Assessment Review Commission, S3446, was unanimously advanced by the Senate's Economic Growth Committee last month. Dunn's companion legislation has not yet received a vote in the Assembly.\n\nCurtis discovered that in 1964, Mendham Township had only about 20 farmland-assessed properties. Today, the wealthy residential community \u2014 where median home values hit $1.01 million in 2022 \u2014 has more than 150. By his math, that adds up to $1.1 million in property tax breaks in the Morris County town that must be paid by other residents to balance the municipal budget.\n\n\"This law has morphed into a scam that wealthy people, with large tracts of land, have adopted as their own personal tax-reduction scheme,\" Curtis said.\n\nHe caught up with Murphy last spring, raising the issue during the weekly \"Ask the Governor\" radio show. That led to an invitation to meet with the governor in Trenton in April for further discussion. After meeting with Murphy, Curtis engaged bipartisan support on his own from Pennacchio and his Senate co-sponsor, Morris Republican Sen. Anthony Bucco.\n\n\"The size of that program is a red flag,\" Pennacchio said. \"I'm not against it. But what I don't want is people gaming the system, forcing other people to pay more tax, which is what is driving people out of this state.\"\n\nTrump, Jets owner get farm tax breaks\n\nComplaints about alleged abuses have been around almost as long as the program itself. In her 1993 race for governor, Christie Whitman faced criticism for farm assessments on two family properties in Central Jersey, though she won the election anyway.\n\nJohnson & Johnson heir and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and family members of the Forbes publishing empire also get farmland preservation tax breaks on their residential properties.\n\nAnd in Bedminster, President-elect Donald Trump enjoys a $257,000 annual farm tax break for a portion of his exclusive Trump National Golf Club, which frequently serves as his summer residence.\n\nMore: In NJ, tiny farms 'gaming the system' can earn big tax breaks for wealthy estates\n\nMurphy caught up with Curtis again on Tuesday. The Mendham Township man said he and his wife received VIP treatment in Trenton. A Murphy staffer led the couple and other invited guests to where they needed to be, including a pre-speech meeting with the governor in his office.\n\n\"They couldn't have been nicer,\" Curtis said.\n\n\"I'm just a regular citizen,\" Curtis said. \"He didn't have to meet with me, or push this; he didn't have to do any of it. My wife told him he should have run for president. I told her she was about six months late with that suggestion.\"\n\n\"The important thing is this is something you can do in a democracy that you can't do in other kinds of governments,\" Curtis continued. \"If you don't agree with something that is going on, make an effort to change it.\"",

KNISKERN, SR./DG\n\nALBANY \u2014 Maggie Mancinelli-Cahill, the guiding force of Capital Repertory Theatre since being named its artistic director in spring 1995 and its indefatigable champion through times both heady and perilous, will leave the company at the end of this year.\n\nMulled by Mancinelli-Cahill since her 25th anniversary and rumored in the local theater world for almost a year, the announcement Tuesday comes a few weeks before she goes into rehearsals for \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy,\u201d The Rep\u2019s spring production. It will be her penultimate directing job while also head of the company. Her last as both artistic director and stage director, a double duty she at that point will have done 66 times before at The Rep, will be this summer\u2019s musical, \u201cOnce.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nShe delayed the announcement until now after originally considering making it public at the start of the 2024-25 season last fall. \u201cFundraising always takes a dip after a change in artistic leadership is announced, and I didn\u2019t want to do that to the end of the\u201d 2024 annual campaign, she said in an interview last week, by way of explaining the decision to hold the news until the new year. \u201cI wanted it to end on a high note.\u201d\n\nThe Rep\u2019s board is working on a succession plan and will make an announcement later this winter, said Philip Morris, CEO of Schenectady-based Proctors Collaborative, the parent organization of The Rep. Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s public visibility will be reduced after \u201cOnce,\u201d but she will work with her successor on the transition for the latter half of the year, remaining on payroll until the end of 2025, she and Morris said.\n\nThe Rep formed an administrative alliance with Proctors in 2011 to shore up years of annual deficits and came fully under the wing of Proctors, the region\u2019s largest arts organization, a few years later. The financially stabilizing arrangement positioned The Rep, after four decades in a leased former supermarket space under a downtown parking garage, to finally create a theater of its own. The result of a nearly $15 million makeover of a former bakery and later warehouse at 251 N. Pearl St., the theater opened four years ago after pandemic-related delays.\n\nThe theater is a physical monument to Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s tenure, Morris said, and the art created there \u2014 including what those involved hope will be future productions directed by Mancinelli-Cahill on an emeritus basis \u2014 will further burnish an impressive artistic legacy. In brief, it encompasses 16 world premieres shepherded by Mancinelli-Cahill, a touring schools program that brings shows to up to 20,000 students annually, co-writer or adapter of nine works and decades of contributing to the careers of young theater artists who would progress to acclaim in national theater, London\u2019s West End and on and off-Broadway.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cMaggie\u2019s aim was to always bring work with a high level of professionalism, good stories and emotional intelligence to Albany \u2014 and she did, for 30 years. For a city of its size to have theater of that quality is really impressive,\u201d said Gordon Greenberg.\n\nGreenberg, who first worked at The Rep as an actor under Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s predecessor, company founder Bruce Bouchard, in 1992, had two of his original musicals, \u201cBreaking Up Is Hard to Do\u201d and \u201cSingle Girls Guide,\u201d chosen by Mancinelli-Cahill to receive world premieres at The Rep. He went on to direct the 2016 Broadway adaptation of the Irving Berlin film \u201cHoliday Inn\u201d and \u201cThe Heart of Rock and Roll\u201d on Broadway last year, and his 2023 West End revival of \u201cGuys and Dolls'' was nominated for six Olivier Awards, the British version of the Tonys.\n\nAnd yet Greenberg, who later this year will direct the Michael Frayn farce \u201cNoises Off\u201d at The Old Globe in San Diego, always returned to The Rep, for a total of 14 productions as writer and/or director, from \u201cSong of Singapore\u201d in 2002 to 2022\u2019s \u201cDracula, A Comedy of Terrors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Maggie there, (The Rep) has always felt like a happy place, a place for art and creation and safety and honesty,\u201d said Greenberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a place people want to keep coming back to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nOver the decades, Mancinelli-Cahill built a stable of actors, directors, designers and other theater artists who became familiar to audiences, a trend more pronounced in the past dozen-plus years. In addition to Greenberg, they include but are not limited to Yvonne Perry, with 12 productions as an actor, four as intimacy coordinator and two as assistant director; Kevin McGuire, a Hoosick Falls native who was on Broadway and Broadway tours for 25 years, returns next month for \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy,\u201d at least his ninth production at The Rep; and many others, including Brenny Campbell (most often as Brenny Rabine), David Girard, Wynn Harmon, Taylor Hilt Mitchell, Shannon Rafferty, Eileen Schuyler and Oliver Wadsworth.\n\nTwo more recent discoveries, Jovan Davis and Kyle Garvin, so quickly became part of The Rep\u2019s fold that each appeared in three productions in less than 18 months during 2023 and last year, including together in Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s comedic romp through \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d\n\nInvolved in virtually every casting decision for nearly all productions by The Rep for Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s entire 30-year tenure has been Stephanie Klapper, a casting director with her own Manhattan firm, who first started sending actors upstate when Bouchard ran the company.\n\nCalling her professional relationship with Mancinelli-Cahill unique in her career for its closeness and duration, Klapper said, \u201cMaggie\u2019s success (in casting) has a lot to do with her sensibility to look at not just the actor and the role but whether this person is right for (The Rep), whether they will thrive in regional theater.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201c\u2018Repertory\u2019 was in the name for a long time, but there wasn\u2019t a repertory company of actors until Maggie built one,\u201d said Perry, a Voorheesville native who was on the soap opera \u201cAs the World Turns\u201d for five years in the mid-1990s. She said she spent seven years trying to get cast at The Rep before Mancinelli-Cahill chose her for the drama \u201cIntimate Apparel\u201d in 2006. Perry acted in \u201cA Sherlock Carol\u201d last fall and will be assistant director for Mancinelli-Cahill on \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re always in shows there,\u2019\u201d Perry said. \u201cI tell them they don\u2019t know the legwork that went into getting to that point.\u201d Collaborating so closely and often with Mancinelli-Cahill proved transformative for Perry as a theater artist, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that Maggie is the best director I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d said Perry. \u201cIt\u2019s that I learn so much from being in the rehearsal room with her: about time management, about personality management, about keeping so many balls in the air at once while she\u2019s directing a show and running the company. I don\u2019t think she gets nearly the credit she deserves for everything she\u2019s responsible for.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody else could have done what Maggie did over the years,\u201d said Joel Hodes, an Albany attorney who was president of the board of The Rep when it hired Mancinelli-Cahill as Bouchard\u2019s successor as artistic director in April 1995. (Bouchard and his co-founder, Peter Clough, both announced their resignations that spring after 14 seasons.)\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nMancinelli-Cahill faced severe financial threats right from her start at The Rep, when she willingly jumped into a million-dollar financial crater. While she was achieving artistic successes like the world premiere of William Kennedy\u2019s play \u201cGrand View\u201d at the end of her first season, she at times faced company bank balances insufficient to cover salaries.\n\n\u201cI remember Maggie calling me on a number of occasions and saying she wasn\u2019t going to be able to make payroll that week,\u201d said Hodes.\n\nMancinelli-Cahill confirmed this, saying, \u201cThere were multiple times in those first two years that I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d still be in business the following week.\u201d\n\nHodes said he and other board members repeatedly gave The Rep short-term loans, some with the understanding that they would not have to be repaid.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cWe did it because we had the confidence that she could do what she said was going to do to turn (The Rep) around,\u201d Hodes said.\n\nThe company still runs a deficit in the low six figures every season, according to Morris, but it is accounted for in the annual budget, and 2024 was The Rep\u2019s highest-grossing year at the box office in its history, Morris said.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Maggie is that she\u2019s fearless in going after what she wants: as a director, as an artistic director, for a production, for the company, for that gorgeous new building,\u201d said McGuire, who said he bonded quickly with Mancinelli-Cahill after she cast him as Don Quixote in \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d in 2011.\n\n\u201cI think part of it was that we both had run companies,\u201d said McGuire, who was artistic director of the former Theatre Company at Hubbard Hall in Cambridge for a decade. \u201cWe spoke the same language. You don\u2019t always get that with actors and directors.\u201d Based in New York City, McGuire spends time every year teaching theater in Brazil and is regularly in the Capital Region, as a cast member at The Rep and as artistic program director of Proctors\u2019 Collaborative School of the the Arts, for which he directs the High School Musical Theatre Awards performance every spring and the school\u2019s summer musical.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nCiting Mancinelli-Cahill\u2019s many simultaneous roles in the past \u2014 including functioning as The Rep\u2019s de-facto CEO, CFO, governmental-affairs liaison and lead fundraiser \u2014 McGuire said, \u201cIt\u2019s been good to see how she was able to delegate more\u201d in recent years. \u201cShe deserves that.\u201d\n\nAs a law student in Albany more than 30 years ago, Kathy Sheehan couldn\u2019t afford tickets to the city\u2019s only Equity-level professional theater. After graduating from law school and beginning a corporate career that eventually would lead her to become a three-term mayor of Albany, Sheehan and her husband, Bob, bought season subscriptions, in part because of Mancinelli-Cahill.\n\n\u201cI thought Maggie was a rock star,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cI really admired her as a role model, as a strong woman in a leadership position.\u201d\n\nHer admiration grew when, as a board member at Proctors 15 years ago, Sheehan was part of a committee tasked with assessing the financial ramifications of the proposed affiliation between the two organizations.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cBeing exposed on a deeper level to everything (Mancinelli-Cahill had) done and what more she wanted to do was so impressive,\u201d Sheehan said. She and her husband believed in The Rep enough to donate financially; Proctors does not release individual giving amounts, but Morris said the Sheehans are among the top 30 individual donors to The Rep.\n\n\u201cI look at it from a personal level, from the economic-development perspective and for community pride,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s been so important to be able to have incredible professional theater in the city of Albany, and Maggie\u2019s been such a valuable part of that.\u201d\n\nMancinelli-Cahill said she plans to remain in the area. She is stepping down from The Rep, but she is not retiring. She would like to teach directing. She would like to direct \u2014 nationally, elsewhere regionally, hopefully at some point back at 251 North Pearl.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

Inflation-weary drinkers have simultaneously dialed back their spending on pricey liquors, putting premium spirits makers like Brown-Forman in financial peril.\n\nBrown-Forman said the job cuts, which amount to nearly 700 people, will \u201cenhance operational efficiency and agility.\u201d It\u2019s laying off 200 people by closing a Louisville cooperage, where wooden barrels are produced to age whiskey and bourbon.\n\nClosing the cooperage and the layoffs will save between $70 and $80 million in annualized cost savings, according to Brown-Forman. A portion of that is \u201cexpected to be reinvested to accelerate growth,\u201d the company said in a statement. Barrels will be sourced from an external supplier at a \u201ccompetitive price,\u201d the company added.\n\n\u201cI want to express my sincere gratitude to our employees, particularly those impacted by these changes, for their dedication and contributions to Brown\u2011Forman,\u201d said CEO Lawson Whiting.\n\nThe announcement comes a few weeks after the US Surgeon General issued a warning that alcohol consumption can increase the risk of cancer and called for an updated health warning label on alcoholic beverages.\n\nFollowing a pandemic peak in 2020 through 2022, spirit companies have been contending with slowing sales. Brown-Forman first sounded the alarm in 2023 when it reported whiskey sales were falling \u2014 a stark contrast compared to a year prior when they were soaring by double-digit percentage points.\n\nBrown-Forman\u2019s (BF.B) shares have lost more than 30% of their value over the past year. The company has a diverse portfolio of liquor, owning Herradura tequila, The Glendronach scotch whisky, Diplom\u00e1tico Rum and Fords Gin among others. It also produces a canned cocktail with Coca-Cola.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

Born in Suffolk, VA on May 5, 1947, he was the son of the late John Lewis Hall and Hazel Rosetta Jones Hall.\n\nJohnny grew up in Ivor, VA, and graduated from Southampton High School. He then earned his associate degree from Richard Bland College. He was a member of The Heights Baptist Church in Colonial Heights, VA and Butterwood Methodist Church in Blackstone, VA.\n\nJohnny\u2019s passion for music began in 1962 at just 14 years old, when he played his first dance aboard a ferry crossing Virginia\u2019s historic James River. With an armful of records and a new stereo player, he sparked a lifelong love for entertaining. Over the decades, Johnny became a cherished figure in the Beach Music community, spinning tunes for shag and bop clubs from Virginia to Florida and serving as the house DJ for Petersburg\u2019s iconic \u201cThursday in Old Town\u201d event. He was an esteemed member of the SOS DJ team at Fat Harold\u2019s Beach Club and a dedicated leader in the National Association of Rhythm & Blues Dee Jays, where he served as Treasurer and Vice President. The last thing he did in his radio career was his daily afternoon radio internet show, \u201cJukin\u2019 Oldies\u201d in which he was very passionate about.\n\nJohnny\u2019s life was equally marked by service and dedication. A veteran of the U.S. Army and the Virginia Army National Guard, he retired as a Major after 25 years, earning the Bronze Star for his distinguished service.

However, a significant number have stayed. According to the Yale School of Management\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), 123 major US companies continue operations in Russia to varying extents.\n\nThe KSE, which includes mid-size and smaller firms in its analysis, estimates that approximately 328 US companies are still active in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to new research, the top 10 US companies that paid the most profit taxes to Russia in 2023 were:\n\nPhilip Morris International (Tobacco) - $220 million\n\nPepsiCo (Beverage) - $135 million\n\nMars (Confectionary) - $99 million\n\nProcter & Gamble (Health and hygiene goods) - $67 million\n\nMondelez (Confectionary) - $62 million\n\nCitigroup (Investment banking) - $53 million\n\nCargill (Agriculture) - $50 million\n\nJohnson & Johnson (Pharmaceuticals) - $42 million\n\nCoca-Cola Hellenic (Soft-drink bottling) - $34 million\n\nWeatherford (Oilfield services) - $32 million\n\nDespite scaling back operations, these companies continued essential business activities, citing challenges in exiting Russia.\n\nPhilip Morris International suspended planned investments and scaled back its manufacturing operations after Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In February 2023, CEO Jacek Olzak told the Financial Times that the company refused to sell its Russian business on the Kremlin\u2019s terms though, as it would result in significant financial losses.\n\nMondelez, on the other hand, has remained in Russia, saying that investors were not \u201cmorally concerned\u201d about companies continuing operations there.\n\nOther Topics of Interest Starmer to Host Coalition Call, Says Putin \u2018Not Serious About Peace\u2019 UK rallying coalition of the willing in response to Russia\u2019s intransigence on peace negotiations.\n\nAlthough Coca-Cola ceased selling its drinks in Russia, its regional bottler, Coca-Cola Hellenic, continues to sell a product called Dobry Cola through Multon Partners. Coca-Cola holds a 21% stake in Coca-Cola Hellenic and reportedly applied to re-register its trademarks in Russia in April 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, PepsiCo, Mars, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Cargill, and Weatherford have scaled back their operations but still produce goods and manage essential operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2024, Citigroup announced that it was winding down its operations in Russia. A spokesperson said that the bank was ending nearly all of its institutional banking business in the country, except operations required to fulfill legal and regulatory obligations. He also added that Citigroup was in the process of closing its Russian consumer banking business.\n\nAside from the US, the second-largest contributor of profit tax to the Kremlin in 2023 was Germany, as German companies paid $693 million in tax to Russia. Austria came in third, with firms paying Putin\u2019s regime $579 million in profit taxes.\n\nHilary Ingham, a professor in economics at the University of Lancaster in the UK, said that US companies may be shoring up Russian support for the war by giving its citizens access to Western goods.\n\n\u201cIt is conceivable that popular support for the war amongst Russians might be severely hampered if they are unable to purchase US goods,\u201d she told Newsweek.\n\nDespite the pressure, leaving Russia is not without its problems, the report said. The Russian government charges companies that leave the country a 15% exit tax and they are forced to sell their assets at a 50% discount. The exit tax generated $385 million for the Kremlin between January and March 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA further financial headache for firms who wish to exit the country is coming. In 2025, the corporate profit tax rate will increase from 20% to 25%, according to the Russian Tax Code.\n\nExperts say that business ties between adversaries during conflict are a reality of interconnected global markets, the report adds.",

However, many remained, continuing to provide substantial financial support through tax payments.\n\nThe findings reveal the United States as the largest foreign contributor of profit taxes to Russia, surpassing Germany ($693 million) and Austria ($579 million). According to Yale School of Management\u2019s research, 123 major US companies maintain business operations in Russia. At the same time, KSE Institute\u2019s broader analysis, including mid-size and smaller firms, puts the number at approximately 328.\n\nAmong the top tax contributors, Philip Morris International leads with $220 million, followed by PepsiCo ($135 million) and Mars ($99 million). Other significant contributors include Procter & Gamble ($67 million), Mondelez ($62 million), and Citigroup ($53 million).\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely shameful that American companies have chosen to stay in Russia and subsidize Putin\u2019s barbaric war in Ukraine,\u201d says Dr. Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia and Stanford University academic, in an interview with Newsweek.\n\nThe data shows US companies\u2019 tax payments have increased from $915.7 million in 2021 despite their combined revenues dropping from $50 billion to $30.5 billion in 2023. Companies looking to exit face steep challenges, including a mandatory 15% exit tax and requirements to sell assets at a 50% discount.\n\nWhen contacted by Newsweek, several companies defended their positions or outlined scaled-back operations. Notably, Mondelez maintained its presence, arguing investors did not \u201cmorally care\u201d about continued business in Russia, while Philip Morris International cited potential financial losses as a reason for maintaining operations.\n\nRead more:",

This was reported by \"Politico\", citing a report published on Monday by B4Ukraine and Squeezing Putin, two non-governmental organizations and the Kiev Institute of Economics.\n\nForeign companies in Russia are major contributors to the Kremlin's war campaign, as they continue to sell unsanctioned goods such as food, tobacco and clothing. The total rises to $21.6 billion (\u20ac21.2 billion) for 2023, taking into account companies from countries that are pro-Ukrainian or strongly supporting Russia\u2019s aggressive war.\n\nTobacco giant Philip Morris is the largest foreign payer in Russia. KSEI estimated that the Marlboro maker raked in almost $7 billion in revenue in 2023. The company paid \u20ac208 million in taxes, up from \u20ac144 million a year earlier.\n\nWhile most Western companies are ready to leave the country or have already done so, several hundred have remained in Russia since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Late last year, Lufthansa Technik and Carlsberg exited the Russian market.\n\nOf the 1,600 companies the researchers looked at, more than 900 were from G7 countries that have supported Ukraine politically, financially and militarily.\n\nThe report lists no fewer than 827 EU firms. Taken together, they \u201cgenerated $81.4 billion (\u20ac79 billion) in revenue, down from $111.4 billion in 2022, but their corporate tax contributions remained stable at $3 billion,\u201d the report, titled \u201cCorporate Drivers of Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine,\u201d said.\n\nThe French Muliez family also remains heavily exposed to Russia. Its retail arm Leroy Merlin and supermarket chain Auchan are ranked No. 3 and No. 7 in terms of Russian-origin revenue in 2023.\n\nA Leroy Merlin spokesman said that holding company ADEO had transferred ownership of its Russian branch to a local government by the end of 2023. Auchan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe top 20 also includes food conglomerates such as Nestl\u00e9, Mars and Pepsi, along with German retailers Metro and Globus. Chinese companies include automotive players such as Haval and its owner Great Wall Motors, but also Chery, Geely, owner of Volvo, FAW and Changan.\n\nCorporate profit tax will rise this year in Russia to 25 percent from 20 percent, meaning the contribution of Western companies could rise even further.",

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"strategy,\" \"future,\" \"opportunity,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following risks relating to the proposed transaction: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement; the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of Kaival 's securities; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of Kaival or other conditions to closing in the transaction agreement; the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of Pubco ordinary shares on Nasdaq following the transaction; the risk that the transactions disrupt current plans and operations of Kaival as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions; the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the transactions, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; costs related to the transactions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that Pubco, Delta or Kaival may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties to be identified in the proxy statement/prospectus (when available) relating to the transactions, including those under \"Risk Factors\" therein, and in other filings with the SEC made by Pubco and Kaival. Moreover, Pubco, Delta and Kaival operate in very competitive and rapidly changing environments. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond Pubco's, Delta's and Kaival 's control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, Pubco, Delta and Kaival assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

(RBH) appeared before the Legislative Assembly of Ontario's Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs to outline RBH's recommendations for the 2025 Budget, focusing on a key recommendation to ban the promotion of illegal tobacco products online. This change would mirror recent changes the province made to the Cannabis Control Act.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Ernst and Young and commissioned by the Convenience Industry Council of Canada (CICC), a growing number of online websites sell and deliver contraband cigarettes anywhere in Canada in violation of Canadian laws. The products often include age and health warnings that mirror past Health Canada requirements on labelling to give an air of legitimacy. Some websites even offer volume discounts for more than one carton purchased. The CICC report cites www.nativecigarettes.ca and www.selectsmokes.se as examples of these sites.\n\nContraband tobacco represents between 39 and 50 per cent of the total tobacco market in Ontario \u2013meaning that potentially 1 out of every 2 cigarettes sold in our province are illegal. As a direct result of the contraband tobacco market, Ontario lost between $990 million and $1.7 billion in potential tobacco tax revenues between 2019 and 2022.\n\nOntario's illicit tobacco market is controlled by, and funds organized crime. Criminal groups involved in contraband tobacco use profits generated from the contraband tobacco trade to fund other illegal activities, including guns and drug trafficking, mostly across the USA / Canada border.\n\nAdditional Budget 2025 recommendations made by RBH include measures to make smoke-free alternatives more widely available to smokers and an education campaign targeted towards smokers on the impact of contraband tobacco sales on community safety.\n\nQUOTE\n\n\"Banning the advertisement of illegal tobacco online is a common-sense step that can have a big impact in terms of slowing the continued growth of the contraband tobacco market and keeping Ontarians safe. As well, there's a need for government to acknowledge harm-reduced product categories within the Tobacco Tax Act to encourage adult consumers to switch to potentially less harmful alternatives to cigarettes. - Kory McDonald, Head, External Affairs, RBH\n\nTo learn more about RBH, visit: https://www.rbhinc.ca/\n\nAbout Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc.\n\nRothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc.

            "content": "Terry Smith has defended his investment strategy after another year of underperformance.\n\nT Class units (which have a 1.04% fee) of Fundsmith Equity returned 8.9% in 2024, below the 20.8% return of the MSCI World index. This means that Smith has underperformed his benchmark for four years in a row now. I Class units are available on the ii platform and cost 0.94% compared with 1.04% for T units.\n\nHowever, since launch in late 2010, Smith is still way ahead of the benchmark, returning 607% compared with 403%.\n\nWriting in his annual letter to investors this week, Smith again blamed his underperformance on the strong returns from the so-called Magnificent Seven shares, which are not a large part of his portfolio.\n\nSmith calculates that just five stocks Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon provided 45% of the returns of the S&P 500 index in 2024, and Nvidia alone produced over 20% of the S&P 500 returns in 2024.\n\nHe said: \u201cOutperforming the market or even making a positive return is not something you should expect from our fund in every year or reporting period, and outperforming the market was more than usually challenging once again in 2024.\n\n\u201cOur fund owns some, but not all, of these stocks and it was difficult to perform even in line with the index unless you owned them at least in line with their index weighting.\u201d\n\nThe goal of Fundsmith Equity, according to Smith, is: \u201cTo produce a high likelihood of a satisfactory return rather than the chance of a spectacular return, which could be spectacularly good or spectacularly bad.\u201d\n\n2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Inception to\n\n31.12.24 Annualised to\n\n31.12.24 Fundsmith Equity (T Class units) 8.9 12.4 -13.8 22.1 18.3 25.6 +607.3 +14.8 Equities (MSCI World) 20.8 16.8 -7.8 22.9 12.3 22.7 +403.4 +12.1 UK Bonds (UK Govt 5 - 10 yr Bond Index) -2.3 5.6 -15 -4.5 4.6 3.8 +23.6 +1.5 Cash (\u00a3 interest rate) 5.1 4.6 1.4 0.1 0.3 0.8 +18.5 +1.2\n\nSource: Fundsmith, data to 31 December 2024. Past performance is not a guide to future performance.\n\nIn 2024, Smith sold his stakes in Diageo, McCormick and Apple. He added two new names: Atlas Copco and Texas Instruments.\n\nOver the calendar year, the bottom five detractors were: L'Or\u00e9al, IDEXX, Nike, Brown-Forman and Novo Nordisk.\n\nHis best shares were Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Automatic Data Processing and Stryker.\n\nSmith defended some of his losers last year. He said Nike suffered from an increasing dependence on fashion and less on traditional exercise uses, but the appointment of a new CEO could help turn around the business.\n\nOn Novo Nordisk, Smith adds: \u201cIn investment it is always better to travel hopefully than to arrive and there is certainly an arms race going on among drug companies to develop competitor drugs. Yet we are still dealing with a company in Novo which is the market leader and holds production and labelling advantages which should sustain that position, with revenues that are growing at 20% a year.\u201d\n\nDespite relatively poor performance, Smith says that his portfolio owns \u201cbetter\u201d businesses than indices based on financial metrics.\n\nFor examples, he cites the 30% operating profit margin of his companies compared with 16% for the typical S&P 500 firm and 15% for the typical FTSE 100 firm.\n\nThis, however, leads to Smith\u2019s portfolio being more expensive than the indices.\n\nSmith says: \u201cOur portfolio consists of companies that are fundamentally a lot better than the average of those in the S&P 500, so it is no surprise that they are valued more highly than the average S&P 500 company. In itself this does not necessarily make the stocks expensive, any more than a lowly rating makes a stock cheap.\u201d\n\nOn Apple and Nvidia\n\nFundsmith Equity dropped Apple in December after holding the tech stock for around two years. Smith began purchasing shares at about $156 per shares, and they now trade at $242, so he banked a profit of around 60%.\n\nTwo years ago, Apple\u2019s valuation was below the S&P average but now it is higher.\n\nSmith explains the reasons for the sale: \u201cWe correctly foresaw a number of reporting periods ahead when sales growth would be lacklustre and so bought a small stake hoping to add to it as the poor sales performance came to pass. We were right about the sales performance \u2014 its sales grew just 2% last year \u2014 but wrong about the share price which rose strongly, placing the shares on a rating about 50% higher than the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nSmith also explained why he is happy to own Meta but not Nvidia, even though both companies have been very volatile.\n\nOne reason is that Meta has more than three billion accounts and several million advertisers, while Nvidia depends on just a few companies to buy its computer chips.\n\nAnother reason for Smith is that before its share price fall in late 2021, Meta was on a price-to-earnings ratio (p/e) of 28, whereas Nvidia is currently on a p/e of 54.",

In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 5.71%, while the S&P 500 lost 2.7%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Altria in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.28, reflecting an 8.47% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $5.04 billion, indicating a 0.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Altria. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.19% increase. Currently, Altria is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Altria has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.66 right now. This valuation marks no noticeable deviation compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.66.\n\nIt's also important to note that MO currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.73. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Tobacco industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.33.\n\nThe Tobacco industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

            "content": "Twenty-one years ago, a Chinese pharmacist named Hon Lik patented the first electronic cigarette. Lik smoked heavily, and hoped to help people quit smoking by giving them the nicotine they crave in a safer way.\n\nHis invention succeeded wildly. It spawned a $28-billion industry that is disrupting the global tobacco business. Leading tobacco control experts say that vapes have begun to reduce the disease and deaths caused by smoking, which kills about 480,000 people a year in the United States. Vaping is much less harmful than smoking, and more effective for smoking cessation than nicotine patches or gum.\n\nYet US regulators have made a dismal mess of the vapes market.\n\nInstead of promoting safe and effective vaping, the federal government, led by the Center for Tobacco Products, a unit of the Food and Drug Administration, has gone to great lengths to keep vapes and other reduced-risk nicotine products out of the hands of consumers who want them.\n\nFDA authorization processes set a higher bar for vapes than for new cigarettes, as Lindsey Stroud, a senior fellow at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, has argued. Of millions of applications, just a short list of products have been authorized\u2014few of them popular, all owned by tobacco companies that can afford to clear the hurdles, and barely any in the non-tobacco flavors that appeal most to adults who smoke.\n\n\u201cThe response of the US government has been to try to stymie rather than facilitate a transition.\u201d\n\nSafer nicotine products around the world \u201care driving down cigarette sales at unprecedented rates,\u201d David Sweanor, a Canadian lawyer, longtime anti-tobacco activist and market analyst, told Filter. \u201cBut the response of the US government has been to try to stymie rather than facilitate a transition.\u201d\n\nWorse, the FDA and anti-tobacco advocacy groups have exaggerated the risks and downplayed the benefits of vaping. Most people who smoke, as a result, don\u2019t understand that switching to vapes can help them live longer, healthier lives.\n\nEven doctors misperceive the risks: Most believe nicotine is the direct cause of the harmful effects of cigarette smoke.\n\nIt\u2019s not. Nicotine, a dependence-forming chemical, keeps people smoking. What makes people sick are thousands of other chemicals, produced by combustion, which collect in a substance known as tobacco tar that lodges in the lungs.\n\nOutside of the US, some governments promote what\u2019s called tobacco harm reduction. They encourage people who smoke but who cannot or will not quit nicotine to switch to safer alternatives.\n\nConsider Sweden, where people obtain nicotine by sucking on smoke-free products called snus. Smoking there has almost disappeared and rates of tobacco-related diseases are the lowest in Europe.\n\nIn Japan, cigarette sales have fallen by more than half as people switch to smoke-free devices that heat but do not burn tobacco. In the United Kingdom, nearly 3 million people have quit smoking in the last five years by using vapes; some hospitals hand them out to people who smoke.\n\nThankfully, those who want vapes in the US can get them despite the FDA\u2019s efforts to keep most of them off the market.\n\n\u201cThe FDA has created a gigantic, chaotic mess.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 18 to 20 million people here use vapes, the vast majority of which are unregulated and technically illegal. Some await FDA authorization, others are tied up in FDA-related court cases and still others have simply ignored and bypassed the regulators.\n\n\u201cThe FDA has created a gigantic, chaotic mess,\u201d Clive Bates, a British tobacco control expert, told Filter. Many of these \u201cproducts could be anything, made anywhere, under any conditions.\u201d\n\nChange could soon come to the FDA. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on December 2 in a case challenging the Center for Tobacco Products\u2019 decision to deny two manufacturers of flavored vapes permission to market their products.\n\nMore importantly, the incoming Trump administration will revisit the issue. Following a meeting with vaping industry executives before the election, Trump wrote on social media: \u201cI saved Flavored Vaping in 2019, and it greatly helped people get off smoking \u2026 I\u2019ll save Vaping again!\u201d\n\nProtecting the Kids\n\nLike electric cars, vapes are a clean 21st-century innovation made possible by advances in battery technology. Lithium-ion batteries heat a liquid containing nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals, creating an aerosol mist that users inhale. There is no combustion.\n\nEven the FDA concedes that vapes \u201ccan generally be a lower-risk alternative for adults who smoke cigarettes.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nIt\u2019s all about the kids. The phenomenal success of the vape brand Juul, which was marketed to young people, set off a moral panic over teenage vaping, driven by Democratic politicians and anti-tobacco advocacy groups. The interests of adults who smoke have been cast aside.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to kids, FDA feels very strongly that a precautionary, prevention lens is critical. That is the driving force for the actions that we take.\u201d\n\nFlavored vapes are at the heart of the debate. The FDA says that flavors deemed to entice kids, like banana split and gummy bear, pose an unacceptable risk to young people. No matter that it\u2019s illegal for anyone under 21 to buy nicotine products.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to kids, FDA feels very strongly that a precautionary, prevention lens is critical,\u201d said Brian King, director of the Center for Tobacco Products. \u201cThat is the driving force for the actions that we take.\u201d\n\nOf 34 FDA-authorized vaping products, 30 are tobacco-flavored, with little appeal for adults who don\u2019t want to be reminded of the combustible cigarettes they are trying to leave behind. The other four are outmoded menthol-flavored vapes made by NJoy, a unit of tobacco giant Altria.\n\nConsequently, renegade products dominate the market. Elf Bar, Breeze and Mr. Fog are now the leading brands, according to King and industry analysts. All are illegally imported from China and widely available.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic example of \u201cmassive government malfunction\u201d when regulators pursue an approach that creates a thriving illicit or gray market, Ethan Nadelmann, the founder of the Drug Policy Alliance, told Filter.\n\nTo understand how FDA lost control of the market, a bit of history is required.\n\nZeller had high hopes for the plan. \u201cThen things started to fall apart,\u201d he told Filter.\n\nAs it happens, tobacco harm reduction has been endorsed by public health experts for decades. Among them is Mitch Zeller, a longtime FDA official who ran the Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022. In 2001, Zeller commissioned what turned out to be a 657-page report from the Institute of Medicine embracing harm reduction; the report urged tobacco and drug companies \u201cto develop and introduce new products that will reduce the burden of tobacco-related disease.\u201d\n\nIn the landmark Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which gave FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products, as vapes are termed, Congress told the agency to support reduced-risk products so long as they are \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health,\u201d a phrase that has taken on outsized importance in the vaping debate.\n\nIn 2017, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Zeller unveiled a comprehensive blueprint to regulate tobacco products. Among other things, it set forth a regulatory framework that would give the FDA until 2022 to carefully authorize safer nicotine products.\n\nZeller had high hopes for the plan. \u201cThen things started to fall apart,\u201d he told Filter, through a succession of events that no one could have anticipated.\n\n\u201cBig Tobacco Is Back\u201d\n\nOne problem was obvious: By the time FDA got around to regulating vapes, sales were already surging. They were driven largely by the popularity of Juul.\n\nWhat was invariably described as an epidemic of youth vaping peaked in 2019: Some 27.5 percent of high school students reported vaping at least once in the past 30 days and nearly 10 percent were frequent users, the FDA said. Gottlieb and Zeller grew alarmed.\n\nAdvocacy groups sued the FDA, arguing that vapes were flooding the market. They won, forcing the agency to hurry its regulatory process.\n\nMeantime, a lung disease that killed 68 people and hospitalized thousands more was mislabeled EVALI\u2014E-cigarette or Vaping Use-Associated Lung Injury\u2014and wrongly attributed to nicotine vapes by the CDC and anti-tobacco groups. The disease was caused by adulterated THC cartridges.\n\n\u201cE-cigarette companies and the tobacco companies that back them are preying on America\u2019s youth.\u201d\n\nBillionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg entered the fray, launching a $160-million initiative to end youth vaping in 2019. \u201cE-cigarette companies and the tobacco companies that back them are preying on America\u2019s youth,\u201d he said.\n\nBy then, Altria had agreed to buy 35 percent of Juul for $12.8 billion. The Bloomberg-funded Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids ran newspaper ads headlined: \u201cBig Tobacco is back, thanks to JUUL\u2014with a whole new way to get kids hooked on nicotine.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in Congress demanded that the FDA clear the market of all flavored vapes. Anti-smoking groups that had previously supported harm reduction did an about-face. The American Cancer Society said flatly: \u201cE-cigarettes should not be used to quit smoking.\u201d\n\nThe Gottlieb-Zeller comprehensive plan was dead. Or, as Zeller put it, the plan has been \u201ccryogenically frozen and it has yet to be unfrozen.\u201d\n\nThe anti-vaping frenzy got results. Seven states and the District of Columbia have banned or severely restricted sales of flavored vapes. The Post Office won\u2019t deliver vapes, and you can\u2019t buy them on a military base.\n\nTeen vaping petered out. The latest annual National Youth Tobacco Survey found that vaping by high school and middle school students has declined by 70 percent from its peak, with about 600,000 teens\u2014one out of every 45\u2014saying they vaped on at least 20 of the last 30 days.\n\nWhile teasing out cause and effect is hard, it certainly looks as if vaping is helping to make teen smoking a thing of the past.\n\nYet at the height of teen vaping, something else happened. \u201cYouth smoking was already declining before e-cigarettes became available, but smoking rates declined faster after e-cigarettes appeared,\u201d said researcher Arielle Selya.\n\nTeen smoking has now fallen to the lowest level ever recorded by the survey. That should bury the canard that vaping is a gateway to smoking. To the contrary, while teasing out cause and effect is hard, it certainly looks as if vaping is helping to make teen smoking a thing of the past.\n\nKen Warner, the former dean of the school of public health at the University of Michigan and a leading tobacco control expert, has called the decline in youth smoking \u201cone of the great public health triumphs of the present century.\u201d\n\nBut what about adults who smoke? There are about 28 million of them in the US. Like young people, they\u2019re likely to prefer flavored vapes. They\u2019ve largely been neglected by the FDA and ignored by anti-tobacco groups.\n\nThat\u2019s a social justice issue, critics like Warner say.\n\nSmoking rates are higher among people with low incomes, as well as people with mental health conditions, Indigenous people and LGBTQ+ people. These marginalized groups are largely invisible to Washington policymakers and lack political clout.\n\nBy contrast, the anti-vaping movement took root in the tonier precincts of Manhattan and Silicon Valley. Its campaigns have been generously funded by Bloomberg, who is also a major donor to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cFDA has been under unrelenting, powerful political pressure\u201d to protect kids at the expense of adults who smoke, Jeff Weiss, a former NJoy executive who continues to advocate for reduced-risk products, told Filter.\n\nIn a 2024 paper published in the Food Drug and Law Journal, Weiss argues that advocacy groups, led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, have \u201csuccessfully driven the Center\u2019s priorities, its policies, its major product review decisions and even its communications strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe clear reality is that the FDA has been captured.\u201d\n\nOften, powerful industries dominate regulators, a phenomenon known as regulatory capture. Here, Weiss and others say, the regulators have come under the sway of the advocacy groups and their political allies.\n\n\u201cThe clear reality is that the FDA has been captured,\u201d Cliff Douglas, a lifelong anti-smoking activist who is now president of the nonprofit Global Action to End Smoking, told Filter. He sees flavored vapes as exactly the sort of innovation Congress envisioned when it told the FDA to identify and encourage the use of safer nicotine products.\n\nMatthew Holman, the former director of science at the Center for Tobacco Products, similarly believes that the FDA pays insufficient attention to adults who smoke. Leadership failed to listen to the agency\u2019s scientists, he has said.\n\nFor example, when the FDA scientists recommended that the agency authorize menthol-flavored vapes from a company called Logic, they were overruled by higher-ups, internal memos show. Holman left the FDA to join Philip Morris International (PMI), which makes safer nicotine products as well as cigarettes.\n\nZeller and King deny being influenced by anti-tobacco groups. The law, they say, puts the burden on companies to prove that their products are \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe standards that Congress set\u2014not FDA, Congress\u2014were high,\u201d Zeller said. The question before the Supreme Court, in essence, is whether the FDA applied those standards fairly.\n\nWin or lose in court, about the best thing that can be said about the FDA for now is that the agency has failed to keep countless flavored vaping products away from consumers.\n\nThe agency has tried everything\u2014sending out hundreds of warning letters about unregulated sales, imposing modest civil penalties on manufacturers and retailers, forming a joint task force with other federal agencies to seize illegal vapes at the border\u2014but the vapes market continues to grow briskly.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Banning a product that consumers want rarely works. People have used nicotine for thousands of years, long before Big Tobacco arrived on the scene. Nicotine, it would seem, delivers benefits\u2014it can improve memory and focus, and reduce anxiety\u2014while posing health risks that are uncertain but well short of life-threatening. Caffeine is comparable.\n\nThe good news is that nicotine vaping is reducing cigarette sales, according to the tobacco companies and Wall Street analysts. By just how much, it\u2019s impossible to know, but some surveys suggest that about a third of the 18 to 20 million people who vape have given up cigarettes entirely. They\u2019ve made what could be a lifesaving choice.\n\nWhat we\u2019ll never know is how many more people would have made that same choice had they been encouraged to do so by the FDA and others in the government who are responsible for improving the public\u2019s health.\n\nPhotograph by Vaping360 via Flickr/Creative Commons 2.0\n\nCorrection, January 9: A previous version of this article stated that the FDA wrongly attributed \u201cEVALI\u201d to nicotine vapes. While the FDA supported this idea to a degree, it was principally promoted by the CDC.\n\nThe Influnence Foundation, which operates Filter, has received grants from Global Action to End Smoking, and unrestricted donations from Altria, PMI and (previously) Juul. It also received a one-off donation from the Taxpayers Protection Alliance to support travel to a harm reduction event, and previously received a restricted grant from the Drug Policy Alliance to support a journalism fellowship.

            "content": "Terry Smith\u2019s Fundsmith Equity fund is one of the most popular active funds among investors, but is its underperformance a concern?\n\nIn MoneyWeek\u2019s monthly round-up of the most popular funds, stocks and trusts to invest in, Fundsmith has often been the most popular and often one of the few active funds that appears on the list of top 10, but in the last three months to December 2024, it seems investors have fallen out of favour for the funds and actives as a whole, with passives now dominating DIY portfolios.\n\nFundsmith\u2019s underperformance at 8.9%, compared to the 20.8% of the MSCI World Index and the 12.6% of the IA Global in 2024, may have rattled some nerves, but in his latest letter to investors, CEO Terry Smith said: \u201cOutperforming the market or even making a positive return is not something you should expect from our fund in every year or reporting period, and outperforming the market was more than usually challenging once again in 2024.\n\nSubscribe to MoneyWeek Subscribe to MoneyWeek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely FREE Get 6 issues free Sign up to Money Morning Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Sign up\n\n\u201cJust five stocks (the \u2018Fab Five\u2019) Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon provided 45% of the returns of the S&P 500 Index (S&P 500) in 2024. This is similar to the concentration of returns provided by the so-called Magnificent Seven in 2023. Moreover, a single stock - Nvidia - produced over 20% of the S&P 500 returns in 2024.\u201d\n\nThe technology boom has certainly dented active fund performance. While Fundsmith owns some of these stocks, it does not hold them all, to which Terry said in his letter that it was difficult to perform even in line with the index unless you owned them at least in line with their index weighting.\n\nWhich stocks brought Fundsmith\u2019s performance down?\n\nL\u2019Oreal, which features in the funds top 10 holding and was once described by Smith as \u2018one of the best companies in the world\u2019 was one of the detractors, having seen an adverse effect from China where its economy is still struggling. Though, Smith continues to hold his view that L\u2019Oreal is still a good business.\n\nOther detractors were IDEXX, Nike, Brown-Formann and Novo-Nordisk.\n\nIDEXX, which makes veterinary diagnostic testing equipment and supplies, is suffering from fewer vet visits after the scramble to adopt pets during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs the industry leader in an area with real long-term growth prospects and a stock where we would probably struggle to buy back our position if we sold it, we intend to continue holding,\u201d Smith said in his letter.\n\nOn Nike, he said the retailer has made great strides in online marketing and fulfilment, but neglected the bricks and mortar retail channel following the pandemic recovery. The fund awaits developments from Nike\u2019s new management.\n\nBrown-Forman, one of the world\u2019s top five drinks companies and the distiller of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey, \u201chas suffered from the fall in consumption from the pandemic highs and is probably seeing early signs of the adverse impact of weight-loss drugs.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk was the fund\u2019s most surprising poor performer in 2024. \u201dIt remains the market leader in weight loss drugs, which it pioneered, and the year was marked by a stream of news about other conditions which these drugs treat effectively and label expansion applications which drug regulators seem willing to approve. Yet not only did the share price fall 10% but it finished the year on a P/E ratio half that of its nearest competitor Eli Lilly,\u201d Smith said.\n\nBut he added that the fund originally bought Novo because of its radical approach to drug discovery and it expects further developments.\n\nTop performing Fundsmith Equity holdings\n\nMeta Platforms, Microsoft, Philip Morris, Automatic Data Processing and Stryker were the top performers.\n\n\u201cGiven the number of repeat appearances in our top five contributors I am tempted to repeat one of our mantras which is that \u2018You make money with old friends\u2019. However, three of those old friends which have been repeat contributors were detractors this year, namely L\u2019Or\u00e9al, IDEXX and Novo Nordisk. However, if anything I would regard this as a blip in their long-term record and we intend to (mostly) patiently await a return to form. In our view they are simply too good to sell and risk being uninvested when the tide turns.\u201d\n\nAre active funds still worth it?\n\nFundsmith Equity managers seem to know what they are doing when it comes to buying good companies and it is one of the funds which has outperformed a comparable index tracker over 10 years fairly comfortably.\n\nAnd AJ Bell\u2019s report into manager versus machine found that only 18% of active managers in the global sector outperformed the average index tracker in 2024 to the end of November, only 17% achieved this feat over the longer period of 10 years.\n\nThe performance has been driven by a small number of big technology names, which hold such a high weighting in the index meaning active managers are unlikely to be anything other than underweight the grouping dubbed the Magnificent Seven.\n\nShould you stick with Fundsmith Equity?\n\n\u201cInvestors can draw some reassurance from Fundsmith Equity\u2019s longer term performance numbers, and from a clearly framed and executed investment strategy. Those who are attracted to the mantra of \u2018buy good companies, don\u2019t overpay, do nothing\u2019 are themselves likely to apply a similar philosophy to the active managers they invest in, so many will undoubtedly stick with Smith through the tougher times, especially when they have enjoyed such long-term success and when recent returns have still been so positive in absolute term,\u201d Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said.\n\nSpeaking of active funds, Khalaf added: \u201cAll active managers will undergo periods of underperformance; it\u2019s part of the beat. Investors need to be willing to accept sometimes these periods can be quite lengthy. It\u2019s always difficult to tell without the benefit of perfect hindsight when an active manager is going through a temporary rough patch, or if there is something more permanently problematic going on. It can help in this situation to assess whether the leopard is panicking and changing its spots by investing in things which don\u2019t match up with the stated fund strategy. There is no obvious sign of this at Fundsmith, which is continuing to run a concentrated portfolio of higher quality names with little turnover.\u201d",

He also completed the Executive Management Program at Columbia University on a scholarship and earned a Master of Business Administration in marketing and finance from Fordham University.\n\n\n\nHe attributes his personal and professional success to his lifelong training and commitment to judo and its philosophy combined with leaders who mentored and supported him. His long and varied career, extensive travels, and rich personal life are a testament to his intense curiosity and fearless spirit. At 77, he maintains his dedication to living his best life and enhancing the world around him. Currently he is working on publishing his book, \"LINK TO VITALITY.\" This book is a living testament that your genetics is not your final destination. This book is about a 76 year journey of one man trying to defy the biology of aging by focusing on the biological aging. Then the chronological aging is able to achieve 76 years of vital life. Unlike most health books, you won't find a simple prescription for staying healthy here. You'll find a smorgasbord of \"good for you\" health practices that can be tweaked and personalized to fit the reader's needs. By simplifying the science that supports many of the personal protocols Dr. El-Hag employs to stay fit (body in motion, stay in motion), he encourages his readers to write their own \"user manual\" so they can establish health habits that will support their individual goals. The book addresses all aspects of health, including exercise, nutrition, supplementation, rest, sleep, breathing, mental fitness, attitude, and lifestyle. Ever the optimist, he plans to release his book on his eightieth birthday.\n\n\n\nAbout Marquis Who's Who\u00ae:\n\nSince 1899, when A. N.

While the firefighter drama doesn\u2019t officially resume its third season until Jan. 31, the network has been showing reruns on Friday nights but that will not be the case for this week. Deadline reports that the NorCal-set series has been pulled from tomorrow\u2019s lineup out of respect to those affected by the SoCal wildfires.\n\nA repeat of Season 2\u2019s \u201cA Hail Mary\u201d at 9 p.m. ET tomorrow will be replaced by another repeat of NCIS: Sydney. The NCIS spinoff will have two full hours on the lineup tomorrow, taking over the 8 p.m. slot as well, while a S.W.A.T. repeat will still end the night at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nPictured (L-R): Jules Latimer as Eve Edwards, Jordan Calloway as Jake Crawford, and Max Thieriot as Bode Leone. Photo: Sergei Bachlakov/CBS\n\nAs for Fire Country\u2019s winter premiere later this month, there is nothing indicating that it\u2019s also being pulled. The episode will be continuing the storyline from the fall finale, which saw Edgewater preparing for a big wildfire that soon started to burn down Eve\u2019s family ranch. It ended on multiple cliffhangers with numerous characters in danger. Directed by star Kevin Alejandro, in \u201cComing in Hot,\u201d as the Chezem Valley fire blazes out of control, \u201cBode and Audrey must find a way to save themselves; Manny risks his freedom for his missing daughter; and Eve tries to protect her father (Phil Morris) and their family\u2019s ranch.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NBC still aired the winter premiere of Chicago Fire last night, but it\u2019s unknown if any fellow first responder shows will suffer the same fate as Fire Country. The final season of 9-1-1: Lone Star won\u2019t be continuing on Fox until later this month, while parent series 9-1-1 is on hiatus on ABC until March. At the very least, all episodes of Fire Country are streaming on Paramount+, so fans can get their fix that way until the series returns at the end of January.\n\nWith multiple wildfires still taking over LA, many shows have had to pause production, with several studios also shutting down along with premieres, award shows, and other special events. Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal CityWalk have also shut down for the time being, as well as Warner Bros. Studio Tour. It\u2019s unpredictable how long this will last, but it\u2019s certainly a heartbreaking sight.",

The conference focused on the crucial role that innovation, technology, and science can play to help accelerate the decline in smoking rates, enabling a better future for everyone. PMI executives pointed out that a smoke-free future is within reach with alternatives that are designed to reduce harm compared to conventional tobacco, through a no-combustion technology.\n\nPMI executives at Technovation Abu Dhabi 2024\n\nSpeaking at the event, Jacek Olczak, CEO Philip Morris International said, \"Banning alternatives to cigarettes is \"wasting time\" because there is existing evidence that different product formats help address the problem in a faster manner. Depriving people of access to less harmful alternatives, while sale of cigarettes continue is almost immoral. 1 billion smokers, globally, should have the right to the information and choose an alternative that is less harmful. Countries that have embraced these alternatives like Japan for instance have seen a reduction of cigarettes by more than 45% in the last 10 years. Japan would be smoke-free in 10 years from now while India will have more smokers and would have wasted this opportunity of possible fast-tracked cessation, owing to not adopting science backed policies.\"\n\nReinforcing the sentiments, Fred De Wilde, President South & Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States and Middle East and Africa Region at Philip Morris International, stated, \"The Global South, with its young and growing population, will significantly contribute to shaping the future. According to the WHO, 80% of the worlds over 1 billion smokers reside in emerging economies. To accelerate the transition to a smoke-free future and reduce the harm from traditional tobacco use, we aim to meet consumer preferences in these regions with affordable and accessible less harmful alternatives to cigarette smoking. In fact, by June 2024, approximately 6.1 million individuals in twenty-seven countries had switched to less harmful alternatives. However, this is just the beginning, with over half of the world's legal-age nicotine consumers living in these areas.\"\n\nSharing the vision of a smoke-free world, Tommaso Di Giovanni, Vice President of Global Communications at Philip Morris International added, \"PMI wants to replace cigarettes to less harmful alternatives as soon as possible. These alternatives have scientifically been proven to be safer than smoking. While not completely risk-free, they can significantly reduce exposure to harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes. We have a firm belief that if you do not smoke, don't start. If you are already smoking, quit. If you do not stop, then switch to less harmful alternatives.\"\n\nPMI presented some of its lesser harmful alternatives that eliminate combustion & showcased how high levels of harmful chemicals in the smoke from burning cigarettes are the primary cause of smoking-related diseases.\n\nAbout Philip Morris International\n\nPhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside tobacco and nicotine sector.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.pmi.com and www.pmiscience.com.\n\nPhoto: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2592628/PMI.jpg",

            "content": "Stock photo | Hans via Pixabay\n\nMitch Kokai\n\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court has sided with tobacco company Philip Morris in an $8.7 million tax dispute with the state Revenue Department. The decision showcased a clear split between the court\u2019s Republican and Democratic justices.\n\nRepublicans who make up the court\u2019s 5-2 majority proved more skeptical than their Democratic colleagues about government bureaucrats\u2019 role in the tax fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case stems from actions dating back more than two decades. A North Carolina General Assembly controlled by Democrats created a cigarette export tax credit in 1999. State lawmakers, still led by Democrats, amended the law four years later.\n\nPhilip Morris and state revenue officials disagree about whether the 2003 amendment limited the amount of tax credits the company could generate in any single year. The disagreement prompted a multimillion-dollar difference of opinion about Philip Morris\u2019 state tax bills for 2013 and 2014.\n\nRepublican justices took issue with the Revenue Department\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201c(I)t is undisputed that the Department interpreted the original version of the Export Credit Statute as permitting unlimited credits calculated based on cigarette exports, which could then be carried forward,\u201d Justice Tamara Barringer wrote for the majority. \u201cIn fact, as found by the trial court, the Department conceded that Philip Morris\u2019 current interpretation of \u2018credit allowed\u2019 is consistent with the Department\u2019s prior interpretation\u201d of the law before 2003.\n\n\u201cThe Department now argues that the 2003 Amendment revised the statute to limit export credits generated to six million dollars each year. We disagree,\u201d Barringer explained.\n\nBeyond simple disagreement, Barringer\u2019s opinion chided the government for its inconsistent approach toward export tax credit rules.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the Department\u2019s representations and actions do not support its current position,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDespite acknowledging the ability to \u2018generate\u2019 credits \u2018above the $6 million cap\u2019 in its 2008 economic incentives report, \u2026 the Department now argues that the 2003 Amendment always created a limit on export credits \u2018generated.\u2019 Yet the Department has repeatedly failed to act in accordance with this interpretation or even announce its change in position.\u201d\n\nThe high court\u2019s two Democrats dissented from the ruling favoring Philip Morris. The amended law\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d limited the amount of credits the company could generate in a single year, wrote Justice Allison Riggs.\n\nThe dissenting opinion also criticized Barringer\u2019s treatment of revenue staffers.\n\n\u201cI am troubled by the scolding tone with which the majority addresses the Department,\u201d Riggs wrote. \u201cHere, it seems plain to me that regardless of the Department\u2019s prior interpretations, the Department\u2019s current interpretation is consistent with the clear intent and purpose of the law at issue here. I do not see any grounds for inferring bad intent or actions on the part of the Department for honoring the intent of the legislature.\u201d\n\nYet Barringer\u2019s words will set a precedent for future disputes pitting taxpayers and everyday citizens against state government agencies.\n\n\u201cSimply put, the Department\u2019s actions amount to an abrupt reversal of policy without notice to the public or taxpayers,\u201d Barringer wrote. \u201cThe actions here lacked transparency and are plainly contrary to the trust the public deserves from its government. This conduct is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs mandated by statute and recognized by the Department in its own publications, citizen taxpayers must be able to rely on the representations of the Department,\u201d the majority opinion continued. \u201cBusinesses need consistency and clarity to operate efficiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department should consistently, plainly and publicly interpret and apply revenue statutes and regulations for all taxpaying citizens. This is a statutory mandate,\u201d Barringer added.\n\nRevenue officials claimed in their dispute with Philip Morris that the 2003 state law set a new restriction on export tax credits. \u201cYet the Department has repeatedly failed to act in accordance with this interpretation or even announce its change in position,\u201d Barringer concluded. \u201cPhilip Morris is entitled to rely on these representations and actions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the specific circumstances of Philip Morris\u2019 tax dispute will crop up again in North Carolina. Yet one can imagine other instances when a taxpayer and the state Revenue Department will reach different conclusions about provisions of state law.\n\nMore broadly, it\u2019s certain that North Carolinians will continue to challenge other state agencies\u2019 interpretations of statutes that limit freedoms and restrict individuals\u2019 actions. When those disputes reach courtrooms, Barringer\u2019s \u201cscolding tone\u201d could prove beneficial.\n\nIt\u2019s not too much to ask government to \u201cconsistently, plainly and publicly interpret and apply\u201d laws that govern so many aspects of our daily lives. The current state Supreme Court has signaled in the Philip Morris case that it will hold state agencies to that high standard.\n\nMitch Kokai is senior political analyst for the John Locke Foundation.",

However, upon using it for the first time at home, he claims it caused cuts on both of his cheeks. He discovered that one of the blades was loose and suspected the razor was defective.\n\nThis led him to take legal action against the manufacturer, Wilkinson Sword, resulting in an out-of-court settlement. Nick, who lives in London, shared, \u201cThis was not just a simple shaving cut. It really sliced into my skin. My cuts bled for over twenty minutes. I felt it was important to take action to protect others who might not be as fortunate as I was. This was a serious issue. It was about standing up to the big companies, and I did just that and succeeded.\u201d\n\nNick purchased a \u00a32.50 Men Advance 3 razor from Sainsbury\u2019s in Richmond, London. After unwrapping it and starting to shave on Boxing Day 2023, he ended up cutting his face. He explained, \u201cI turned on the hot tap and applied my shaving lotion, going through the motions. I began shaving one side with a stroke, then switched to the other side. A few seconds later, I noticed I was bleeding heavily on my left cheek, and then it started on the right side too, before I knew it, blood was streaming down my face.\u201d Unlike previous shaving accidents, this one felt entirely different. Nick remarked, \u201cThe bleeding just wouldn\u2019t stop. Since the cuts were on my face, it took me nearly half an hour of dabbing with tissues before the blood finally ceased.\u201d\n\nNick noticed that one of the blades in his razor was loose when he inspected it. As a part-time landscape gardener, he remarked, \u201cSeeing that blade sticking out made me realize it could have caused serious harm.\n\nLatest: Duchess Meghan Mourns the Loss of Beloved Rescue Dog, Guy\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a minor cut; it actually sliced into my skin. After thirty years of shaving, I had never experienced anything like this before.\u201d Thinking quickly, Nick had family members take photos of the cuts on his face and made sure to keep the razor, its packaging, and the receipt as proof. He mentioned that his injuries took weeks to heal, leaving him with scars on his cheek. He also shared that the trauma from the incident resulted in recurring nightmares for several months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some bad experiences with surgeries and blood in the past, and this brought it all back. I kept dreaming about blood on my face. It was a really tough time for me.\u201d Instead of throwing away the defective razor, Nick reached out to product liability experts at Express Solicitors. They contacted Sainsbury\u2019s, who then directed them to the manufacturer of their brand, the well-known razor company Wilkinson Sword. The brand's representatives tested the razor and, a month later, offered to settle his claim for \u00a35,000 without admitting any fault.\n\nLatest: Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag\u2019s Home Destroyed by Pacific Palisades Wildfire\n\nJack Klein, a product liability expert at Express Solicitors who handled Nick's case, stated, \u201cMost people wouldn\u2019t think to sue one of the world\u2019s largest razor manufacturers after a shaving injury. But Nick did, and by keeping the razor as evidence, he secured a settlement. This demonstrates that if you\u2019re injured by a product, you might have a legitimate claim, regardless of the company\u2019s size.\u201d A spokesperson for Sainsbury\u2019s commented, \u201cCustomer safety is our top priority. We want to assure our customers that we have not received any other complaints regarding this product. In this instance, Mr. Silverthorn's legal team worked directly with the manufacturer to look into his experience and resolve the claim.\u201d",

            "content": "An American teenager has just taken on 10 of the world\u2019s biggest food companies, including Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9 and Kraft Heinz, suing them for deliberately engineering their ultra-processed food (UPF) products to be addictive, and for targeting their marketing to children, alleging that eating UPFs causes chronic diseases and lifelong illness and suffering.\n\nAt 16, Bryce Martinez was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The \u201ccivil action\u201d complaint he is bringing against these companies alleges that because as a child his food intake was dominated by their products, he developed his chronic illnesses, which \u2013 the lawsuit said \u2013 in general emerged in adolescents for the first time around the year 2000.\n\nThe rates of these diseases in children \u201care now surging\u201d, the complaint said, doubling in recent years.\n\nIn Daily Maverick, Ad\u00e8le Sulcas writes that the lawsuit was filed in Philadelphia in early December 2024. It is the first civil action suit of its kind, said Martinez\u2019s law firm, Morgan & Morgan, in which food manufacturers are being sued for damages allegedly caused by their products.\n\nThe full list of companies being sued also includes Post, PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestl\u00e9 (USA), Kellanova, WK Kellogg, Mars and Conagra.\n\nIn the US, UPF products make up two-thirds of children\u2019s average daily energy intake, said the lawsuit, which draws extensively on the scientific literature on UPF consumption and its negative health effects.\n\nDefinition\n\nUPFs are \u201cindustrially produced edible substances that are imitations of food\u201d, the lawsuit said, adopting the definition of Carlos Monteiro, the Brazilian researcher who created the NOVA classification system for processed foods in 2009.\n\nThe evidence on the harmful effects of UPFs on human health has spiralled in recent years, going beyond the negative impacts of foods high in fat, sugar, salt and refined carbohydrates, long known to be implicated in obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cancers, cardiovascular disease, irritable bowel disease, dementia and other mental health conditions.\n\nThe latest emerging science is that it\u2019s the additives in UPFs \u2013 enhancing their taste, colour, texture and overall appeal, plus high levels of sugars, fats and salt, aggravating the risks of these diseases \u2013 which lead to \u201caddictive\u201d eating behaviours and drives their over-consumption.\n\nWhile there is no universally accepted single definition (Monteiro\u2019s system does not take into account some aspects of processing), it is generally accepted that UPFs consist of substances that have been fractioned, chemically modified, combined with additives (such as preservatives, emulsifiers, flavourants and many other chemicals), and are then moulded, extruded, and pressurised to reform food-like shapes, while their original whole-food structures have been annihilated (imagine a potato \u201cchip\u201d that looks like a slice of potato but is actually reconstructed from a largely chemical paste).\n\nUPF products are known to trigger a range of chronic diseases \u2013 obesity, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and even depression.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are finding additional wide-ranging and long-term harms to health caused by the chemical additives, including emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, and by the absence of \u201cwhole\u201d foods from the diet, increasingly replaced by processed alternatives.\n\nThe latest emerging science points to the additives in UPFs \u2013 which enhance their taste, colour, texture and overall appeal \u2013 being especially harmful, further increasing the risks of ill health, and leading to \u2018addictive\u2019 eating behaviours and driving over-consumption and weight gain.\n\n\u201cThe story \u2026 is an egregious example of companies prioritising profits over the health and safety of the people who buy their products,\u201d said lawyer Mike Morgan, a partner in Morgan & Morgan, which has filed the suit for Martinez.\n\n\u201cExecutives at the defendant companies have allegedly known for at least a quarter of a century that ultra-processed foods would contribute to illnesses in children, but allegedly ignored the public health risks in pursuit of profits,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nType 2 diabetes used to be known as \u201clate onset diabetes\u201d because it occurred mainly among older adults, after decades of damage to the body, in part from unhealthy foods and drinks.\n\nMartinez is one of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of children and adults in the US (possibly far more, globally), showing signs of UPF-triggered diseases. Diabetes rates have soared globally in recent decades, including among children, and including low- and middle-income countries like South Africa.\n\nThis has happened because more and more countries\u2019 populations have shifted their food consumption increasingly away from whole, traditional foods and towards ever-higher proportions of UPFs, which are relentlessly marketed to vulnerable audiences, and are more affordable, convenient, and easily available (up to 80% of products in South African supermarkets are ultra-processed) than fresh, whole foods.\n\nUPFs in South Africa\n\nIn 2024, University of Western Cape researcher Tamryn Frank published a scientific paper showing that among 2521 participants aged 18 to 50, ultra-processed foods comprised almost 40% (39.4%) of the energy intake of the average adult. The research was carried out in 2017-2018, among low-income adults in Langa, Khayelitsha, and Mount Frere.\n\nThough this country\u2019s 40% rate of UPF consumption is lower than the UK\u2019s 57% (66% among UK adolescents) or the more than 50% among Americans, the rise in South Africans\u2019 consumption of UPF is recent and sharp, in a food environment that on the one hand makes cheap, unhealthy foods much more affordable and accessible than healthy foods, and on the other lacks adequate regulation to protect consumers from the harms caused by unhealthy foods and drinks.\n\n(Frank\u2019s study also says that \u201cpolicy measures are urgently needed in SA to protect against the proliferation of harmful UPF and to promote and enable consumption of whole foods and less UPF\u201d.)\n\nFurther research in South Africa by the SAMRC/Wits Centre for Health Economics and Decision Sciences has shown extraordinarily high rates of sugary-drinks consumption, which are also ultra-processed products.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2012, South Africans\u2019 consumption of sugary drinks jumped from 183 Coca-Cola products per person per year to 260. Research shows that drinking even one sugary beverage a day increases an adult\u2019s likelihood of being overweight by 27%, and a child\u2019s by 55%, with liquid sugar considered more harmful than other forms.\n\nSouth African nine- and 10-year-olds drink an average of 254 Coca-Cola products per year (the global average is 89).\n\nA 2024 study from the SA Human Sciences Research Council shows that almost 50% of adult South Africans are overweight or obese (31% among men, 67% among women), making us among the most obese nations in the world. At least one in eight South Africans is diabetic, with diabetes the second-biggest cause of death among South Africans, after TB.\n\n\u2018Big Food\u2019 replicates \u2018Big Tobacco\u2019s\u2019 devious marketing tactics\n\nThe Martinez lawsuit alleges that the 10 global UPF manufacturers have taken exactly the same approach to marketing their harmful products as tobacco did decades ago (before the WHO\u2019s 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control caused scores of countries and companies to restrict marketing of tobacco products, especially to children).\n\nThis allegation is founded in established fact, but is framed in stark relief by the Martinez lawsuit: in the 1980s, Martinez v Kraft Heinz says, \u201cBig Tobacco took over the American food environment\u201d, with global cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris buying General Foods and Kraft, and RJ Reynolds buying Nabisco, Del Monte, KFC, and others.\n\n\u201cCollectively, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds dominated the US food system for decades,\u201d the document says, using \u201ctheir cigarette playbook to fill our food environment with addictive substances that are aggressively marketed to children and minorities\u201d.\n\nHow this works, in practice\n\nBig Tobacco companies intentionally designed UPF products to \u201chack the physiological structures of our brains\u201d, the case says, using UPF product formulation strategies \u201cguided by the same tobacco company scientists and the same kind of brain research on sensory perceptions, physiological psychology, and chemical senses that were used to increase the addictiveness of cigarettes\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, these formulations strategies were quickly adopted throughout the UPF industry, the case says, \u201cwith the goal of driving consumption, and defendants\u2019 (food companies\u2019) profits, at all costs\u201d.\n\nProfessor Susan Goldstein of the Wits/SAMRC Centre expanded on this for Daily Maverick: \u201cThey paid researchers to bring out an alternative narrative, they advertised to children (while denying it), they bribed policymakers, and argued that their businesses are beneficial to society and if limited or controlled, jobs would be lost.\n\n\u201cWhat is interesting about this court case,\u201d Goldstein said, \u201cis that the tobacco industry is clearly shown to have been involved in \u2018Big Food\u2019 developing their products to become addictive. The tobacco industry owned many food companies and poured millions into research to find how addiction works, and then applied this to processed food. And it has clearly worked (for food, too). They also shared the marketing, corporate \u2018washing\u2019 and other aspects of their playbook to maximise profits.\n\n\u201cThis is just a section of what is now referred to as the \u2018industry playbook\u2019,\u201d Goldstein said, \u201cand unfortunately other industries (such as Big Food and Big Alcohol) use the same playbook to prioritise their profits over health.\u201d\n\nWill the outcome of this court case finally turn the tide on UPFs? A US-based source who did not want to be named but is an expert on the US legal system, told Daily Maverick that \u201cthere\u2019s definitely an expectation that there will be many similar lawsuits, which would be consolidated in one or a few courts for pretrial proceedings\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of mass torts can involve hundreds of cases to, at the very high end, hundreds of thousands.\u201d Such cases are different from \u2018class actions\u2019, in which large numbers of people jointly sue, \u201cbut they usually end with a common settlement\u201d.\n\nThe date for the actual court case is still to be determined.\n\nSulcas is a writer and senior adviser for Daily Maverick\u2019s \u2018Food Justice\u2019 project, writing about food policy and systems, and intersections with climate and health.\n\nPubMed article \u2013 Dietary intake of low-income adults in South Africa: ultra-processed food consumption a cause for concern (Open access)\n\nGlobal Public Health article \u2013 Sugar and health in South Africa: Potential challenges to leveraging policy change (Open access)\n\nResearchGate article \u2013 National Food and Nutrition: South Africa (Open access)\n\nDaily Maverick article \u2013 Unprecedented lawsuit against ultra-processed food companies \u2014 Big Food on trial (Open access)\n\nSee more from MedicalBrief archives:\n\nWake-up call for governments as studies flag high risk of ultra processed foods\n\nUltra-processed food linked to higher death risk \u2013 30-year study\n\nUltra-processed foods linked to 32 health problems, large review finds\n\nAnother study links ultra-processed food to higher cancer risk\n\nUltra-processed foods should be labelled \u2018addictive\u2019, say scientists",

            "content": "Investment fund Blue Whale Growth has made a lot of money for investors since its launch more than seven years ago \u2013 and manager Stephen Yiu is determined to keep the impressive track record going.\n\nThe \u00a31.2 billion fund, backed by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has delivered a total return of 162 per cent since launching in September 2017 \u2013 equivalent to an annual return of more than 14 per cent, net of fees.\n\nYet Yiu is not resting on his laurels. His aspiration is to deliver annual returns of 15 per cent, although not in a straight line.\n\nThough running a tight portfolio, comprising just 26 global stocks and one which remains fully invested at all times, Yiu is not frightened to make big calls.\n\nUnlike some global fund managers, Blue Whale Growth is light on the 'magnificent seven' US stocks \u2013 big drivers of the US stock market in recent years \u2013 and big on 'idiosyncratic' companies which he believes have businesses capable of withstanding any economic slowdown or sharp market corrections.\n\nCurrently, the fund only holds shares in magnificent seven stocks Nvidia (8 per cent), Meta (3 per cent) and Microsoft (1.5 per cent).\n\n'We do not own Alphabet, Amazon, Apple or Tesla,' says Yiu.\n\n'In effect, we are overweight in Nvidia and short on the other magnificent six.'\n\nThis time last year, the respective holdings in Nvidia, Meta and Microsoft were 9, 4 and 8 per cent.\n\nYiu's view is that the 'narrative could change' next year for the magnificent seven \u2013 chipmaker Nvidia excepted \u2013 as revenues are eroded by vast expenditure on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis, he says, could lead to corrections in their share prices and a 'year of reckoning' for funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, of which the big technology stocks are a key component.\n\nUnlike active funds such as Blue Whale Growth, such tracker or passive funds cannot reduce their exposure to the big tech giants ahead of any sell-off.\n\n'They must hold the S&P 500,' he says. 'Maybe, next year, we could see a rejuvenation of investor interest in active funds generally.'\n\nBlue Whale Growth has exposure to the AI theme beyond the magnificent seven. It has key holdings in US companies Broadcom (its biggest holding) and Vertiv. 'Broadcom,' says Yiu, 'could be the new Nvidia in terms of outperforming the rest of the market.'\n\nYet Yiu also has big stakes in companies that he describes as 'idiosyncratic' \u2013 businesses that should grow irrespective of the prevailing economic conditions.\n\nAmong them is US-listed sports betting and gaming company Flutter which Yiu says is on a 'great journey' as more American states legalise sports gambling. 'American consumers like their sport and their gambling,' he adds.\n\nOther idiosyncratic holdings include German company Sartorius and US-listed Danaher, both making waves in bioprocessing.\n\nThere is also US tobacco stock Philip Morris which has diversified into nicotine pouches and smoke-free alternatives to conventional cigarettes.\n\nBlue Whale Growth's success means, provided the fund finishes the year above \u00a31billion, it will rebate one per cent of its annual management charge to investors.\n\nMost investors in this fund pay an annual management charge of 0.75 per cent, so the rebate will drop this fee to 0.7425 per cent.\n\nIt will be cut by another one per cent if \u2013 'when' (Yiu's word) \u2013 the fund gets to \u00a32 billion.\n\nWhile three-quarters of the fund's assets are exposed to US-listed shares, only 40 per cent of the revenues generated by all the holdings are from the US.",

This is the first time that this has happened. The list of defendants is quite something, and certainly worth spelling out in full: Kraft Heinz; Mondelez; Coca Cola; Pepsico; General Mills; Nestle; Mars; Kellogg\u2019s; as well as Post Holdings, Kellanova, and Conagra Brands. Post Holidings is a Philip Morris spin-off; Kellanova is a Kellogg\u2019s spin-off.\n\nAdvancing\n\nFuturists like cases such as this because we see them as a sign that an issue might be moving from the \u2018Advancing\u2019 stage of Graham Molitor\u2019s policy S-curve into the choppy waters between \u2018Advancing\u2019 and \u2018Resolving\u2019.\n\n(\u2018Advancing\u2019 is that stage in the S-curve where there is general agreement among advocates of change on what the issue is, and why it is an issue, but it\u2019s not that salient to policy makers or government and public institutions. \u2018Resolving\u2019 is the area where the issue has the attention of policy-makers, and you start to see regulations and so on start to change as a result.)\n\nThe whole UPF issue has been advancing quite fast. Chris Van Tulleken\u2019s high profile book is one example of that. There\u2019s been a wave of advocacy reports getting into details like the external costs of Big Food (which are fast), another sign that it\u2019s hitting the grey area between Advancing and Resolving. The House of Lords committee report that I mentioned recently at Just Two Things is another example of this.\n\nLegal cases are often sighting shots in this process.\n\nTelling a story\n\nThe other reason that futurists like cases like this, especially in the United States where law is conducted as a public contest, is that the documents submitted to the court include a lot of data. And so it is in this case. Here the law firm acting for the plaintiff is Morgan & Morgan, America\u2019s largest personal injury law firm, and the document is on their website.\n\nObviously serious American lawyers don\u2019t get to be that way without knowing how to make a case, and even the Introduction tells quite a story.\n\nLet me pick out a few paragraphs from this. It kicks off by asserting that ultra-processed foods [UPF] are\n\none of the greatest threats to our health, and the health of our children.\n\nThen it describes ultra-processed foods as being\n\nindustrially produced edible substances that are imitations of food. They consist of former foods that have been fractioned into substances, chemically modified, combined with additives, and then reassembled using industrial techniques such as molding, extrusion and pressurization.\n\nAlien\n\nIncidentally, if you\u2019re interested in all of this, the whole lawsuit is extensively referenced and sourced.\n\nAnd then the next paragraphs get onto the (alleged) impact:\n\nUPF are alien to prior human experience. They are inventions of modern industrial technology and contain little to no whole food. However, the prevalence of these foods exploded in the 1980s, and have come to dominate the American food environment and the American diet. The issue is particularly pronounced in children, who now derive over 2/3 of their energy from UPF on average. The explosion and ensuing rise in UPF in the 1980s was accompanied by an explosion in obesity, diabetes, and other life-changing chronic illnesses.\n\nSome of the consequences are well known\u2014non-communicable diseases associated with ageing started appearing at younger ages in the population. But what\u2019s interesting about the lawsuit is that it tells a business story about why there was an explosion of UPFs in the 1980s. And at the heart of the business story is not Big Food, but Big Tobacco.\n\nThe tobacco connection\n\nThis is the result, it says (and you have to keep remembering that an argument is being made here as you read it, even if it is a well-researched argument) of the tobacco companies Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds buying up a stack of food companies in the 1980s.\n\nCollectively, Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds dominated the US food system for decades. During this time, they used their cigarette playbook to fill our food environment with addictive substances that are aggressively marketed to children and minorities. UPF formulation strategies were guided by the same tobacco company scientists and the same kind of brain research on sensory perceptions, physiological psychology, and chemical senses that were used to increase the addictiveness of cigarettes.\n\nHacking our brains\n\nThese two claims are well-sourced as well, including some tantalising footnotes that reference inter-office memos between named scientists in 1990 and 1991.\n\nBig Tobacco companies intentionally designed UPF to hack the physiological structures of our brains. These formulation strategies were quickly adopted throughout the UPF industry, with the goal of driving consumption, and defendants\u2019 profits, at all costs\u2026 At the same time, Big Tobacco repurposed marketing strategies designed to sell cigarettes to children and minorities, and aggressively marketed UPF to these groups.\n\nThe case states that the US food industry now spends about $2 billion a year marketing UPFs to children; and that \u201cUPFs meet all the scientific criteria that were used to determine that tobacco products are addictive.\u201d\n\n(Down with the kids in a Walmart store. Photo: Thayne Tuason, via Wikimedia, CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nSecret meeting\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the case seems\u2014to me, as a non-lawyer\u2014to turn on a similar claim that has previously caused legal problems for both Big Tobacco and Big Oil: that executives at the food companies knew of the harm that UPFs were doing several decades ago, and chose to ignore it and carry on:\n\nIn April 1999, the CEOs of America\u2019s largest UPF companies attended a secret meeting in Minneapolis to discuss the devastating public health consequences of UPF and their conduct.\n\nThe plaintiff, Bryce Martinez, has Type 2 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease since the age 16, and alleges that is the result of his consumption of UPFs.\n\nI\u2019ve just summarised the Introduction here, but if you\u2019re interested in the detail there\u2019s a 98-page section of Statement of Facts that goes into the detail. It includes some pretty questionable examples of advertising to children along the way.\n\nBlowing smoke\n\nI\u2019d expected to do a quick news search and find at least one public affairs spokesperson for one of these companies declaring the case to be \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cwithout merit\u201d, which usually happens in response to anti-corporate lawsuits in the US. Not a peep. The best I could find was a statement from a policy person at the food and beverage industry group Consumer Brands Association blowing smoke (pun not intended but quite pleasing):\n\n\u201cThere is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods\u2026 Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.\u201d\n\nI think this is known in the trade as a non-denial denial.\n\nAn earlier post by Marion Nestle on UPFs summarised three studies that found that a UPF-heavy diet would lead you to eat around 1,000 calories a day more than if you had a unprocessed food diet.\n\nAn initial case\n\nA couple of notes from me: the first is that an initial case such as this is sometimes an attempt\u2014through the coverage it gets\u2014to bring more plaintiffs into the open, which makes it harder for the defendants to swat the case away, and makes the case easier to fund. And given that Morgan & Morgan is a personal injury lawyer and not a public interest lawyer, we can assume they are fairly sure that there\u2019s potential here for mass tort or a class action suit.\n\nSecondly, having watched my local Sainsbury\u2019s reorganise its shelves recently, it\u2019s increasingly hard to find non-processed foods outside of fruit and veg, some of the bread and cakes, and some of the dairy products. If I were running a supermarket in the current climate, I might be a bit more careful about my category mix.\n\n\u2014\n\nA version of this article is also published on my Just Two Things Newsletter.\n\nTeaser photo credit: Thayne Tuason, via Wikimedia, CC BY-SA 4.0)",

In an exclusive interview with Charles Bendotti from Philip Morris International (the first multinational company to earn the EQUAL-SALARY certification), we discussed:\n\nRecent trends in pay equality\n\nWhy equal pay for equal work is critical to the modern organization\u2019s ethos\n\nHow to ensure a free, fair, and diverse workplace\n\nDespite the equal pay debate gaining momentum in the last few years, there continues to be a persistent wage gap among male and female workers. Glassdoor\u2019s 2019 report Opens a new window indicates that the pay gap in the U.S. has shrunk from 6.5% in 2011 to 4.6% in 2018. However, it could take until the year 2070 to achieve equal pay for equal work.\n\nWe sat down with Charles Bendotti, SVP of People & Culture at Philip Morris InternationalOpens a new window (PMI), to discuss how organizations can take a positive step towards equitable wages and challenges they might face on the way.\n\nLearn More: 5 Steps to Closing the Gender Pay Gap\n\nWhy It\u2019s So Important to Offer Equal Pay for Equal Work\n\nWage equality isn\u2019t only a question of ethics and organizational values. It positions companies as a preferred employer to different types of talent, encouraging persons of different genders, minority groups, and languages to apply for a job there. This has two clear benefits:\n\nThe organization can access a wider pool of talent\n\nThe workforce becomes more diverse, enabling innovation and driving productivity\n\n\u201cEqual pay for equal work is a fundamental first step to take to help advance equality in the workplace and society. It builds trust with employees, increases attractiveness to prospective talent, and helps shape an inclusive and diverse working environment,\u201d Bendotti said, adding that building a more inclusive workplace culture was an essential enabler for business transformation at PMI.\n\nInterestingly, PMI is the world\u2019s first multinational company to become a certified EQUAL-SALARY providerOpens a new window . This covers the company\u2019s massive workforce spread across 90 countries around the world. Other known organizations that possess this certification are PwC Switzerland and the World Economic Forum.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a fair and equal opportunity to fully participate and contribute, to be recognized, rewarded and feel valued for their contribution \u2013 irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation or any other dimension of their identity,\u201d Bendotti mentioned.\n\nHowever, organizations could face some challenges when trying to outline an effective blueprint to offer \u201cequal pay for equal work.\u201d Let\u2019s look at these in further detail.\n\nLearn More: Equal Pay Day 2019: Why Technology and Culture are Crucial to Closing the Gender Pay Gap\n\nHow to Overcome Roadblocks and Come Out on the Right Side of the Equal Pay Debate\n\nMinority representation and inadequate workplace diversity are significant challenges for any large organization. In fact, a new survey reports that black women continue to face major barriers to career advancement \u2013 and wage inequality is a big part of this.\n\nGlassdoor found out that men and women approach an organization with the same level of wage expectations. Despite this, a persistent gap remains between the average salary of men and that of women, even when adjusted differences in their roles. For every dollar a male employee earns, a woman earns 95.1 cents in the U.S. This is in addition to the lack of female representation in certain roles, industry-specific hiring bias, and other discriminatory practices.\n\nOrganizations looking to overcome this and offer equal pay for equal work throughout their organizational hierarchy have a tough road ahead. Bendotti recommends an external verification process like the global EQUAL-SALARY certificationOpens a new window as the first step in this direction.\n\n\u201cThis independent verification work was an important step to further foster gender equality in our workplace. While it does not directly address the gender-balance gap in leadership roles, it helped us uncover potential blind spots that could hinder equal opportunities for women to advance,\u201d Bendotti mentioned. The certification took over 18 months to complete and involved a rigorous audit, including interviews with the company\u2019s leadership team and a review of HR policies.\n\nAnother concern in the equal pay debate is the difference in starting salaries for male and female workers. When switching jobs, employees seek an approximately 33% raise on their previous salary \u2013 regardless of gender. However, a wage gap in the early years of a woman\u2019s career translates into an increasing variance in the later stages, compounded by the lack of women in leadership positions. To overcome this, HR could benefit from adopting a \u201cno salary history\u201d hiring policy, assessing candidates only on the basis of expertise and demonstratable skills.\n\nPMI is eager to help increase female participation in leadership roles \u2013 Bendotti notes incremental improvements made in the last five years: \u201cToday, women hold 35.5% of all management roles at PMI, up 6.1 percentage points since the end of 2014. While we\u2019re on track to meet our goal of at least 40% of women in management by 2022, I recognize that we must continue to improve our female representation at senior leadership levels, and I\u2019m personally committed to making that happen.\u201d\n\nWe also recommend using data analytics to address the pay gap. Using the widespread data available in silos across organizations, you can create a clear picture of the existing gaps in your organization. Using that data, you can revamp your recruitment and hiring process, ensuring that you hire for skills while reducing this pay gap as much as possible.\n\nLearn More: How AI in HR Will Close the Gender Pay Gap\n\nEnsuring Equal Pay, an Inclusive Culture, and a Diversity-friendly Workplace: Takeaways for HR\n\nIn June of this year, the equal pay debate was reignited when the U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer team publicly called for pay equity legislation. When calls for equal pay occur at a global level, it can be a cue for HR to use these voices for positive change in the workplace and push for diversity & inclusion- (D&I-) based transformation on the policy level. This includes:\n\nLeveraging skill-based hiring techniques to prevent gender bias at the recruitment stage\n\nOffering mentorships and other career progression opportunities to female leadership candidates\n\nBuilding secure and, if possible, anonymous communication lines to identify any inequitable activity in the workplace\n\nAs Bendotti mentioned, equal pay for equal work is the \u201cright thing to do\u201d for all stakeholders. \u201cYour employees will thank you for it, and you\u2019ll be able to engage management across the organization to get on board,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd winning the equal pay debate is only the first step. Inspired by these conversations, organizations can make diversity and equality a core part of their DNA, positively contributing to their societal footprint.\n\nHave you assessed your organization for wage equality?

            "content": "As we head into 2025, investors are reflecting on what was a red-hot 2024 for the stock market. Despite ending on a softer-than-expected note as the Fed tempered rate cut expectations, it was still a solid year all around, and the mood remains optimistic.\n\nHowever, with last year's 20% rally fresh in mind, many are questioning whether the market can sustain such momentum for another 12 months. While individual opportunities for this kind of appreciation remain, another strategy to consider is to focus on dividend-paying stocks.\n\nDividend stocks not only provide a reliable income stream but also offer stability, even in unpredictable market conditions. For those looking to enhance returns, here are three Dividend Kings with strong yields that can strengthen your portfolio this year, regardless of how the broader market or individual stock prices perform.\n\n1. Altria Group\n\nDespite falling 10% through December, shares of tobacco giant Altria Group Inc MO still managed to finish 2024 up around 30%. While they need to start trading beyond the $60 level to show they've truly broken out of this multi-year range, this is the best they've looked in a long time.\n\nThe fact their dividend yield is 7.7% will only add to investors' temptation. Altria's dividend has more than 50 years of continuous growth behind it, so it's no wonder it's considered one of the most reliable dividend-paying stocks out there.\n\nCoupled with the fact that Bank of America upgraded its rating on the underlying stock last month and gave it a $65 price target, you're looking at one of the more attractive stocks to own for 2025.\n\n2. Philip Morris International\n\nLike Altria, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE PM) is another tobacco stalwart with an industry-wide reputation for a strong dividend. They boast more than 16 years' worth of dividend growth, along with a 4.46% dividend yield.\n\nIn addition, the PM stock is looking quite attractive right now. After gaining more than 50% from April through November 2024, the stock price fell at the end of the year. But this is starting to look like a golden entry opportunity.\n\nPM's relative strength index (RSI) is in the mid-30s, suggesting it's close to being extremely oversold. For those of us on the sidelines who are keen to add a strong dividend-paying stock to our portfolio for 2025, potential entry points don't get a whole lot better than this.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nRounding out our list is telecommunications titan Verizon Communications Inc VZ. The stock traded mostly sideways through 2024 and started 2025 towards the bottom of that range. However, with a dividend yield of 6.74%, don't be surprised if Wall Street starts taking advantage of bargain prices.\n\nAt the close of last week, Verizon shares were officially extremely oversold, as per their RSI, so it's fair to expect some kind of bounce back in the near term. Given their strong 20-year track record of dividend growth, there's a lot to like about the stock.\n\nWhile two analysts rated the stock Neutral in December, both gave refreshed price targets that are well above where Verizon shares are trading right now. It will be interesting to see if the stock can continue to consolidate above the $39 level in the coming weeks. One trade to consider is starting to build a position around here and adding to it as it turns north again. And receiving a dividend yield of nearly 7% while you wait for this isn't the worst way to start the new year.\n\nThe article \"3 Must-Have Dividend Kings for 2025\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

However, it is important to note that analysis-based projections do not always align with actual outcomes.\n\nThe seven stocks\n\nBetween 2014 and 2023, BAT Bangladesh achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% in revenue and 13.8% in net profit. Additionally, its recent agreement to manufacture cigarettes for Philip Morris Bangladesh Limited, the producer of Marlboro, is expected to significantly boost its topline.\n\nThe company has consistently invested around Tk900 crore in capital expenditures, positioning itself to enhance margins through improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced production costs while meeting both local and international demand.\n\nCurrently, BAT Bangladesh trades at Tk360 per share, reflecting a price-earnings ratio of 11.02, compared to the market average of 17.7.\n\nThis suggests the stock is trading at an attractive valuation relative to its historical averages, presenting a potential buying opportunity for investors, according to Shanta Securities.\n\nShanta Securities said BRAC Bank's board comprises distinguished professionals and academic leaders who ensure robust asset management. BRAC, the renowned international NGO, holds a 46.2% ownership stake in the bank. Notably, 60% of the board members are independent directors, a unique feature in the industry.\n\nThe brokerage firm projects the loan book to grow further to Tk91,300 crore by 2028, representing a five-year expected CAGR of 11.5%.\n\nDespite an industry-wide rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), BRAC Bank has consistently maintained its NPL ratio below 4% since 2016, reflecting its commitment to good governance. As of 30 September 2024, the NPL ratio stood at an impressive 2.8%.\n\nShanta Securities sets the target price of Grameenphone shares to Tk380, which currently trade at Tk323. The brokerage firm expects investors to achieve a return of 17.6% from Grameenphone shares.\n\nIBN Sina Pharma is set to launch a second factory specialising in oral solid dosages, sterile products, and oncology medicines. This expansion is expected to significantly boost in-house manufacturing capacity, enabling the company to meet growing demand and adapt to evolving market trends, according to the broker.\n\nThe commercial production of the API unit will commence once the necessary licences are obtained from the drug administration. Meanwhile, work on the polymer unit is progressing steadily. As these projects become operational, Shanta Securities anticipates a consistent improvement in the company's margin ratios.\n\nITC is the first private third-party Payment Service Operator company in Bangladesh licenced by the Bangladesh Bank. It is the owner of the largest payment platform in Bangladesh, known as Q-Cash. At present, 36 banks are using different electronic payment services of the Q-Cash network.\n\nITC's revenue growth is linked with the country's digital journey as Q-cash is an electronic payment system. With increased usage of online banking systems and card transactions, the company's earnings will increase, said the securities firm.\n\nCapitalising on this favourable business environment, investors could potentially earn a 54.1% return from ITC shares, which are currently considered undervalued, according to Shanta Securities.\n\nDirectors of Square Pharma have increased their stake in the company by purchasing 91 lakh shares at prevailing market prices from the secondary market. This move reflects the directors' confidence in the company's strong fundamentals and future growth potential, according to Shanta Securities.\n\nAdditionally, the parent company is progressively transferring its products to Square Lifesciences Limited, which benefits from a favourable 3% tax rate.\n\nSimilarly, Square Kenya Limited, a tax-exempt entity, is gaining momentum in the Kenyan market. The scaling up of operations in these tax-advantaged entities is expected to significantly boost overall profitability, the brokerage firm noted.\n\nThese strategic advantages position Square Pharma to deliver improved returns for investors, Shanta Securities added.\n\nMarico has a strong track record of delivering solid returns to its investors, a trend that is likely to continue with its increased production capacity, according to Shanta Securities.\n\nHowever, the firm cautioned that anti-India sentiment could temporarily disrupt the company's growth momentum.\n\nDespite this risk, Shanta Securities projects a potential return of 31.4% on Marico shares this year for investors.",

PHOTO: AFP\n\nLONDON \u2013 British novelist David Lodge, who was shortlisted for the Booker Prize twice, has died at the age of 89, his publisher said on Jan 3.\n\nThe English author was best known for Small World (1984) and Nice Work (1988), which were nominated for the prestigious literary award in the 1980s.\n\nHe died peacefully on New Year\u2019s Day, Penguin Random House said, without giving a cause of death.\n\n\u201cHis contribution to literary culture was immense, both in his criticism and through his masterful and iconic novels which have already become classics,\u201d said Lodge\u2019s publisher, Ms Liz Foley.\n\nLodge\u2019s family said they were very proud of the writer, who was renowned for his plays, memoirs and TV scripts, as well as his books.\n\nSmall World and Nice Work came after Changing Places (1975) and made up his campus trilogy series about a fictional university called Rummidge. It followed professors Philip Swallow from England and Morris Zapp from the United States and the cultural challenges they face when they swop universities for six months.\n\nLodge garnered a worldwide following for his comical, cynical take on middle-class life in more than a dozen novels, many mining the worlds of academia and Catholicism.\n\nIn 2008, The Guardian newspaper described him as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s best-loved comic writers\u201d, while A Clockwork Orange (1962) author Anthony Burgess called him \u201cone of the best novelists of his generation\u201d.\n\nLodge was born in south-east London on Jan 28, 1935, into a Catholic household. His father was a professional dance musician and his mother was a housewife .\n\nA gifted student, Lodge read literature at University College London, where he met fellow student Mary Jacob, whom he married in 1959.\n\n\u2018Captured Britain perfectly\u2019\n\nA year later, he took a teaching job at the University of Birmingham and published his first novel The Picturegoers (1960), a multi-character social exploration set around a local cinema.\n\nWith his third novel, The British Museum Is Falling Down (1965), Lodge hit his stride with a well-received comic story of the life of a procrastinating student trying to work \u2013 and being endlessly distracted \u2013 in the British Museum\u2019s reading room.\n\nTen years later, Changing Places introduced Swallow and Zapp.\n\nThe novel \u2013 which was inspired by Lodge\u2019s own academic experience and a long study trip he had made to the US \u2013 won the prestigious Hawthorn Prize and marked the beginning of his most popular and critically successful phase.\n\nThe New York Times called Small World an \u201cexuberant, bawdy and wickedly satiric sequel\u201d. The novel and Nice Work , which completed the trilogy, were both later adapted for television in 1988 and 1989 respectively.\n\nThe books missed out on Booker prizes to late English novelist Anita Brookner in 1984 and Australian novelist Peter Carey in 1988.\n\nThe Times of London described Lodge in 2018 as one of the prize\u2019s \u201cmost notable unwinners\u201d.\n\n\u201cLodge will be read long after most of his peers for the simple reason that, in his early work, he captured Britain so perfectly,\u201d The Guardian wrote in 2008 about the witty and wicked portraits of 1960s liberalism.\n\nLodge taught in the English department at the University of Birmingham between 1960 and 1987 before retiring to focus on writing.\n\nAs well as novels, he wrote extensive literary criticism in academic journals, two fictional biographies \u2013 on authors Henry James and H.G. Wells \u2013 and two volumes of his memoirs.\n\nLodge continued to draw from his own life for fresh inspiration for his fiction, including his late onset deafness which is at the heart of his 13th novel, Deaf Sentence (2008).\n\n\u201cI have been rather cautious,\u201d Lodge told The Guardian in 2008, explaining how he had found the time to write when he had also been working full-time in academia. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed in one place. Having a stable married life is important. People who get into divorce, remarriage, custody and all that. It\u2019s terribly consuming of time and energy.\u201d\n\nHis wife died in January 2022. He is survived by their three children \u2013 Stephen, Christopher and Julia. AFP\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

The Young family moved to Burwood in the 1960\u2019s from Scotland and attended both Burwood Public Primary School and Ashfield Boys High School.\n\nDesigned directly in consultation with the Young family, the mural is based on a photo of the band from the 1970\u2019s by photographer Phillip Morris in the early days of the band\u2019s formation. The blurred background in the design is also in reference to the original facade of 4 Burleigh Street.\n\nStay updated with your free Noise11.com daily music news email alert.

            "content": "Investing in profitable companies when their stock prices offer high yields can be very rewarding over the long term. If you have a few hundred dollars that you don't need for reducing debt or covering other living expenses, there are solid companies offering tempting dividend yields right now.\n\nRealty Income (O 1.49%), Target (TGT 0.19%), and Philip Morris International (PM 0.92%) have dividend yields that are well above the S&P 500 average of 1.24%. Here's why three fool.com contributors believe they are smart buys for 2025 and beyond.\n\nA forever stock ready for 2025\n\nJennifer Saibil (Realty Income): Realty Income is one of the best dividend stocks to own at any time, but 2025 could be an important year for the real estate industry in general, and Realty Income's business could be even stronger than usual.\n\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT). This is a structure where companies pay out 90% of their earnings as dividends, which is why REITs are great dividend stocks. The typical setup is that they own properties and rent them out, usually to a specific sector. Realty Income is a retail REIT, and it leases properties to retail chains like Walmart and Home Depot.\n\nSince it leases predominantly to high-quality tenants that sell essentials, it has demonstrated resilience throughout the last five years, starting with the pandemic and heading into the recent poor real estate climate. It has an occupancy rate of 98.7%, and it rarely dips below that.\n\nIt has become one of the largest REITs in the world with more than 15,000 properties, and it grows through a mix of buying new properties and acquiring smaller REITs. It has a comfortable cash position to keep that up and has identified plenty of new targets to expand and fund its dividned.\n\nThere are several reasons why Realty Income is one of the best REITs out there. One is the strength of its business. A great dividend stock starts with a well-established business. Other features to add on top of that are a long track record of increases, reliable payments, and a high yield.\n\nRealty Income has paid a dividend for 654 consecutive months, and it has raised it for 109 consecutive quarters. It is one of the few companies that pay a monthly dividend, an extra feature that makes it even more attractive. The dividend yields 5.9% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average, and higher than many REITs.\n\nOften, when a REIT's dividend yield gets very high, it's a red flag and implies risk. Realty Income's stock is down on consumer pessimism about the real estate industry, but it's managing effectively through the turbulence. The yield is usually high, but it's higher than average due to short-term concerns. This is more than an opportunity to buy on the dip, which investors shouldn't miss. It's an opportunity to buy an excellent, all-weather stock that pays a high yield rain or shine, and every month to boot.\n\nTarget has paid a dividend for over 50 years\n\nJohn Ballard (Target): Cautious consumer spending has hit many retailers, including Target, over the last year. A cautious shopper and other cost pressures resulting from port strikes have weighed on Target's business and stock performance.\n\nFor a long-term investor focusing on dividends, it's a good buying opportunity. Target has paid a dividend since 1967, which speaks volumes about the strength of its retail operation.\n\nThe shares currently offer an attractive 3.24% forward dividend yield at a share price of $138, yet the company only pays out 47% of earnings in dividends. This suggests Target can maintain and grow its dividend for years to come.\n\nPeople will be in a spending mood again. To its benefit, Target is still seeing positive traffic to its stores, but a 2% decline in average ticket prices dragged down its comparable-store sales, which grew only 0.3% year over year last quarter. Management cited weakness in apparel and home categories, but this should set up a growth opportunity when the economy improves.\n\nOver the long term, Target should benefit from its focus on exclusive products through partnerships and growing sales through its Target Circle 360 program, which helped drive nearly 20% growth in same-day delivery last quarter.\n\nOverall, Target's history of paying dividends, growing earnings, and delivering value to shoppers should provide growing passive income to shareholders for many years.\n\nThis dividend stock is smoking hot\n\nJeremy Bowman (Philip Morris): If you've got less than $200 to invest in the stock market, and you're looking for a dividend stock to buy, I can think of few better options than Philip Morris.\n\nThe tobacco stock has outperformed top rivals like Altria and British American Tobacco by successfully pivoting to next-generation products like iQOS heat-not-burn tobacco sticks and Zyn nicotine pouches, which it gained in its 2022 acquisition of Swedish Match. In fact, next-gen products now make up nearly 40% of the company's revenue.\n\nDriven by strong growth in those categories and a solid performance in its traditional cigarette business, which supplies brands like Marlboro to international markets, Philip Morris stock jumped 28% in 2024, and it looks primed for more growth in 2025.\n\nThe company has just started selling iQOS in the U.S. after acquiring the rights to distribute it from Altria, and it's invested in new manufacturing capacity for Zyn in the U.S., showing its confidence in continued growth from the nicotine pouches. In the third quarter, the company reported 17% organic growth in smoke-free products. Overall revenue was up 11.6% on an organic basis to $9.9 billion, as the company also claimed its highest market share in combustibles since its spin-off from Altria in 2008. Organic operating income rose 14% to $3.7 billion, and it raised its earnings per share guidance for the year.\n\nLike other international stocks, Philip Morris stock fell after the election, as investors fear that a stronger dollar will pressure the company's results. That reaction looks overblown, as Philip Morris has little exposure to tariffs, and it operates in a recession-proof industry.\n\nAfter that pullback, the stock now offers a dividend yield of 4.5% and trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 19. With momentum building in products like iQOS and Zyn, the stock looks like a strong buy for 2025, especially for investors looking for dividend income.",

            "content": "When I was a teenager, David Lodge, who died last week at the age of 89, meant more to me than any other writer. It wasn\u2019t only that his novels were so wildly entertaining and funny. My parents had been born into the optimistic but class-ridden postwar world he caught with such precision, and for this reason I saw his tales of campus life as helpful guides to the more baffling aspects of adult behaviour.\n\nThere was no getting away from the fact that my father, a university lecturer, had an amazing amount in common with both conformist Philip Swallow and randy Morris Zapp, the two professors who enjoy a transatlantic exchange in Changing Places (the first of a trilogy set in Rummidge, a city modelled on Birmingham, where Lodge both lived and taught).\n\nOnce I\u2019d somehow emerged into the adult world myself, Lodge was at the top of the list of people I longed to interview, and in 2008 I finally made this happen. But, having travelled to his bright, modern house in Edgbaston, fully prepared to die of mirth on his living room carpet, a surprise awaited me. In person, Lodge, though clever and sensitive and overall quite delightful, was very far from a laugh fest. He told me that when I described his life to him, so successful and replete, it sounded wonderful \u2013 and yet, he\u2019d never been able fully to enjoy it himself.\n\nWriters, of course, are often very little like their books \u2013 and what\u2019s wrong with that? The imagination is all. Nevertheless, I couldn\u2019t help myself.\n\nAt the end of our encounter, Mary, his wife of almost 50 years, returned home. She was a hoot, and in her presence Prof Lodge perked up exponentially. On the train home, I developed a theory that she had secretly helped him with his most comic books, a bit like \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 the narrator of Meg Wolitzer\u2019s feminist novel of literary life, The Wife.\n\nLadybird, ladybird\n\nView image in fullscreen Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in \u2018her\u2019 Netflix kitchen. Photograph: Netflix/PA\n\nIf I\u2019m fascinated (in a twisted way) with the trailer for the forthcoming Netflix series With Love, Meghan, in which the Duchess of Sussex can be seen serving bruschetta that look like ladybirds, I\u2019m completely obsessed with the Daily Mail\u2019s tenaciously rapid response to its appearance.\n\nNo sooner had the clip been released than its correspondents had discovered that the house where everything happens is not Meghan\u2019s, but that of a rich, \u201cphilanthropic\u201d couple in their 70s; that the chopping boards we can see in the kitchen are made of black walnut, cost \u00a360 and provide an \u201ceasy aesthetic vibe\u201d; and that the pudding Meghan makes \u201cappears to resemble Eton Mess\u201d. It\u2019s quite the achievement to make a melange of strawberries and cream sound sinister, even menacing, but somehow the Mail has done it.\n\nYellow warnings\n\nView image in fullscreen Blooming worried? Daffodil in flower on Christmas Day in Binfield, Oxfordshire. Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBy the time you read this, the country may be blanketed in snow \u2013 though in my mind, it\u2019s been this way for days. Over Christmas, I read Andrew Miller\u2019s perfect new novel, The Land in Winter, about two unhappy couples who find themselves marooned in the West Country during the famously fierce winter of 1962/63.\n\nIn the 21st century, we\u2019re a little hysterical about weather \u2013 sometimes with good reason and sometimes not. Personally, I\u2019m not in a panic about the prospect of blizzards; we\u2019re a long way now from 1963, when people in Oxford could drive their cars to their neighbours across a frozen Thames.\n\nNo, what\u2019s filling me with trepidation is the fact that, since 1 January, daffodils have been happily blooming in our garden. To pinch from TS Eliot, the soul\u2019s sap quivers. Never has their mellow yellow seemed less cheery.",

            "content": "Daniel White, Kristine Duffy and Philip Morris joined Arrow Financial's board of directors last month. Arrow Financial\n\nArrow Financial in Glens Falls, New York, is entering 2025 with a new brand, an expanded board and a reconfigured investment portfolio.\n\nThe $4.4 billion-asset Arrow announced Thursday that it had consolidated its two bank subsidiaries, Glens Falls National Bank and Trust and Saratoga National Bank and Trust . Arrow styled the unified institution Arrow Bank.\n\nThe consolidation aims to align \"our mission, vision and values across all areas of our business,\" President and CEO David DeMarco said in a press release. \"While our brand evolves, our unwavering commitment to quality service, trusted relationships and community engagement remains unchanged.\"\n\nArrow's fourth-quarter results will reflect approximately $1.2 million in rebranding-related expenses: $500,000 in professional and legal fees, along with a $700,000 charge for branding materials and signage, according to the company.\n\nArrow initially signaled its intent to refresh its brand in July, after receiving the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's permission to consolidate its subsidiary banks.\n\nJames Dawsey\n\nAccording to Hovde analyst Feddie Strickland, the consolidation effort probably won't yield an appreciable amount of savings for Arrow, though it should result in streamlined operations. \"The elimination of duplicative charter-level duties frees up employees for other tasks, reducing the need for additional headcount longer-term,\" Strickland wrote in a Dec. 27 research note.\n\nArrow paired its rebranding with a balance sheet restructuring transaction that saw the company offload $75 million in lower-yielding securities, then reinvest the proceeds in higher-yielding investments. Arrow, which disclosed the move Dec. 26, said the securities it sold carried an average book yield of approximately 0.6%. Their weighted average remaining life was 1.3 years. While the newly acquired securities are longer duration \u2014 weighted average remaining life of 4.5 years \u2014 their average book yield is approximately 4.4%.\n\nThe transaction will result in a $3 million hit to fourth-quarter earnings, but the earn-back is relatively brisk at 1.3 years, the company estimated. Going forward, the deal is expected to boost Arrow's annual 2025 earnings by $2.7 million.\n\n\"We like the securities restructuring and short earnback,\" Strickland wrote in his Dec. 27 note.\n\nArrow reported net income totaling $9 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Thus, the cumulative securities losses and rebranding costs aren't likely to produce a fourth-quarter loss. Profit through the first nine months of 2024 totaled $25.2 million, a 13% increase from the same period in 2023.\n\nArrow's asset sale comes on the heels of similar restructuring moves by other financial institutions in recent weeks. The $23.8 billion-asset First Hawaiian Bancorp in Honolulu announced a $293 million securities sale on Dec. 9, while the $42 billion-asset Associated Banc-Corp in Green Bay, Wisconsin, announced plans to sell a $2 billion block of lower-yielding mortgage loans and securities on Dec. 4. The next day, the $10.7 billion-asset Columbia Financial in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, said it had sold $321 million of lower-yielding securities.\n\nArrow disclosed its board expansion on Dec. 19. It added four members to what had been a nine-member board. Three of the new directors, James Dawsey, Kristine Duffy and Philip Morris, had served on the boards of Arrow's subsidiary banks. The fourth new director, Daniel White, is a certified public accountant who recently retired as office managing partner of KPMG's Albany and upstate offices.\n\n\"We're confident their leadership and insights will help guide our organization as we continue to grow, innovate and serve our community with excellence,\" DeMarco said in a statement to American Banker.\n\n",

Whereas primary data are generated via Statista's own surveys like the Global Consumer Survey, secondary input datasets are mostly sourced from international institutions (such as the IMF, the World Bank or the United Nations), national statistical offices, trade associations and from the trade press. These datasets are often incomplete as there are gaps between survey years or no or no reliable information might be available for a specific indicator in a specific country or region. Data for missing years are interpolated by various statistical means, such as linear or exponential interpolation, or cubic splines. Data for missing countries or regions are imputed by considering known information from other countries or regions that are found to be similar by cluster analyses like k-means or similar procedures.\n\n\n\nMost indicators are composites of multiple input sources with slightly varying methodologies that have been processed by our analysts to be aligned and consistent with each other and with all other indicators in the KMI database. Due to ther addition of new data or changes in underlying methodologies it can be possible that data is not comparable any longer with previously published data or is changed retroactively to suit the new definitions.\n\n\n\nBecause of the high degree of processing, no specific external source can be named for each data point and all data for historical years (usually one to three years before the last finished calendar year before the current one) have to be considered Statista estimates.

Specifically, the current environment has pushed some fundamentally sound businesses into value territory. Here's an overview of two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are top buys in 2025.\n\nTobacco giant adapts to changing times\n\nAltria Group (MO 0.61%) knows a thing or two about longevity. Through two centuries of business evolution, the company has maintained its market dominance, with flagship brands like Marlboro. Right now, investors can grab shares at an attractive price point, thanks to broader market concerns about declining smoking rates.\n\nLooking at the numbers, Altria's stock trades at just 9.87 times forward earnings, far below the S&P 500's multiple of 24.2. This bargain valuation tells an interesting story. While the market frets over traditional tobacco's future and some of Altria's past missteps (like its cannabis ventures), it's overlooking the company's growing success in products like oral tobacco and nicotine pouches.\n\nManagement isn't sitting still in the face of changing consumer habits. Their game plan centers on expanding the company's presence in alternative nicotine products. These new categories are already showing promise, complementing the still-profitable cigarette business with fresh growth opportunities.\n\nThe dividend story might be the most compelling part of Altria's investment case. It's yield of 7.8% stands head and shoulders above most S&P 500-listed companies.\n\nBetter yet, the payout ratio sits at a comfortable 66.9%, suggesting this generous dividend is built to last. For income seekers, that combination of yield and sustainability is hard to ignore.\n\nTelecom leader positioned for recovery\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ -0.32%) isn't just another phone company. As one of America's largest wireless carriers, it serves millions of customers and operates a network that spans the nation.\n\nThe past few years haven't been kind to Verizon's stock price. Heavy spending on network upgrades and fierce competition have weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nBut that's where things get interesting. At just 8.44 times forward earnings, Verizon trades like a company in trouble. The market seems fixated on competitive pressures and past capital spending, missing the turning point in Verizon's story. The expensive phase of the 5G network buildout is winding down, and it's starting to show in the numbers.\n\nThe cash-flow narrative has shifted dramatically in recent years (see graph below). With major network investments in the rearview mirror, Verizon's free cash flow has surged over the prior 36 months. Furthermore, the wireless industry has matured over the past 12 months, and carriers are finally starting to show pricing discipline after years of aggressive promotions.\n\nFor income seekers, Verizon's 6.78% dividend yield turns heads. True, the 115% payout ratio raises eyebrows, but improving cash flow paints a more reassuring picture.\n\nMoreover, the telecom giant's 18-year streak of dividend hikes speaks volumes about its commitment to shareholders. With network spending falling and cash flow rising, Verizon looks well-positioned to maintain its reputation as a reliable dividend payer.\n\nWhy buy these two high-yield dividend stocks?\n\nBoth Altria and Verizon have fallen out of Wall Street's favor, creating a classic \"be greedy when others are fearful\" scenario. Their stocks trade at single-digit earnings multiples while offering yields that dwarf the S&P 500's average payout.\n\nBut what's truly compelling here isn't just the eye-catching yields. These are market leaders with staying power, not speculative high-yield traps. Each company faces its share of headwinds, yet both have clear paths forward.",

            "content": "Karachi, January 2, 2025 \u2013 In the midst of unprecedented economic challenges, Pakistanis spent a staggering Rs 276 billion on cigarettes during the first nine months of 2024. This shocking revelation emerges as the nation grapples with soaring inflation and dwindling resources for essential commodities.\n\nFinancial reports from two major companies, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) and Philip Morris International (PMI) Pakistan, highlight this extravagant expenditure. PMI reported sales of Rs 20.49 billion for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, while PTC accounted for a monumental Rs 255.54 billion in sales over the same timeframe. Both entities, listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), contribute significantly to the national exchequer through duties and taxes, while providing employment across the supply chain.\n\nThe annual quantum of sales is expected to be much higher. If we calculate the non-duty-paid cigarettes and smuggled segments, the actual number of cigarettes consumed could potentially double.\n\nHowever, the crux of the matter lies not in the revenue generated but in the enormous health and economic costs borne by the citizens. Despite warnings from health and social organizations about the dire consequences of smoking, the government remains focused on revenue generation rather than public welfare.\n\nEven if these companies contribute approximately half of their sales revenue in taxes, the financial and health benefits of banning cigarettes far outweigh the loss of excise duties. Cigarettes, deemed non-essential, primarily contribute to federal excise duty, a tax category intended for luxury or harmful items. Eliminating cigarettes would not significantly affect national revenue but would safeguard public health and redirect resources towards constructive economic activities.\n\nA complete ban on cigarettes could keep the Rs 276 billion in the hands of citizens, enabling them to invest in improving their quality of life. This redirected spending could stimulate other manufacturing sectors, create jobs, and bolster the overall economy. By prioritizing human development over excise revenue, the government could foster a healthier, more prosperous society.\n\nPakistan, as a developing nation, cannot afford such colossal wastage of resources. The expenditure on cigarettes underscores a deeper economic mismanagement, where short-term revenue considerations overshadow long-term societal gains. The government must urgently rethink its policies and prioritize the welfare of its citizens over the profits of tobacco companies. A decisive move towards banning cigarettes would not only save lives but also channel billions of rupees into more productive avenues, paving the way for a healthier and more sustainable future.",

The D.C. attorney general accused SMNA of enabling online sales of flavoured Zyn nicotine pouches (NPs) to consumers in the district which continued until June 30th, 2024, despite the ban taking effect on October 1st, 2022.\n\nUnder the settlement terms, PMI is required to conduct quarterly monitoring to ensure distributors adhere to the flavour ban. Earlier this year, the company had suspended online sales following a subpoena from the attorney general\u2019s office, and now PMI has also ceased selling flavoured Zyn products through its official website and related online platforms.\n\nThe growing popularity of nicotine pouches\n\nMoving forward, Swedish Match plans to shift its focus to in-person sales at brick-and-mortar retail stores, as confirmed in a company statement. Nicotine pouches, including Zyn, are now the second most-used nicotine product in the U.S., trailing only traditional cigarettes, according to the CDC. This relatively recent increase in popularity has raised widespread alarm, similar to fear and apprehension which resulted from the success of vaping products starting a approximtely a decade ago.\n\nIn line with this sentiment, a recent article from the Times Educational Supplement (TES) offered a dramatic take on nicotine products, such as NPs and snus, warranting a closer examination. While snus is deeply embedded in Swedish culture, it remains a lesser-known product in many countries, such as the UK, and is often viewed with skepticism. However, the question arises: how much of this caution is justified, and where do nicotine pouches fit within the realm of harm reduction? Importantly, it\u2019s worth noting that snus and nicotine pouches are distinct products.",

The rankings were done through five categories: customer satisfaction (22%), financial strength (13%), social responsibility (24%), innovation (21%) and employee engagement and development (20%), and all of it was calculated and the final Effectiveness Score was then concluded. There were also some standards set, with companies scoring 80, being in just 1%, companies scoring 60, being in top 15-20% and companies scoring 50 being in average range.According to the results, Apple was the top company in terms of best management, with an effectiveness score of 92.1. It scored 100 in innovation and 120 in financial strength. Apple stole this spot from Microsoft as it was the top well managed company in 2023 . Followed by Apple is Nvidia, with an effectiveness score of 90.1. The company\u2019s greatest asset is its financial strength (139), followed by employee engagement and development (75).Coming in third spot is Microsoft, with an effectiveness score of 88.8, and having the best scores in innovation (98) and financial strength (99). Intel was the fourth best managed company in the US in 2024 while MasterCard was the fifth. They had effectiveness scores of 78.5 and 75.7 respectively. The sixth and seventh best managed companies were Johnson & Johnson (75.5) and Procter & Gamble (75.2). Alphabet, Adobe and Philip Morris were also the top ten best managed companies in the US in 2024.The companies which scored less than 70 in effectiveness were Intuit, American Express, Caterpillar and HP. The biggest weaknesses of these companies were customer satisfaction and financial strength. It was found that companies which are innovative, attract top talents and expand their markets are the ones with high effectiveness scores, hence, well managed.Read next: US Consumer Media Spending Report 2024: This is How Much the Average American Spends on Internet, TV, and Mobile",

(NYSE:PM) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOptimism for High Growth Despite High Rates and Debt\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump\u2019s policies take effect.\n\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed\u2019s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\n\nFed\u2019s Shifting Rate Path Sparks Concerns in the Market\n\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed\u2019s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn\u2019t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn\u2019t ruling out anything.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\n\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed\u2019s path forward.",

Reynolds.\n\nOn Dec. 4, Superior Court Judge David A. Deakin in Middlesex issued a lengthy written decision that trebled \u2014 from just over $15 million to more than $45 million \u2014 the damages awarded to plaintiffs Joseph and Betty Reppucci in the second phase of a bifurcated trial.\n\nIt may be the largest treble damages award in a consumer case in Massachusetts, according to Andrew Rainer, litigation director of the Public Health Advocacy Institute. The award exceeds by 67 percent a $9 million compensatory damages award that a Middlesex Superior Court jury granted in 2019 in Greene v. Philip Morris, which tripled to $27 million.\n\nTwo days after Deakin\u2019s decision, a Hampden County jury entered another eight-figure verdict against RJ Reynolds, awarding Kevin Penza and his daughter, Kimberly Breen, $8.1 million in compensatory damages and $2.5 million in punitive damages related to the death of Kevin\u2019s wife, Jacqueline.\n\nThe jury\u2019s decision came after five days of deliberations and after Judge Edward J. McDonough Jr. gave jurors a \u201cdynamite\u201d charge under Tuey-Rodriguez to resolve an impasse.\n\nThat case is now proceeding to briefing on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Chapter 93A as well.\n\nParticipating in both cases for the plaintiffs were PHAI attorneys Rainer, Mark Gottlieb, Madeline Edelstein and, in the Reppucci case, ShanShan Guo.\n\nThey were joined in Reppucci by Randy Rosenblum of Dolan, Dobrinsky, Rosenblum & Bluestein in Miami and Kevin Donovan of the national personal injury firm Rubenstein Law.\n\nIn the Penza case, PHAI was joined by Gary M. Paige and Cassandra Lombard, of Gordon & Partners in Florida.\n\nThe defense of R.J. Reynolds in both cases was led by attorneys from Jones Day.\n\nBut-for causation rejected\n\nJoseph Reppucci began smoking as a child in the early 1960s. By age 12, he was smoking a pack a day. Concerned about the health effects of cigarettes, Joseph switched sometime in the early to mid-1980s to Winston Lights, mistakenly believing that they would be safer because they had less of the harmful elements found in traditional cigarettes, along with a filter.\n\nUnbeknownst to Joseph and the rest of the smoking public, by 1983 RJ Reynolds had a confidential internal report indicating that smokers would adjust their smoking techniques \u2014 holding smoke in their lungs longer, inhaling more deeply, or blocking air-dilution vents on the cigarette \u2014 to ensure they were still getting the same amount of tar and nicotine.\n\nJoseph Reppucci continued smoking for virtually his entire adult life, including after his first surgery to treat an oropharyngeal cancer in 2002. He only stopped in 2018, after his second surgery for the same smoking-related illness, when his teeth, lower mandible, and almost all his tongue were removed.\n\nDeakin\u2019s 27-page decision in Reppucci is \u201cdefinitely the most thorough 93A decision we\u2019ve had yet,\u201d Rainer told Lawyers Weekly.\n\n\u201c[Deakin] really turned over systematically a lot of the issues that have been raised with respect to 93A in these cases,\u201d Rainer said.\n\nThose issues include rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs needed to show but-for causation. To prevail, the plaintiffs should be required to prove that without R.J. Reynolds\u2019 unfair and deceptive practices regarding Winston Lights, Joseph Reppucci never would have developed cancer in 2018, the company argued.\n\nBut Deakin determined that a \u201csufficiency\u201d standard was more appropriate, which the plaintiffs could meet, he concluded.\n\n\u201cHad R.J. Reynolds ended its unfair and deceptive practice of misleading customers into believing that Winston Lights were a safer alternative to other cigarettes, Mr. Reppucci would have been fully informed of the true risk that he faced every time he smoked Winston Lights, and would, solely on that basis, have been more likely to quit,\u201d Deakin wrote. \u201cBut, even more fundamental, Mr. Reppucci would have been made aware that R.J. Reynolds had been intentionally deceiving him \u2014 and the world \u2014 about the safety of its product for years.\u201d\n\nBoston plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Michael C. Shepard, who has worked with PHAI on other suits, said tobacco cases always come down to the companies accusing the smoker of deciding to continue to smoke despite the known health risks.\n\n\u201cBoth the jury [in Penza] and judge [in Reppucci] are seeing through the defense tactic of blaming the smoker,\u201d Shepard said.\n\nAs for Deakin reaffirming the \u201csubstantial contributing cause\u201d standard, Shepard noted that it is \u201cthe only standard that makes any sense\u201d when it comes to toxic exposure, and the verdicts in the Penza and Reppucci cases show that the standard is one that juries understand.\n\nDeakin\u2019s factual determinations in Reppucci are notable in that the judge found that the manufacturer made misrepresentations about its product, even though the representations about the product itself were accurate \u2014 that is, the manufacturer was not untruthful in marketing its light brand product as delivering less tar and nicotine, said Boston attorney Kevin W. Buono, whose practice includes the defense of consumer class actions and mass tort claims.\n\nInstead, the court thought where smokers would adjust their smoking technique and otherwise maintain their tar and nicotine intake was enough to call the manufacturer \u201cdeceptive\u201d in its advertising, despite the apparent accuracy of the manufacturer\u2019s representations that the product itself did in fact have less tar and nicotine, Buono said.\n\n\u201cThis aspect of the decision is notable in that it shifts responsibility from consumers to manufacturers for ensuring a consistent level of intake of a \u2018light\u2019 product to receive the benefits of the reduced level of unhealthy ingredients,\u201d Buono said.\n\nHe added that one can rather easily anticipate the use of this theory in other contexts, such as in the case of, for example, manufacturers of \u201creduced fat\u201d or \u201clow sodium\u201d snack products, if the manufacturer has reason to believe that consumers of such products end up consuming as much fat or sodium as the traditional products because snackers tend to eat more of the supposedly healthier snack option.\n\nDeterrence still necessary\n\nIn Rainer\u2019s view, perhaps the most significant aspect of Deakin\u2019s decision was simply his willingness to treble a $15 million compensatory damages award.\n\nPHAI had offered examples in its briefing of a couple of cases from elsewhere in the country in which an award of that magnitude had been tripled, but Deakin still wondered aloud at oral argument whether it might be more appropriate to merely double the award, his only other alternative once he found that the conduct was willful and knowing.\n\nJudges do not consider the size of the underlying verdict when deciding whether treble damages are warranted under Chapter 93A, Shepard noted. When judges hear of the harm caused by multi-billion-dollar companies withholding information, \u201cthey\u2019re not inclined to treat them with kid gloves,\u201d he said.\n\nR.J. Reynolds argued that an award of multiple damages would be \u201can unfair and excessive exercise in over-deterrence and over-punishment,\u201d Deakin wrote.\n\nThe company contended that the evidence showed that it did not need to be deterred because it had already changed its practices, but Deakin found that argument failed on two accounts.\n\nFirst, it was \u201cmistaken on principle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only authority R.J. Reynolds had offered to support its argument, the Supreme Judicial Court case Kraft Power Corp. v. Merrill, involved a defendant who had died.\n\nBut R.J. Reynolds is not deceased or dissolved; it still sells tobacco in Massachusetts and beyond, Deakin said.\n\n\u201cR.J. Reynolds remains susceptible to deterrence by the law, and where it is so available, \u2018the Legislature\u2019s displeasure with the proscribed conduct and its desire to deter [the wrongful] conduct and encourage vindictive lawsuits remain,\u2019\u201d Deakin wrote, quoting from the SJC\u2019s decision in International Fidelity Insurance Company v. Wilson, et al.\n\nR.J. Reynolds had also failed to present any substantial evidence to suggest that it has been sufficiently deterred or punished, Deakin added.\n\n\u201cR.J. Reynolds, however, provides little persuasive evidence of the overall soundness of its practices and, much more important, no evidence to suggest that an award of multiple damages would fail to serve any substantial deterrence interest,\u201d Deakin wrote.\n\nTo the extent that the company had offered reasons to believe that it is already sufficiently deterred, it did not support them with data illustrating the impact of other litigation to prove that Chapter 93A\u2019s deterrent goal had already been satisfied.\n\n\u201cThus, even if I credited the theory behind the defendant\u2019s argument, the evidence presented would be inadequate to convince me that less-than-treble damages were warranted,\u201d Deakin stated.\n\nThe Reppucci decision is a testament to the breadth of the attorney general\u2019s regulations declaring certain acts per se \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d under Chapter 93A, Buono said. The court\u2019s determination that there had been a 93A violation rested largely on a broadly worded regulation promulgated by the AG prohibiting a seller\u2019s failure to disclose \u201cany\u201d fact that \u201cmay\u201d have influenced the consumer\u2019s decision to buy a product.\n\n\u201cThis extraordinarily broad language would support a finding that there had been a Chapter 93A violation in consumer product cases where the defendant\u2019s conduct was far from \u2018profoundly egregious,\u2019 as the court described R.J. Reynolds\u2019s public misinformation campaign here,\u201d Buono said.\n\nDeakin did hand R.J. Reynolds a win on an issue that Rainer noted the company has been battling over for a long time: what is known as the interstate commerce exception to Chapter 93A.\n\nThe issue boils down to whether plaintiffs can pursue personal injury claims for the period between 1979 \u2014 when the Legislature passed an amendment to 93A allowing such recovery \u2014 and 1983, when the Legislature repealed language in Chapter 93A excepting from liability certain conduct based on interstate commerce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people who, for example, quit smoking in the \u201980s,\u201d Rainer said. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s 1983 as opposed to 1979, that means they may not be able to recover under 93A. That was a little victory for them buried amidst a $45 million punishment.\u201d\n\nNew territory\n\nThe Penza case was PHAI\u2019s first in Springfield, but it was also notable for the difficulty the jury had in reaching its decision, Rainer said.\n\n\u201cThe jury reported back several times that they were stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, they sent a note that said, \u2018We\u2019re still working, but what if we can\u2019t agree? Is it a mistrial?\u2019\u201d\n\nThen, there was a note that a juror wanted to be excused, but the jury was already down to 12 people.\n\n\u201cSo, the judge said, \u2018We really need you. If you go home, we can\u2019t continue,\u2019\u201d Rainer recounted.\n\nThen came the note that said they were at an impasse, which led to a back-and-forth between the two sides\u2019 attorneys as to what charge to give.\n\nJudge McDonough ultimately gave the jury what Rainer considers to be a \u201cvery well written\u201d dynamite charge first given back in 1983.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been, at least to my eyes, a surprising amount of litigation about what judges can and can\u2019t say [when a jury is at an impasse],\u201d Rainer said.\n\nRainer believes a challenge to the dynamite charge is inevitable. R.J. Reynolds\u2019 attorneys did not respond to Lawyers Weekly\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOutlier\n\nMassachusetts courts are set to be unusually busy with tobacco litigation in 2025, with 10 cases on track to go to trial, of which PHAI is involved in nine, according to Rainer.\n\nThe litigation in Massachusetts continues unabated thanks in part to the SJC\u2019s 2021 decision in Laramie v. Philip Morris USA Inc., in which the court rejected Philip Morris\u2019 argument that the 1998 settlement agreement the company reached with the Massachusetts attorney general precluded recovery of punitive damages under the wrongful death statute, G.L.c. 229, \u00a72.\n\nMassachusetts is among most states that entered into a master settlement agreement with the then-existing tobacco companies, which are now essentially down to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, Rainer noted.\n\nThe tobacco companies continue every year to pay money into all those states\u2019 coffers, but as far as Rainer knows, none of that money goes directly to individual people. Rather, the settlement was designed to reimburse the states for the enormous health care costs involved in treating people for tobacco-related injuries, he said.\n\nHowever, tobacco companies are facing less litigation from individual plaintiffs than one might think, Rainer said.\n\nThere had been extensive litigation in Florida after a class action against all the tobacco companies in the late 1990s was decertified on appeal in 2006. That prompted thousands of individual cases to be filed, but no more than 400 or 500 have ever been tried, Rainer said.\n\n\u201cThe courts in Florida have become much more conservative because of having two pretty conservative Republican governors in a row, so the tobacco litigation in Florida is starting to end,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are lawyers who have brought tobacco cases relatively recently in Illinois, Oregon, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands, Rainer said, but there is a relatively small number of states seeing litigation activity on par with that in Massachusetts.\n\nWhile the tobacco industry would likely dispute his characterization, the companies rarely provide a sufficient incentive to settle costly smoking cases, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never profitable for a lawyer to settle one of those cases,\u201d Rainer said. \u201cThe only time that lawyers really can make money on these cases is if they go to trial and win.\u201d\n\nThe companies\u2019 settlements and litigation losses are listed on Form 10-Ks that they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The lists are shorter than one might expect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hundreds of cases,\u201d Rainer said.\n\nThe passage of time is also a contributing factor to the slowdown in litigation activity, Rainer acknowledged.\n\n\u201cThe farther away we get from the most egregious conduct of the companies in the 20th century, the fewer cases there will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis litigation does probably have an endpoint related to the facts.\u201d\n\nHowever, tobacco still kills an \u201castonishing\u201d half a million Americans every single year, Rainer said.\n\n\u201cThat number, thankfully, is going down and will continue to go down,\u201d he said.",

This was the first time the event was held in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nThe 'Technovation: Smoke-Free by PMI Abu Dhabi Edition' features media representatives from across the region to discuss the promises of smoke-free products and the technologies available today. During the one-day event, discussions between media and other stakeholders from around the world focused on the important role that innovation, technology and science can play in creating a smoke-free environment.\n\n\n\nThe event was attended by media agencies from nearly 30 countries worldwide to listen to presentations and participate in discussions about the role of the tobacco industry, civil society, government and the public health community towards the goal of achieving a smoke-free future at a faster pace.\n\n\n\nA highlight of the event was the engaging discussion led by PMI's CEO Jacek Olczak, who shared insights into PMI's three-decade journey in research and development to pioneer products that are a much better choice than continued smoking.\n\n\n\nA key target reinforced PMI's ambitious vision: to increase its total net revenue in smoke-free products to 66% by 2030, while having already achieved 38% today.\n\n\n\nThe conversation, moderated by Tommaso Di Giovanni, Vice President of International Communications and Engagement, outlined the company's transformation from a traditional tobacco company to a leader in smoke-free innovations \u2013 envisioning a smoke-free future that is within reach. \"We are now more fortunate because we are living in a time when innovation can come faster and can accelerate the decline in smoking habits and help those who do not quit smoking, to switch to lower risk products,\" said PMI CEO, Jacek Olczak.\n\n\n\nThis push for a smoke-free future is founded on its research that burning tobacco is what makes cigarettes harmful; chemicals emitted from burning are the main cause of smoking-related diseases. During the event, PMI CEO Jacek Olczak reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to a smoke-free world by prioritizing smoke-free alternatives where it has invested $12.5 billion since 2008. Since 2016, he said the company has been strengthening its commitment to delivering a smoke-free future. It introduced the first heat-not-burn platform in Japan and Italy in 2014.\n\n\n\n\"We started it in Japan 10 years ago, in Nagoya. The number of users in Japan who started with this product, in my opinion, is about 70 percent. So, within 10 years, Japan is almost, but not yet, reaching its peak of becoming a smoke-free country,\" said Mr Olczak. \"So now, we have the science, the evidence, for the last 10 years. If you look in Sweden, the proof over the last 30 years, is that products, different product formats, can solve problems very quickly,\" he continued.\n\n\n\nOlczak revealed that the company is working towards deriving two-thirds of its revenue from smoke-free products by 2030.\n\n\n\nThe role of policymaking in PMI\u2019s smoke-free ambitions\n\n\n\nA distinguished panel of experts, including representatives from the Consumer Choice Center and Progressive Policy Institute, explored the evolving regulatory landscape for smoke-free products.\n\n\n\nThe discussion highlighted how forward-thinking governments are recognizing the role of scientifically substantiated alternatives in accelerating the decline of smoking, while generating positive public health and socio-economic outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe sessions also showcased PMI's significant investment in research and development, which has reached $12.5 billion since 2008. With more than 1,500 R&D positions dedicated to smoke-free innovation, PMI demonstrated its commitment to scientific advancement in the field.\n\n\n\nThe company presented its vision where, with appropriate regulatory frameworks and stakeholder collaboration, cigarette sales could end within 10-15 years in many countries.\n\n\n\nPlacing consumers at the centre of research and development\n\n\n\nAnother panel highlighted how consumers are an often-neglected voice in the debates that often result in disproportionate regulation, restrictions on sales and use and outright bans applied to SFPs. The discussion highlighted that despite considerable scientific evidence to support the public health benefits of less harmful alternatives, obstacles are being placed in the way of consumers.\n\n\n\nAndrzej Dabrowski, Area VP Middle East & North Africa for Phillip Morris international, said much of the success in the MENA region was providing a portfolio of products to move smokers away from cigarettes in meeting their needs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the MENA region, everything started in UAE in 2019. There, there was appropriate regulation that opened the gates for SFPs. Here we launched our first IQOS with success. Nowadays, 5 years later, we have many more markets where SFPs are present vs. those where they are not\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe also said that understanding the balance between regulation, consumer preferences, and cultural factors is essential for replicating this success in other Middle East and North African regions. Furthermore, he stressed that it was essential to provide portfolio customization to meet different consumers\u2019 needs and demands, with only one bigger goal: move away from cigarettes as many smokers as possible, as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nThe panel further emphasized the importance of placing consumers at the centre of all research and development conducted, to develop less harmful alternatives.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the event stressed the critical role of consumers in being informed about their options and alternatives, empowering them to make educated choices that align with their needs and preferences.\n\n\n\nPMI\u2019s smoke-free products for a smokeless future\n\n\n\nThe event also showcased PMI\u2019s products, from its leading heated tobacco system, IQOS, to its responsibly commercialized e-vapor products, and oral smokeless nicotine pouch. This multi-category portfolio of scientifically backed products, while not risk free, are a better alternative for adults than continued smoking.\n\n\n\nIQOS, PMI\u2019s flagship smoke-free innovation, has surpassed its bestselling cigarette brand to become the premium nicotine brand globally less than a decade since its launch, demonstrating tangible progress. In the UAE, IQOS has been available to legal-age smokers in the UAE since 2019.\n\n\n\nThe event concluded with an innovative exhibition showcase featuring distinct zones, including a comprehensive consumer retail experience for harm reduction alternatives, an immersive virtual reality journey exploring facts versus myths about smoke-free products, PMI's cutting-edge science center.\n\n\n\nThe exhibition effectively demonstrated PMI's multi-category approach to tobacco harm reduction and its commitment to scientific substantiation of smoke-free alternatives.",

            "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nTiny packets of nicotine have quickly become a big problem for parents and schools.\n\nThey\u2019re available at gas stations and convenience stores under names like Zyn, O! Rogue, Juice Head and VELO. Although the products are supposed to be sold only to people over 21, a growing number of children have reported using these types of smokeless oral nicotine packets.\n\nBecause they\u2019re relatively new to the market, parents and teachers may not know what to look for. And since young users don\u2019t have to stand outside and smoke or vape to get a nicotine fix, the products can be easy to hide and hard to spot.\n\nThe tiny white pockets, sometimes called lip pillows or upper deckies, are held between the inner lip and the gum. They contain nicotine or synthetic nicotine and filler that is mostly flavor like mint or fruit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about Zyn use right now,\u201d said Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics and the founder and director of the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, an online curricular aimed at reducing and preventing youth tobacco use.\n\nZyn and its competitors came to the US in 2014, and the number of adults who use them has remained relatively steady since around 2016. But they have quickly become one of the most-used nicotine products among kids and young adults, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, second only to vaping.\n\nIt\u2019s against the law for tobacco companies to promote their products with traditional advertising, like on TV or in magazines, but Zyn and its competitors seem to be everywhere online where a kid would be.\n\nEmbraced by some professional athletes and familiar personalities, the products have become so popular on TikTok that there\u2019s even a name for devotees: Zynfluencers.\n\nSwedish Match U.S., the maker of Zyn, said the product is marketed to existing nicotine consumers over 21.\n\n\u201cWorking to ensure access is only for adults over 21 is built into our DNA. Nicotine products are among the most highly regulated on the market. Swedish Match North America, which markets ZYN in the U.S., doesn\u2019t use social media influencers and refuses requests for such partnerships. Its product websites are strictly age-gated, and its advertising features only individuals 35 or older,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBut there are so many oral nicotine products hitting the market that in December, the American Heart Association revised its policy paper on the topic for the first time since 2010. It calls for more research and for more education for doctors, parents and kids so people can be more aware of when young people are using them and what the health consequences may be.\n\nHalpern-Felsher gave a talk at one school in the San Francisco Bay Area where she was told that Zyn is \u201cpervasive\u201d and \u201creally difficult to detect.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeens don\u2019t understand that this is nicotine, and they don\u2019t understand what it could do to them,\u201d she added.\n\nHealth dangers of nicotine\n\nPromoted by users as a pick-me-up, nicotine may give young people a quick burst of energy. But in the long term, it has the opposite effect: It can have a profound impact on the structure, function and connections in the young brain, which may harm their ability to pay attention, learn and remember things.\n\nLevels of nicotine in these products can vary from about 3 milligrams per packet up to 12 milligrams, \u201cand we know kids are sometimes doubling up with these,\u201d Halpern-Felsher said, putting them at risk of nicotine poisoning. For context, the nicotine ingested from a 6 milligram Zyn pouch would be equal to smoking about three packs of cigarettes or one and a half e-cigarette pods of 2% vape juice per day according to the American Lung Association.\n\nKids are also more easily addicted to nicotine than adults, studies show, which could lead to a lifetime of health issues. More research is needed on the effects in younger people, but adult use of nicotine carries a cardiovascular risk, raises the risk of cancer and can cause bad breath, tooth loss and gum disease. There\u2019s also an increased risk of death from heart or cerebrovascular issues, studies have found.\n\nAlthough the number of teens who vape has fallen from a peak in 2019 and the number of people smoking combustible cigarettes has been declining for more than a decade, the CDC says, slightly more children are using oral nicotine products than in years past.\n\nThe agency said in October that about 1.8% of middle- and high-schoolers \u2013 about 890,000 young people \u2013 reported using nicotine pouches. That\u2019s up from 1.5% in 2023. The American Lung Association puts the numbers even higher, saying that a quarter of people who use nicotine pouches are underage.\n\nTheir reasons for using can vary, Halpern-Felsher said. Some are trying to kick an addiction to e-cigarettes. Others just like the flavors and the head rush that come with the nicotine, she said.\n\nSome may also be self-medicating for conditions like depression or anxiety. \u201cWe know the mental health crisis is real, and we\u2019re very concerned about self-medication,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts say parents should talk to their children about the risks of nicotine products and watch for sudden changes in behavior or secrecy, such as disappearing for a prolonged period of time. Nicotine may make them irritated or anxious and may curb hunger.\n\nAlso watch for containers that look like a pack of mints or for the nicotine pouches themselves, which may become visible when they\u2019re talking.\n\nIf a child is using and want to quit, parents should help them come up with a plan. It\u2019s better to respond with support than punishment, according to the Truth initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people break a nicotine addiction.\n\nEfforts to tackle youth usage\n\nPhilip Morris, the tobacco giant that bought Zyn maker Swedish Match, has leaned into smokeless products as people move away from cigarettes. Sales of Zyn have increased 300-fold since 2016. In the first quarter of 2024, Philip Morris said, it sold 131.6 million cans worldwide, up 8.2% from the same period in 2023. The company said it anticipates selling 560 million cans this year alone.\n\nPhilip Morris\u2019 website clearly requires users to verify that they are 21 and that they use tobacco products. If a person says they don\u2019t use tobacco products, they get a screen that says the product is not for them.\n\nAfter the District of Columbia went to court over sales of Zyn this year, arguing that they violate the area\u2019s ban on flavored products, the company stopped online sales, but it still offers incentives and rewards like Zyn branded merchandise and gift cards for people who purchase the products.\n\nIn December, Swedish Match North America, a subsidiary of Philip Morris, reached a settlement with the district and said it would pay $1.2 million; it also promised to better monitor how its products were distributed.\n\nEarlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Federal Trade Commission to investigate Zyn sales, particularly to young people. Some Republicans criticized the effort with allegations of a \u201cnanny state,\u201d and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, called for a \u201cZynsurrection.\u201d\n\nThe FDA said in April that it has taken some action, sending 119 warning letters to retailers selling Zyn to underage buyers.\n\nMore states and cities are banning flavored nicotine products, so they may be subject to further regulations. But often companies create new products or market them in a way that can be confusing.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\u201cThey will often will claim the products are tobacco-free and are a safer alternative to smoking combustible cigarettes, and while they are likely safer than smoking combustible cigarettes, the reality is, we just don\u2019t know the short- and long-term impact of these products,\u201d said Dr. Cheryl Dennison Himmelfarb, who helped write the American Heart Association\u2019s policy paper and is the vice dean of research at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and the School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s nicotine delivered from tobacco or not, it\u2019s addictive and not ideal for the developing brain.\u201d\n\nDennison Himmelfarb hopes that more stores will enforce the legal age limit and that policy-makers will focus on restricting the use among young people.\n\nHalpern-Felsher said she and her team at Stanford are building a Zyn-specific prevention curriculum in addition to the smokeless tobacco prevention curriculum that they have taken to thousands of schools nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are that concerned about Zyn,\u201d she said.",

Starting Sept. 30, smokers under the age of 30 had to start showing photo identification to buy tobacco products including e-cigarettes. Previously, retailers only had to verify with photo ID the age of customers under 27.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FDA also prohibited retailers from selling tobacco products via vending machines in spaces where people under 21 are present or permitted to enter. The previous rule only applied to locations where people under 18 where present.\n\nThe rule changes are part of government efforts to decrease underage tobacco sales. Over 95% of U.S. adults who smoke daily smoked their first cigarette by the age of 21, according to the FDA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a report in May, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the tobacco industry designed products that appeal to children and marketed them aggressively via social media, concerts and sporting events.\n\nThe WHO estimates that about 37 million people aged 13 to 15 use tobacco.\n\nCigarette smoking is responsible for over 480,000 deaths in the United States each year, according to the CDC.",

A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOptimism for High Growth Despite High Rates and Debt\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump\u2019s policies take effect.\n\nRechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed\u2019s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period.\n\nFed\u2019s Shifting Rate Path Sparks Concerns in the Market\n\nThe path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed\u2019s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn\u2019t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn\u2019t ruling out anything.\n\nOn Yahoo Finance\u2019s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent.\n\nWasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed\u2019s path forward.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stocks screener to identify 30 companies with the largest market cap and a 5-year beta (monthly) between 0.2 and 0.8.

Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\n5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.56\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a leading tobacco company that has significantly diversified its portfolio beyond traditional cigarettes. Through internal investments and strategic acquisitions, the company has expanded into next-generation products such as heat-not-burn tobacco, electronic vapor, and nicotine pouches. A key move in this direction was the 2022 acquisition of Swedish Match, which brought the Zyn brand under its ownership.\n\nAdditionally, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) gained the rights to sell IQOS products in the U.S. from Altria, positioning itself well in the rapidly growing market for next-generation tobacco products. This shift aligns with the broader growth potential of the sector, as the next-generation tobacco products market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10% from 2021 to 2028, according to Data Bridge Market Research.\n\nIQOS, which was launched in Japan over a decade ago, has become a significant revenue driver for Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). The product now generates more than $10 billion in annual net revenues for the company and is available in over 70 markets worldwide, with 30.8 million adult users. Furthermore, in the third quarter, the company\u2019s smoke-free business contributed 38% of total revenue and 40% of gross profit, with its share continuing to grow.\n\n7. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\n5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.52\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a leading healthcare company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of a broad range of healthcare products. While the company continues to navigate ongoing talc-related litigation, which has been an issue for several years, the outcome of these cases remains uncertain.\n\nDespite these challenges, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has leveraged its strong financial position and excess free cash flow to pursue acquisitions. This year, the company allocated $18 billion to acquire Shockwave Medical, V-Wave, and several drug development companies. These acquisitions have strengthened its MedTech and Innovative Medicines platforms, complementing its ongoing investments in research and development.\n\nIn the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted its second consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion, with 11 key brands showing double-digit growth. In the MedTech space, the company has secured a leadership position in four of the fastest-growing cardiovascular intervention markets.",
