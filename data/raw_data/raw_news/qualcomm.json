            "content": "NVIDIA Corp NASDAQ: NVDA and Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ: QCOM are two of the biggest names in the chipmaking world. While both have underperformed recently, there\u2019s a growing sense that momentum could be about to shift.\n\nEach stock has shown signs of stabilizing after steep declines, and with earnings, valuations, and technicals now converging into what could be strong Q2 setups, the question is: which one deserves your capital? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nGet QUALCOMM alerts: Sign Up\n\nNVIDIA: Record Revenue, But Valuation Remains a Sticking Point\n\nNVIDIA shares were trading at $109 during Wednesday\u2019s session, still down nearly 30% from January\u2019s all-time high. But there\u2019s a sense that the worst of the pullback may be behind them. The stock looks to be forming a double bottom, a technical pattern that often signals a bullish reversal. In short, the bears may have tried and failed to push shares to new lows, which suggests buyers are slowly taking back control.\n\nNVIDIA Today NVDA NVIDIA $103.30 -7.12 (-6.45%) 52-Week Range $75.61 \u25bc $195.95 Dividend Yield 0.04% P/E Ratio 40.65 Price Target $169.89 Add to Watchlist\n\nThat sentiment would make sense, considering NVIDIA\u2019s latest earnings report at the end of February. The company blew past analyst expectations, posting all-time record revenue and year-over-year growth of nearly 80%. Just as importantly, forward guidance came in ahead of expectations, supporting the idea that demand for AI chips and data center hardware remains robust.\n\nDespite all this, shares have struggled to mount a sustained recovery, but analysts have remained firmly bullish. William Blair and Cantor Fitzgerald both reiterated their Buy ratings in recent weeks, with Cantor\u2019s price target of $220 pointing to a 100% upside from Wednesday\u2019s levels.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge potential gain for a company of NVIDIA\u2019s size, but it comes at a cost. The stock currently trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of 38, far higher than many of its peers. For investors who want exposure to the chip sector without paying top dollar, that\u2019s a serious consideration.\n\nQualcomm: Undervalued and Steady, But Flying Under the Radar\n\nWhile NVIDIA has been dominating headlines, Qualcomm has been quietly building a bullish case of its own. Shares are still down more than 30% from their high last June, having never failed to recover from the summer slump. Like NVIDIA, however, they\u2019ve also shown resilience over the past few weeks and are holding firm along a multi-year support line at the $150 level. That kind of technical base can often act as a springboard for stronger moves higher.\n\nQUALCOMM Today QCOM QUALCOMM $139.78 -14.30 (-9.28%) 52-Week Range $138.66 \u25bc $230.63 Dividend Yield 2.43% P/E Ratio 14.93 Price Target $205.32 Add to Watchlist\n\nQualcomm\u2019s last earnings report, released two months ago, beat expectations and was followed by a dividend increase - one of the strongest signals a company can send about its confidence in future growth. Yet, unlike NVIDIA, Qualcomm hasn\u2019t seen a wave of recent analyst upgrades. The last major update came in February when Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating with a $240 price target. That still implies a 55% upside from current levels, but the lack of fresh coverage is noticeable.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a valuation argument that can\u2019t be ignored. With a PE ratio of just 16, Qualcomm looks incredibly cheap compared to its peers. NVIDIA, at 38, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ: AMD, currently trading at a staggering 114, make Qualcomm look like a bargain in comparison. For value investors or those more risk-averse, this alone may be reason enough to lean toward Qualcomm.\n\nWhich Stock to Buy for Q2: NVIDIA or Qualcomm?\n\nThere\u2019s a strong case to be made for both NVIDIA and Qualcomm heading into Q2. NVIDIA has the momentum, the growth story, and the analyst attention, but it comes with a richer valuation. Qualcomm offers a more grounded opportunity with strong fundamentals, a better valuation, and an improved technical setup.\n\nFor aggressive growth investors, NVIDIA may still be the pick, especially if it can hold $105 and reclaim $120 in the weeks ahead. But for those looking for value, steadier upside, and less downside risk, Qualcomm may be the better bet. Either way, both stocks look primed for a stronger Q2 than what they\u2019ve shown so far this year.\n\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and QUALCOMM wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile QUALCOMM currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.\n\nBut making Qualcomm Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of QCOM entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $141.64 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Qualcomm Inc, the RSI reading has hit 26.6 \u2014 by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 39.3. A falling stock price \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, QCOM's recent annualized dividend of 3.4/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.21% based upon the recent $154.113 share price.\n\nA bullish investor could look at QCOM's 26.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on QCOM is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.\n\nClick here to find out what 9 other oversold dividend stocks you need to know about \u00bb\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

This company is active in various sectors, including hotel management and car manufacturing.\n\nAccording to Jilei Hou, senior vice president of engineering at Qualcomm, attracting highly qualified talent from VinAI strengthens Qualcomm\u2019s ability to deliver advanced AI solutions that benefit a wide range of industries and consumers.\n\nVinAI, the parent company of MovianAI, is led by former DeepMind researcher Hung Bui. Since its founding in 2019, the company has published several scientific articles on generative AI and posted dozens of open-source projects on GitHub.\n\nModels for image generation\n\nAbout two years ago, VinAI researchers presented a new method for developing image generation models. This technique uses an existing image generation model to train a smaller algorithm that can perform the same tasks with less computing power. According to VinAI, this technology reduces the need for training data and facilitates development.\n\nIn addition to new machine learning techniques, the laboratory also developed various open-source AI models. One of the image generation algorithms combines three different neural network architectures, namely diffusion, transformer and Mamba architectures. Mamba is a relatively new alternative to transformer architecture and can handle hardware more efficiently in certain situations.\n\nVinAI also developed an LLM\n\nVinAI\u2019s research work goes beyond image generation. The company has also developed a customized large language model, RecGPT-7B, which is optimized for recommendation system tasks.\n\nAccording to VinAI CEO Hung Bui, the company is ready to contribute to Qualcomm\u2019s mission to conduct groundbreaking fundamental AI research and apply it on a large scale in various sectors, including smartphones, PCs, and software-defined vehicles. He will join the chip company as part of the acquisition.\n\nMovianAI\u2019s expertise in model development can help Qualcomm improve its suite of AI development tools. These tools make it easier for companies to implement machine learning applications on devices with Qualcomm processors.\n\nQualcomm offers a library of preconfigured AI models optimized for its own hardware. These algorithms make it unnecessary for companies to train new models from scratch, speeding up development. For software teams that still want to build customized models, Qualcomm offers tools that help optimize their performance.\n\nThe acquisition of MovianAI follows less than a month after the acquisition of Edge Impulse Inc., another specialist in AI development. This company\u2019s software makes building AI models that can run efficiently on connected devices easier. Before the acquisition, Edge Impulse had raised approximately 54 million dollars in investments and had built up a user base of more than 170,000 developers.",

Just a few moments have passed since the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 was officially announced, with perhaps the biggest difference being that the latest announcement does not mention the use of in-house Oryon cores, as Qualcomm has stuck with the older Kryo CPU architecture. Even then, the company advertises up to a 49 percent performance boost compared to the previous generation, along with a host of improvements, so let us dive into the details immediately.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 misses out on mmWave 5G but gets support for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, UFS 4.0, LPDDR5X, and more\n\nThe first area of compromise is the use of the older 4nm lithography, which we assume is TSMC\u2019s N4P node, meaning that on the efficiency side of things, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is inferior to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. On the plus side, the chipset sports a robust CPU cluster in the \u20181+ 3 + 2 + 2\u2019 formation, with the fastest core operating at 3.20GHz, while the performance cores are functioning at 3.00GHz. Although the GPU name was not spilled, Qualcomm states that the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 can deliver a 49 percent improvement on the graphics side of things compared to the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.\n\nWith the CPU, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is up to 31 percent faster, all the while exhibiting a power efficiency improvement of 39 percent. The new SoC also supports top-tier features such as a fast 5G modem that, sadly, does not support mmWave bands, but the sub-6GHz baseband chip that can reach maximum downlink speeds of 4.2Gbps. Additionally, the silicon gets Bluetooth 6.0 support right off the bat, along with UFS 4.0, LPDDR5X RAM functioning at 4,800MHz, and of course, Wi-Fi 7.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 also possesses on-device AI capabilities, with the SoC touting up to 44 percent better performance thanks to a new NPU. The ISP is capable enough to support a single camera sensor up to 320MP, with 8K HDR video playback at 60FPS and 4K HDR video capture at 60FPS. We expect multiple Chinese vendors to incorporate the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 into their high-end devices, and we will be back with more updates on how the new chipset performs compared to current-generation and older-generation silicon.",

            "content": "Qualcomm and Arm are both showing interest in acquiring the British company Alphawave. The latter is mainly focused on developing and licensing IP related to chip designs.\n\nThe news has already provided Alphawave with a financial advantage. Shares rose by 48.3 percent after Qualcomm confirmed it was considering a bid for the company, which was founded in 2017.\n\nOn Monday, Alphawave\u2019s market value was still around 708 million pounds (913 million dollars), but due to the new developments, this temporarily exceeded one billion pounds. The interest of the American company Qualcomm was confirmed on Tuesday, while earlier that day Reuters had exclusively reported that the British company Arm had also shown an interest in Alphawave, albeit a passing one.\n\nCrucial technology for AI processing\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Arm has attempted to acquire Alphawave in order to gain access to crucial technology for building its own AI processors. The crown jewel is its so-called serdes (serializer-deserializer) technology, which determines how quickly information can be transported to and from a chip. This is critical for heavy AI workloads, such as fine-tuning or AI training, because these often require thousands of interconnected chips to function smoothly.\n\nThe possession of strategic IP is a major competitive advantage among chip parties, because competitors often need a license or must take the costly path toward an alternative implementation. Broadcom, for example, is known for a similar affinity with data serialization and deserialization, which has helped the company win over customers such as Google and OpenAI for their AI chips. Nvidia has also developed its own variant in this area.\n\nHowever, Arm has decided not to acquire Alphawave after initial talks with the company, according to two sources familiar with the situation. The exact reason for this has not been disclosed, but this opens the door for Qualcomm to possibly pursue its interest.\n\nComplex relationships in the chip industry\n\nThe interest in Alphawave is taking place against a backdrop of tense relations between Qualcomm and Arm. The two chip companies recently faced each other in court over licensing conditions. In December 2024, Qualcomm achieved an important victory in this legal battle when a jury ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s central processors were properly licensed under their agreement with Arm. If this legal conflict had gone differently, Qualcomm might have had to abandon the current Snapdragon Elite chips intended for Windows PCs.\n\nThe conflict with Arm arose after Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of chip startup Nuvia in 2021. Arm claimed that licensing terms had been violated because Qualcomm had bypassed the more expensive Nuvia license by using the technology under its own, cheaper Arm license. The problem became so serious that Arm even threatened to terminate the license agreement with Qualcomm. That would have been a step with far-reaching consequences for the smartphone industry, where Qualcomm is supreme outside the Apple domain.\n\nAt the same time, Arm has ambitions that go beyond just licensing its technology. Under the leadership of CEO Rene Haas, the company has also started to focus on developing complete chip designs, making it increasingly a competitor to customers such as Qualcomm. This has not yet led to major problems, but Arm has clearly left behind its role as \u2018chip Switzerland\u2019.\n\nStrategic interests\n\nIt is also worth noting (as Reuters has already done) that Alphawave has a joint venture in China called WiseWave, which it operates with the Chinese investor Wise Road Capital. This investor was blacklisted by US officials last year due to national security concerns. Such ties with China could be a complicating factor in a takeover by US companies such as Qualcomm.\n\nAlthough Arm itself does not seem to be willing to take over Alphawave, its parent company is. Last month, for example, Arm owner SoftBank announced it had taken over chip designer Ampere Computing for 6.5 billion dollars. Ampere specializes in CPUs based on Arm architecture and focuses on AI workloads. Although x86 is still dominant in server racks worldwide, Ampere chips are considered one of the most prominent Arm-based alternatives.",

            "content": "Qualcomm has acquired the generative AI division of Vietnamese AI research company VinAI for an undisclosed sum, marking the chipmaker's second AI acquisition in 2025 as it continues to invest in edge AI capabilities.\n\nKey Points:\n\nVinAI founder and CEO Dr. Hung Bui will join Qualcomm following the acquisition\n\nThis is Qualcomm's second AI acquisition in 2025, following Edge Impulse in March\n\nThe acquired division will contribute to Qualcomm's smartphone, PC, and automotive products\n\nThe San Diego-based chip giant announced Tuesday it has purchased MovianAI, formerly the generative AI division of VinAI, a Hanoi-headquartered AI research company that's part of the Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup.\n\nQualcomm is rapidly expanding its appetite for AI talent and technology as it positions itself at the forefront of edge computing (AI that runs on devices rather than in data centers) which CEO Cristiano Amon recently described as a \"tailwind\" for the company.\n\nVinAI, founded in 2019 by former Google DeepMind research scientist Dr. Hung Bui, has built a reputation in AI research with approximately 200 employees across offices in Hanoi, the United States, and Australia. While primarily focused on automotive AI products like in-cabin monitoring and \"smart parking\" systems, the company has also conducted broader AI research in computer vision, language models, and other generative AI technologies.\n\n\"This acquisition underscores our commitment to dedicating the necessary resources to R&D that makes us the driving force behind the next wave of AI innovation,\" said Jilei Hou, Qualcomm's Senior Vice President of Engineering, in the acquisition announcement.\n\nThe talent acquisition appears to be a central motivation for the deal. Dr. Bui will join Qualcomm following the close of the acquisition, bringing his expertise in generative AI and machine learning to the chipmaker's growing AI division.\n\n\"We are ready to contribute to Qualcomm's mission of making breakthroughs in fundamental AI research and scale them across industries, including smartphones, PCs, software-defined vehicles, and more,\" said Dr. Bui in a statement. \"Our team's expertise in generative AI and machine learning will help accelerate the development of innovative solutions that can transform the way we live and work.\"\n\nThis acquisition continues Qualcomm's pattern of AI-focused investments in 2025, coming shortly after its purchase of Edge Impulse, a German AI and Internet of Things company, in early March. The company appears to be aggressively building out its AI capabilities to maintain competitiveness in the evolving chip market, where AI processing has become a key differentiator.\n\nFor Vietnam's technology ecosystem, the acquisition represents both a win and a loss \u2013 validation of the country's growing AI talent pool, but also the departure of a homegrown AI division to a global tech giant. Qualcomm noted that it has been working with the Vietnamese technology ecosystem for more than 20 years, helping fuel growth in the country's information and communication technology industry.\n\nFinancial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, consistent with Qualcomm's approach to its previous Edge Impulse purchase earlier this year.",

            "content": "With 6G standardization work officially underway, Qualcomm is working to make its R&D work a commercial reality\n\nAs the world begins shaping the 6G era, Qualcomm is taking a dual-track approach: building on the strengths of 5G while pursuing transformative new capabilities. During an interview at Mobile World Congress, Qualcomm SVP of Engineering and Global Head of Wireless Research John Smee laid out the company\u2019s blueprint for 6G, bringing to light both evolutionary and revolutionary ideas. On the evolutionary side, Qualcomm is driving innovation in spectrum efficiency and network reach. But in parallel, the company is exploring a revolutionary vision of networks that are intelligent, perceptive, and adaptive\u2014from digital replicas of the physical world to AI embedded directly in the air interface.\n\nAt the heart of 6G\u2019s evolution lies Qualcomm\u2019s effort to maximize the value of currently deployed spectrum, and spectrum expected to be made available for 6G. For coverage, this means enhancing performance in sub-2 GHz FDD bands and standardizing integration between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) to enable ubiquitous connectivity. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing a lot of innovation into those lower spectrum bands,\u201d Smee said, emphasizing uplink performance for a world increasingly driven by user-generated content. \u201cAnd, at the same time, [we\u2019re] making sure we\u2019re doing the standards work necessary to have that integration between terrestrial and non-terrestrial\u201d networks, he added.\n\nOn the capacity front, Qualcomm is scaling up 5G\u2019s massive MIMO for mid-band spectrum into \u201cGiga-MIMO,\u201d targeting upper mid-band spectrum (6\u20138 GHz) to dramatically increase antenna density and improve beamforming. Smee also took on operators\u2019 desire to reuse existing infrastructure as a cost-effective transiton path to 6G. \u201cYou\u2019re going to leverage your existing footprint on the network side, and yet you\u2019re moving to an even higher frequency with this Giga-MIMO\u2026That\u2019s going to be really important to bring more capacity into 6G.\u201d\n\nWhere 5G relied heavily on simulation and statistical modeling, 6G will be built and optimized using real-time, high-fidelity digital twins. Qualcomm\u2019s vision involves creating precise, 3D models of the network and physical environment\u2014tools that go far beyond planning exercises to become part of the network\u2019s operational fabric.\n\nAt its San Diego headquarters, Qualcomm has deployed an Open RAN development platform that includes service management and orchestration (SMO) and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) capabilities. This is paired with an advanced network digital twin that uses AI to perform end-to-end, closed loop optimizations.\n\nBig picture on network digital twins, Smee described a dual role in enabling new services and enhancing network operations.\u201cOn one hand it could be enabling a new service\u2026[and] it enables the network itself to optimize itself better because it has a better understanding of the environment. So we see it as a kind of two-sided: operations side and also an interesting use case in and of itself.\u201d\n\nAnother revolutionary step is treating the network as not just a communications system, but also as a sensing system. Qualcomm is building on 5G\u2019s wideband signaling to enable RF-based sensing applications\u2014tracking drones, mapping environments, and performing radar-like functions using communications waveforms. \u201cWe\u2019re designing 6G to ensure the waveform can do positioning, can do ranging,\u201d said Smee. Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) sets the stage for situational awareness, safety applications, and entirely new types of services where the network sees and responds to the physical world in real time.\n\nSmee explained that ensuring the waveform supports sensing is the \u201cintegrated part of sensing and communication.\u201d He added: \u201cIt also opens this new door that\u2026once the network is able to do that sensing of the environment, it can leverage technologies like sub-band full duplex so it can be listening as well as transmitting on the network side, and get that RF signature. For us it\u2019s a really interesting one.\u201d\n\nWith AI gradually being brought into 5G, a key goal for 6G is to make AI part of the network\u2019s DNA. Qualcomm\u2019s AI-native vision means AI isn\u2019t just running on endpoints or in the cloud\u2014it\u2019s embedded into devices, the RAN, and the air interface itself. This allows for new performance enhancements, including better channel state feedback, end-to-end traffic optimization, and dynamic security protocols. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having AI in the device and the network,\u201d Smee noted. \u201cIt\u2019s about AI being baked into the specification of how devices and networks communicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how AI is an application, it\u2019s part of the toolbox for any engineer today, and it\u2019s also something that, from a standards standpoint, we can bring AI directly into the standard.\u201d\n\nQualcomm\u2019s 6G research shows a network that evolves smartly while revolutionizing deeply. With its roots in improved spectrum use and its branches in digital twins, ISAC, and AI-native architecture, 6G will be more than a faster, better network\u2014it will be an intelligent, adaptive infrastructure for the future of connectivity.",

The company likely aims to keep this lineup going with the arrival of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, which could be announced a couple of days from now, as a teaser poster hints at a future launch, though the chipset\u2019s exact model name has not been mentioned.\n\nUnlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will lack in-house Oryon cores and will rely on older ARM CPU designs\n\nUsing Google Lens, the teaser\u2019s machine translation to English reveals the terms \u2018New generation, powerful group,\u2019 and below, it is mentioned \u2018Snapdragon Flagship New Product Media.\u2019 While we cannot expect the app to deliver an accurate \u2018word to word\u2019 translation, we have learned that what Qualcomm intends to announce will occupy a premium space in the company\u2019s family of chipsets. Various accounts on X believe that the release will be the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, with some of them also referring to the silicon as the Snapdragon 8s Elite.\n\nHowever, we will prefer to call the upcoming SoC the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 because there are a ton of differences separating this chipset from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, with the most obvious one being the absence of in-house Oryon cores. The Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will instead rely on older ARM designs, with the configuration being \u20181 + 3 + 2 + 2.\u2019 The fastest core is expected to be the Cortex-X4, operating at 3.21GHz, followed by three Cortex-A720 cores running at 3.01GHz, two Cortex-A720 cores functioning at 2.80GHz, and lastly, two Cortex-A720 sporting a 2.02GHz frequency.\n\nAside from this configuration, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is also said to feature an Adreno 825 GPU, with Anvin commenting on X that the AnTuTu score obtained by this SoC has exceeded 2 million. These specifications reveal that Qualcomm\u2019s upcoming release will not rely on any low-power cores, which will help to maintain incredible multi-core performance, but at the cost of power draw. We assume that the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will leverage TSMC\u2019s 4nm N4P node to maintain optimum efficiency, meaning the chipset may perform equivalent to the previous-generation Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. As for the other details, those will be revealed during the official announcement, so stay tuned.",

            "content": "QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM) has had a rough week with its share price down 4.6%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:\n\n39% = US$10b \u00f7 US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.39 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nQUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE\n\nTo begin with, QUALCOMM has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 12% net income growth seen by QUALCOMM over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% over the last few years.\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QCOM? You can find out in\n\nIs QUALCOMM Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nQUALCOMM has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 36% (or a retention ratio of 64%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.\n\nAdditionally, QUALCOMM has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 29% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that QUALCOMM's future ROE will be 35% which is again, similar to the current ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with QUALCOMM's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nIf you're looking to trade QUALCOMM , open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other top growth stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio.\n\nBuy \u201ceverything\u201d related to China has been David Tepper\u2019s investment theme despite the uncertainties about the economy amid a trade spat with the US. The president and founder of Appaloosa Management LP believes China\u2019s economy is well-positioned to bounce back from the COVID-19-triggered slowdown.\n\n\u201cEverything. ETFs, I would do futures \u2014 everything. Everything,\u201d Tepper said during an interview on CNBC when asked about which Chinese equities.\n\nConsequently, Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s portfolio has built significant exposure to Chinese equities, with the biggest holding offering exposure to the country\u2019s internet landscape. The investment strategy is increasingly paying off as Chinese stocks have enjoyed a bull run in response to Beijing unveiling a sweep of measures aimed at boosting economic growth.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 13 Growth Stock Picks and Top 10 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nWith 5.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, China\u2019s economy exceeded expectations thanks to Beijing\u2019s stimulus policies, which included interest rate reductions. Investors are awaiting information on further fiscal assistance for the struggling real estate sector and consumer demand.\n\nIncreased focus on Chinese equities affirms Tepper\u2019s philosophy, which often revolves around contrarian views on the market. His focus on Chinese equities comes amid growing concerns that they would be hit hard as the US imposes significant trade tariffs on China in a bid to trim the trade deficit between the two economic powerhouses.\n\nAmid the concerns, the founder of Appaloosa Management LP insists on the need to deploy significant risk management to offset the impacts of the ongoing trade war. Similarly, Tepper has already emphasized the need to stay invested in bull markets, which appear and remain calm during market downturns, as the one in play in the US.\n\nUS equities have been under immense pressure in the first quarter of 2025, which is attributed to uncertainties about US trade wars and the reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The S&P 500 has already shed nearly 3% in value and is on course to record its first quarterly decline since July of 2023.\n\nThe selloff in the US equity markets also comes at the backdrop of disappointing financial results from some companies that have been reported. Market participants have also not been impressed by the guidance that signals potential weakness across the board amid deteriorating macroeconomics.\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s this negative bias out there. You just don\u2019t know to what degree,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nAnalysts are becoming increasingly wary regarding US corporate profits for the first quarter of this year, as policies from the Trump administration pose a risk of igniting a global trade conflict that could hinder economic expansion. Predictions for the S&P 500\u2019s performance in the first quarter of 2025 have decreased by 4.5 percentage points, marking the most significant downward adjustment since the last quarter of 2023, according to his remarks.\n\nEarnings growth for S&P 500 firms is now projected to be 7.7% compared to the previous year, which would represent the lowest rate since the third quarter of 2023 and a substantial drop from 17.1% in the final quarter of 2024, according to data from LSEG released on Friday.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are worried about things like tariffs \u2026 Really, it\u2019s a broad economic slowdown that is the one thing that would be very difficult for companies to contend with,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe combed Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify the top 10 growth stocks in Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s portfolio. From the resultant data, we settled on the top 10 picks and analyzed them on why they stand out as growth picks. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the value of Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s equity stakes while also detailing hedge fund sentiment around the stocks, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nAppaloosa Management LP\u2019s Equity Stakes: $122.90 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor giant known for developing and licensing chipsets, processors, modems, and RF systems for mobile devices, automotive, computing, and IoT. It is one of the top growth stocks in Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s portfolio as a leader in smartphone chipsets.\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) has sought to strengthen its growth metrics by releasing its AI-enabled Snapdragon 3 Gen 8 mobile processor. Revenue growing by double-digit levels in the last three quarters underscores the robust underlying growth. Revenue for its fiscal Q1 ended December 29 increased 17% to $11.67 billion. Its semiconductor sector (QCT) saw a 20% increase in revenue to $10.1 billion. Vehicle revenue jumped 61% to $961 million as revenue from the Internet of Things (IoT) increased 36% to $1.5 billion.\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) attributed its substantial handset revenue to increased sales of high-end Android smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 models running on its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. Additionally, it stated that its sales to Chinese clients remain strong due to the country\u2019s growing premium market.\n\nOverall, QCOM ranks 7th on our list of top growth stocks in David Tepper\u2019s Portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Google Pixel handsets aside, the best Android phones use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. It\u2019s a chipset that goes toe-to-toe with Apple\u2019s A18 Pro used in the iPhone 16 Pro, and two new leaks have given us an idea of how its successor will keep things competitive with the iPhone 17.\n\nFirst up, on Weibo, the reliable leaker Digital Chat Station has what he claims to be raw specifications of SM8850 \u2014 the model number for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.\n\nWhile the layout is the same, with two prime cores and six performance cores, there are still some noteworthy improvements. For starters, the leaker says that it will be built to TSMC\u2019s N3P process, for a smaller, more efficient design. It will also pack the Adreno 840 GPU \u2014 a step up from the 830 used on its predecessor.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the leaker says that it supports SME1 and SVE2 extensions. These relate to machine learning, computer vision and other related fields, and, as Android Authority explains, the support for SVE2 suggests that the chipset is built on ArmV9 architecture. That\u2019s a big step up from the Elite 8, which was built on ArmV8.\n\n\n\nClock speeds aren\u2019t revealed here, but on X, the leaker Jukanlosreve not only reports that the GPU will be 1.35GHz (up from 1.1GHz on the 830), but gives us an insight into what kind of performance boost the new chipset will bring to the table. We\u2019re apparently looking at a 25% boost to single-core performance and 20% for multi-core.\n\nSM8850 (Snapdragon 8 Elite 2)ST: 25% increase compared to predecessor \u2013 4000MT: 20% increase compared to predecessor \u2013 13,000Adreno 840 at 1.35GHzSource:UndeadMarch 28, 2025\n\nA worthy iPhone 17 competitor?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIf past Qualcomm releases are anything to go by, we\u2019d expect the company to reveal the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 between October and November. It will then gradually filter through to Android flagships over the next few months, with the first major release expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S26 early next year.\n\nThat means it will arrive after the A19 chipset debuts in the iPhone 17 range in September. It is also tipped to be using TSMC\u2019s N3P fabrication process, and while we haven\u2019t heard anything definitive, Apple tends to boost performance by around 20% each generation.\n\nAfter a period of having the upper hand over Qualcomm, it\u2019s become extremely close with the Snapdragon 8 series. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset achieved Geekbench scores of 3,031 and 9,829 to the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 3,386 and 8,306.

The first evidence of the upcoming SoC\u2019s raw capabilities is demonstrated by the latest AnTuTu result, which a tipster claims is 40.7 percent faster than the fastest Android smartphone at this time for this particular benchmark. Let us take a closer look at these scores.\n\nIn AnTuTu, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 is rumored to have obtained a score of 3.8 million, gaining a significant lead over the Snapdragon 8 Elite\n\nShortly after sharing some partial specifications of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 on Weibo, Digital Chat Station has revealed the alleged AnTuTu results of Qualcomm\u2019s upcoming flagship chipset. Apparently, the SoC accumulated a score of a whopping 3.8 million, making the results 40.7 percent higher than what the iQOO 13 has garnered on AnTuTu\u2019s leaderboards. Based on the charts, the iQOO 13 is currently the fastest Android smartphone tested on the benchmark suite, with a result just a fraction short of the 2.7 million mark.\n\nSince AnTuTu employs a combination of both CPU-focused and GPU-focused tests, we would like to assume that the CPU cluster and Adreno 840 bring a wide range of improvements to the table. Additionally, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 being mass produced on TSMC\u2019s third-generation 3nm \u2018N3P\u2019 process should allow the silicon to offer a slight performance boost at the same power draw as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Earlier, we reported that Qualcomm was slated to bring its improved \u2018Pegasus\u2019 cores to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2\u2019s cluster, with a previous rumor stating that the performance cores were tested at 5.00GHz.\n\nThis frequency bump, along with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 supporting ARM\u2019s Scalable Matrix Extension, or SME, could result in the chipset obtaining such a high score in AnTuTu. Of course, since the launch is months away, we recommend readers treat these figures with a pinch of salt, and we will back with more updates. Then again, such scores have us excited about what is to come in the future.\n\nNews Source: Digital Chat Station",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report posted on March 25, Chinese AI firms have made significant progress in closing the technology gap with the U.S., with some areas now only three months behind, according to 01.AI CEO Lee Kai-fu. He highlighted DeepSeek\u2019s advancements in optimizing chip usage and algorithm efficiency, allowing China to compete more closely in AI development. Despite U.S. semiconductor sanctions, Chinese companies have adapted by improving their algorithms, with DeepSeek even surpassing expectations in certain areas like infrastructure software engineering.\n\nAs per the report, Lee emphasized that investing in proprietary models is becoming more challenging due to competition from major tech firms and open-source alternatives, leading 01.AI to focus on AI applications instead. The company recently launched Wanzhi, a platform for enterprise AI deployment, and expects substantial revenue growth in 2025.\n\nChina Advances AI Despite US Chip Export Controls\n\nSenior foreign officials and major tech companies are urging the Trump administration to ease AI chip export restrictions. In a discussion on March 25, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh explained that initial U.S. controls began in 2022 under the Biden administration, limiting the semiconductor kingpin\u2019s high-end chip shipments to China by restricting interconnect bandwidth. These measures expanded with a 168-page diffusion rule categorizing countries based on access levels. Despite restrictions, Chinese firms like Ant Group continue AI advancements by optimizing available resources, including Huawei and AMD chips, reducing pre-training costs by 20% through heterogeneous computing.\n\nAccording to Singh, the semiconductor kingpin argues that these restrictions are cutting into its revenue, with its China exposure dropping from 20% to below 10%, while AI firms like OpenAI claim the market remains undersupplied, further driving demand for GPUs. Singh noted that U.S. AI models still outperform Chinese counterparts in reasoning and multimodal tasks, giving them a competitive edge. Furthermore, investors remain confident in the Mag 7 stocks, viewing market dips as buying opportunities. However, concerns are rising about data center expansion and energy supply challenges, especially in regions beyond traditional hubs like Virginia.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 database of over 1000 hedge funds.",

            "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +2.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.8% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has lost 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nQualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 points to a change of +15.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.45 indicates a change of +5.8% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $10.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.8%. The $42.92 billion and $44.5 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.2% and +3.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $11.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.5%. EPS of $3.41 for the same period compares with $2.75 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.87%. The EPS surprise was +16.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nQualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "It\u2019s been a long wait, but after years of user complaints about Windows Search's shortcomings, the OS is finally introducing a brand-new, AI-driven, NPU-powered system search engine based on semantics rather than keywords.\n\nOne of the \u2018big three\u2019 Windows AI features (including Recall and Click to Do), Semantic Search is a comprehensive system overhaul of how to find documents, images, file names, or even system settings.\n\nHands-on with Windows Recall on Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs! - YouTube Watch On\n\nHowever, there is one caveat: The new Semantic Search feature, now rolling out with Windows Update KB5053656 (Preview Release channel, OS Build 26100.3624), is only available to current Qualcomm Snapdragon X-series laptops like the Surface Pro 11 and the Lenovo Legion Slim 7x.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; Microsoft says \u201csupport for AMD and Intel\" is \"coming soon\" to join the best Copilot+ PCs out there.\n\nMicrosoft announced this update to the Windows Insider Release Preview channel just a few days ago, and it is likely a significant talking point at Microsoft\u2019s forthcoming AI event.\n\nWindows 11 'AI edition:' A work in progress\n\nWhile looking similar to the old Windows Search the new AI-driven one, which relies on an NPU, is much faster and smarter. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nMicrosoft introduced improved Windows Search last October, allowing users to leverage descriptive queries to locate settings and content. The update leverages the NPUs inside Copilot+ PCs, which are designed to have at least 40 TOPS for AI workloads and are available across File Explorer, Settings, and the universal Windows Search pane.\n\nWith AI-driven Semantic Search, you can describe the document or image you\u2019re searching for, and Windows will locate it for you\u2014no need to remember exact file names anymore.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nEssentially, the system search in Windows 11 is now \u201csmart,\u201d a feature that has been long-awaited due to Apple\u2019s popular Spotlight tool in macOS. While not AI-driven, Spotlight does allow Mac users to utilize natural language support and contextual understanding, making it superior to regular Windows Search. However, it likely trails the new NPU-powered Semantic Search, as NPUs are faster and more efficient.\n\nMicrosoft explains how the system works:\n\n\"To improve your search results, Copilot+ PCs perform semantic indexing along with traditional indexing. Supported file formats include .txt, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .rtf, .pptx, .ppt, .xls, .xlsx for documents and .jpg/.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .ico for images. Semantic indexing makes your searches more powerful since items that are close and related to your search terms would also be included in your search results. For instance, if you searched for pasta you might also get results for lasagna, including images that contain pasta or lasagna.\n\nAll data gathered from semantic indexing is stored locally on your PC. None of it is ever sent to Microsoft or used to train AI models. Semantic indexing is enabled by default on Copilot+ PCs. If you want to disable indexing and searching for specific locations or file types, you can do so by selecting the appropriate options under Settings > Privacy & Security > Searching Windows > Advanced indexing options.\"\n\nCopilot+ PCs hit the market last June, but the launch lacked standout features tied to the branding. Senior Editor Zac Bowden labeled the rollout a \"total disaster,\" with the absence of must-have exclusives being a key factor.\n\nThat narrative could shift as Microsoft enhances Windows Search and File Explorer with AI, potentially addressing long-standing frustrations.\n\nIndeed, as noted above, Microsoft is set to take the stage next Friday, April 4th, at 9:30 AM ET (live streamed). The company will discuss consumer AI and Copilot, likely hinting at more extensive plans for its OS and connected systems. I'll be at the event to cover any breaking news.\n\nMicrosoft may also announce its new, slightly smaller Surface Pro and Surface Laptop editions, which are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors. We exclusively reported that these PCs were coming back in January. These editions align nicely with the latest Windows 11 KB5053656 update now rolling out to Windows Insiders (Release Preview).\n\nA general rollout of this OS update for non-Windows Insiders is expected in the coming weeks.",

            "content": "Qualcomm is nearing a big decision. It's reportedly gearing up to release a new, midrange Snapdragon chip. While this \"budget\" SoC is rumored to be powered by Arm cores \u2014 not the custom Oryon cores powering other Elite chips \u2014 it's unclear whether the company will still use \"Elite\" branding. We've seen reports use both Snapdragon 8s Elite and Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to refer to the unannounced mobile chip.\n\nThe problem? The custom Oryon CPU cores are what make Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, well, \"elite.\" Let's review how we got here.\n\nThe switch from Arm to Oryon\n\nLast year, Qualcomm finally achieved its breakthrough moment. It launched the Snapdragon X lineup of laptop and desktop-class systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in June 2024 that would eventually disrupt the stronghold competitors AMD and Intel had on personal computing. Then, Qualcomm used what it learned to develop the Snapdragon X platform and brought it to mobile with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.\n\nBy now, I've had the chance to review and test multiple Snapdragon X and Snapdragon 8 Elite laptops and phones, respectively. They're both as good as advertised. Snapdragon X brought excellent power efficiency and responsiveness to Windows laptops, and Snapdragon 8 Elite brought massive year-over-year performance improvements to Android smartphones.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nOryon cores are the secret to Qualcomm's major success. The company used its own custom Oryon cores instead of off-the-shelf designs from Arm to make the Snapdragon X, Snapdragon X Plus, and Snapdragon X Elite SoCs. Essentially, it followed the same blueprint Apple used when designing its own silicon.\n\nA quick look at Qualcomm's PC processors reveals that chips with Oryon cores don't always use the Elite brand. That's reserved for Qualcomm's best PC chips, while budget versions with slower clock speeds and/or fewer cores use names like Snapdragon X and Snapdragon X Plus.\n\nBut we've never seen a Qualcomm chip branded with the Elite tag that doesn't use custom Oryon cores. Although there are conflicting reports about whether the next Snapdragon 8s mobile processor will get a \"Gen 4\" or \"Elite\" brand name, the right option seems clear.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nQualcomm should name the unreleased midrange chip Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to avoid consumer confusion and keep the Elite brand sacred for the company's standout processors \u2014 those with Oryon cores.\n\nWhat will Qualcomm's next midrange chip be called?\n\nRight now, there's no official word on what Qualcomm will call the next Snapdragon 8s chip. One rumor from reputable leaker Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter) earlier this month said that the SoC was \"set to launch soon,\" referring to it as Snapdragon 8s Elite. More recently, a tip from Digital Chat Station this week on Weibo called the unreleased chip the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.\n\nAlthough both rumored names are only speculation at this point, one seems more fitting than the other.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nThat's because current leaks claim to reveal the upcoming Snapdragon 8s chip's core structure, and custom Oryon cores are absent. According to Digital Chat Station, this processor has a model number of SN8735. It is said to be headlined by a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, plus three more 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores. The SoC is also expected to include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 efficiency cores.\n\nIf this configuration turns out to be accurate, the Snapdragon 8s chip will use standard Arm designs rather than Qualcomm's best Oryon cores. This isn't a bad thing, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is expensive, and the \"s\" variant is supposed to be cheaper. However, it does mean that the Elite branding wouldn't exactly make sense for this particular SoC.\n\nQualcomm is rumored to make the right move\n\nQualcomm is a very large company operating in many different verticals, from cellular modems to smartphone and desktop chips. Under those circumstances, it's easy for naming schemes to get convoluted. Just look at what Intel and Sony have done over the years, releasing products like the Intel Core i9 14900K or the Sony WH-1000XM5.\n\nLuckily, Qualcomm seems to be aware of how important branding is for consumer clarity. At MWC Barcelona 2025, it introduced a new naming scheme for its vast portfolio of products. Qualcomm will be used for general products, like modems, with the Snapdragon brand serving consumer products and the Dragonwing brand covering the enterprise market.\n\n(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)\n\nQualcomm may be set up for an interesting decision. On the one hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Elite would make it clear that the to-be-released chip is part of the same generation as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. On the other hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 would make it clear that the chip isn't using custom Oryon cores.\n\nOnly time will tell which name Qualcomm will end up using. Personally, I'm voting for the next Snapdragon 8s SoC to be called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. While the Elite nomenclature is an excellent brand, it's too good to be diluted. Currently, every Elite chip features Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, and I think it should stay that way.",

(San Diego, Calif.) has filed complaints alleging anticompetitive practices by processor IP licensor ARM Holdings plc with the European Commission, the US Federal Trade Commission and Korea Fair Trade Commission.\n\nBloomberg reports that Qualcomm\u2019s complaint is that ARM \u2013 which has operated an open and equitable intellectual property licensing regime for more than 20 years \u2013 is now restricting access to technology and exploiting its market dominance as it prepares to operate in competition with its customers.\n\nThe multiple filings come after Qualcomm successfully defended itself in a lawsuit filed by ARM in a Delaware court.\n\nIn December 2024 the jury found that Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-PC processors, based on the ARM instruction set, were properly licensed and did not need a separate license to be negotiated. The formal result was a mis-trial, which left Qualcomm free to continue selling its Snapdragon X processors based on the Oryon core for now, but also left the way open for Arm to seek a re-trial, which it is expected to do.\n\nIn the trial it was revealed that CEO Rene Haas had written a strategy paper indicating ARM could start designing its own chips. Haas responded that as CEO it was his job to consider multiple possible courses of action and that this one has not been implemented.\n\nSince then it has been reported that ARM is designing a CPU for data centers as a \u201cchip platform\u201d that will be customizable for multiple customers with Meta as the first.\n\nRelated links and articles:\n\nwww.arm.com\n\nwww.qualcomm.com\n\nNews articles:\n\nARM signs Meta as first chip product customer, says report\n\nARM escalates Qualcomm dispute with license threat\n\nQualcomm hits back over ARM lawsuit\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : If you enjoyed this article, you will like the following ones: don't miss them by subscribing to : eeNews on Google News\n\nShare:",

President Trump\u2019s recent imposition of a 25% tax on car import tariffs may also figure. The companies, said Reuters, did not comment.\n\nThe meeting follows last week\u2019s China Development Forum, which traditionally sets out Chinese economic development plans and aims for the months ahead and tries to secure cooperation and investment from foreign enterprises to help it achieve its goals.\n\nFellow chip maker Broadcom (AVGO) was reportedly one of the U.S. firms which attended the event, though the number of Stars and Stripes companies was said to be lower than in previous years. That is largely due to heightened economic and political tensions between the U.S. and China since the return of President Trump to power in January.\n\nAiling Domestic Economy\n\nIt is partly because of the tariff hikes imposed on China by the U.S. and the shift in overseas manufacturing facilities to other Asian nations such as Vietnam since the Covid pandemic that China is looking for a pick-up in overseas investment.\n\nChina also wants to boost what it sees as an ailing domestic economy \u2013 despite projections of 5% growth this year \u2013 hit by a property crisis and lower consumer confidence. At the forum, Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged countries to open their markets and fight \u201crising instability and uncertainty.\u201d It may be hoping to use Trump\u2019s aggressive economic policies to curry favour with global firms looking to expand in existing or new markets.\n\nIs QCOM a Good Stock to Buy Now?\n\nOn TipRanks, QCOM has a Moderate Buy consensus based on 11 Buy, 7 Hold and 1 Sell rating.

It's said Qualcomm has filed confidential complaints with the United States Federal Commission, European Commission, and Korea Fair Trade Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longstanding relationship between Qualcomm and Arm is a mutually beneficial one, and at the same time contentious. It's growing even more combative as both companies attempt to ride the AI chip boom to new heights. For example, Qualcomm recently won a court battle in Delaware, in the which the company convinced a jury that it didn't need a new license to employ Arm's IP after acquiring chip startup Nuvia for $1.4 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow just a few months later, Qualcomm is trying to convince multiple regulatory agencies that Arm is hurting competition by restricting access to its chip technologies, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Qualcomm's vantage point, Arm's open licensing model that has been in place for decades has been good for the industry, while also creating a reliance in its technology. To that point, there's a good chance that at least one of your in-home devices is running on an Arm-based design, be it the chip inside your smartphone, wireless router, tablet, or any number of smart devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, Qualcomm is accusing Arm of restricting access to key technologies that should be available under its current license agreements. While not specified in the report, this is likely in reference to Arm's AI-optimized compute subsystems (CSS) solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, Arm disagrees with Qualcomm's assessment, going so far as to call its longtime customer's latest accusations nothing more than a \"desperate attempt\" to conceal the merits of Arm's business practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Arm remains focused on enhancing innovation, promoting competition, and respecting contractual rights and obligations,\" Arm told Bloomberg in an email. \"Any allegation of anticompetitive conduct is nothing more than a desperate attempt by Qualcomm to detract from the merits and expand the parties\u2019 ongoing commercial dispute for its own competitive benefit.\"\n\n\n\n",

With technical momentum shifting and a wave of bullish sentiment building, Qualcomm is beginning to look like it\u2019s coiling tightly, ready to break out.\n\nGet QUALCOMM alerts: Sign Up\n\nQualcomm Fundamentals Are Quietly Impressive\n\nQUALCOMM Today QCOM QUALCOMM $158.39 -1.76 (-1.10%) 52-Week Range $149.43 \u25bc $230.63 Dividend Yield 2.15% P/E Ratio 16.92 Price Target $205.32 Add to Watchlist\n\nQualcomm may not make as many headlines as NVIDIA Corp NASDAQ: NVDA or Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ: AMD, but its financial performance has been consistently strong. For several quarters now, the company has delivered solid earnings results that have exceeded expectations on both revenue and EPS.\n\nQualcomm has made a deliberate push to diversify away from smartphones, investing heavily in automotive chips, edge computing and AI-driven processors. These segments are not just growing; they are helping to stabilize earnings, even as mobile demand softens.\n\nIts automotive division, in particular, is gaining traction. Qualcomm\u2019s vehicle chip revenue is expected to grow steadily in the years ahead, positioning it as one of the leading suppliers in the space. Meanwhile, its AI-focused chips designed for inference and edge devices are well-timed to capitalize on broader consumer and industrial device adoption trends.\n\nQualcomm Valuation Adds Even More Fuel\n\nYou do not often find a semiconductor company with consistent performance, long-term growth potential and a price-to-earnings ratio of just 17. But that\u2019s where Qualcomm sits today.\n\nCompare that to NVIDIA\u2019s PE ratio of 41 or AMD\u2019s 114, and it becomes clear that Qualcomm offers rare value in a sector where sky-high multiples are the norm. While NVIDIA and AMD certainly command premium valuations due to their dominance in GPUs and AI infrastructure, Qualcomm\u2019s lower multiple, paired with strong fundamentals, makes it a standout for value-conscious investors.\n\nAt current levels, Qualcomm looks deeply undervalued, and this valuation gap alone could act as a catalyst for rotation back into the stock as broader tech sentiment recovers.\n\nAnalysts Are Starting to Speak Up for Qualcomm\n\nAlso of note is the fact that Wall Street hasn\u2019t missed the bullish setup. Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating last month, along with a $240 price target, which, from Tuesday night\u2019s close of $160, implies an upside of 50%.\n\nAnalysts across the board have pointed to Qualcomm\u2019s resilient business model and expanding end-market exposure as key reasons to remain bullish. There\u2019s a growing recognition that Qualcomm\u2019s diversification efforts are beginning to pay off and that the market may have been too quick to discount its upside. With attention still focused on the mega-cap names in the chip space, a breakout from Qualcomm could turn some heads.\n\nQualcomm Technicals Align With the Bullish Case\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Price Chart for Wednesday, March, 26, 2025\n\nThe technical backdrop is also turning increasingly supportive. Qualcomm\u2019s RSI has been rising from previously oversold levels and now sits comfortably in an uptrend. More significantly, the MACD has just completed its first bullish crossover in months. This is often one of the most reliable technical signals for a trend reversal, especially when confirmed by strong support holding.\n\nThe $150 level has now been tested multiple times, and each test has been met with buying pressure. Combined with positive MACD momentum and improving RSI, this creates an environment where a breakout above recent highs becomes a very real possibility.\n\nGetting Involved With Qualcomm Stock\n\nQualcomm may not have the AI buzz of some of its peers, but its case for a breakout is rooted in solid, verifiable strength. The fundamentals are strong, the valuation is attractive, and the technical setup is increasingly hard to ignore.\n\nFor investors who want exposure to the chip sector without paying nosebleed multiples, this may be one of the better opportunities in the market right now. If the $150 level continues to hold, and all signs suggest it will, Qualcomm could well be gearing up for its next leg higher.\n\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and QUALCOMM wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile QUALCOMM currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Qualcomm now claims that Arm is moving to limit access to its IP in order to develop and sell its own chips \u2014putting it in direct competition with its licensees.\n\nThe dispute has surfaced amid an ongoing legal battle between the two companies. During the recent Arm v. Qualcomm trial, Qualcomm\u2019s legal team introduced a strategic document written by Arm CEO Rene Haas and presented to the company\u2019s board. The document reportedly outlined a vision for Arm to begin designing its own chips.\n\nWhen questioned about the strategy in court, Haas stated that Arm does not currently manufacture chips but emphasized the need to plan for the future.\n\nReports suggest Arm is exploring the development of proprietary chips, with Meta mentioned as a potential early customer.

According to the report, Qualcomm executives have made similar monopolistic accusations against Arm in private meetings and confidential filings with regulators.\n\nQualcomm and Arm Turn from Partners to Rivals\n\nOver the past two decades, Arm has followed an open licensing model for its chip design technology, where it also had licensing deals with QCOM. This strategy led several chip makers to rely heavily on Arm\u2019s technology. However, Arm is now reportedly trying to thwart competition as it seeks to advance its own chipmaking goals.\n\nBoth Qualcomm and Arm are trying to leverage their expertise in the growing computing market, manufacturing chips for desktops and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon platform is used for running high-speed AI, security, and graphics. Meanwhile, Arm\u2019s chip design technology is widely used by chip makers across the globe.\n\nThe latest lawsuits follow a federal court hearing from December 2024 alleging Qualcomm-owned Nuvia of breaching a licensing agreement with Arm. During the trial, QCOM was acquitted on two of the three charges. First, the eight-person jury ruled that the company did not violate Nuvia\u2019s license agreement with Arm. Second, the jury ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s custom CPUs (Computer Processing Units) used in Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) PCs (Personal Computers) were legally licensed under its existing agreement with Arm.\n\nIs Qualcomm Stock a Buy?\n\nAnalysts remain divided on Qualcomm\u2019s stock trajectory. On TipRanks, QCOM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating.

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best semiconductor stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nThe global semiconductor market is poised for substantial growth, with research firm MarketsandMarkets estimating its value to reach $628 billion in 2024 and expand to $707 billion by 2025, reflecting a robust 12.5% growth rate. The firm, in their Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook 2025 report, also highlights that this surge is driven by increasing demand for semiconductors in data centers, high-performance computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. As AI adoption accelerates, semiconductors are cementing their role as the foundation of next-generation digital infrastructure. The rising needs of hyperscalers and cloud service providers, particularly in handling AI workloads, are expected to further drive semiconductor industry expansion.\n\nFurther, MarketsandMarkets notes that the key growth drivers for the semiconductor sector in 2025 include high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that is crucial for AI accelerators and GPUs, AI servers that power deep learning and real-time analytics, and Gen-AI smartphones featuring advanced AI-integrated chips. However, the industry faces notable challenges as well, including supply chain disruptions and evolving regulatory frameworks that impact production costs, market access, and overall growth.\n\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and ongoing uncertainties, such as tariffs and trade policies, have been major discussion points among investors. Jordan Klein, Managing Director at Mizuho Securities, had addressed the industry\u2019s demand outlook in a CNBC interview, emphasizing that semiconductor stocks often anticipate market fundamentals six months in advance. While AI-driven companies like NVIDIA are experiencing strong demand, other segments, such as memory, PCs, and industrial chips, are not delivering significant earnings surprises. Meanwhile, investors are increasingly favoring sectors like software and fintech over semiconductors. Klein also raised concerns about a potential slowdown in 2025, suggesting that many investors are currently adopting a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach rather than buying in expectation of near-term improvements. While AI-driven semiconductor companies are likely to maintain momentum, weaker segments may struggle to recover in the short term.\n\nSo far, Klein\u2019s take seems to be playing out. The S&P Semiconductors Industry Index is down nearly 13% in 2025, significantly lagging the broader S&P 500, which has fallen about 3.5%. But there\u2019s a silver lining\u2014historically, when semiconductor companies start cutting earnings estimates, their stock prices tend to rebound because those cuts are often already priced in. This could create buying opportunities for long-term investors.\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, the long-term outlook for semiconductors remains strong. AI, cloud computing, and HPC will continue to push demand for advanced chips, and while cyclical downturns and regulatory challenges may create volatility, they also open the door for investors to buy quality semiconductor stocks at lower valuations. Keeping an eye on earnings revisions and broader market trends could help investors find solid entry points in this ever-evolving industry.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we first compiled a preliminary list of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment & Materials stocks using a review of online screeners, ETFs and financial media reports. We then analysed Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaire holdings to determine the most favoured semiconductor stocks among those investors. We then ranked top 10 of these stocks in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors holding positions in each company as of Q4 2024. Additionally, we also provide data to assess hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, utilizing data from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database to provide deeper insights into institutional investor trends.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on March 20.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 19\n\nBillionaire Holdings: $2.6 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nQUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a global leader in semiconductor technology, specializing in wireless communications. The company plays a crucial role in advancing 5G technology, supplying chipsets and system-on-chip solutions for mobile devices, automotive applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Its Snapdragon processors are widely used across smartphones and connected devices.\n\nIn early February, the company provided its Q2 2025 revenue outlook, projecting between $10.2 billion and $11.0 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS expected to be between $2.70 and $2.90. The company also reaffirmed its goal of reaching $22 billion in non-handset revenues by 2029.\n\nQUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported strong Q1 2025 earnings, which exceeded market expectations. Total revenue rose 17% year-over-year to $11.7 billion, while net income reached $3.8 billion, reflecting a solid net margin of 27.3%. The company\u2019s semiconductor division, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), performed well across all key markets. Additionally, the Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) segment posted a 20% revenue increase. Automotive and IoT segments also showed significant growth, with revenues increasing 61% and 36% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nDespite these strong results, QUALCOMM faces potential challenges, including a slowdown in the smartphone market and licensing uncertainties with Huawei. However, analysts remain optimistic about the stock\u2019s future. The median 12-month price target stands at $192, suggesting a potential 23% upside.\n\nOverall, QCOM ranks 5th on our list of best semiconductor stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

In it's back-and-forth battle, Qualcomm is now complaining to antitrust authorities that Arm is trying to hamper worldwide competition.\n\nQualcomm recently had private meetings with three antitrust organizations about Arm's alleged anticompetitive behavior. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that this new global antitrust campaign came after Arm tried restricting Qualcomm's ability to build silicon products.\n\nAccording to the insiders, Qualcomm met with representatives from the European Commission, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, and the US FTC. The company alleges that Arm, a longtime partner in the mobile chip business, is restricting access to its microchip technology after running an \"open network\" of silicon IP for more than 20 years.\n\nAlso read: Arm vs Qualcomm: mutually assured destruction\n\nQualcomm claims that Arm built a successful business model by forcing chip companies to rely exclusively on its processor technology and that the mobile ecosystem thrived as a result. However, things are now much different than they were two decades ago. Arm is trying to manufacture and sell chips, eliminating the need to go through third-party manufacturers and designers such as Qualcomm.\n\nIn response, Arm provided Bloomberg with an official statement. The British corporation vows to respect its contractual obligations with its technology partners and refutes all allegations about its anticompetitive conduct. It claims that Qualcomm is desperately trying to create a competitive advantage by diverting attention from the two companies' ongoing commercial disputes.\n\nEarlier this year, Arm stopped trying to bar Qualcomm from using its intellectual property. The conflict originated from Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia, a chip startup with a previous licensing agreement with Arm. Qualcomm plans to include Nuvia's Arm-compatible tech in future Snapdragon processors, but Arm claims Qualcomm cannot just take possession of Nuvia's license without its approval.\n\nQualcomm raised its antitrust complaint last December when representatives from the company met with FTC officials in Washington, DC. During the meeting, Qualcomm accused Arm of withholding some unspecified technology that should have been available through the existing license agreement between the two companies. More recently, Qualcomm voiced the same complaint with European authorities, stating that Arm seeks to compete directly with its own chip instead of providing the chip tech to third parties.

            "content": "Qualcomm is gearing up to launch the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 in April 2025, but while there seem to be some promising specs, there is some confusion about what the chipmaker will call its new products.\n\nInitially whispered to be called the Snapdragon 8s Elite, the upcoming SoC is shaping up to be a slightly less heroic version of its flagship sibling.\n\nAccording to the Digital Chat Station, it\u2019ll sport a 1+3+2+2 core layout featuring a Cortex-X4 running at 3.21 GHz, three Cortex-A720s at 3.01 GHz, two additional A720s at 2.80 GHz, and two efficiency-focused cores operating at 2.02 GHz.\n\nThe GPU department will be handled by the Adreno 825 \u2014 a junior member of the same family as the more powerful Adreno 830 found in the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It might not be top-shelf gaming silicon, but early whispers suggest this chip is no slouch, with AnTuTu benchmarks allegedly surpassing the 2 million mark. Not bad for a chip that\u2019s meant to sit somewhere between \u201cflagship\u201d and \u201cwe couldn\u2019t afford the real one.\u201d\n\nIt features 6MB of SLC and 8MB of L3 cache, which should enhance performance and power efficiency.\n\nSmartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 are expected to roll out soon after its launch, with the iQOO Z10 Turbo Pro and Redmi Turbo 4 Pro leading the charge. The latter is expected to rebrand itself globally as the Poco F7. This move suggests a dartboard is in charge of Xiaomi\u2019s product naming department.\n\nAlso sniffing around the launch are Xiaomi\u2019s Civi 5 Pro and Oppo\u2019s K13 Pro, both hoping to ride the \u201cnot quite a flagship but still kinda fast\u201d wave to relevance.\n\nOf course, none of this is official yet, so take it all with the usual Qualcomm-sized grain of salt. However, if true, it appears that April could bring another mildly confusing yet powerful chip to the Android SoC party.",

            "content": "Robert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Qualcomm could be rebranding its expected Snapdragon 8s Elite SoC as the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, potentially complicating its already complex naming conventions.\n\nThe leaked specifications suggest the chipset is built on TSMC\u2019s advanced 4nm process. It features a mix of Cortex-X4 and Cortex-A720 cores and an Adreno GPU similar to the one found in the existing Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nThis chip seemingly avoids the \u201cElite\u201d label because it lacks Qualcomm\u2019s proprietary Oryon CPU architecture.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon lineup can sometimes get difficult to follow, but the flagship end is a little less complicated than the rest of the lineup. Every year, we have a top-tier flagship SoC and a second \u201cs\u201d SoC for affordable flagships. After the success of the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, we have been hearing about the upcoming 8s Elite SoC for upcoming flagships. As it turns out, Qualcomm\u2019s flagship lineup is also set to get confusing as this SoC might get rebranded to 8s Gen 4.\n\nQualcomm has been spotted working on the SM8735, widely believed to be called the Snapdragon 8s Elite SoC. Leaker Digital Chat Station mentions that this part number could end up being called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.\n\nThe leaker has also shared allegedly finalized specifications of the processor. According to the leaker, the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is built on TSMC\u2019s 4nm process. It is said to come with a prime Cortex-X4 core clocked at 3.21GHz, three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01GHz, two more Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 2.8GHz, and two more Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 2.02GHz.\n\nThe processor is said to come with the Adreno 825 GPU, which is said to be similar to the Adreno 830 found in the Snapdragon 8 Elite but with a reduced core size.\n\nDigital Chat Station also mentions that the ISP is also the same as the Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nNew phones with this chip are expected to be released in early April, so we\u2019ll hear more about this SoC soon.\n\nWhy is this not the Snapdragon 8s Elite? The leaker mentions in a comment that because this SM8735 SoC doesn\u2019t use Qualcomm\u2019s self-developed Oryon CPU architecture, it is not being named an \u201cElite\u201d SoC.\n\nThis makes sense, but it also complicates Qualcomm\u2019s lineup with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 when there isn\u2019t a corresponding 8 Gen 4 (presumed to be what the 8 Elite would be called before it was rebranded). It also raises questions about what next year\u2019s SoCs will be called.\n\nQualcomm is no stranger to a messy naming convention, and the situation doesn\u2019t seem likely to improve anytime soon.\n\nGot a tip?

It was believed that this chipset would be called the Snapdragon 8s Elite, but the latest rumors suggest that it may be called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.\n\nWhat's in a name, though? The more interesting aspect is where Qualcomm will get the chip made. Samsung might have been in with a chance since its 4nm process is tried and tested, but that doesn't appear to be the case, as Qualcomm seems to be going with TSMC once again.\n\nTSMC may be the sole supplier of this 4nm chip to Qualcomm\n\nThe Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is rumored to feature a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 prime core alongside three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 performance cores, two 2.8GHz Cortex-A720 and two additional 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores. You'll notice that this chip uses off-the-shelf cores instead of Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores.\n\nQualcomm has reportedly chosen TSMC to manufacture this chip on the 4nm process. One has to wonder if the loss of confidence inspired by Samsung's beleaguered 3nm process is so significant that it has prevented Qualcomm from trusting Samsung's tried and tested 4nm process for this new chip?\n\nSamsung started mass producing chips on its first-generation 4nm process, SF4E, back in 2021. It made the Exynos 2200 on it, a Google Tensor chip, and other semiconductors. Qualcomm has used it as well for the production of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 as well as 5G modems.\n\nThe Korean giant has continued to upgrade its 4nm process over the years to maintain technical parity with TSMC. 2023's upgrade had brought Samsung's 4nm yield on par with its Taiwanese rival. Earlier this month, Samsung also began mass production of its fourth-generation 4nm chips that supports latest 2.5D and 3D packaging technologies.",

(OTCQB:PRKR) (\"ParkerVision\"), a developer and marketer of technologies and products for wireless applications, today announced results for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nYear End 2024 Summary and Recent Developments\n\nThe U.S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"CAFC\") overturned the federal district court's 2022 summary judgement ruling that dismissed the case prior to a jury trial in its patent infringement action against Qualcomm and ended the case. The CAFC's decision remanded the case back to be reopened in the district court in the Middle District of Florida (Orlando division) for trial. A trial date has not yet been set by the district court. The court has indicated it will set a date for trial following its ruling on remaining outstanding motions, including Qualcomm's motion for a third claim construction hearing, the Company's motion to substitute its technical expert due to serious medical issues, and Daubert motions regarding damages, among others.\n\nThe Company currently has active patent infringement cases in the Western District of Texas against MediaTek, Realtek, Texas Instruments, and NXP Semiconductors with at least two trials expected to commence in the second half of 2025 and one or more trials expected in the first half of 2026.\n\nThe Company filed a cert petition with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the CAFC's use of Rule 36 orders to uphold decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") regarding invalidation of patent claims. The Supreme Court issued its orders list today, denying the Company's petition.\n\nJeffrey Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The most impactful event of 2024 was the Federal Circuit's agreement with ParkerVision's appeal, reversing the Orlando district court's 2022 rulings that had ended our prospect for a jury trial in our patent infringement case against Qualcomm. This coming May will mark the start of the 12th year since this case was filed as it has faced numerous delays due to, among other things, patent validity challenges, two years of a pandemic, and, ultimately, a trip to the appellate court. We are eager to receive the district court's rulings on the remaining pending motions, after which the court has indicated it will hold a pre-trial conference and establish a trial date.\"\n\nMr. Parker continued, \"We have also made meaningful progress in our patent infringement cases in the Western District of Texas in 2024. We are anticipating at least two jury trials in the Waco court in the second half of this year, with additional trials scheduled in 2026. We are confident that juries will find our story compelling as we explain the benefits our innovations brought to the accused infringing wireless products. In certain cases, we had prior interactions with the defendants that we believe provide a basis for claims of willful infringement.\"\n\nCommenting on the recent Supreme Court decision on the Company's cert petition, Mr. Parker stated, \"We are disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision today, denying our cert petition that raised challenges to the CAFC's use of Rule 36 to affirm PTAB decisions with no written opinion. I am appreciative of the public support received for this petition, including from two former federal circuit judges, as well the number of amicus briefs filed on behalf of this petition by members of the venture capital, startup, intellectual property and national security communities.\"\n\nFinancial Results\n\nNet loss for 2024 was $14.5 million compared to net income of $9.5 million for 2023. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $(0.16) for 2024, compared to basic and diluted income per common share of $0.11 and $0.08 , respectively, in 2023. The $24 million decrease in earnings from 2023 to 2024 is primarily the result of a $25 million decrease in licensing revenue and a $9.5 million non-cash increase in loss from the change in fair value of contingent payment obligations, offset by a $10.5 million decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in revenue and related decrease in operating expenses from 2023 to 2024 is primarily the result of a $25 million license and settlement agreement reached in 2023, as a result of the Company's patent infringement litigation, and corresponding contingent expenses payable to legal counsel recognized in operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $9.6 million and $0.1 million , respectively, on the net increase in fair value of its contingent payment obligations. This increase in fair value is the result of changes in significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amounts and timing of projected future proceeds that will be used to repay the contingent obligations. The significant estimates and assumptions in 2024 were impacted, in particular, by the CAFC decision received in September 2024 that remanded the Qualcomm case back to district court.\n\nOur long-term liabilities increased by approximately $8.6 million from year-end 2023 to 2024. This increase is the result of a $9.6 million increase in our contingent payment obligations, based on an overall increase in the estimated fair value of those obligations, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding convertible notes as a result of conversions by the holders into shares of common stock during 2024.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents following a December 2024 equity financing\n\nAbout ParkerVision\n\nParkerVision, Inc. invents, develops and licenses cutting-edge, proprietary radio-frequency (RF) technologies that enable wireless solution providers to make and sell advanced wireless communication products.

In addition to continuing to improve the common \"uvcvideo\" web camera driver and other routine refinements, there is also some new media hardware support slated to be included as part of the Linux 6.15 kernel.Mauro Carvalho Chehab sent out the media subsystem updates already. Barring any issues being raised by Linus Torvalds, the media pull has some new hardware support, including new camera sensor patches and seemingly never-ending work on the uvcvideo web camera driver.Among the new support for Linux 6.15 on the media side is adding the Aver Media H789-C PCI Express tuner card. Analog video inputs using the H789-C should now be working.\n\n\"Introduce support for Qualcomm new video acceleration hardware i.e. iris, used for video stream decoding.\n\n\n\nIris is a multi pipe based hardware that offloads video stream decoding from the application processor (AP). It supports H.264 decoding. The AP communicates with hardware through a well defined protocol, called as host firmware interface (HFI), which provides fine-grained and asynchronous control over individual hardware features.\n\n\n\nThe existing venus driver supports only hfi gen1 to communicate with the firmware while this iris driver supports both hfi gen1 and hfi gen2. The support of hfi gen1 is added to the iris driver with the intention that it can support old gen1 interface based firmware, while enabling gen2 based future SOCs. With this, the plan is to migrate older SOCs from venus to iris. As of now, since the iris driver supports only entry level features and doesn't have feature parity with the venus driver, it is enabled for SM8250 only when venus driver is disabled. When the feature parity is achieved, the plan is to enable the iris driver unconditionally for SM8250, and then gradually start removing platforms from venus driver.\n\nHardware supported by only venus - 8916, 8996, SDM660, SDM845, SC7180, SC7280\n\nHardware supported by only iris - SM8550\n\nHardware supported by both venus and iris - SM8250\n\n\n\nThis driver comes with below capabilities:\n\n- V4L2 compliant video driver with M2M and STREAMING capability.\n\n- Supports H264 decoder.\"\n\nSome additions to the cx23885 media driver were needed to get analog tuning working on the AVerMedia H789-C card along with both composite and S-Video inputs and stereo audio inputs.The media subsystem updates also include support for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX controller for receiving HDMI input. The Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX is used by the Rockchip RK3588 SoC and other hardware. With the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI RX there is support for HDMI 1.4b and HDMI 2.0 input up to 4K@60, HDMI CEC support, a variety of pixel formats, and more.This pull request also adds support for the Qualcomm SDM670 camera subsystem that is used by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670.Also quite significant with this media pull request is introducing the Qualcomm Iris video decoder driver. This Iris video decode driver supports the Qualcomm video acceleration hardware to offload from the application processor. Initially supported is H.264 decoding. This Qualcomm Iris driver will eventually replace the Venus hardware. The PR explains around this Iris video decode driver:It's quite an exciting media pull request for the Linux 6.15 kernel with these new hardware support additions.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other most undervalued dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStock prices took a steep hit in March as investors grew concerned about a possible economic downturn, driven by unpredictable tariff policies and signs of slowing job growth. The broader market has dropped over 7% from its peak on February 19, putting stocks on the doorstep of a correction.\n\nA group of seasoned investors saw last week\u2019s stock market downturn as a buying opportunity. As the market briefly entered correction territory, wiping out approximately $5 trillion from the broader market\u2019s value, corporate insiders began increasing their purchases. According to data from the Washington Service, the insider sentiment index climbed to 0.46 in March, up from 0.31 in January, with almost two weeks still remaining in the month. This puts the metric on track for its highest monthly level since June, bringing it closer to its historical norm.\n\nDave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, made the following comment about the situation:\n\n\u201cIf we see corporate insiders begin to use the opportunity in their stock prices to purchase shares, that shows that they have confidence in the underlying economy and in their underlying businesses. That differs from just the headlines, because the headlines are scary.\u201d\n\nIn its 2025 US Market Outlook, Morningstar indicated that the US stock market was approaching the upper limit of its fair value range, suggesting that investors should moderate their return expectations for the year. It was noted that, since the end of 2010, the market had traded at such a premium or higher less than 10% of the time. Given these conditions, the firm had adopted a more cautious stance, emphasizing the increasing importance of portfolio positioning.\n\nMorningstar advised investors to overweight value stocks and underweight growth stocks, citing that growth stocks were trading at their highest premium relative to fair value since the tech-driven bubble in early 2021, whereas value stocks remained undervalued. As of March 3, 2025, the Morningstar Value Index had gained 5.54% year to date, while the Morningstar Growth Index had declined 3.81%.\n\nIn addition, investors are shifting capital into value funds, which are perceived as more resilient during market downturns compared to growth stocks. Data from Lipper shows that U.S. growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $3.6 billion in outflows this month, while U.S. value ETFs attracted $1.8 billion in inflows. Value funds, which are largely composed of stocks from sectors like banking, energy, and utilities, provide a cushion against market volatility by focusing on stable, cash-rich, and undervalued companies that tend to be less sensitive to economic swings.",

            "content": "Amazon has tagged Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 as a \"frequently returned\" item, indicating that Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite platform is losing popularity.\n\nQualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite Platform Doesn't Offer Competitive Perf/$ Value; Consumers Are Likely Losing Interest\n\nWell, this is a surprise, but it seems like customers aren't happy with their Surface Laptop 7. As spotted by Windows Central, Amazon has categorized the laptop as a returning item. Interestingly, this isn't due to any bug or performance issue; rather, it indicates consumer sentiment. Amazon has not mentioned any particular reason for flagging the product, but we do expect it to be something related to the onboard Snapdragon X Elite platform, and we'll discuss why ahead.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 features the high-end Snapdragon X Elite (12-core) model and does a decent job in terms of performance. However, one of the main reasons Qualcomm's platform is not the optimal option is that it lacks support for applications important for a particular consumer segment and doesn't offer any leverage from existing competitors, such as Intel's Lunar Lake. With return rates increasing, it indicates that consumers are experiencing such problems.\n\nIn addition, existing Qualcomm machines are priced in a way that makes other offers way too attractive. For example, Apple's ARM-based MacBooks offer way more in terms of battery life and OS experience compared to Qualcomm laptops, and they also have a better value-to-money ratio. Intel's co-CEO reported on Qualcomm's laptop return rates a few months ago, claiming that consumer sentiment isn't positive towards the release, which has now been reflected in the Surface Laptop 7 listing.\n\nThe Amazon listing itself has an overall 4.2 rating, with over 364 ratings, so it is likely that the return rates aren't too high, but this is indeed something to notice. For consumers looking for a laptop sub-$1500 budget, the Snapdragon X Elite platform would likely be their least priority. Qualcomm needs to sort this out by entertaining the entry-level consumer or offering better perf/$ value on its upcoming machines.",

            "content": "Amazon has flagged Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 as a \"frequently returned item,\" cautioning potential buyers to check customer reviews before purchasing, Windows Central reports. The label suggests that the device has a higher return rate than similar products, though Amazon does not specify the reasons behind it.\n\nOne likely factor is the laptop\u2019s use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X platform, which relies on Arm-based architecture instead of the traditional x86 processors from Intel and AMD. While Arm chips offer better power efficiency and battery life, they can introduce software compatibility issues.\n\nMany Windows applications are still optimized for x86 processors, meaning they must rely on software emulation to run on Arm. Although Microsoft has improved emulation with Windows on Arm, specific older applications, professional software, and games may still suffer from reduced performance or fail to run altogether. This limitation has been a common criticism of Windows devices powered by Arm chips.\n\nThe situation for gaming is also not ideal. Many games refuse to even run on Windows on Arm platforms, and those that do often offer lower performance than competing x86 platforms. Also, it bears mentioning that Snapdragon's primary selling point was originally centered around far superior battery life over x86 alternatives.\n\nNewer x86 laptops from Intel, like Lunar Lake, have dramatically improved battery life compared to prior-gen models, reducing or eliminating Snapdragon's battery life advantage while preserving full compatibility with Windows software.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 has a 4.2-star rating on Amazon from over 360 reviews, but 12% of those reviews are one-star. While some users report a positive experience, complaints about software compatibility, performance inconsistencies, and general usability appear to be recurring issues. These concerns may explain why the device has received the \"frequently returned\" warning, as buyers who expect a seamless Windows experience may be disappointed.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to address some of these concerns by offering Intel-powered versions of the Surface Laptop. Earlier this year, the company introduced the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro for business customers, powered by Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) processors. Similar options will likely be made available for consumer models, though no official timeline has been announced. Switching to Intel chips would remove software compatibility challenges while providing solid battery life and performance.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

SK\n\n\uc0ac\uc9c4 \ud655\ub300 Chairman Chey Tae-won\n\nSK Group is growing its future growth industry in response to the rapidly changing business environment.SK Networks is a holding company focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and will strengthen its AI business in partnership with Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SK Networks has recently decided to collaborate with Qualcomm to expand its AI-based business portfolio that incorporates Qualcomm's Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Accordingly, a new business model centered on on-device AI will be established in various areas.Qualcomm is planning to provide SK Networks with IoT solutions such as Qualcomm Dragon Wing QCS6490 that supports On-device LLM (On-device LLM). Qualcomm Dragonwing QCS6490 is a high-performance SOC solution for industrial and commercial IoT. It is characterized by being optimized for various IoT applications such as robots, drones, gateways, tablets, and kiosks. Through this, it is expected to create synergy effects tailored to the characteristics of SK Networks, which is incorporating AI-linked business models by developing businesses in various areas.SK Networks is planning to review the possibility of using Qualcomm technology by its headquarters and subsidiaries and secure world-class AI performance and security by utilizing excellent IoT solutions. In addition, it plans to continue to evolve with capabilities secured based on Hicosystem, a network of experts in the global technology and investment industry.Choi Sung-hwan, president of SK Networks' business division, said, \"By partnering with Qualcomm with global technology expertise, we can add depth and evolution as an AI company,\" adding, \"We will try to provide new experiences to customers and enrich humanity's tomorrow by incorporating AI into SK Networks' products and services.\"\"Qualcomm continues to expand its portfolio of industrial and commercial IoT products and solutions and is receiving positive responses in various industries such as robotics, manufacturing, logistics, and retail,\" said Kwon Oh-hyung, general president and senior vice president of Qualcomm's Asia-Pacific region. \"Starting with collaboration with SK Networks, we will further expand our business portfolio that supports the advantages of On-Device AI.\"SK Energy signed a contract with Cathay Pacific Airlines in early March to supply more than 20,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2027. Earlier, Cathay Pacific Airlines began putting SAF supplied by SK Energy in all aircraft departing from Incheon International Airport in November last year. The two companies plan to continue to expand the SAF route in the future.As a result, SK Energy signed a stable SAF supply contract with Hong Kong's largest civil airline more than two months after exporting SAF to Europe in January. The Asia-Pacific region is the largest base market, accounting for more than 80% of domestic oil refinery exports.In particular, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok International Airport is a hub airport in the Asia-Pacific region that ranked fifth worldwide in the number of travelers last year. With this supply contract as an opportunity, SK Energy plans to speed up its efforts to tap the SAF market in the Asia-Pacific region.SK Energy started commercial production of SAF in September last year with a mass production system for low-carbon products with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons. Coprocessing is a process of producing low-carbon products such as SAF and Bionaphtha by connecting separate biomaterial supply pipes to the existing petroleum production process line. Global SAF demand has continued to grow since 2021 when the International Air Transport Association (IATA) passed a resolution to reduce the aviation industry's CO2 emissions by 50% compared to 2005 by 2050.[JUNG SEUNG HWAN, business reporter]",

The S&P 500 futures have dropped 15 points, the Nasdaq 100 futures are down 73 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 140 points lower.\n\nThe decline in futures is tied to reactions from recent earnings reports. FedEx (FDX, Financial), NIKE (NKE, Financial), Micron (MU, Financial), and Lennar (LEN, Financial) have all reported results that contributed to the negative sentiment in early trading.\n\nTreasury yields have decreased, continuing a rally seen this week. The 10-year yield has dropped by two basis points from yesterday and ten basis points this week, sitting at 4.21%.\n\nThere are no major economic reports scheduled for release today.\n\nToday's News\n\nThis week saw notable dividend increases from major companies. Qualcomm (QCOM, Financial) announced a 4.7% increase in its dividend, raising it to $0.89 per share. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Financial) declared a new dividend amount of $1.40, marking a modest increase of 0.2%. Williams-Sonoma (WSM, Financial) also joined the ranks with a significant 15.8% hike in its dividend. These moves highlight a trend among companies to return more capital to shareholders amid ongoing market uncertainties.\n\nIn the tech sector, Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) is expanding its quantum computing capabilities with a new research lab in Boston. The Nvidia Accelerated Quantum Research Center will integrate quantum hardware with AI supercomputers, aiming to advance hybrid quantum-classical computing. This initiative underscores Nvidia's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation.\n\nNike (NKE, Financial) faced challenges as its stock traded lower following warnings of inventory issues and global economic headwinds impacting the upcoming quarter. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Nike's long-term prospects, but acknowledge the road to recovery could be turbulent, with significant pressure expected on revenue and margins in the near term.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI, Financial) saw a positive shift as J.P. Morgan upgraded its stock, citing the resolution of financial filing uncertainties and strong demand for its AI server shipments. This upgrade reflects confidence in Super Micro's growth trajectory despite potential margin pressures in a competitive landscape.\n\nFedEx (FDX, Financial) shares took a hit after the company revised its fiscal year outlook downwards, citing ongoing weaknesses in the U.S. industrial economy. The company now anticipates flat to slightly declining revenue, with adjusted EPS projections also lowered, reflecting the challenging economic environment.\n\nAccenture (ACN, Financial) experienced stock pressure after CEO Julie Sweet highlighted potential revenue impacts from the Trump Administration's spending cuts. Analysts have adjusted their price targets, noting increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment affecting IT services.\n\nIn the defense sector, the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program contract is anticipated to be awarded soon, with Lockheed Martin (LMT, Financial) and Boeing (BA, Financial) as key contenders. This contract, potentially worth $20 billion initially, could provide significant opportunities for the winning company as the program progresses.\n\nDanaher (DHR, Financial) received an upgrade from Goldman Sachs to a Buy rating, with a target price of $260 per share. This upgrade comes as the company's stock has seen a decline, presenting what Goldman Sachs views as an attractive entry point for investors.\n\nLexinFintech (LX, Financial) declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.11 per ADS, maintaining a forward yield of 2.09%. This announcement reflects the company's ongoing commitment to shareholder returns amid evolving market conditions.\n\nGuruFocus Stock Analysis",

At the heart of this revolution lies the System on a Chip (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors.\n\nWhile companies like Apple and Google are known for \"building\" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips and can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nTurning an idea into a blueprint\n\nCredit: Qualcomm\n\nThe journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the chip's architecture. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals.\n\nFor Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy.\n\nThe core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its Tensor chips, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEach company knows what it needs better than anyone else does.\n\nCredit: Apple\n\nOnce done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL are used to \"program\" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all.\n\nOnce someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration.\n\nFrom there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.\n\nCredit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nApple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. TSMC is one of the biggest, but there are others \u2014 including Samsung's own foundry.\n\nThe company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line.\n\nThe process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the \"good\" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.\n\nThe fabless model has plenty of advantages\n\nCredit: Source: Arizona State University\n\nIt's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs.\n\nInstead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier.\n\nExpertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology.",

So says Qualcomm Technologies, in discussion with RCR Wireless at MWC 2025, where it proclaims recent open RAN wins for its Dragonwing cellular infrastructure portfolio with Viettel Group and NTT DOCOMO, the largest 5G operators in Vietnam and Japan, respectively.\n\nIndeed, with the right technology platform, open RAN is ready to outrun traditional RAN in new 5G networks, it says.\n\nThe Viettel project, announced late last year, is a full open RAN massive MIMO deployment, already live in the network. It uses the US firm\u2019s Dragonwing QRU100 platform in the radio units (RUs) and Dragonwing X100 accelerator cards in the virtualized distributed units (DUs); both are geared for open RAN systems, and work in the integrated RU/DU setup to streamline compute-intensive tasks. Qualcomm worked with Viettel Group\u2019s research division, Viettel High Technology Industries (VHT), on the development and integration of the RU and DU solutions.\n\nThe deployments with Viettel will scale to \u201cthousands of sites this year\u201d, says Gerardo Giaretta, vice president of product management at Qualcomm. Meanwhile, the work with NTT DOCOMO uses the Dragonwing X100 accelerator card in a virtualized DU from NEC, and runs on an HPE ProLiant DL110 server. The system will be rolled-out across its network in Japan. The deal, which has followed extensive testing, is a feather in the cap, too, for both his firm and the whole ecosystem, just because NTT DOCOMO is \u201crecognized as a hard network to get into\u201d, remarks Giaretta.\n\nAnd Qualcomm\u2019s confidence is high not only because of the regional heft of these operator brands, but because of their different profiles. Giaretta explains: \u201cWe have two great deployments, last year and this year \u2013 with Viettel in Vietnam and NTT DOCOMO in Japan\u2026 [They are] important because they show open RAN is useful and deployed in competitive markets \u2013 whether they are competitive from a cost perspective like in Vietnam or from a performance perspective like in Japan. It is exciting to move from development to interoperability to commercialization, finally.\u201d\n\nThese deals are harbingers of a strong second-half display, as open RAN makes its way into 5G systems. OREX SAI, a venture between NTT DOCOMO and NEC, has verified the whole open RAN bundle for \u201cglobal deployments\u201d by other operators, observes Giaretta. Hanoi-headquartered Viettel has operations elsewhere variously in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. \u201cSo this is just the start,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is planning to take that platform and deploy [it] elsewhere.\u201d The Viettel model, focused on developing markets, holds real value for open RAN, he says.\n\n\u201cIt is different from going into a developed country where 5G has been deployed for four years, and there are fewer sites available\u2026 [Operators in] these developing countries [are interested] to be at the edge of technology progress \u2013 maybe more than [those in] developed countries. So we see great growth opportunities \u2013 tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of sites in the next couple of years\u2026 We are also working with other operators and other vendors which are not public yet. So this is a turning point [for open RAN] over the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nIt seems like the technological impediments to open RAN are falling away, and that what remains is just a business problem \u2013 is how RCR Wireless puts it to Giaretta on the showfloor at MWC. He responds: \u201cIt is an ecosystem problem more than anything. The open RAN specification is mature enough, with and without massive MIMO. Solutions with our silicon technology\u2026 give a performance that is equivalent if not superior to traditional RAN. So it is just about operators getting used to the process and getting convinced about the new ecosystem and development.\u201d",

It was previously reported that the company's modem is capable but not as much as Qualcomm's. However, it does have an edge when it comes to power efficiency, which gives the iPhone 16e a battery boost. It is now being reported that Apple's C1 modem has outperformed Qualcomm modems in several benchmarks.\n\nApple's C1 modem inside the iPhone 16e outperforms the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16\n\nAs mentioned, Apple has spent years perfecting its modem, and while it is only the beginning, the company will introduce major performance gains in future iterations of the chip. A new study reveals that Apple's C1 modem beats Qualcomm in most benchmarks. The study compares the C1 modem in the iPhone 16e to Qualcomm-made modems in the iPhone 16, and the results are quite surprising.\n\nOokla tracked the performance of the three best carriers in the United States with three different tiers, which include low, medium, and high-performance experience. The stats show how the iPhone 16e's C1 modem performed against the iPhone 16 with a Qualcomm modem. It can be seen that the C1 modem performs better in the 10th percentile when the download speeds are lower than the Qualcomm modem's. In the medium tier, the performance of both chips is neck and neck, but Apple takes the lead. In the 90th percentile or the third tier, the iPhone 16 beats the C1 chip by quite a margin. The iPhone 16 with a Qualcomm modem had better download speeds across AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.\n\nWhile the results are surprising at first glance, given that the C1 modem is Apple's entry into the modem business, Ookla says that the numbers should not matter to users.\n\nPerformance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of the overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.\n\nThe new iPhone 16e performed better on AT&T and Verizon, while the iPhone 16 took the lead with T-Mobile. In terms of upload speeds, the iPhone 16e performed better across all major carriers, especially AT&T and Verizon, with almost double the upload speed compared to the iPhone 16. We will share more tests related to the performance of the C1 modem, so be sure to stick around.",

With a more tailored driver, you're getting better performance.\n\nThere is one caveat, though. Not all Snapdragon X series chips and PCs are always compatible with the latest drivers.\n\nFor example, at the time of writing, the current release isn't compatible with the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x. So always check the release notes first.\n\nHow to download and install the Qualcomm beta graphics driver\n\nHaving the beta drivers unlocks significant performance gains. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe graphics driver from Qualcomm is currently a beta product, as such there are some small hoops to jump through.\n\nThe first is that you have to sign up to use Qualcomm Software Center, which takes nothing more than an email address and a password.\n\nOnce you're registered, hit this link to get to the latest version of the Windows Graphics Driver. Check the release notes first, to ensure there are no deal breaking issues or compatibility woes. Remember, as good as this driver is, it's still a beta product.\n\nOnce you're happy, download the file. It'll come as a zip archive, so you'll need to extract it to run the installer.\n\nInstalling is straightforward once you've gone through the process of registering and downloading. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nRunning the installer is the final step, just as with any Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA graphics driver. It'll be installed on your system, recognize the hardware, and then start to do its magic.\n\nRegular graphics driver updates are something Qualcomm will have to start ramping up as it continues to compete against the long-standing trio. Eventually you'd assume it won't be a beta, but for now, if you're serious about graphics on your Snapdragon X PC, follow these steps and reap the rewards.",

But before the iPhone 16e\u2019s launch, expectations were that Apple\u2019s C1 would trail Qualcomm\u2019s own 5G modem\u2014at least in this first version. A just-published study of real-world findings, however, tells a different story.\n\nStudy shows Apple\u2019s C1 beats Qualcomm in key areas\n\nToday Ookla published a study of real-world data comparing Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e with C1 against the standard iPhone 16 with Qualcomm\u2019s modem.\n\nThe findings were surprising.\n\nOokla tracked performance on the top three US carriers across three different tiers:\n\n10th percentile (lowest performance experience)\n\nMedian performance\n\n90th percentile (highest performance experience)\n\nThe full data offers a nuanced picture of how each device fares against the other, but there were a number of key takeaways.\n\nFirst, iPhone 16e with C1 was the clear winner in the 10th percentile.\n\nThis means that when analyzing those situations when connectivity is a struggle, and download speeds suffer, the C1 offered a better experience than Qualcomm\u2019s modem.\n\nSecond, the opposite proved true in the 90th percentile. iPhone 16 with Qualcomm had better top download speeds across AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon.\n\nHowever, Ookla says this is unlikely to matter as much to users:\n\nPerformance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.\n\nWhat about median performance?\n\nThough close, overall the edge goes to the iPhone 16e, as it offered faster median speeds across both AT&T and Verizon.\n\nHowever, T-Mobile users got faster median speeds with Qualcomm than Apple\u2019s C1.\n\nLastly, upload speeds were consistently faster for iPhone 16e\u2014across all major carriers. With AT&T and Verizon the C1 offered in the ballpark of double the upload speeds of Qualcomm. On T-Mobile the C1 still had an edge, but just barely.\n\n9to5Mac\u2019s Take\n\nApple is in an interesting position with its C1 modem. On one hand, the company deserves to celebrate its achievement in creating a 5G modem that can go toe-to-toe with the market leader\u2014and per this new data, even surpass it.\n\nBut the company is also still shipping Qualcomm modems in all of its flagship, more premium iPhones. So it probably wouldn\u2019t go over too well if Apple started a big campaign about C1\u2019s strengths.\n\nStill, these findings make me very excited for the future of Apple\u2019s modem efforts.\n\nWhat are your takeaways from seeing this comparison of Apple\u2019s C1 to Qualcomm?

            "content": "\n\nThe 16e is the first iPhone to feature the Apple-designed C1 modem.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nAT&T and Verizon Speedtest\u00ae users experienced better median download speeds on the iPhone 16e than iPhone 16. However, the opposite was true for T-Mobile users.\n\nVerizon Speedtest users with the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 experienced median download speeds that lagged behind that of both AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\n\n\niPhone 16e Speedtest users on Verizon\u2019s network and AT&T\u2019s network saw higher upload speed performance than those using the iPhone 16. However, T-Mobile users experienced the opposite and had slightly higher upload speeds on the iPhone 16 compared to the iPhone 16e.\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhone 16e made its commercial debut in late February with much fanfare because it\u2019s the first device to include the Apple-designed C1 modem. Historically, Apple relied upon Qualcomm to provide most of its iPhone modems so its decision to use the C1 modem in the iPhone 16e is considered a significant move.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s early in the adoption curve for the iPhone 16e, we analyzed the performance of the new device from March 1st through March 12th, and compared it to the performance of iPhone 16, which has a similar design and the same 6.1\u201d screen. Both devices run on the same Apple-designed A18 SoC. However, it\u2019s important to note that unlike the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e does not support mmWave spectrum. This is the first iPhone available in the U.S. without mmWave support but we expect future iterations of the C1 modem will include it.\n\niPhone 16 offers higher top-end performance than the iPhone 16e\n\niPhone 16e Offers Better Worst-Case Speeds, but iPhone 16 Has a Higher Top-End Performance\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nWhen we compare Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data from the top 90th percentile (those with the highest performance experience) of iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 users from all three of the top U.S. operators, we see the iPhone 16 performing better in download speeds. However, at the opposite end, with the 10th percentile of users (those who experience the lowest performance) we see the iPhone 16e performing better than the iPhone 16.\n\niPhone 16e outperforms on download speeds for AT&T and Verizon, but not T-Mobile\n\nSpeedtest data shows the iPhone16e recorded faster median download speeds than the iPhone 16 on both AT&T and Verizon\u2019s networks, but was markedly slower on T-Mobile\u2019s network.\n\niPhone 16e users on T-Mobile\u2019s network experienced median download speeds of 264.71 Mbps, which is at least 47% faster than iPhone 16e users on Verizon\u2019s network that experienced median download speeds of 140.77 Mbps. The download speed performance for iPhone 16e users on AT&T\u2019s network was 226.90 Mbps, closer to that of T-Mobile users.\n\nHowever, when comparing median download speeds for T-Mobile users with the iPhone 16e (264.71 Mbps) to T-Mobile users with the iPhone 16 device (357.47 Mbps), the iPhone 16 outperformed the iPhone 16e by at least 24%.\n\nThe iPhone 16e\u2019s underperformance in median download speed compared to the iPhone 16 on T-Mobile\u2019s network is most likely due to the fact that T-Mobile is the only US carrier to have a nationwide commercialized 5G standalone network (SA) and one of the few operators globally to deploy significant spectrum depth and advanced features like carrier aggregation (CA) on the new 5G architecture.\n\nThe C1 modem\u2019s more limited capabilities on 5G SA networks compared to the Qualcomm modem in the iPhone 16 may be a key factor contributing to the larger performance gap between device models observed on T-Mobile\u2019s network in early testing.\n\nVerizon\u2019s download performance lags on both devices\n\nWhile much has been made of the lack of mmWave support on the iPhone 16e, which will have some impact on performance, particularly for users that are in range of these higher bands, both Verizon Speedtest users with the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 experienced median download speeds that lagged behind that of both AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\niPhone 16e Outperforms iPhone 16 on AT&T & Verizon Despite Lacking mmWave, but Trails on T-Mobile's 5G SA\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\niPhone 16e beats the 16 among those in the 10th percentile\n\nWhen we examine Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data for the bottom 10th percentile (those with the lowest overall download speeds) of iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 users, we see that iPhone 16e users experienced better download speeds compared to iPhone 16 users across all three mobile providers.\n\nFor example, T-Mobile iPhone 16e users in the bottom 10th percentile are experiencing speeds of 57.34 Mbps compared to T-Mobile iPhone 16 users that are experiencing speeds of just 27.27 Mbps.\n\nThe Worst Outcomes on iPhone 16e Are Significantly Better Than on iPhone 16\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nAt the other end of the scale at the 90th percentile (those with the fastest overall download speeds), we saw the reverse with the iPhone 16 outpacing the iPhone 16e for each mobile provider. For example, T-Mobile iPhone 16 users in the 90th percentile experienced blazing fast median download speeds of 889.83 Mbps compared to T-Mobile iPhone 16e users that are experiencing median download speeds of 627.01 Mbps.\n\niPhone 16 Outperforms iPhone 16e in Peak Performance Scenarios\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nPerformance at the lowest 10th percentile often provides a more accurate reflection of overall quality of experience (QoE) than the fastest 90th percentile, which can be skewed by deployments in mmWave-covered locations and is subject to declining marginal returns.\n\niPhone 16e is higher in upload speeds\n\nInterestingly, in upload speeds, we saw iPhone 16e users on Verizon and AT&T experiencing higher upload speed performance than those using the iPhone 16. T-Mobile users, however, experienced just slightly higher upload speeds on the iPhone 16e compared to the iPhone 16. The gap was the biggest with AT&T iPhone 16e customers, who experienced median upload speeds of 14.63 Mbps, which is at least a 38% increase over AT&T iPhone 16 users who experienced median upload speeds of 8.60 Mbps.\n\niPhone 16e Leads iPhone 16 on Upload Speed across AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon\n\nSpeedtest Intelligence\u00ae | 1-12 March, 2025\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s departure from Qualcomm\n\nApple has historically sourced its iPhone modems from Qualcomm but in 2019 the company purchased Intel\u2019s modem business with the goal of designing its own in-house modems.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16e with the C1 modem supports all the low and mid-band 5G spectrum but, as mentioned above, it doesn\u2019t support mmWave spectrum. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 with 2\u00d72 MIMO and Bluetooth 5.3, but lacks Wi-Fi 7 support unlike the rest of the iPhone 16 series of devices.\n\nApple claims that the C1 is more power-efficient than any modem ever used in an iPhone and said that the 16e has a new internal design, which allows it to give the device a bigger battery. In its 16e specifications Apple claims that the 16e has a battery life of up to 26 hours with video playback and up to 21 hours with streaming video playback. This compares to the Apple 16 which Apple claims has a battery life of up to 22 hours with video playback and up to 18 hours with streaming video playback.\n\nSome of the performance differences that Speedtest data picked up between the iPhone 16e and the iPhone 16 may also be attributed to the fact that the C1 modem doesn\u2019t have all the same capabilities that are featured in Qualcomm\u2019s modems.\n\nAccording to a Qualcomm comparison of the C1 and its mid-tier and premium modems, Qualcomm\u2019s mid-tier modems support 4CA downlink carrier aggregation and its top of the line x80 and x85 modems support 6CA downlink carrier aggregation compared to the C1 which supports just 3x downlink carrier aggregation. Qualcomm\u2019s mid-tier, x80 and x85 modems also support uplink carrier aggregation and uplink MIMO and the Apple C1 does not.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the performance of the iPhone 16e as adoption of the device increases around the world and we plan to publish a more comprehensive comparison across the entire iPhone 16 portfolio of devices. While we have not analyzed the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s performance here because it is in the premium device category, we do see it leading over the iPhone 16e in most performance metrics.\n\nOokla analysts Mark Giles, Luke Kehoe and Kerry Baker contributed to this piece.\n\nTo find out more about Speedtest Intelligence\u00ae data and insights, please contact us here.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Inc. QCOM has launched three new Snapdragon G-series platforms designed to elevate handheld gaming experiences across various platforms.\n\nWhat Happened: At the Game Developers Conference on Monday, Qualcomm unveiled these chipsets for handheld gaming devices and consoles. These latest additions to Qualcomm\u2019s gaming processor lineup provide gamers with a broader selection of options across various platforms, including cloud, console, Android, and PC, according to a report by Wccftech.\n\nThe Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, the most potent G-series chipset from Qualcomm to date, is specifically engineered for Android-powered handheld gaming devices.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s chipset boosts CPU performance by 30% and graphics power by 28% while supporting Wi-Fi 7 for lower latency and better connectivity.\n\nThe Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 chipset, optimized for cloud gaming, offers substantial performance enhancements. Qualcomm claims its new version offers 2.3x faster CPU and 3.8x faster GPU performance, along with Wi-Fi 7 support for smoother gaming up to 144FPS.\n\nThe Snapdragon G1 Gen 2, designed for handheld cloud gaming on Android, supports 1080p at 120FPS.

It promises \"high-fidelity graphics\" with \"incredible ergonomics\" for those wanting their mobile games at their best.\n\nAs the naming conventions may elude to, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 is said to be the most powerful of the lineup, made for the \"most demanding cross-platform gaming titles\" whereas the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 is instead primarily marketed for \"cloud games across major ecosystems\".\n\nThis is backed up by the technical specifications of the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, which feature an eight-core Qualcomm Kyro CPU, Adreno A32 graphics (including ray tracing functionality), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, and support for 1440p at 144Hz.\n\nThe Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 is similarly powerful, with the same eight-core Qualcomm Kyro CPU, but it features Adreno 22 graphics instead, with the same connectivity standards and output options.\n\nThings only get more mainstream when analyzing what the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 can do. Despite having the same eight-core processor as the others, six of its total cores are efficiency, with only two dedicated to performance.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

It's safe to say this could be the chip found in cloud gaming devices that do not require the same level of horsepower.\n\nSome of its partners running the new chips include AyaNeo, OneXSugar, and Retroid Pocket, among others, as the hardware is primarily geared towards Android and cloud gaming performance rather than native rendering. However, given the prowess of the leading chip, that could change depending on who adopts the silicon.\n\nA step forward for mobile gaming hardware\n\nQualcomm has had great success over the past year since its Snapdragon X Elite line, powering some of the best laptops and best ultrabooks, famed for their snappy performance and long battery lives when compared to traditional x86 alternatives. The company now seems in a position to take on some of the biggest processors from rivals, such as AMD's Z1 and Z2 chips that you'll find in some of the best gaming handhelds.\n\nWe may not see a similar level of compatibility and performance with Windows or SteamOS machines, but for what they are, the Snapdragon G Series could still be a viable alternative. Some handhelds hitting the market have already impressed featuring the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 chip, like the AyaNeo Pocket S2, which is said to elevate Android gaming without the usual trappings of getting warm (via PCMag).\n\nJust as Windows on Arm has evolved since it launched and was iterated upon as the big x86 alternative, the Snapdragon G Series could be the thing to push more handheld gamers into the arms of dedicated cloud-based and Android machines if the battery lives, displays, and ergonomics can outmatch what current-generation handheld PCs can do.\n\nCompetition is always a good thing as it pushes companies to continue innovating and improving on tech instead of stagnation, something the portable scene has been in danger of for years now. Will the Snapdragon G Series be enough to frighten AMD and Intel? It's not clear yet, but we've seen Qualcomm muscle in on their territory with its laptops, so why couldn't handhelds be next?",

Earnings Growth 5.01% See Full Analysis\n\nShares of Qualcomm Inc. NASDAQ: QCOM have been stuck in a frustrating trading range for months despite the chipmaker consistently delivering strong financial results. The stock is down 10 percent since the last week of February and has been testing the lower end of its range from December. While part of this decline is due to the broader market selloff and the cooling investor sentiment around tech stocks, Qualcomm\u2019s underperformance relative to peers seems increasingly disconnected from its fundamentals.\n\nAt $158, the tech stock is now trading at 2021 levels, despite posting record revenue and one of its most profitable EPS prints in years. This combination of strong financial performance and a beaten-down stock price means that Qualcomm is now sitting at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just 17.\n\nGet QUALCOMM alerts: Sign Up\n\nThat number stands out in the semiconductor space, where peers trade at significantly higher multiples. For example, Micron Technology Inc\u2019s NASDAQ: MU PE sits at 30, NVIDIA Corp\u2019s NASDAQ: NVDA is at 40, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc\u2019s NASDAQ: AMD is a lofty 105. The gap suggests that Qualcomm is severely undervalued, and the market is failing to recognize its position in AI-driven chip solutions, automotive growth, and smartphone stabilization.\n\nEarnings Show Strength, But Investors Remain Hesitant\n\nQualcomm\u2019s latest earnings report in early February was another clear beat on analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS, yet the stock reaction was muted. Despite the company also reporting strong forward guidance, it seems concerns around smartphone demand softness kept enthusiasm in check.\n\nDespite these concerns, Qualcomm\u2019s broader growth potential continues to be a bright spot. The company is making major strides in AI-capable processors, which are becoming increasingly important across effectively every industry and vertical.\n\nWall Street Sees Major Upside From Here\n\nQUALCOMM Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$205.32\n\n29.99% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 30 Analyst Ratings Current Price $157.95 High Forecast $270.00 Average Forecast $205.32 Low Forecast $160.00 QUALCOMM Stock Forecast Details\n\nWhile the market remains skeptical, analysts have been more optimistic. Following the February earnings report, multiple firms reiterated bullish stances. Piper Sandler, for example, maintained its Overweight rating with a $190 price target, while Benchmark issued a Buy rating with a $240 target.\n\nAt Qualcomm\u2019s current price of $158, Benchmark\u2019s price target represents an upside of more than 50 percent. Even analysts with Neutral ratings, such as Cantor Fitzgerald and Evercore ISI, have price targets above current levels, further reinforcing the argument that Qualcomm may be trading at an unjustified discount.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s ability to continue expanding beyond smartphones is one reason for this confidence. While mobile chips remain a core revenue driver, the company is aggressively pushing into AI-powered computing, automotive processing, and industrial IoT applications, all areas expected to grow in the coming years.\n\nTechnical Setup Suggests a Reversal May Be Underway\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Qualcomm may be at a turning point. The stock\u2019s relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46, signaling slightly oversold conditions, while the MACD is on the verge of a bullish crossover, which often precedes a shift in bullish momentum.\n\nAdditionally, shares have recently bounced off December\u2019s low, indicating that a support level may be forming. The inability of bears to push the stock lower here, despite weak market sentiment, suggests that a near-term bottom could be in place.\n\nIf momentum shifts and the market begins rotating back into high-quality tech names, Qualcomm could be one of the first to benefit, given its strong valuation case and recent analyst support.\n\nQualcomm Going Foward\n\nQualcomm\u2019s record-breaking earnings, low valuation, and strong analyst price targets all point to significant upside potential. The company is currently trading at a valuation discount compared to its peers, and even analysts with more cautious outlooks have price targets that suggest the stock is too cheap at current levels.\n\nFor long-term investors, this may be one of the best entry points in months. If the broader market stabilizes and Qualcomm continues its expansion into AI-driven computing, a move back toward $190 or beyond could happen sooner than expected.\n\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and QUALCOMM wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile QUALCOMM currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom Inc. AVGO, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Broadcom, JPMorgan and Qualcomm\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\n\n\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens and attempts to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) as witnessed in first-quarter fiscal 2025. Strong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth.\n\n\n\nBroadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom\u2019s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\n\n\nBroadcom\u2019s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. However, gross margin in fiscal second quarter is expected to contract sequentially on unfavorable revenue and product mix. High debt level is a headwind.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have gained +23.5% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry\u2019s gain of +25.4%. The company\u2019s Strategic buyouts, branch openings and decent loan demand will aid the company. With interest rates likely to remain high for longer, its net interest income (NII) will get support.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3.4% by 2027. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. Our estimate for non-interest income indicates an 11.6% fall in 2025. As it invests heavily in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated.\n\n\n\nOur estimates for non-interest expenses reflect a CAGR of 2.5% by 2025. Weak asset quality is worrisome. However, a resurgence in deal-making activities and a solid pipeline will drive the investment banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% by 2027.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\n\n\n\nQualcomm's have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (-4.4% vs. +17%). The company is also facing challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip. Moreover, the majority of its customers include Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential owing to strained bilateral trade relationships with the United States.\n\n\n\nAlso, Apple\u2019s move towards designing its chip in-house will likely have a negative impact on Qualcomm\u2019s profit. Nevertheless, Qualcomm is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge.\n\n\n\nWith the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The acquisition of Veoneer, Inc. has significantly strengthened QCOM\u2019s position in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Qualcomm here >>>)",

Qualcomm has announced three new chips designed for handheld gaming consoles at the 2025 Game Developers Conference. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 leads the lineup with ray tracing and Wi-Fi 7, while the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 SoCs target the cloud gaming market.\n\nThe Snapdragon G-series lineup is led by the G3 Gen 3 SoC, an upgrade from the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. It is built specifically for Android-based handheld gaming devices and supports Unreal Engine 5's Lumen lighting system. It also offers real-time, hardware-accelerated ray tracing with global illumination and reflections. The G3 Gen 3 chip supports up to QHD+ resolution and 144Hz refresh rates.\n\nSnapdragon G3 Gen 3 includes an 8-core Kryo CPU consisting of 1 prime core, 5 performance cores, and 2 efficiency cores. Graphics processing is handled by an Adreno A32 GPU. Qualcomm claims that the chip delivers a 30% faster CPU and 28% improved graphics performance compared to its predecessor. Connectivity is powered by the FastConnect 7800 module, featuring Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 7 for reduced latency and enhanced bandwidth.\n\nThe Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 is the second chip in the lineup, serving as an upgrade to the Snapdragon G2 Gen 1. Designed primarily for cloud gaming, it supports display resolutions up to QHD+ and 144Hz refresh rates, matching its higher-end sibling.\n\nThe Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 features an 8-core Kryo CPU with 1 prime core, 4 performance cores, and 3 efficiency cores, along with an Adreno A22 GPU. Like the flagship model, it includes the FastConnect 7800 module with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. Qualcomm states that the new chip offers 2.3 times faster CPU performance and 3.8 times faster GPU performance compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe entry-level option, Snapdragon G1 Gen 2, targets handheld cloud gaming on Android devices. It includes an 8-core Kryo CPU with 2 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores, coupled with an Adreno A12 GPU. Qualcomm says the G1 Gen 2 offers 80% faster CPU performance and 25% better GPU performance compared to the previous generation.\n\nUnlike the G3 and G2 models, the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 uses the FastConnect 6700 connectivity module with Wi-Fi 6/6E and Bluetooth 5. On the display side, it supports up to FHD+ resolution with a 144Hz refresh rate.\n\nDevices featuring these new Snapdragon gaming chips are expected to launch later this quarter. Ayaneo, Onexsugar, and Retroid Pocket are among the prominent brands already confirmed to release new handheld gaming consoles powered by Qualcomm's latest chips.",

Though gaming on phones is still popular, the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck proved the capability of high-end devices for playing on the go, paving the way for similar handhelds to grow into a more mainstream niche, from smaller devices like the Analogue Pocket to premium platforms like the Lenovo Legion Go S.\n\nQualcomm's three new chips fit different tiers of gaming devices: the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 for top-end handhelds, the G2 Gen 2 for standard handhelds and the G1 Gen 2 for devices that mostly stream games. Like their predecessors, these chips are built specifically for gaming, and are designed for different workloads than phones, PCs or other categories Qualcomm releases silicon for.\n\n\"The thing that really separates the mobile world from the handheld world is that the handheld is a bespoke gaming device, it's intended to be picked up and played for a long time,\" said Micah Knapp, Snapdragon Gaming Platforms business and product lead. \"We're really designing the whole platform -- the software, the hardware, everything around it -- to be able to get that peak performance but then also sustain it over a long period of time.\"\n\nQualcomm announced three chips at GDC 2025: the G3 Gen 3 meant for top-end devices, the G2 Gen 2 for mid-grade handhelds and the G1 Gen 2 for handhelds that mostly stream games. Qualcomm\n\nAt the top of its new lineup, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 has 30% better CPU and 28% better GPU (Adreno A32) performance compared to its 2023 predecessor, supports up to Quad HD Plus displays with 144Hz refresh rate, and its Qualcomm FastConnect connectivity chip enables Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity.\n\nQualcomm confirmed three devices that will include the G3 Gen 3 chip. The Ayaneo Pocket S2, a sleeker rectangular device with a 6.3-inch display, will be coming in March. The larger Ayaneo Gaming Pad, with large controller-like handgrips and an 8.3-inch 120Hz display, will be available in May. Lastly, the OneXPlayer OneXSugar 1, the first Android gaming device with dual screens one on top of another (the top one is detachable), will also be coming in May.\n\nThe Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, which has 2.3 times better CPU and 3.8 times better GPU (Adreno A22) performance over its 2023 predecessor. It also supports up top Quad HD Plus displays with 144Hz refresh rate and the same FastConnect 7800 connectivity chip with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3.\n\nThis chip is for more affordable handhelds that aren't quite at the level of the Lenovo Legion Go S or Asus ROG Ally X, but aren't as expensive as those, either. While Qualcomm didn't name the specific device, handheld maker Retroid Pocket will have a device announced in \"a very short time\" that runs the G2 Gen 2.\n\nLastly, the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 is meant for devices that can play games, but will most likely be streaming them using cloud services like Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now. Its CPU has 80% better and GPU (Adreno A12) has 12% better performance than the chip's 2023 predecessor.\n\nThe Retroid Pocket PR Classic runs the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chip. Retroid Pocket\n\nQualcomm's G-series power the expansion of handhelds\n\nQualcomm's three chips are meant for different devices with different capabilities and sold at different prices -- and they're coming at an ideal time. Handheld gaming is enjoying a new era with wildly differing designs, formats and purposes, from cheap pocket-sized devices ordered from online marketplaces to high-end devices like the wedge-sized 8-inch and 11-inch Acer Nitro Blaze that launched at CES.\n\nIt's safe to say that these differing handheld gaming devices -- some of which look like shrunken Nintendo Game Boys, some of which follow the central-screen layout of the Nintendo Switch -- aren't just cheap Android phones, and haven't been for some time. Accordingly, Qualcomm's G-series chips suit gaming platforms' needs for longer game sessions at high performance, rather than the shorter, repeated gaming sessions when playing on phones.\n\nThat said, Qualcomm's handheld gaming and mobile chips share some DNA, as all three of the company's new chips are meant to power Android-based devices. Yet they also use Kryo CPUs, older designs than the Oryon CPUs that debuted on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile and Snapdragon X Elite PC chips, which boasted performance increases and AI capabilities. The company justified this by saying that its Kryo CPUs are well-suited for powering the many devices that handheld manufacturers are releasing on a faster basis, at least for now.\n\n\"Can Oryon help here? Absolutely. And are we looking at it in the future? Absolutely,\" Knapp said.\n\nWhile there are many different kinds of handhelds that run their own bespoke operating systems, from small outfits to the Steam Deck running SteamOS -- and even Windows. But Qualcomm's chips focus on powering devices that run Android, which the company says benefits the portability of a game to run on different platforms, like phones and cars (both of which Qualcomm makes chips for). It also gives handhelds easy access to the many games on the Google Play store.\n\nBut there's been increasing overlap between the Windows and Android space as it becomes easier to port software from one or the other. Knapp pointed to Epic Games, which made the Unreal Engine and has made the process so swift that it can \"have a PC game and hit a button and have it running on Android the same day,\" he said. As developers have struggled with shifting their game to a touch interface for Android-running devices, handhelds are a great opportunity considering their gamepads and buttons that are easier to port to.\n\n\"I do think this new form factor with the handheld and the gamepad is really going to accelerate more PC games moving to Android,\" said Dave Durnil, head of gaming at Qualcomm Technologies. \"Over time, we'll start to see [PC games] show up maybe even faster on mobile devices because of this nice bridge that handheld provides from PC to Android.\"",

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) as witnessed in first-quarter fiscal 2025. Strong demand for Broadcom\u2019s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth.\n\n\n\nBroadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom\u2019s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\n\n\nBroadcom\u2019s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.

With interest rates likely to remain high for longer, its net interest income (NII) will get support.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks analyst expects NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3.4% by 2027. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. Our estimate for non-interest income indicates an 11.6% fall in 2025. As it invests heavily in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain elevated.\n\n\n\nOur estimates for non-interest expenses reflect a CAGR of 2.5% by 2025. Weak asset quality is worrisome. However, a resurgence in deal-making activities and a solid pipeline will drive the investment banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% by 2027.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\n\n\n\nQualcomm's have underperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (-4.4% vs. +17%). The company is also facing challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip. Moreover, the majority of its customers include Chinese manufacturers, which further clouds the revenue-generating potential owing to strained bilateral trade relationships with the United States.\n\n\n\nAlso, Apple\u2019s move towards designing its chip in-house will likely have a negative impact on Qualcomm\u2019s profit. Nevertheless, Qualcomm is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge.\n\n\n\nWith the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, it is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile.

            "content": "Qualcomm has decided to step into the Android gaming handheld segment, as the firm has announced three new SoCs under its \"G-Series\" lineup.\n\nQualcomm Enters The Handheld Segment Dominated By AMD, Already Sees Integration From The Likes Of AYANEO & OneXPlayer\n\nThe San Diego chipmaker has been rapidly expanding to new market segments in the past few years, and after seeing decent success in the laptop industry, Qualcomm is now coming for the handheld segment. Under the Snapdragon G Series generation, the chipmaker has announced three new SoCs for handheld gaming devices, featuring the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2, all targeting different performance levels along with price segments as well.\n\nStarting with the highest-end chip, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 is a successor to the Gen2 variant, offering 30% faster CPU performance and 28% faster graphics capabilities. In terms of core configuration, you are looking at eight Kryo cores, including one prime, five performance, and two efficiency cores. For the iGPU, Qualcomm has equipped the G3 Gen 3 with the Adreno A32 GPU, similar to its previous-gen counterpart. This particular chip targets the enthusiast end of the handheld market, offering \"leading performance per watt\" figures.\n\nOne of the biggest upgrades with Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 is the support for Wi-Fi 7 and QHD+ 144Hz displays, which means that the SoC can easily be integrated into any high-class device. Unfortunately, we are yet to know about specifics like clock speeds or the chip's performance across gaming/synthetic workloads. Interestingly, the G3 Gen 3 has already seen integration from manufacturers like AYANEO and OneXPlayer, which shows the hype around Qualcomm's new SoCs.\n\nNext up, we have the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, which features a similar core configuration compared to the Gen 3; however, here, the efficiency cores see a rise, likely to target better power figures. This chip is said to bring in up to a 2.3x CPU performance increase and 3.8x faster GPU capabilities over Snapdragon G2 Gen 1. It also supports Wi-Fi 7, making it easier to integrate in mainstream handheld devices. The G2 series will be more common in budget-friendly handheld products, and we'll likely see them more in action.\n\nFinally, the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 is left, which focuses entirely on a budget-oriented performance experience since it features 2x performance cores and 6x efficiency cores. Qualcomm says that this chip is intended for cloud gaming on handheld devices, so we likely won't see the G1 Gen 2 in action for mainstream products, but rather in those where lower pricing is a priority.\n\n2 of 9\n\nQualcomm's entry into the handheld market comes at a time when AMD has dominated the segment, especially after the release of its Phoenix APU generation, and there's no doubt that Team Red has the leading market share. The interesting factor here would be how Qualcomm decides to compete in this space, whether through offering competitive performance or pricing, although the latter seems more sensible.\n\nDevices like the AYANEO Pocket S2, Gaming Pad, and OneXPlayer's SUGAR 1 have already integrated Snapdragon's G-Series SoCs into their devices, and it will be exciting to see how this venture turns out. We expect the initial batch of Qualcomm's handheld devices to launch in the upcoming weeks, and that's when we will know whether the San Diego chipmaker has successfully managed to capitalize on this segment.",

            "content": "Robert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nWhat if Google\u2019s next Pixel flagship used Qualcomm\u2019s high-flying Snapdragon 8 Elite rather than Google\u2019s in-house Tensor processor? While obviously entirely hypothetical (Google already has plans for the Pixel 11\u2019s Tensor G6), the hit-and-miss nature of the Pixel\u2019s in-house chip has often left many of us contemplating if the Tensor project has failed and if Pixel wouldn\u2019t be better off using the same chip as everyone else.\n\nPerformance is the obvious and most talked about point of difference, of course. It\u2019s well documented that Tensor typically benchmarks a couple of generations behind brand-new rivals, leaving Google\u2019s current Tensor G4 closer to 2022\u2019s 8 Gen 2 than the new powerhouse 8 Elite. Things don\u2019t look set to change with the G5; the gap has widened as Qualcomm has powered ahead with custom CPU cores that Arm\u2019s Cortex CPUs can\u2019t match.\n\nHypothetically, would you be more likely to buy a Snapdragon Pixel? 194 votes Absolutely. 64 % No, I prefer Tensor. 17 % It makes no difference to me. 19 %\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that the current Pixel 9 is slow, nor will the 10 series. With both the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Ultra in hand, I can attest that both launch apps and power through my daily tasks without breaking a sweat. But honestly, even much more affordable phones now offer plenty of performance when browsing social media. For premium users looking to play the most demanding Android games or fire through video editing apps, there\u2019s no doubt that the Snapdragon 8 Elite has much more headroom \u2014 an especially important consideration given the seven-year lifespan of these handsets. Still, this has been the case for several years at this point, so let\u2019s look at other developments to make this thought experiment much more interesting.\n\nPerformance is the most obvious difference, but moving to Snapdragon could change a lot more.\n\nAnother boon for recent Snapdragon flagships is enhanced battery life. Thanks to TSMC\u2019s 3nm process, rival handsets outlast the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s battery life for a roughly equivalent 5,060mAh capacity (see the Magic 7 Pro \u2013 5,270mAh, and Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2013 5,000mAh below). Granted, display and other spec differences contribute, but there\u2019s a general theme, too. Pixel falls far behind our competitors in our video playback, web browsing, and video call tests \u2014 offering anywhere from just 66% to 85% of the screen on time of the Galaxy S25 Ultra in these scenarios. Depending on what you\u2019re doing, that can result in a couple of extra hours of screen-on time. This is certainly reflected in my time spent with the two phones \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro XL will easily take me through a whole day, but the S25 Ultra is more likely to push on through a second day of basic use.\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s handset does equal and even sometimes just about best the competition when it comes to image and video capture, allowing you to take more of those precious snaps before the phone goes dead. Tensor\u2019s imaging pipeline seems more frugal than Snapdragon\u2019s, possibly owing to its tighter integration with its AI processor. Still, this seems to depend far more on the camera hardware than the processor, as seen by the huge variation in results from our Snapdragon 8 Elite flagships. In any event, hopefully, general battery life will likely improve when the Pixel 10\u2019s Tensor G5 finally swaps Samsung Foundries for TSMC and a more cutting-edge 3nm node, but we\u2019ll have to see if it can close that gap.\n\nA final point worth considering about Snapdragon is Qualcomm\u2019s huge range of extra options. Qualcomm has long had blazing fast and reliable modems for 5G and the latest Wi-Fi standards (Samsung\u2019s modems have been meh). Additionally, there\u2019s aptX Lossless for high-end wireless audio and Snapdragon Seamless for better integration with the latest PCs. Few brands ever throw in everything Qualcomm has to offer, but these would let Google do some more interesting things with its broader ecosystem. Granted, Google is investing in Satellite SOS and other features that ensure the phone feels up-to-date, so it\u2019s more a case of picking and choosing what would make for the most interesting products. I would undoubtedly love snappier connectivity between my Pixel and PC, as well as an option other than the unreliable LDAC to play back my FLAC\n\nCould you give up those Pixel goodies?\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nOK, enough of the Snapdragon schmoozing. Obviously, we\u2019d be giving up much of what makes the Pixel so great if it ditched Tensor for Snapdragon, right? Well, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s as true today as it was a couple of years ago.\n\nTake AI, for example, Tensor\u2019s early golden goose that kept the early models on everyone\u2019s radar. Fed up with the sluggish pace of machine learning silicon innovation, Tensor allowed Google to push ahead with computational photography and on-device AI capabilities that were leaps and bounds ahead at the time. While Google already cut its teeth on these ideas while still using Snapdragon, the Pixel 6 upped the ante with Live Translate, Face Unblur, and Real Tone, and Google\u2019s two follow-up phones cemented its reputation on these fronts.\n\nHowever, 2024 leveled the playing field. Galaxy AI showed that Samsung and Snapdragon can match much of what Google has to offer, and that gap has narrowed further with the S25 series. Close cooperation between the two has brought real-time translations, document summarization, and even new AI imaging features on-device. Countless other brands have introduced similar AI capabilities with their 2025 flagship products, such as the OnePlus 13 with its Gemini Nano-powered Magic Compose and live translation tools, leaving the Pixel 9 series with fewer unique AI accolades. Plenty of brilliant Pixel-exclusive features remain, of course, and Google will no doubt throw a few more at us when the Pixel 10 rolls around. However, a lot of these tools could almost certainly run on a Snapdragon-powered Pixel, too, complete with the other benefits we\u2019ve listed so far.\n\nWhether its AI, photography, or updates, Tensor provides fewer clear advantages each year.\n\nPhotography isn\u2019t a safe space for Pixels these days, either. While the brand continues to be one of the more reliable performers when it comes to HDR and color accuracy, plenty of other phones can do that, too. In fact, I\u2019d argue that OPPO, vivo, and Xiaomi produce better-looking pictures in terms of color science and are plowing their phones with useful filters and other AI tools to make them creative powerhouses. Google\u2019s latest innovations in Add Me and Best Take are welcome but hardly push the creativity envelope, but that\u2019s what high-end photographers all clamor for.\n\nLong-term updates, too, aren\u2019t exclusively Pixel\u2019s domain either. Google has made it easier for vendors like Qualcomm to support their chips for longer, albeit without necessarily supporting the latest Android hardware features further down the line. Still, Samsung now supports its Galaxy flagships with seven years of OS upgrades, matching Google. OnePlus promises four OS and six years of security patches, and several others have committed to the four/five split.\n\nA Snapdragon chip certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee long-term support, but it wouldn\u2019t be a barrier to Pixels lasting seven years either.\n\nSpeaking of updates, Android 16 breaks the long-standing practice of rolling out significant upgrades alongside the latest Pixel. If Google wanted, it could completely shift its launch window to be one of the first with a new Snapdragon processor. Now, wouldn\u2019t that be something?\n\nSnapdragon is a no-brainer, then?\n\nWell, that sounds pretty conclusive. Surely, Google is foolish not to opt for Snapdragon?\n\nWell, let\u2019s not be so hasty: price is the elephant in the room, and we know that the 8 Elite doesn\u2019t come cheap. Tensor isn\u2019t exactly a bargain bucket chip, but it\u2019s not as pricey, and the company plans to bring the cost down even further over the next two generations. Meanwhile, rumors suggest that next year\u2019s Snapdragon flagship will cost even more. If you\u2019ve wondered why brands have seemingly very tight budgets for updating their designs, it\u2019s because silicon costs are consuming ever greater portions.\n\nCould Google offer such long updates, continually revamp its design, or invest so heavily in its beloved software features if it had to pay the Snapdragon tax? Only Google knows, but I imagine something would have to give. At the very least, Tensor allows Google to support budget, flagship, and tablet products from a single building block \u2014 an idea Apple leverages to great success as well.\n\nI'd love a faster Pixel, but Tensor has less tangible benefits I'd miss.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that rivals have only recently closed the gap on Tensor\u2019s advantages in AI, photography, and updates. Being at the helm of its chip destiny affords Google a level of planning it can\u2019t have when buying off the shelf. Unfortunately, Tensor doesn\u2019t appear to have anything all that groundbreaking planned for the next couple of generations. Still, it will power 4K 60fps HDR video, 100x zoom, a new Cinematic Rendering Engine, and ambient health-related features in the next couple of generations, keeping the Pixel fresh with new features to talk about. Plus, the potential for another breakaway design change is probably worth keeping the chip around for.\n\nSo, would I really want Google to ditch Tensor and return to Snapdragon for the Pixel 10 and potentially beyond? Part of me says yes, but equally, there are already plenty of great phones if you\u2019re desperate for a Qualcomm chip. Tensor\u2019s more intangible qualities have helped make the Pixel the beloved series that it is, and despite our quibbles, it still plays an important enough role in the series\u2019 identity to keep it around. In any event, we\u2019re stuck with Tensor for at least a couple more years anyway.\n\nYou might like",

            "content": "Will Intel survive to 2030? We answer your biggest questions on factory delays, CHIPS Act\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Intel's first Ohio factory delayed again. Here's when it may open Intel, the financially embattled chipmaker, has delayed the opening of its first Ohio factory to 2030 or 2031, multiple years after it was to open.\n\nIntel has delayed the opening of its first Ohio chip factory to 2030 or 2031, five or six years later than originally planned.\n\nOther companies, including TSMC and Qualcomm, have reportedly considered acquiring part or all of Intel.\n\nIndustry experts say Intel has fallen behind competitors in the chip market and needs to make significant strides to catch up.\n\nWhen Intel broke ground on its $28-billion factories in New Albany, the company planned to begin production of microchips in Ohio in 2025.\n\nBut following one delay after another and continued financial problems, Intel has delayed the completion and opening of its first chip factory to 2030 or 2031. A second fab is set to now open in 2032.\n\nThe delays mean the first factory won't open until at least five or six years after it was expected to be operational in 2025. On top of the latest delays, President Donald Trump has also called on Congress to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation that is helping to fund Intel's new Ohio One factories.\n\nWith all the headlines the chipmaker garnered the last few weeks, The Dispatch took questions from readers during an \"Ask Us Anything\" online townhall this week on Reddit.\n\nHere are the biggest questions readers had and what we know.\n\nHave other companies expressed interest in buying Intel?\n\nAt this point, it's anyone's guess whether it will be Intel eventually running the chip plants in New Albany or another company altogether.\n\nAs recently as this week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom about taking stakes in a joint venture to operate Intel's factories, Reuters reported. Under the proposal, TSMC would operate the factories.\n\nThe development was hardly the first report of other companies eyeing part or all of Intel's business.\n\nRead More: Is Intel in trouble? How struggling chipmaker's financial issues may impact Ohio factories\n\nAlong with TSMC, Broadcom was said to be looking at acquiring Intel's chip design and marketing business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also previously asked TSMC to consider taking a controlling interest in Intel. San Diego-based Qualcomm has also considered buying Intel.\n\nAnd rumors swirled a month or two ago about whether Elon Musk, the world's richest man and leader of Tesla and SpaceX might be interested in buying Intel. Musk is currently heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency initiative to slash federal spending.\n\nWill CHIPS Act cash still materialize for Intel?\n\nIntel was one of several companies that stood to receive billions of dollars in federal funding from the bipartisan CHIPS Act signed into law by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBut, in a joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump called the CHIPS Act a \"horrible, horrible thing\" and suggested to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress do away with the law.\n\nIt's unclear whether Congress will act on Trump's request. But, Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, has told The Dispatch he believes there is still bipartisan support for the CHIPS Act and that it will likely remain in place.\n\nIntel has received $2.2 billion of its $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n\nDan Tierney, spokesperson for Gov. Mike DeWine, said the governor's office will keep an eye on whether Congress takes action on the CHIPS Act. But, Tierney pointed out that Intel's leaders previously said they would have pursued the company's Ohio One plants even without federal funding.\n\nWill Ohio claw back any state funding for Intel's New Albany fabs?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the state of Ohio will try to claw back any of the funding it's awarded Intel for its chip factories.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Development has an agreement with the company, which states $300 million in grants were made available to help with the construction of each factory completed by the end of 2028. That money was paid out in September 2023, according to the state.\n\nPolicy experts on both sides of the aisle have called for accountability for Intel following its delays and the fallout from its financial problems.\n\nRead More: Intel already spent billions on delayed New Albany chip factory, new report reveals\n\nZach Schiller, research director at Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning think tank with offices in Columbus and Cleveland, said that the trouble with Intel is \"more than just noise.\" Officials should require Intel to annually report the number of jobs its Ohio plants have created along with other metrics such as capital invested, Schiller previously told The Dispatch.\n\nAt the same time, Greg Lawson, a researcher at the right-leaning think tank The Buckeye Institute said the state should enforce its agreement with Intel given how much money it put on the table.\n\n\"You need to have easily enforceable claw backs because what happens in 10 years? Is whoever is in the governor's mansion then really going to do that?\" Lawson said in February.\n\nWhat about the colleges and schools that already started preparing for Intel?\n\nSince Intel announced it was coming to Ohio, local colleges and school districts have begun retooling programs and training students to join the workforce the company will need when its factories open.\n\nIn 2022, Intel said it would give $17.7 million over three years to fund research and training at more than 80 Ohio colleges and universities.\n\nOne Columbus CEO Kenny McDonald said in February that he's not worried about how the latest delay will impact this research and training locally. He encouraged colleges to stay the course in preparation for the factories.\n\nWhen Intel's factories are fully up and running, the Ohio One site is expected to employ around 3,000 workers. As of Dec. 31, Intel's Ohio operation had 163 employees, including 156 who live in Ohio and 7 employees who don't live in the state, according to the chipmaker.\n\nDo industry experts think Intel itself can survive to 2030?\n\nDepending on what happens over the next five years, Intel could look a lot different in 2030 than it does today.\n\nIntel has fallen behind some of its closest competitors and it will take a lot for the chip maker to catch back up with them, experts have told The Dispatch.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., NVIDIA, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have all pulled ahead of Intel, which largely exited the smartphone market years ago, Brady Wang, an associate director at Counterpoint, a Hong Kong-based technology market research firm previously said.\n\nAt the same time, Intel also lags competitors in artificial intelligence \u2014a sector that's growing rapidly right now. Until Intel gains ground in AI, it will struggle to compete, both Wang Counterpoint senior analyst Jeongku Choi have said.\n\n\"Investing in leading edge fabs is a no-brainer to survive,\" Wang said. \"It\u2018s the only way to regain the confidence of their customers.\u201d\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby",

            "content": "Barring any hiccups, Qualcomm has agreed to purchase Edge Impulse for an undisclosed amount.\n\nEdge Impulse is designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying machine learning on edge devices where computing power is normally limited. These devices include healthcare wearables, industrial IoT, retail, security, energy, supply chain and asset management. The platform has a suite of tools covering the entire workflow from data collection, model training, optimization and deployment.\n\nQualcomm intends to expand its abilities with AI and IoT, under the umbrella of its Dragonwing line of AI-powered chips. Dragonwing is designed to support Enterprise applications and prioritizes energy efficiency in resource constrained deployments.\n\nCofounder Zach Shelby writes on the company blog about starting the company with Jan Jongboom in 2019 and how joining Qualcomm will not change the company\u2019s objectives, but extend its reach to the 170,000 developers that will now also be part of Qualcomm\u2019s Dragonwing community.\n\nHe goes on to write: \u201cIn 2019, Jan Jongboom and I set out to democratize machine learning on edge compute for millions of developers. Recognizing that the compute capabilities of microcontrollers had grown to the point where they were able to run domain specific AI models directly onboard, we realized there were an endless number of use cases that would benefit from moving AI from the cloud to the edge. But there was a missing piece: a way to easily build, optimize, and deploy edge and domain-specific AI models onto these devices.\u201d\n\nHe elaborates that, \u201ctogether we launched Edge Impulse, an end-to-end platform that streamlines the edge AI workflow. Instead of having to manually collect and format data, hand-code and train model architectures, convert and compile models, and test for viability, Edge Impulse gives developers a tool that automates data collection, simplifies model training, provides advanced optimization tools, and offers one-click deployment to many types of hardware, from MCUs to CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s used by Fortune 100 companies deploying AI globally.\n\nBy integrating with Qualcomm Technologies, Edge Impulse developers will have the ability to target Dragonwing platforms, which feature superior AI inferencing, computer vision, graphics and processing capabilities. This is already launched and you can try it out today.\n\nShelby goes on to point out that, by joining Qualcomm, they \u201caccelerate support for computer vision, audio, speech recognition, and Generative AI, on extremely capable Dragonwing processors\u2026[while] continuing support for edge hardware from our wide partner base, including MCUs, CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. As always, you can deploy your models to your favorite hardware with Edge Impulse.\u201d\n\nFor Qualcomm, Edge Impulse suite adds an \u201cintuitive Edge AI Workflow: Regardless of your experience level, benefit from a complete and intuitive edge AI development workflow. Go from data preparation and AI experimentation to optimizing and deploying AI models on a wide range of edge hardware, including Dragonwing processors, which you can try today.\u201d\n\nI have to applaud Shelby\u2019s detail showing how to deploy to Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 Hardware with Edge Impulse for the benefit of developers.\n\nThe Edge Impulse platform works with Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 edge AI workflow and tools like the Qualcomm AI Hub and Foundries.io, allowing for even greater access to new models, testing environments, and deployment options.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s announcement tones it down a bit, but Nakul Duggal, group general manager, automotive, industrial and embedded IoT, and cloud computing, Qualcomm Technologies, says, \u201cWe are thrilled about the opportunity to significantly enhance our IoT offerings with Edge Impulse\u2019s advanced AI-powered end-to-end platform that will complement our strategic approach to IoT transformation. We anticipate that this acquisition will strengthen our leadership in AI and developer enablement, enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive technology for critical sectors such as retail, security, energy and utilities, supply chain management, and asset management.

            "content": "Looking to enhance data-driven decision-making for customers in industrial internet of things (IoT) applications, Palantir Technologies has entered into a collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies to run its Ontology enterprise systems on Qualcomm\u2019s hardware and software platforms at the network edge to hasten and improve real-time insights and data-driven decisions even in offline remote environments.\n\nBy combining its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered edge processors and connected software with Palantir\u2019s AI platform, Qualcomm believes manufacturers and enterprise customers will be able to build and deploy scalable AI solutions for a variety of sectors, beginning with manufacturing, industrial and automotive.\n\nThe partnership comes weeks after Qualcomm unveiled the Dragonwing suite of products that now represent the comms tech firm\u2019s networking and cellular infrastructure solutions. Dragonwing products are designed to support edge intelligence custom-designed for business and industry, with on-device hardware and software AI solutions seeing use in a number of areas.\n\nThe net result, according to Qualcomm, is that the IoT solutions can be used to simplify complexity, empower smarter decision-making and optimise operational efficiency, forming \u201cblueprints for industry transformation\u201d, from enhancing everyday needs to solving the world\u2019s most mission-critical challenges.\n\nThe collaboration will combine Palantir\u2019s Ontology directly with Dragonwing processors, enabling AI-powered applications built using Palantir\u2019s OSDK and AIP to be run directly on devices powered by Dragonwing platforms for hardware-accelerated multimedia and AI experiences, even in partially disconnected or fully air-gapped environments.\n\nPalantir Foundry Object Peering, designed to enable data synchronisation across compute topologies powered by Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 platforms, supports hardware and software solutions that capture and process data at the source, all while integrating with core AIP infrastructure during times of connectivity. Palantir Apollo then enables customers to manage those solutions on devices powered by Qualcomm platforms at scale, delivering ontologies, AI models and third-party software across edge and cloud footprints.\n\nThe two companies are confident that by harnessing Palantir\u2019s data integration and analytics and the Dragonwing IQ series, users will be able to create devices that will identify potential security breaches and operational issues early, optimise response times and significantly enhance overall system reliability.\n\n\u201cQualcomm Technologies is at the forefront of enabling intelligent edge computing, and our collaboration with Palantir marks a pivotal moment in advancing AI capabilities at the edge,\u201d said Nakul Duggal, group general manager of automotive, industrial and embedded IoT, and cloud computing, at Qualcomm Technologies.\n\n\u201cBy harnessing Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 advanced edge AI capabilities across a broad portfolio of devices via our Qualcomm AI Stack and connected services and using Palantir\u2019s Ontology enterprise offerings, our customers can revolutionise how data is processed and utilised. This powerful combination delivers transformative benefits across industries, enhancing real-time insights and decision-making at the edge,\u201d added Duggal.\n\n\u201cAt Palantir, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with data and AI with our software. Our collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies is a significant step to bring one of Palantir\u2019s most core elements, the Ontology, to the edge,\u201d said Palantir Technologies\u2019 head of USG research and development, Robert Imig.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026 will enable our customers to mirror their data modelling in cloud stacks with remote edge devices powered by Qualcomm Technologies, thus enabling seamless ability to port logic and AI from the cloud to the edge, providing Palantir-grade decision-making for industrial IoT use cases.\u201d",

Epic hasn't rolled out Fortnite on Snapdragon just yet, and while increased app support is great for Snapdragon gaming, there are a few drawbacks to the Snapdragon X platform.\n\nEpic support is a step in the right direction\n\nCredit: Qualcomm\n\nEpic's Easy Anti-Cheat system is used by hundreds of multiplayer games, including games that aren't available just through the Epic Games Store. After all, Epic is the company behind the Unreal engine, which powers a lot of multiplayer games.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Fortnite is the first game with Snapdragon support for Easy Anti-Cheat, Epic intends to roll the system out to other games once the Fortnite stress test phase has been completed. The announcement reads, \"Battle-testing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support with Fortnite will help ensure smooth implementations in other games.\"\n\nA lack of multiplayer and competitive games has been one of the major gaming drawbacks of the Snapdragon X platform, and the root cause is that most multiplayer games use Windows kernel-level anti-cheat software. Since most games are compiled for Windows x64, kernel anti-cheat doesn't translate directly to Windows on Arm.\n\nQualcomm has been partnering with many companies, including Adobe, BlackMagic, and Moises, to increase application support for Snapdragon X systems. So, working with Epic Games to get more games running on Snapdragon just makes sense. Especially as the Snapragon X series chipsets are now coming to miniPCs as well as laptops.\n\nDon't get too excited for gaming on Snapdragon X laptops\n\nCredit: Future\n\niGPU gaming has come a long way, with the AMD Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix Point\" and Intel Core Ultra 200V Lunar Lake AI PC chips offering impressive graphics that blew our expectations out of the water. But of the three Windows AI PC chips, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series falls short of its competition.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we'd seen gaming demos with the Snapdragon X Elite that were impressively smooth, the experience with actual production systems was beyond underwhelming. Depending on the games you play, the integrated Adreno graphics tile leaves you playing a slideshow even at medium 1080p settings.\n\nHowever, Snapdragon X gaming also has issues that go beyond underpowered hardware. Windows on Arm gaming has a decent library of indie and single-player titles but lacks competitive games and MMOs, thanks to Windows kernel-level anti-cheat systems.\n\nWhile Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat support could eventually open up more games from the Epic library on Snapdragon X systems, Epic is using Fortnite as a stress-test before rolling out support on more games. So, gamers will have to wait for other Easy Anti Cheat games like Apex Legends, Elden Ring, Halo: Infinite and Destiny 2.\n\nWhat this means for you\n\nIncreased app support for Snapdragon X systems is great for the Windows on Arm ecosystem. One of the biggest challenges in swapping from an Intel or AMD-powered Windows x64 system to Arm is the software gap between the two versions of Windows.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking games available to more gamers is always a good thing. After all, people like to game on laptops.\n\nBut even with more games becoming available, gaming on Snapdragon-powered laptops will still have to contend with sub-par hardware.\n\nSo, sure, you may one day be able to play Elden Ring on your Snapdragon X Elite Copilot+ PC, but the overall experience may not be worth it. At least with this generation.\n\nWe still don't know much about the next generation of Qualcomm Snapdragon AI PC chips, but the second generation could feature a beefier iGPU that would make gaming on a Snapdragon laptop a worthwhile experience.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no current date for when Fortnite or other Easy Anti-Cheat games will become available on Snapdragon-powered devices.",

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\n\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nVGM Score\n\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nHeadquartered in San Diego since 1985, Qualcomm is a fabless semiconductor company.\n\nQCOM is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. QCOM has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 15.1% for the current fiscal year.\n\n10 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.59 to $11.76 per share. QCOM boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, QCOM should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM)?\n\nBefore you invest in QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

I've written first-hand experience that shows this just isn't the case.\n\nThere is one roadblock though; Anticheat. Today, Epic Games and Qualcomm have announced a collaborative effort to upgrade Easy Anti Cheat to support Snapdragon X later this year.\n\n\"Hundreds of today\u2019s multiplayer games\u2014including Fortnite\u2014rely on Easy Anti-Cheat to counter hacking and cheating in multiplayer PC games. In addition to releasing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support for Fortnite we will bring this support to developers through an Epic Online Services SDK release. This will enable developers using Easy Anti-Cheat to bring this compatibility to their own games. \"\n\nFortnite will be the first EAC title on Snapdragon X later this year. (Image credit: Epic Games)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the first title to go live is also the biggest. It's also the one that makes the most sense. Epic Games' megahit, Fortnite, will be going live with Snapdragon X support for Easy Anti Cheat later this year. There's no more specific information than that on when, but it's in progress.\n\nThis is huge for a number of reasons, not least one of the most played games on the planet becoming available on Snapdragon X-powered PCs. Fortnite is traditionally one of the easier games to run on lower-powered hardware, so it's a good fit.\n\nIt's also, as Epic says, the perfect way to battle test that it actually works.\n\n\"Battle-testing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support with Fortnite will help ensure smooth implementations in other games.\"\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

In addition to Fortnite, Epic will release an SDK update for other developers to add support into their own EAC implementations.\n\nSnapdragon-powered PCs can game, and Epic is going to make sure they can play even more titles. (Image credit: Future)\n\nGaming on Snapdragon X is, in some regards, akin to gaming on the Steam Deck. The two aren't apples for apples, but both share an issue with anticheat software. Steam OS is based on Linux, and so Windows-based anticheat doesn't just magically work.\n\nThe situation over there has improved a lot, despite holdouts, and the likes of Riot Games' Vanguard, and Activision's Ricochet, are unlikely to ever work on Linux due to their kernel-level activity.\n\nEpic Games has been very proactive though and supports Steam Deck, and will soon support Snapdragon X for Windows. Whatever your feelings about the company, you cannot deny the effort the boffins there are putting in to open up gaming to as many folks as possible.\n\nI've been really impressed with gaming performance on both the Snapdragon X Elite and the Snapdragon X Plus, both with and without using Microsoft's Auto SR upscaler. Even being a first-gen product, the performance is there.\n\nLots of stars need to align, not least Qualcomm pushing regular graphics driver updates and Microsoft expanding support for Auto SR. But anticheat is a massive roadblock to playing some of the most popular games on the planet, so the impact here is real. It has to start somewhere, and the ball is now officially rolling.",

            "content": "Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said Tuesday (March 11) that artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in the next fundamental shift in how humans interact with technology, describing it as a \u201cgeneration change\u201d poised to reshape the tech landscape and redefine user experiences across devices.\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of a very big transition in technology,\u201d Amon said during a speech at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. \u201cAI is a generation change. It\u2019s going to change a lot how we interact with our computers.\u201d\n\nThe CEO outlined a historical progression of how humans interacted with computers \u2014 from using an ASCII keyboard to type into a computer, to graphical and use of a mouse, to touchscreens on mobile devices. AI is ushering in the next leap forward.\n\n\u201cSomething happened with the AI,\u201d Amon said. \u201cThe computers can understand human language, and because the computer can understand human language, it changes again how we interact with computers.\u201d\n\nAccording to Amon, rather than navigating between different apps for specific tasks, users will interact with AI agents that understand context and can seamlessly perform tasks across multiple domains.\n\nToday, \u201cyou go to different apps and do different things. But once the AI understands your intention, they are free. It can go to an app. It can go to another app,\u201d Amon said. \u201cApps are built on top of the agent, so it changes, and it\u2019s going to be this assistant that you have with you all the time.\u201d\n\nFor example, a traveler on vacation takes photos and videos. The AI agent automatically organizes them and adds information. It can also suggest dining options based on its knowledge of the traveler\u2019s preferences and juxtaposes that with its knowledge of eateries at the vacation spot. The AI agent does all these without asking the traveler to use different apps.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have different inputs, whether it\u2019s voice and audio, or text. \u2026 Every text that you write could be a prompt for a model and for an agent to understand what you do and then be ready to help you when you need help,\u201d Amon explained.\n\nAmon emphasized that this transformation extends beyond smartphones to other devices, such as automobiles and wearable technology like augmented reality (AR) glasses.\n\nAmon called AR glasses \u201cwearable AI,\u201d highlighting Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses as an example of this emerging technology. \u201cWhen you wear those glasses, what you see the glass sees, what you hear the glass hears,\u201d he explained, enabling seamless AI assistance based on real-world context.\n\nHe also described cars as \u201ca new computing space\u201d where agent-based interfaces are particularly well-suited, allowing drivers to interact naturally through voice and visual cues.\n\n\u201cThe car is now a new computing space, like a phone was computing space. Your laptop\u2019s a computing space,\u201d Amon said. \u201cThis type of agent-based user experience is perfect when you are driving a car \u2014 voice is very natural, visual is very natural.\u201d\n\nAmon said AI as the new user interface could be ubiquitous within five years, with edge computing further hastening the transition.\n\nThis on-device AI processing is what Amon referred to as \u201cAI at the edge.\u201d This approach offers advantages in speed, privacy, reliability and cost compared to cloud-based alternatives, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you do the processing on the device, it\u2019s immediate. You don\u2019t have to wait. It\u2019s private. It\u2019s your data. It\u2019s your personal graph that stays with you,\u201d Amon said. \u201cEvery time you run an AI on the cloud, versus you running the computer that you have in your hand now, that\u2019s your computer. It runs on that at no cost to you.\u201d\n\nAmon said Qualcomm wants its chips to enable all these experiences at the edge, or on-device. The AI revolution is the latest chapter in Qualcomm\u2019s 40-year history of driving technological transformation, from pioneering mobile communications to integrating consumer electronics into smartphones, and now to enabling on-device AI processing.\n\n\u201cWe are like a real technology company,\u201d Amon stated. \u201cWe\u2019re the No. 1 patent holder in the United States, we have created a lot of fundamental technologies.\u201d He said Qualcomm technology is present in devices people use daily, even if they aren\u2019t aware of it.\n\nPhoto credit: Deborah Yao",

            "content": "Analysts advise investors against favoring a single investment strategy. JP Morgan noted that large technology companies are widely held both individually and within major indices. As a result, significant market fluctuations can occur when developments\u2014such as the recent introduction of a Chinese large language model in late January\u2014impact the sector. However, the firm does not recommend actively betting against the dominant tech giants that hold the largest weightings in the broader market.\n\nThe report highlighted several key drivers behind this trend. Strong employment numbers, easing inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start cutting interest rates have bolstered investor confidence, prompting a broader market rally beyond the dominant mega-cap stocks. Additionally, sectors that are more sensitive to interest rates\u2014such as financials, utilities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs)\u2014have benefited from a lower-rate environment.\n\nMuch of the Russell Index\u2019s gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of mega-cap stocks, particularly the tech-heavy \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d These companies now make up over 25% of the index and were responsible for nearly 40% of its 21% total return in the first three quarters of 2024. However, market dynamics have started to shift in recent months, with value stocks gaining traction. In the third quarter, the Russell Value Index surged 9.4%, significantly outpacing the 3.2% rise in the Russell Growth Index, according to a report from BlackRock.\n\nFormer professor-turned-investment manager Josef Lakonishok and value investing specialist David Dreman strongly advocated for a patient, long-term approach to investing, believing that steady, disciplined strategies often outperform rapid, high-growth ones. Their research indicated that value investing tends to outperform growth strategies approximately 70% of the time, regardless of a company\u2019s size. After analyzing companies across different market capitalizations, they found that, over long periods, value stocks consistently generated average annual returns slightly above 7%, surpassing the performance of growth stocks.\n\nValue investing has remained a favored approach among investors for years, largely popularized by Warren Buffett, who continues to focus on stocks he believes are undervalued relative to their true worth. While growth investing has dominated market sentiment in recent times, the long-term performance of value stocks remains solid.\n\nWe recently published a list of 13 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now . In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDrawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, JP Morgan highlighted that the leading companies of that era traded at forward price-to-earnings ratios between 50x and 75x. In contrast, most of today\u2019s mega-cap stocks are valued at roughly half of those peak multiples. The firm further advised investors to diversify beyond growth equities, particularly by considering financial stocks. Alongside industrials, a balanced approach between growth and value stocks remains its preferred strategy.\n\nStocks that pay dividends are often associated with value investing, as they generally provide higher yields and demonstrate stronger financial stability compared to growth stocks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, investment strategies centered on generating income tend to share traits commonly found in value stocks. Companies with attractive dividend yields and lower valuations often capture investor attention.\n\nHowever, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index does not adhere strictly to a value-focused approach. Instead, it maintains a mix of both growth and value stocks. A long-term review of the index, covering the period from 1999 to 2022, indicated that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were classified as value stocks, while 40.94% fell into the growth category.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz screener and identified dividend companies with forward P/E ratios below 15, as of March 6. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. From the resultant dataset, we selected 13 companies that have the highest number of hedge fund investors at the end of Q4 2023. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) The Best Cheap Dividend Stock To Buy Right Now?\n\nA technician testing the latest 5G device, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 13.51\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks eighth on our list of the best cheap dividend stocks. The American semiconductor company has a strong financial position and advanced research and development capabilities, and is well-equipped to expand into high-growth sectors such as robotics chips. As automation transforms industries like manufacturing, logistics, and services, the demand for sophisticated robotics technology is expected to grow, creating new opportunities for the company. Its cutting-edge semiconductor designs, including custom \u201cOryon\u201d cores featured in the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon 8 Elite, deliver high performance and energy efficiency\u2014critical for real-time decision-making in robotics applications.\n\nIn fiscal Q1 2025, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported $11.7 billion in revenue, marking a 17.6% year-over-year increase. This was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, setting a new quarterly sales record. The chip division (QCT) contributed $10.1 billion in revenue, up 20% from the previous year. Smartphone-related sales rose 13% to $7.6 billion, while automotive revenue saw a 61% surge, reaching $961 million. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things (IoT) segment grew 36% to $1.5 billion.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) maintained a strong financial position in the latest quarter, with over $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Operating cash flow reached nearly $4.6 billion, and the company returned $942 million to shareholders through dividend payments. The company\u2019s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.85 per share for a dividend yield of 2.18%, as of March 6. QCOM is a reliable dividend payer with 20 years of dividend growth under its belt.\n\nOverall, QCOM ranks 8th on our list of best cheap dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Qualcomm has acquired AI startup Edge Impulse. The startup offers an AI platform for training LLMs for edge devices and support for Qualcomm Dragonwing processors.\n\nRecently acquired by Qualcomm, Edge Impulse offers a cloud-based platform that allows end users to train LLMs running on (IoT or IIoT) devices at the edge of the (enterprise) network, for example, in industrial environments.\n\nThese specific LLMs are often trained on (measurement) data from network sensors. The Edge Impulse cloud platform helps transform this data into training sets for LLMs.\n\nIn addition, specific tooling helps create data pipelines for automating workflows, especially workflows that aggregate sensor data into a dataset for training the model. Consider filtering, deduplication and removal of erroneous records.\n\nOther platform capabilities\n\nThe platform also provides tools for feature engineering. This involves condensing raw sensor data into a format LLMs can process more easily, such as merging a collection of temperature measurement data into a single value that is easier to analyze.\n\nThe Edge Impulse platform further helps identify the right LLM for a specific project after creating a training dataset.\n\nAlso, due to the limited processing power of edge devices, the platform helps identify the right hardware requirements for different AI architectures. This makes it easier for companies to select the right LLMs to run on their edge devices.\n\nUnder the hood, an LLM algorithm trained in Edge Impulse is packaged in a C++ library instead of Python. This is because the \u201cold\u201d programming language offers more hardware efficiency. Ultimately, Edge Impulse claims that this could reduce the memory usage of an LLM by 60 percent.\n\nBy now, more than 170,000 developers worldwide are said to be already using the platform.\n\nBrick ML device\n\nIn addition to its cloud-based software platform, Edge Impulse offers a dedicated edge device: the Brick ML. This compact rectangular computing device is designed specifically for running LLMs. It can be attached to devices in edge environments, collect sensor data, and analyze it locally with the onboard LLMs.\n\nSupport for Qualcomm Dragonwing processors\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Edge Impulse acquisition offers new opportunities, such as for its recently launched range of Dragonwing processors for edge devices. Within this range are GPUs for running LLMs and processors that can operate at extremely low temperatures.\n\n\n\nEdge Impulse, meanwhile, supports the Qualcomm Dragonwing processors QCS6490 and QCS5430. Both processors are suitable for rugged mobile devices, and the latest Dragonwing processor is additionally suitable for robotic solutions and applications.\n\nThe AI startup plans to support more Qualcomm Dragonwing processors later and edge hardware from other partners, such as MCUs, CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs.\n\nNo financial details about the acquisition were disclosed.\n\nAlso read: Qualcomm stretches life of Snapdragon 8 Elite: eight years of support",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other most undervalued high quality stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIs a Market Rally Around The Corner?\n\nIn one of our recent articles, titled 11 Best Undervalued Stocks to Invest in Now, we talked about how the recent tariffs have caused a slowdown in the market and are likely to cause inflation. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\n\u201cToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\u201d\n\nOn March 6, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about how the market is likely to proceed forward from here. Lee stated that he is still optimistic about the market, he acknowledged that investors are sitting out at the moment as they are trying to assess the severity of these tariffs. However as a result the market is seeing a big price correction and a decline in sentiment. Moreover, Lee noted that we also had a bad ADP jobs report and the market is going up on bad news which he believes is good for the market.\n\nLee explained what has happened during the six weeks essentially represents a bear market that has swept through sentiment and positioning because if we look at the hedge funds positioning it has almost gone neutral. Lee believes because of this the current and two upcoming months can be huge rally months, where the market can be rallying as much as 10% to 15%.\n\nWhile answering the question of whether this slowdown is a Buy, Lee noted that the 10 best days happen every year for the market. Last year the 10 best days of the year added up to 21% to the S&P 500, excluding these 10 days the market was only up 4%. He explained that markets don\u2019t get 20% gains throughout the year, it is those 10 best days where the market rallies the most. Lee thinks that these 10 best days for 2025 are near because if the economy is near stall speed, the \u201cTrump Put\u201d will come back, otherwise, the market has to unwind all this austerity. Moreover, if the job market is soft, the \u201cFed Put\u201d comes back into play, because the Fed does not want the stall speed to linger. Lee thinks these two things are going to be the positive catalysts in the next couple of weeks.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Technologies has signed a deal to acquire US-based Edge Impulse, which makes miniaturised machine learning (ML) tools for microcontrollers (MCUs) in resource-constrained IoT modules. It is the latest move by the chipmaker to reorganise its IoT strategy and portfolio to combine hardware, software, and services to \u201cscale across multiple verticals\u201d. Last week, ahead of MWC, it introduced a new brand, Dragonwing, to give its IoT products their own identity, and to stand apart from its regular Snapdragon consumer units. The deal with Edge Impulse, a regular on the low-power IoT circuit, is timed with its appearance at Embedded World in Germany this week.\n\nQualcomm has also picked up the LTE portfolio of France-based IoT specialist Sequans, at the end of last summer. It explained its IoT strategy, now united under the Dragonwing brand, to put squarer focus on an \u2018end-to-end\u2019 chipset roadmap, software architecture, services suite, developer resources, ecosystem partnerships, optimised solutions, and industrial blueprints. All in, the message is Qualcomm is (more) serious about IoT \u2013 as if the market, including with the rise of private 5G networks and first sightings of RedCap in Industry 4.0, is ready to blow open. At least, that is how it reads. As with the proposed Edge Impulse deal, it is very clearly also about AI at the edge.\n\nEdge Impulse\u2019s no-code platform includes tools and features for data collection and preparation, and model training, deployment, and monitoring in IoT devices. It has been available since 2019, when on-device edge AI was popularly called \u2018tiny ML\u2019, to describe a more-miniaturised version of edge AI to go even in battery-powered IoT devices. As it is, on-camera AI/ML for computer vision applications is the standard application for tiny ML and edge AI, further orchestrated with distributed compute nodes within an enterprise-based edge setup, and linking to the cloud as required / permitted.\n\nIn a blog post about the Qualcomm deal, Zach Shelby, co-founder at Edge Impulse, wrote: \u201cRecognising that the compute capabilities of MCUs had grown to the point where they were able to run domain specific AI models directly onboard, we realised there were an endless number of use cases that would benefit from moving AI from the cloud to the edge. But there was a missing piece: a way to easily build, optimise, and deploy edge and domain-specific AI models onto these devices.\u201d Which is the firm\u2019s whole origin story, right there \u2013 to remove the manual developer processes to collect and format data, hand-code and train architectures, and convert and compile models.\n\nAnd then to test for viability. \u201c[We] set out to democratise ML on edge compute for millions of developers\u2026 \u2013 to give developers a tool to automate data collection, simplify model training, provide advanced optimisation tools, and offer one-click deployment to many types of hardware, from MCUs to CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs,\u201d said Shelby. The deal will mean its developers, which number about 170,000, can \u201ctarget Dragonwing platforms\u201d for AI inferencing, applications, and other processing capabilities, said Qualcomm. Target IoT sectors for Qualcomm are industrial, logistics, security, healthcare, retail, energy, and sundry \u201centerprise\u201d markets.\n\nNakul Duggal, group general manager for embedded IoT at Qualcomm, said: \u201cEdge Impulse\u2019s advanced AI-powered end-to-end platform\u2026 will complement our strategic approach to IoT transformation. This acquisition will strengthen our leadership in AI and developer enablement, enhancing our ability to provide comprehensive technology for critical sectors\u2026 IoT opens the door for a myriad of opportunities, and success is about building real-world solutions, enabling developers and enterprises with AI capabilities to extract intelligence from data, and providing them with the tools to build the applications and services that will power the digital transformation of industries.\u201d\n\nEdge Impulse currently supports Dragonwing QCS6490 and QCS5430 processors; it will add support for additional Dragonwing processors for industrial and embedded IoT applications. Edge Impulse will maintain its current website (branded as \u201cEdge Impulse, a Qualcomm company\u201d) and remains dedicated to supporting developers and ecosystem partners.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Cheap Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other cheap tech stocks.\n\nIt seems that technology stocks have had a tough start to 2025. On March 4, 2025, CNBC reported that since President Donald Trump took office in January, the S&P 500 technology sector has dropped 7.5%. Tech stocks have slumped largely due to new tariffs that have set off a trade war and added fuel to the risk-off sentiment on Wall Street.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Worst Performing Crypto Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 5 Years.\n\nEconomists had cautioned that tariffs could lead to a rise in inflation and create global economic disruptions. Many leading tech companies assemble and manufacture products outside the US and as a result of the tariffs these companies could see manufacturing costs rise.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have also been hit hard. On March 3, Trump cleared the way for new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and smashed hopes of a potential last-minute deal. According to the US President, there was \u201cno room left\u201d for further negotiations after weeks of talks. Trump also put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nIn response, Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs. Mexico said it will be looking to announce a plan on Sunday. China retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on some US goods. These developments have added to the uncertainty surrounding the tech sector.\n\nThe tech sector has experienced a decline due to economic uncertainty and trade tensions and this might present buying opportunities for some investors. Despite current challenges, some tech stocks show strong potential for growth.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Yahoo Finance. To find cheap tech stocks, we looked for stocks with a forward P/E ratio of less than 20. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies trading at under 20 times their forward earnings as of March 3, 2025. Next, we focused on the top 10 cheap tech stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 10 cheap tech stocks to buy were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nForward P/E: 13.55\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an American multinational technology corporation that ranks among the best cheap tech stocks to buy. The company designs and develops processors, modems, radio frequency (RF) systems, 5G, 4G and legacy connectivity solutions, and optimized software.

It has 170 offices in more than 30 countries around the world.\n\nThe company is making strategic moves to maintain leadership in wireless technologies by integrating advanced AI capabilities into its platforms to enhance user experiences and drive transformation across industries. On March 3, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) unveiled advancements in 5G and AI at MWC Barcelona 2025.

            "content": "ZDNET's key takeaways The Asus Zenbook A14 is available now, with configurations starting for $899.\n\nAsus' new ultraportable is a fantastic balance of innovation and value with a brilliant OLED display, competitive hardware, and a satisfying physical form.\n\nWhile its use case is clearly defined, the laptop has its limits when it comes to high-end performance. View now at Asus View now at Best Buy more buying choices\n\nWhen Asus officially announced the Zenbook A14 at CES this year, I wasn't the only one to be low-key enamored with it. It's a great laptop in its own right, but it stands out as a successful balancing act between performance and affordability while hitting all the right notes that consumers care about.\n\nMade of Asus' proprietary ceraluminum material, the Zenbook A14 almost feels like a prototype model that's empty inside, as it's exceedingly light at just 2.1 pounds (for reference, the 13-inch MacBook Air is 2.7 pounds). When you set it down, the device opens easily with the lift of a single finger, revealing the brilliant OLED display.\n\nAlso: I tested Asus' dual-screen laptop, and it sparked my creativity in the best way\n\nAsus committed to a neutral-forward aesthetic with the A14. The brand messaging features muted tones and quiet, sophisticated imagery punctuated by natural motifs, and, overall, it works to form a cohesive identity.\n\nThis aesthetic highlights Asus' determination to deliver a cohesive brand message while balancing innovation and cost. For example, the display on the Zenbook A14 looks good right out of the box. It's bright, crisp, and efficient. But closer inspection reveals that it's not as premium a display as you'd find on, say, Asus' ProArt P16.\n\nThe display is framed by plastic bezels carefully designed not to look cheap, but again\u2026 this isn't the ProArt. Additionally, the panel over the FHD display has some slight warping that can give a funhouse mirror effect when you catch your reflection on the glossy surface.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nOnce the display is turned on, however, whatever jumpscare you just saw is quickly forgotten, as it delivers a brilliant image: contrast is crisp, colors are vivid, and it's bright, at 600 nits and a full HD+ (1920 x 1200) resolution that pairs well with the speedy performance.\n\nAlso: I tried Asus' dual-screen laptop, and it revitalized my workflow in the best way\n\nSpeaking of performance, let's discuss the tech that powers this device. Asus again focused on balance, pairing the base-level Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor with the 32GB RAM configuration and the slightly faster Snapdragon X Plus with the lower-end, 16GB RAM configuration.\n\nThis balancing act results in a slightly unintuitive pricing structure: the laptop with the higher-end processor is cheaper ($899) as it comes with half the memory (which is what you're really paying for). The version with more RAM and the lower-end Snapdragon X processor starts at $1,099.\n\nThe difference between the two processors is ultimately not that massive, both are eight-core chips, but the Snapdragon X chip is limited to 3.0 GHz clock speed, putting a performance cap on this laptop.\n\nThat cap is fine because this device isn't made to tackle intensive workloads. It's for the modern professional who lives in the cloud, works remotely, and values a nice display.\n\nAlso: This mechanical keyboard I tested works just as well for work as it does for play\n\nThat being said, the performance is solid. It's a fast laptop: it boots quickly, loads apps swiftly, and navigates the web without lag. It runs silent and cool, generating almost no heat -- even with the slim form factor.\n\nIn our benchmarking tests, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processor performed better than I expected against more premium devices with Intel's Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" chip, particularly in its higher-end sibling, the Zenbook S14, and Dell's XPS 13 in multi-core performance. The processor even surpassed the latter in single-core performance.\n\nComparing this laptop's numbers to HP's OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Elite, for example, suggests the device is outclassed at the higher end of performance but is highly optimized for everyday tasks and able to deliver a faster, more efficient experience in those use cases.\n\n\n\nCinebench 24 MC Geekbench 6.2.2 SC Geekbench 6.2.2 MC Zenbook A14 (Snapdragon X) 541 2133 10624 Zenbook S 14 (Intel Lunar Lake) 481 2748 11050 Dell XPS 13 (Intel Lunar Lake) 552 2743 11005 HP Omnibook X (Snapdragon X Elite) 470 2326 13160\n\nThe laptop's strong performance is allied to an enjoyable physical form factor. The keyboard is fantastic -- it's one of the most comfortable laptop keyboards I've used. I make this claim without exaggeration and note its success isn't due to anything particularly expensive or high-end. Asus just hit the mark when balancing design and cost.\n\nAlso: This 13-inch Dell laptop lives rent-free in my head for its brilliant display and battery\n\nThe keys are smooth and matte, with a slick texture that borders on ASMR. I also love how the laptop's ceramic body is fingerprint-resistant and easy to clean, even when splashed in the kitchen or coffee shop.\n\nFor remote or hybrid workers who move from place to place, the laptop also features the right number of ports (an HDMI, two USB-Cs, and one USB-A) to handle whatever accessories you carry in tow or to charge the battery. I'm (sort of) kidding, but that leads me to my last point.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nHands down, the best part of this laptop is the outstanding battery life. Asus advertises up to 32 hours on a single charge. Although that's the top end of the estimation, it's not far off from what you can expect with everyday use. During my testing, a day's work in the office didn't take me down past 50%.\n\nThe Snapdragon X processor reduces power consumption to a trickle when it's not in use. If you do need juice, the A14 charges quickly, reaching close to 75% after just an hour of charging. This capability translates to a laptop that can last a couple of days' work on one charge, even if that includes multiple video calls.\n\nAlso: I tested Asus' 27-inch TV-monitor hybrid for two weeks - and can't stop thinking about it\n\nI'll also mention a few of the drawbacks of this laptop (but there aren't many). The first is that the Qualcomm Adreno GPU on this system is not designed for high-end gaming. Sure, it can certainly handle casual games. But this isn't a device made for the latest FPS.\n\nAlso, the display, while it looks great, is still capped at a 60Hz refresh rate, which keeps the battery (and price point) low but further limits any aspirations of high-end gaming. Ultimately, while the Zenbook A14 is competitively priced, this is not a $1,500 laptop.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe Zenbook A14 has a coherent identity: it's a lightweight, aesthetic machine for the modern professional, effortlessly mobile in both form factor and battery life, but trades some raw power for all that endurance. That being said, the Snapdragon X processor punches well above its weight and competes handily with chips that are, on paper, more powerful.\n\nBecause of its cohesive identity, how well it balances innovation and value, and the hardware performance, the Zenbook A14 is one of the best laptops I've reviewed in the past year and one I'd strongly recommend as long as its strengths align with your needs.\n\nTo top it all off, the starting price of $899 is very competitive -- potentially even disruptive -- if Asus succeeds in selling this laptop's brand story in a way that positions it as an alternative to other ultraportable, such as Apple's MacBook Air.",

            "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Qualcomm (QCOM). Shares have lost about 7.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qualcomm due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nQualcomm Surpasses Q1 Earnings Estimates on Record Revenues\n\nQualcomm Incorporated reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, with adjusted earnings and revenues beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by healthy demand trends in Android handsets and automotive businesses. Both metrics improved year over year, led by the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net income in the December quarter improved to $3.18 billion or $2.83 per share from $2.77 billion or $2.46 per share in the prior-year quarter. The increase was attributable to top-line growth.\n\n\n\nQuarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $3.83 billion or $3.41 per share compared with $3.1 billion or $2.75 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 48 cents.\n\nRevenues\n\nOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal first quarter were record high at $11.67 billion, up from $9.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly revenues beat the consensus mark of $10.89 billion. Qualcomm registered record automotive revenues for the sixth consecutive quarter owing to solid momentum in the Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform. Strength within the handset and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) businesses also buoyed the top line.\n\nSegment Results\n\nQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) were record high at $10.08 billion, up from $8.42 billion a year ago, as strength in the automotive platform and higher demand in handsets, along with normalization of channel inventory within the IoT business, aided the top-line growth. The company witnessed solid market traction in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets.\n\n\n\nAutomotive revenues rose 61% to a record high of $961 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform, with automakers deploying high-performance, low-power computing and connectivity chips to bring next-generation experience to consumers. Handset revenues jumped 13% to an all-time high of $7.57 billion, led by healthy traction in premium Android handsets. IoT revenues were up 36% to $1.55 billion on new product launches and channel inventory normalization. EBT margin for the QCT segment rose to 32% from 31%.\n\n\n\nQualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1.54 billion, up 5% year over year, as it remained the industry's most extensive licensing program of cellular essential patents. EBT margin improved to 75% from 74%.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nQualcomm generated $4.59 billion of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with $2.95 billion a year ago. As of Dec. 29, 2024, the company had $8.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $13.21 billion of long-term debt. The company repurchased 11 million shares for $1.8 billion during the quarter.\n\nQ2 Guidance\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $10.3-$11.5 billion due to market stabilization, recovery in market demand and portfolio strength. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $2.70-$2.90 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $2.38-$2.58 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.45 billion. For QCT, the company anticipates revenues between $8.9 billion and $9.5 billion, with 10% growth in handset revenues, about a 15% rise in IoT and a 50% improvement in automotive revenues.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Qualcomm has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nQualcomm belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Another stock from the same industry, Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY), has gained 1.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended December 2024.\n\nInfineon Technologies reported revenues of $3.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.4%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nInfineon Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -30.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Infineon Technologies. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren\u2019t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

            "content": "Ericsson, Qualcomm Technologies and Thales Alenia Space have partnered on 5G NR non terrestrial networks (NTN) technology since 2022.\n\nThe integration of traditional mobile networks with satellite-based connectivity has taken a step forward, bringing the possibility of seamless global mobile coverage across land and sea closer to reality. Ericsson, Qualcomm Technologies and Thales Alenia Space have demonstrated a 5G standards-based non-terrestrial network (NTN) call using a simulated low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite channel in a French test laboratory.\n\nThis proves that an NR-NTN capable device can maintain uninterrupted mobile connectivity in areas covered by either terrestrial or satellite networks. It means that even in remote locations such as oceans or dense forests\u0097where terrestrial networks cannot reach\u0097devices will still be able to connect without requiring additional satellite equipment like dishes. This achievement paves the way for new applications, including high-definition voice calls and real-time video streaming via satellite connectivity.\n\nThe trial marks a major milestone toward commercialising non-terrestrial networks. The collaboration, which began in 2022, was the world\u0092s first publicly announced 5G NTN project based on 3GPP standards. The partners focused on testing key technical aspects, including managing delays, Doppler effects, and ensuring seamless satellite handovers\u0097critical for maintaining uninterrupted communication in satellite environments.\n\nFredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President and Head of Business Area Networks, at Ericsson, said: \u201cThis successful 5G non-terrestrial network call represents not just a technological breakthrough but also showcases the practical viability of integrating satellite technology within existing terrestrial frameworks. Ericsson is committed to advancing ubiquitous connectivity, and our collaborative effort with Thales Alenia Space and Qualcomm Technologies will help ensure that future communication systems are more inclusive, resilient, and globally accessible. By leveraging NTN technology, we aim to bridge the digital divide and bring reliable communication to every corner of the world.\u201d\n\nJohn Smee, Senior Vice President, Engineering, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., added: \u201cOur collaboration with Ericsson and Thales Alenia Space is crucial in leveraging 3GPP standards for satellite communications, helping to ensure that 5G connectivity is universally accessible to 5G smartphone users. Qualcomm Technologies remains committed to enhancing chipset capabilities that support the seamless integration of 5G non-terrestrial networks and terrestrial networks.\u201d\n\nHerv\u00e9 Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space, stated: \u201cFor years, Thales Alenia Space has been at the heart of all initiatives aimed at seamlessly integrating satellite communications in the 5G network infrastructure \u2013 including standardization with 3GPP \u2013 and takes 5G NTN standardized solutions into account in the design of its satellite payloads supporting either Broadband or Direct-To-Device (D2D) services. By combining Thales Alenia Space\u2019s expertise in space technologies with Ericsson\u2019s leadership in 5G networks and Qualcomm Technologies\u0092 advanced chipsets, we are making significant headway towards the seamless integration of terrestrial and NTN networks, to provide access to 5G services, anywhere and at any time.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Thales Alenia Space remain committed to further refining 5G/6G NTN technologies. Their goal is to scale 5G NTN deployment, enabling a full range of services\u0097including messaging, voice and data\u0097across multi-orbit satellite networks. This innovation will help bridge the digital divide, ensuring reliable mobile connectivity for users everywhere, regardless of location.",

            "content": "In effect, the trial proved that an NR-NTN capable device would never be without mobile coverage where areas are served by either terrestrial or non-terrestrial networks. In other words, if NTN covers an area in the middle of an ocean or deep forest - currently impossible to cover with terrestrial networks - then a device would be able to connect, via mobile connectivity alone, with any other device or service on the mobile network without the need for additional satellite signal receiving equipment, such as a dish.\n\nThe integration of traditional mobile networks with satellite mobile networks - and the related possibility of truly global connectivity across oceans and continents - has moved a step closer following a significant technology achievement by Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC), Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Thales Alenia Space.\n\nSupport applications could include high-definition voice calls and real-time video streaming services.\n\nThe achievement is a significant milestone on the way to non-terrestrial networks becoming a commercial reality. The collaboration launched in 2022 was, at the time, the world\u2019s first publicly announced collaboration for 5G NTN based on 3GPP standards.\n\nFredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President and Head of Business Area Networks, at Ericsson, says: \u201cThis successful 5G non-terrestrial network call represents not just a technological breakthrough but also showcases the practical viability of integrating satellite technology within existing terrestrial frameworks. Ericsson is committed to advancing ubiquitous connectivity, and our collaborative effort with Thales Alenia Space and Qualcomm Technologies will help ensure that future communication systems are more inclusive, resilient, and globally accessible. By leveraging NTN technology, we aim to bridge the digital divide and bring reliable communication to every corner of the world.\u201d\n\nJohn Smee, Senior Vice President, Engineering, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., says: \u201cOur collaboration with Ericsson and Thales Alenia Space is crucial in leveraging 3GPP standards for satellite communications, helping to ensure that 5G connectivity is universally accessible to 5G smartphone users. Qualcomm Technologies remains committed to enhancing chipset capabilities that support the seamless integration of 5G non-terrestrial networks and terrestrial networks.\u201d\n\nHerv\u00e9 Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space, says: \u201cFor years, Thales Alenia Space has been at the heart of all initiatives aimed at seamlessly integrating satellite communications in the 5G network infrastructure - including standardization with 3GPP - and takes 5G NTN standardized solutions into account in the design of its satellite payloads supporting either Broadband or Direct-To-Device (D2D) services. By combining Thales Alenia Space's expertise in space technologies with Ericsson's leadership in 5G networks and Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 advanced chipsets, we are making significant headway towards the seamless integration of terrestrial and NTN networks, to provide access to 5G services, anywhere and at any time.\u201d\n\nEricsson, Qualcomm Technologies, and Thales Alenia Space are committed to further refinement and development of 5G/6G NTN technologies, aiming to introduce and scale 5G NTN on the market and allow for a full set of services \u2013 from multi-orbit satellites including messaging, voice and data, to make seamless communication a reality for everyone, everywhere, and at any time.",

The latest release certainly delivers a large performance gap when compared with Apple\u2019s custom C1 5G modem, which is why Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, Christiano Amon, does not feel threatened by its rival\u2019s efforts. In fact, the Chief Executive states that regarding modems, the San Diego firm will always share some relevance or the other.\n\nNew Snapdragon X85 also claimed to be the first 5G modem that is integrated with heaps of AI, with Qualcomm\u2019s CEO believing that even premium Android devices do not stand a chance\n\nSpeaking with CNBC, Amon believes that the combination of artificial intelligence and raw performance allows the Snapdragon X85 to command a dominating position, creating a delta between Apple\u2019s devices and those running Android. However, Amon has not yet commented on the company\u2019s flagship modem\u2019s efficiency, which is likely what gives the C1 the edge. With Apple\u2019s modem and transceiver are mass produced on TSMC\u2019s 4nm and 7nm technologies, making it one of the reasons Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e is marketed to deliver better battery life than any other 6.1-inch iPhone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first modem that has so much AI, it actually increases the range of performance of the modem so the modem can deal with weaker signals. What that will do will set a huge delta between the performance of premium Android devices, and iOS devices, when you compare what Qualcomm can do versus what Apple is doing.\u201d\n\nQualcomm\u2019s CEO also believes that the company has established such a strong foothold in this category that its name will always carry importance regarding next-generation modems. The firm had estimated to stop supplying Apple with 5G modems in 2027, but Qualcomm likely has a roadmap planned for how it aims to offset those losses. Bear in mind that there is still a massive client list on the Android side that continues to rely on these modems.\n\n\u201cIf modem is relevant there\u2019s always a place for Qualcomm technology. In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that\u2019s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that\u2019s in their hand all the time,\u201d Amon added.\n\nEven if Christiano Amon appears confident in the Snapdragon X85\u2019s capabilities, Apple is already said to be testing the C2, which may bridge that performance gap with Qualcomm\u2019s future high-end offerings.\n\nNews Source: CNBC",

In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, \"It\u2019s the first modem with so much AI.\"Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e . For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.While talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones,At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. \u201cIf modem is relevant there\u2019s always a place for Qualcomm technology,\u201d Amon said.

And I think that\u2019s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that\u2019s in their hand all the time.\u201dModems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors.The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nHow Will Tariffs Affect the Market?\n\nOn March 5th, BBC reported that the US stock market had fallen after the tariffs sparked trade war fear. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has sparked significant concerns about a potential trade war. The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from these countries, with Canadian energy products facing a 10% tariff. On the other hand, tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased from 10% to 20%. As a result, Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of US goods, with plans for additional tariffs on $125 billion in goods over the next three weeks. Moreover, China imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 15% on various US agricultural imports, such as chicken, pork, and soybeans. The tariffs have raised fears of inflation and a broader trade conflict, leading to a decline in US and global stock markets. As a result, the S&P 500 experienced a significant drop, and European markets also closed lower.\n\nToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\n\nWhile talking about how the Fed might react to the tariffs, Fisher mentioned that it is a little too early to guess. The Fed is bringing inflation down and we are getting closer to the 2% target, however, at the same time tariff increases the cost of doing business, which might slow down the economy and tickle up inflation. To conclude Fisher noted that tariffs won\u2019t be digested quickly and will take time.",

Model Fine Tuning\n\nInstructLab allows users to contribute to Large Language Models (LLMs) without needing advanced AI/ML expertise. It overcomes the challenges high entry barriers, simplifying the process of enhancing generative AI. Through community-driven governance and best practices, InstructLab makes model contributions more accessible and supports regular updates to open-source models without full retraining. IBM\u2019s Granite Model Series with lower parameter counts are prime candidates to be used as student models for training and developing the models for edge use cases.\n\nTaxonomy based skill and knowledge representation\n\nThe taxonomy creation process for InstructLab involves structuring skills and knowledge contributions into a hierarchical tree with YAML files at the end nodes. Contributors can define skills (e.g., grounded or ungrounded) by creating a qna.yaml file with examples of questions, answers, and optional contexts, alongside an attribution.txt file citing sources. For knowledge contributions, a repository of Markdown files supports detailed contextual information linked through qna.yaml. The taxonomy leverages synthetic data alignment for Large Language Models (LLMs) and organizes content into cascading directories based on domains and subdomains, ensuring clarity and ease of model tuning.\n\nCheck the GitHub taxonomy repo for information.\n\nSynthetic Data Generation\n\nInstructLab leverages taxonomy-defined skills or knowledge to create datasets using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate synthetic data. Run the ilab data generate command, using GPU acceleration if available, to create synthetic data. The pipeline can be customized to use alternative models or endpoints for generation. The generated dataset is saved in JSONL format within the datasets directory, named skills_train_msgs_.jsonl and knowledge_train_msgs_.jsonl, depending on the type of contribution. Confirm the dataset creation by inspecting the output directory using the ls datasets command.\n\nilab data generate \\ --pipeline full \\ --sdg-scale-factor 100 \\ --endpoint-url http://localhost:8080/v1 \\ --output-dir ./outputdir-watsonxai-endpoint \\ --chunk-word-count 1000 \\ --num-cpus 8 \\ --model ibm/granite-20b-multilingual\n\nFine tune the model\n\nTraining a model using InstructLab involves several customizable options depending on the system and resources available. The process begins by running the ilab model train command within a Python virtual environment. GPU acceleration, , significantly enhances training speed. For advanced workflows, multi-phase training can be used, where the model is trained sequentially on knowledge and skills datasets to optimize performance. Once training is complete, the model can be evaluated to select the best checkpoint and tested to compare performance before and after training.\n\nilab model train \\ --strategy lab-multiphase \\ --phased-phase1-data <knowledge train messages jsonl> \\ --phased-phase2-data <skills train messages jsonl> -y\n\nFor more information on InstructLab, visit this article.\n\nc. Application development\n\nAfter the model is trained and validated on watsonx, the model is published in Qualcomm AI Hub. The model becomes available for the OEM developers to build their custom applications. Qualcomm AI Hub enables you to do the following:\n\nCompile and optimize the pre-trained PyTorch model into a format that can be run on a device\n\nSubmit a profile job to run inference with the compiled model on a real physical device with a Snapdragon or Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 chipset\n\nMeasure on-device model performance Confirm latency and memory are below required targets Get insights on which compute units (NPU, GPU and CPU) the model layers are running on\n\nVerify numerical accuracy of the model with an inference job\n\n3. Lifecycle governance\n\nwatsonx.governance handles lifecycle governance by extending AI best practices from predictive machine learning to generative AI while mitigating risks across models, users, and datasets. It supports responsible AI through explainability, transparency, and compliance with internal and external regulations. Watsonx.governance enables real-time monitoring of model performance and fairness and management of lifecycle metadata for models and templates, ensuring compliance. Monitoring metrics including those for RAG, drift and model performance, while Guardrails restrict outputs of hate speech, aggression and profanity. The AI risk atlas provides educational guidance on potential risks, supporting organizations in creating robust governance frameworks. Governance workflows integrate roles from model development to deployment and monitoring, fostering a structured and responsible AI lifecycle.\n\na. Model evaluation\n\nModel evaluation involves running assessments on prompt templates to ensure performance and compliance. Evaluations can be configured using the wizard or via APIs, where you select dimensions and metrics, adjust settings like sample sizes and thresholds, and provide the test data to map input and expected outputs. Results are reviewed in the Evaluations tab, offering insights into metric scores, threshold violations, and visualizations over time to understand model performance and processing efficiency. This process helps ensure robust and effective model deployments.\n\nb. Continuous compliance\n\nThe Model Risk Governance (MRG) solution, facilitates comprehensive governance across all model types within an organization. It employs object types like Models, Model Groups, Use Cases, and Use Case Reviews to manage compliance, risk ratings, and stakeholder approvals. The dashboard provides a centralized view of compliance status, validation, and risk levels. Workflows automate key governance processes, such as use case approval and model lifecycle management, ensuring thorough oversight from development to deployment. This integrated approach enables continuous compliance and risk management for enterprise AI solutions.\n\nc. Runtime monitoring\n\nModels are monitored in real-time, enabling OEMs to track the performance of their Generative AI applications at the Edge. This monitoring encompasses metrics such as fairness, drift, and answer relevance.\n\nConclusion: a new era of Edge AI\n\nThe collaboration between IBM and Qualcomm Technologies marks a significant milestone in edge AI development.

            "content": "Qualcomm is relying on artificial intelligence to give its modems an edge now that it faces a well-resourced modem competitor as Apple\u2019s C1 modem enters the fray. This may yet prove to be a weak position, given that Apple owns the hardware, software and operating systems inside its systems \u2013 and that its C1 modem also uses AI to optimize connections.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC during the week, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon discussed his company\u2019s all-new X85 modem, which the company claims is, \u201cDesigned for the next generation of connected and AI-enabled applications.\u201d That design leans heavily into artificial intelligence, Amon admitted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first modem that has so much AI, it actually increases the range of performance of the modem so the modem can deal with weaker signals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argues that this component will set itself apart from what Apple delivers.\n\nBut, what if he is wrong?\n\nAfter all, not only will Apple\u2019s modem be better integrated inside Apple hardware, but that integration means the Apple modem can draw on the computational intelligence of the device, rather than relying on its own built in AI.\n\nIn contrast, Qualcomm\u2019s offering will inevitably be less able to access AI support from the chips on the host machines it appears on (as it doesn\u2019t make the host processors), which presumably means it will be reliant on its own AI \u2013 which is unlikely to be as powerful as the host chip.\n\nWithin that, I can see trade-offs in terms of relay speed, component interconnect, and that Qualcomm\u2019s AI is likely to have been trained on a huge stack of incredibly relevant teal-world training data \u2013 so it may yet be better at modeming.\n\nHowever, it is also possible Apple already has useful network data in its own right, collected from iPhone users in normal use in the form of crash and network reports. If it does, then that means it has real world performance data gathered across millions of users across almost two decades with which to train its own AI.\n\nWhich may even the game.\n\nComparing Apple\u2019s with\u2026\n\nAmon believes Qualcomm\u2019s AI-augmented modems will, \u201cset a huge delta between the performance of premium Android devices, and iOS devices, when you compare what Qualcomm can do versus what Apple is doing.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s got good reasons to be cheerful, given that AI needs modems like humans need hearts \u2013 that networked data is the wind under AI\u2019s wings, without it, AI becomes AD (Artificial Dumb).\n\nBut while he seems certain Qualcomm will offer the best available modem, and while Apple has been working on its own for many years before getting there with the C1, I think the real test of modems will come when Apple decides to put it inside its own pro products in or around 2027.\n\nOne year before the first pre-commercial 6G trials are expected to begin. I\u2019ve a feeling all those dates will prove to be more connected than that appear to be.\n\nToday will look different tomorrow\n\n\u201cWe build a platform for generations,\u201d said Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji. \u201cC1 is the start, and we\u2019re going to keep improving that technology each generation, so that it becomes a platform for us that will be used to truly differentiate this technology for our products.\u201d\n\nWatch this space.\n\nYou can follow me on social media!

's $100 billion commitment to expand manufacturing in the U.S. is \"great news,\" Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told CNBC on Tuesday, adding it helps with diversification of chipmaking locations. Amon also addressed U.S President Donald Trump's tariff policy, suggesting longer term technology trends would outweigh any short term uncertainty. Trump announced on Monday that TSMC would invest $100 billion in the U.S. which would go toward building more chip fabrication plants in Arizona. TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer and supplies chips to the likes of Qualcomm, Apple and Nvidia .\n\nThe U.S., under leadership of both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has sought to bring more cutting-edge chip manufacturing to American soil on the grounds that it is a matter of national and economic security to have these advanced technologies made closer to home. Many in the technology industry have backed these plans, including Qualcomm. \"Look, this is great news,\" Amon said. \"It shows that semiconductors are important. It's going to be important for ... the economy. Economic security means access to semiconductors. More manufacturing is music to our ears.\" Amon said that some of Qualcomm's chips are already manufactured in TSMC's existing plants in Arizona and in the future, the company will get more semiconductors made in the U.S. \"TSMC is a great supplier of manufacturing for Qualcomm. They have a facility in Arizona. We already have chips built in Arizona. The more capacity that they put we're going to use it, same way we've been using in Taiwan, we're going to use it in other locations,\" Amon said. Global companies are also digesting the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. on Mexico and Canada as well as additional duties on China.\n\nQualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon speaks at the Computex forum in Taipei, Taiwan, June 3, 2024. Ann Wang | Reuters\n\nAmon said it's currently difficult to predict the impact on Qualcomm from the tariffs. \"It's hard to tell because you don't know exactly how this is going to go. The interesting thing is we're big\n\nexporters of chips. We're not an importer of chips ... Chips are going to devices. They're made all over the world, and it's hard to really know what is happening,\" Amon said. \"We're just is going to navigate based on whatever the outcome is.\" The Qualcomm CEO said there are a number of key technology trends that are likely to support the U.S. giant's business in the long term, over the short term tariff uncertainty. We are right at the \"beginning of a significant upgrade for AI smartphones. We're seeing PCs changing to AI PCs. Cars are becoming computers. That's what's driving our business, not necessarily what we're going to see in the short term,\" Amon said.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other AI news and ratings you probably missed.\n\nAccording to a February research report by Precedence Research, the global AI market is projected to grow from $757.58 billion in 2025 to approximately $3.68 trillion by 2034, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.20%. North America led the market in 2024 with valuations of $235.63 billion, while the Asia Pacific region is expected to see the highest growth rate at nearly 20% during the forecast period.\n\nThe U.S. market alone is expected to expand from $146.09 billion in 2024 to $851.46 billion by 2034, growing at a 19.33% CAGR. Some major factors driving AI adoption include increased investment in research, the need for automation across industries, and favorable government initiatives. The report states that major tech companies are accelerating AI advancements, while industries like healthcare, automotive, and financial services are integrating AI to improve operations. Furthermore, the banking, financial services, and insurance sectors are experiencing a surge in AI adoption for fraud detection, data analytics, and cybersecurity.\n\nHardware-based AI solutions are emerging to improve efficiency, with companies like IBM and Intel developing AI chipsets, the report states. Meanwhile, regulatory changes, such as the European Union\u2019s data protection laws and FDA approvals for AI-based healthcare solutions, are shaping the industry.\n\nAI Investment Shifts Toward Monetization and Sustainability\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Rahul Ghosh of T. Rowe Price showed optimism about AI but acknowledged that capital expenditure growth is slowing. While hyperscalers are still increasing their AI-related investments, the projected 44-45% growth for 2025 is far lower than the triple-digit increases seen in recent years. An important concern is how much of this spending is supported by free cash flow compared to leverage, as excessive borrowing could raise sustainability risks. The market focus has shifted from general AI adoption to monetization, with analysts and investors assessing which companies are truly profiting from AI. Large internet and e-commerce firms, especially in the U.S. and China, are leading in AI-driven revenue generation. While major tech players currently dominate the market, Ghosh sees opportunities for smaller AI models that could power new consumer applications.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\n\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\n\nNed Davis\u2019s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n\n\u201cOne would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. \u2026 As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.",

            "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned -9.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has lost 14.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share, indicating a change of +14.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 points to a change of +15.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.44 indicates a change of +5.8% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $10.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.8%. The $42.92 billion and $44.5 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.2% and +3.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $11.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.5%. EPS of $3.41 for the same period compares with $2.75 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.87%. The EPS surprise was +16.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nQualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nOnly $1 to See All Zacks' Buys and Sells\n\nWe're not kidding.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

With a market cap of $173.8 billion, the company develops and delivers digital wireless communications products and services based on CDMA digital technology.\n\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \u201clarge-cap stocks,\u201d and QCOM perfectly fits that description, with its market cap exceeding this mark, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the semiconductors industry. QCOM is a standout player in wireless technology, known for its pivotal role in developing essential patents for 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. With its strong intellectual property portfolio, QCOM has a competitive edge in the market. The company's Snapdragon processors are highly regarded for their performance and are widely used in top-tier smartphones, solidifying its position as a leading supplier of advanced processors.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nDespite its notable strength, QCOM slipped 31.9% from its 52-week high of $230.63, achieved on Jun. 18, 2024. Over the past three months, QCOM stock gained marginally, outperforming the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 2.6% losses during the same time frame.\n\nIn the longer term, shares of QCOM climbed 2.3% on a YTD basis, outperforming XLK\u2019s 3% dip over the same time frame. However, QCOM rose marginally over the past 52 weeks, underperforming XLK\u2019s 10.2% returns over the last year.\n\nTo confirm the bearish trend, QCOM has been trading below its 50-day moving average since late February. It is trading below its 200-day moving average since August 2024, with some fluctuations.\n\nQCOM is facing challenges as Apple Inc. (AAPL) shifts away from using its patents, developing its own baseband chips. Additionally, pricing pressures and supply chain constraints have affected its performance.\n\nOn Feb. 5, QCOM shares closed up more than 1% after reporting its Q1 results. Its adjusted EPS of $3.41 beat Wall Street expectations of $2.93. The company\u2019s adjusted revenue was $11.7 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $10.9 billion. For Q2, QCOM expects its adjusted EPS to range from $2.70 to $2.90, and expects adjusted revenue to be between $10.2 billion and $11 billion.\n\nIn the competitive arena of semiconductors, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has taken the lead over QCOM, showing resilience with a 54.7% uptick over the past 52 weeks. However, AVGO has lagged behind the stock with a 14% loss on a YTD basis.\n\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish on QCOM\u2019s prospects. The stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating from the 32 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $201.44 suggests an potential upside of 28.2% from current price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

Now, according to a report by the German media outlet WinFuture, it is claimed that Qualcomm's desktop CPUs, coming under the Snapdragon X2 lineup, are said to feature up to 18 Oryon V3 cores and interestingly, will come with a SiP (System-in-Package) configuration showing that the San Diego chipmaker will indeed have a distinctive implementation.\n\nQualcomm has been preparing a desktop CPU lineup in the past, categorized under \"Project Glymur.\" Based on newer information, Qualcomm is expected to go big with CPU core count, which means that the chip will be far more powerful than what the company's laptop processors offer. Apart from this, the most exciting part is that Qualcomm seems to employ SSD and memory components in a single package, although we are unaware of how that would work out.\n\nThe closest SiP implementation we have seen in the industry is AMD and their 3D V-Cache CPUs, where Team Red managed to mount a large L3 cache memory die directly on top of the CPU die. The report says that Qualcomm is testing out a CPU with 48 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD directly on the CPU package instead of standalone components. While this might improve performance and thermal management, manufacturing complexities will be a big concern in this implementation; hence, it would be interesting to see how this works out.\n\nIn a previous coverage, we reported on how Qualcomm is testing out their Snapdragon X2 desktop CPUs with a dedicated AIO, confirming the company's ambitions. Moreover, it is said that the lineup has a \"premium\" segment as well, reportedly called \"Snapdragon X2 Ultra Premium\", suggesting that Qualcomm plans an extensive release, covering widespread market segments.

Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year.\n\nMarkets to Broaden Out in 2025, Says BofA\n\nAs per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector.\n\nAs per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his \u201cbase case.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nBlackRock Remains Overweight on US Stocks\n\nBlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024.\n\nOverall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm\u2019s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view.",

            "content": "Ericsson Press Release | Mar. 3, 2025\n\nIn a groundbreaking milestone, Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. have successfully conducted an interoperability device test on a frequency band dedicated to 5G railway communications in Europe. This achievement underscores the importance of ecosystem support and highlights ongoing efforts to advance the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS).\n\nThe two companies utilized a mobile test platform powered by the Qualcomm\u00ae X85 5G Modem-RF over the n101, 10MHz-wide band using a specifically designed Ericsson radio prototype. The n101 TDD (time division duplex) band \u2013 or the 1900-1910 MHz band \u2013 is dedicated to 5G railway communications in Europe. This is the first time a FRMCS 1900MHz 5G radio has been tried with a unique 10MHz TDD channel bandwidth and a special TDD uplink balanced frame structure, specifically selected for railways.\n\nThe pioneering device testing of a n101-capable chipset at 1900 MHz is a crucial step in the development of FRMCS device radio modules and detailed planning of FRMCS trials. It marks a major leap forward in the journey towards FRMCS using 5G in the European Union (EU).\n\nFRMCS is an international standard for 5G-based railway communication systems. With the Global System for Mobile Communications \u2013 Railway (GSM-R) being phased out by 2030, FRMCS is poised to become the 5G-based connectivity framework for railway systems.

Qualcomm announced the technology in October 2023, and this is the first hardware to launch.\n\nThe Buds 5 Pro were announced in China on Thursday, alongside the 15 Ultra phone, which is also launching in Europe. They come in two versions: a regular Bluetooth model and a Wi-Fi version that uses Qualcomm\u2019s Expanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) tech to deliver 96kHz/24bit lossless audio at a bandwidth of up to 4.2Mbps, superior to anything you can get over Bluetooth. You\u2019ll also be able to walk away from your phone without the connection deteriorating, so long as you stay within the range of your Wi-Fi network.\n\nThere are caveats. The obvious one is that you\u2019ll need to be on Wi-Fi, so you\u2019re only likely to get the benefits of better audio on your home network. When it announced XPAN in 2023, Qualcomm told The Verge that your phone will pass over Wi-Fi credentials during pairing, but we don\u2019t yet know whether the buds can handle connections to multiple networks so that they work in the office, too. Still, whenever Wi-Fi is unavailable, the buds can always fall back on Bluetooth.\n\nFor now, these buds are only compatible with the Xiaomi 15 and 15 Ultra. That may change eventually, but hardware limitations mean they could only ever work with phones featuring a compatible Qualcomm flagship chipset, such as the 8 Gen 3 or 8 Elite. That rules out ever using these over Wi-Fi with any iPhone or other Apple tech.\n\nThe 10-hour battery life on the buds (with up to 40 including the case) is better than the eight hours of the Bluetooth model, backing up Qualcomm\u2019s claim that it can deliver lossless Wi-Fi audio at the same power consumption as Bluetooth.\n\nAudio comes from a triple-driver system, with an 11mm main driver backed up by a PZT tweeter and planar driver. There\u2019s support for active noise cancellation and an array of AI features built in, including call recording, transcription, and translation.\n\nThe Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi are available for \u00a3189.99 (around $240) and only come in black. They cost a little more than the \u00a3159.99 (around $200) Bluetooth-only version, available in white or gray.",

            "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date, which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least one business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase QUALCOMM's shares on or after the 6th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.85 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.40 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that QUALCOMM has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of US$157.17. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether QUALCOMM's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether QUALCOMM can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nSee our latest analysis for QUALCOMM\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. QUALCOMM paid out a comfortable 36% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 29% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's positive to see that QUALCOMM's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNasdaqGS:QCOM Historic Dividend March 1st 2025\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see QUALCOMM has grown its earnings rapidly, up 21% a year for the past five years. QUALCOMM is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.",

By the time the second-generation C-series 5G modem chip is ready to be used in a complete premium iPhone flagship series, it will be the iPhone 18 line to be released in 2027. Apple hoped to have improved the component by then so that it would be faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 5G modem chip it had been using on the iPhone.\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone 16e , using the C1 5G modem chip, was 40% faster on Speedtest.net than the\n\nBut as it turns out, Apple might not have to wait until 2027 to beat the Snapdragon 5G modem in a foot race. A YouTube content creator who goes by the name Dave2D posted a video showing that the, using the C1 5G modem chip, was 40% faster on Speedtest.net than the iPhone 16 Pro Max outfitted with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 5G modem chip. The downlink speeds were 213.84Mbps and 152.77 for the Apple C1 5G modem chip and Qualcomm Snapdragon X71 5G modem chip respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple's in-house 5G modem was faster than Qualcomm's 5G modem even though the C1 does not include support for the fastest mmWave 5G networks. Apple did this to save some money and also because most U.S. wireless users never get the opportunity to connect to a mmWave network because these signals travel over limited distances compared to mid-band and low-band networks.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest iOS news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, while both phones were most likely connected to sub-6GHz 5G networks, had the pair been hooked up to a mmWave network, only the iPhone 16 Pro Max would have been able to support the faster downlink speeds that are obtainable with mmWave support. It should be noted that both phones were running on the Bell Network.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne theory is that the C1 was able to outperform the Snapdragon X71 because of the area where Dave2D performed the test which was in Toronto, Canada. As Dave2D points out, being a major city, there are cell towers everywhere in Toronto which he says makes testing Apple's in-house mode less challenging for the C1. Had the test been conducted in a region where 5G towers are harder to find, we might have seen different results with the Snapdragon X71 5G modem coming out ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Apple was able to develop chips that were both faster and more efficient than the Intel processors they replaced, all in an under 3 year transition.\n\nNow, Apple is trying to replace Qualcomm, starting off with the new C1 modem in the brand new iPhone 16e, it\u2019s the first step in a much larger journey. In the end, Apple wants all networking to be handled in-house.\n\nFuture C2 and C3 modems\n\nApple\u2019s first C1 modem, which debuted in iPhone 16e last month, is more focused on efficiency. It doesn\u2019t support 5G mmWave, and doesn\u2019t support all of the same wavelengths as the existing Qualcomm modems. It\u2019s still pretty performant according to tests, but it isn\u2019t the best of the best.\n\nThat\u2019s why this C1 modem isn\u2019t making its way to most of the iPhone 17 lineup, though it will likely appear in the iPhone 17 Air \u2013 where its efficiency gains will be important for such a thin form factor. Apple referred to C1 as \u201cthe most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Apple is already working on future generation 5G modems. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple intends to fully replace Qualcomm within two generations.\n\nThe C2 modem, codenamed Ganymede, will debut in the iPhone 18 lineup in 2026 \u2013 as well as future iPad models in 2027. According to Gurman, these modems will be on-par with Qualcomm:\n\nThe big difference is that Ganymede will catch up to current Qualcomm modems by adding support for mmWave, download speeds of 6 gigabits per second, six-carrier aggregation when using Sub-6, and eight-carrier aggregation when using mmWave.\n\nAfterwards, Apple will debut C3 in 2027, codenamed Prometheus, alongside the iPhone 19 lineup. This modem will completely surpass Qualcomm:\n\nIn 2027, Apple aims to roll out its third modem, code-named Prometheus. The company hopes to top Qualcomm with that component\u2019s performance and artificial intelligence features by that point. It will also build in support for next-generation satellite networks.\n\nAmid all of these plans, Apple is also considering bringing cellular support to MacBooks, as soon as 2026. This would of course be thanks to its new in-house modems.\n\nNew Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip\n\nOn top of replacing Qualcomm\u2019s cellular modems, Apple also wants to replace Broadcom\u2019s networking chips. Despite being a relatively new rumor, this new networking chip will debut as soon as this year.\n\nThis networking chip, codenamed Proxima, is expected to debut in refreshed versions of the HomePod mini and Apple TV later this year, per Gurman. The chip will support the Wi-Fi 6E standard, and has a theoretical capability of serving as a Wi-Fi router. Gurman also said it\u2019ll debut in some iPhone models this year, and some iPad and Mac models in 2026.\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo has taken this a step further, and stated that the Apple networking chip will actually debut in the entire iPhone 17 lineup later this year, rather than just the iPhone 17 Air. Kuo states that this will \u201cenhance connectivity across Apple devices,\u201d as well as reduce cost.\n\nModem integration with main chipset\n\nAfter Apple is done with its modem transition, it\u2019s also considering integrating its cellular modems inside of the main Apple Silicon chipset. Rather than an A18 chip and a separate C1 chip, it\u2019d all be one package.\n\nAccording to Gurman, this feat won\u2019t happen until 2028 at the earliest. Nonetheless, its on the table, and apparently provides a number of cost and efficiency benefits.\n\nMy favorite iPhone accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

Interestingly, he added, \u201cYou know, obviously we have plans,\u201d hinting at the possibility of bringing an Nvidia ARM CPU to the consumer PC market. However, he tempered expectations by saying that he would \u201cwait to tell you\u201d about Nvidia\u2019s upcoming ARM CPU for Windows.\n\nIn his address to the media, Jensen also suggested that MediaTek may bring the PC chipset on its own. Huang added, \u201cNow they could provide that to us, and they could keep that for themselves and serve the market. And so it was a great win-win.\u201d\n\nThe Curious Case of Nvidia N1X and N1 ARM-based PC Chipsets\n\nJust before CES 2025, X user @QQ_Timmy shared a post saying that Nvidia is actively advancing its Windows on ARM (WoA) initiative. The user mentioned that the high-end \u201cN1X\u201d and mid-range \u201cN1\u201d chipsets from Nvidia have been developed in collaboration with MediaTek.\n\nNot only that, the user mentioned that device makers might launch Windows laptops with Nvidia\u2019s ARM-based chipsets at Computex in May 2025.\n\nAlso Read: Snapdragon X Elite Can Redefine the Future of Windows Computing\n\nLater, @_h0x0d_ on X revealed an unknown platform code called \u201cN1X\u201d for Lenovo\u2019s upcoming Yoga 2-in-1 16 2025 laptop. Lenovo generally adds \u201cA\u201d for AMD before the platform code, \u201cI\u201d for Intel, and \u201cQ\u201d for Qualcomm chips. The new \u201cN1X\u201d platform code likely refers to Nvidia\u2019s upcoming ARM-based PC chipset.\n\nNvidia N1X Leaked Geekbench Score\n\nThe Nvidia N1X chipset has surfaced on Geekbench with an early test run. X user Jukanlosreve has shared a screenshot of Nvidia N1X running on Windows 11 with 16GB of RAM. That said, it only features four Arm Cortex-A725 CPU cores. Nvidia N1X achieved 1,169 in single-core and 2,417 in multi-core in the Geekbench 6.4.0 test. This is an early result, and we expect Nvidia N1X to feature a total of 8 or 12 CPU cores.\n\nImage Credit: Jukanlosreve via X\n\nGiven the recent leaks and the Microsoft-Qualcomm exclusivity agreement coming to an end, it appears Nvidia is set to enter the Windows PC market pretty soon. Leaks suggest that PC makers may unveil Windows laptops with Nvidia\u2019s ARM CPU at Computex in May 2025, and these retail devices may ship by September 2025.\n\nNvidia has expertise in GPUs and Tensor cores and has worked with ARM CPUs in the past. The company has already developed the ARM-based Grace CPU for data centers. Not to forget, Nvidia has previously built ARM-based Tegra series processors for multimedia devices and gaming consoles.\n\nNow, with the latest MediaTek partnership, can Nvidia outperform Qualcomm (or Apple) in CPU performance and efficiency, especially with vanilla ARM CPU cores? I pose this question because Qualcomm\u2019s next-gen Snapdragon X2 Elite is set to feature 3rd-gen Oryon CPU cores, promising a generational leap in performance and efficiency.\n\nWhatever the case, it looks like 2025 is going to be another exciting year for Windows laptops. Besides established players like Intel and AMD, new entrants such as Qualcomm, Nvidia, and MediaTek may bring fresh innovations and improve the Windows experience overall.",

Market factors, such as the Nasdaq's 5.5% monthly decline during February amid broader tech sell-offs, likely influenced this price movement. Furthermore, investor activism, including a proposal by As You Sow regarding high-carbon investments, adds layers of scrutiny that might impact investor sentiment.

This collaboration is a huge step forward in the mobile industry, offering consumers more value by keeping their devices secure and up-to-date for far longer than what was previously the norm.\n\nThe initiative kicks off with smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform, which will launch alongside Android 15. These devices will receive not only Android OS and kernel upgrades but also vital security patches. Qualcomm has also revealed plans to expand this support to devices powered by the upcoming Snapdragon 8 and 7-series mobile platforms, which will debut later this year. This marks the longest software support Qualcomm has ever provided, a significant improvement over previous offerings.\n\nThe new promise from Qualcomm and Google is a great thing, but not everyone will benefithttps://t.co/IkGdqrdut0\u2014 Android Central (@androidcentral) February 26, 2025\n\nThis extended update period is in direct response to growing consumer demand for smartphones that last longer. With phones becoming such an essential part of daily life, many users now expect their devices to serve them for several years. This initiative is designed to meet those expectations while also addressing the increasing concerns over cybersecurity. With longer software support, even older devices will continue to get important security updates, helping to safeguard users from new threats.\n\nOne of the key factors behind this program is the use of advancements in Android architecture, particularly \"Project Treble.\" This innovation makes it easier to roll out updates without requiring extensive changes to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code. It\u2019s a more cost-effective solution for device makers, allowing them to provide timely updates without the added expense. For consumers, this means their phones can stay secure and functional for much longer.\n\nThe program\u2019s key features include eight years of security updates and two Android Common Kernel (ACK) upgrades, both of which are crucial for maintaining security and ensuring compatibility with newer software. These updates will help keep older devices safe and running smoothly, even as they age.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that while Qualcomm is providing the support framework, the decision to offer the full eight years of updates is ultimately up to the device manufacturer. OEMs will decide which devices will receive the extended support, so not all Snapdragon-powered smartphones will automatically qualify for the full update cycle.\n\nGoogle and Qualcomm\u2019s collaboration is a major milestone in extending the life of smartphones and responding to the increasing demand for more sustainable, secure devices. Offering up to eight years of updates, this initiative is set to reshape how we think about smartphone longevity, ensuring users can enjoy a longer and safer mobile experience.\n\nSEE ALSO: Pixel 9a Unveiled In Leaked Video; First Look At Specs And Features",

            "content": "Chip designer Arm has a new edge AI platform optimized for the Internet of Things (IoT) that expands the size of AI models that can run on edge devices, includes a powerful new CPU, and enables developers to integrate more easily with popular AI frameworks.\n\nIt\u2019s the first such platform based on the company\u2019s v9 architecture and boasts numbers such as an eight-fold improvement in machine learning performance over Arm\u2019s previous platform and a 70% improvement in IoT performance.\n\nArm\u2019s new platform marks at least the third move by a chip player this week to expand their presence at the edge, where the push is on to bring as much compute power, AI capabilities, data processing and analysis tools, and security features to where much of the data today is being created.\n\n\u201cWe can only realize the potential of AI if we move it to the physical devices and the environments that surround us,\u201d Paul Williamson, senior vice president and general manager of Arm\u2019s IoT line of business, told journalists. \u201cIn the world of IoT, it\u2019s AI at the edge that matters most. Just a few years ago, edge AI workloads were much simpler than today. For example, they were focused on basic noise reduction or anomaly detection. But now the workloads have become much more complex and they\u2019re trying to meet the demands of much more sophisticated use cases.\u201d\n\nGetting Crowded at the Edge\n\nIntel this week introduced the latest additions to its Xeon 6 processor lineup, including a system-on-a-chip (SoC) aimed at AI workloads at the edge and in networks and featuring integrated acceleration, connectivity, and security technologies to enable more workloads to run on fewer, smaller systems.\n\nFor its part, Qualcomm, known for its Snapdragon line of power-efficient chips for smartphones and PCs, introduced a new product brand portfolio \u2014 Dragonwing \u2014 for industrial and embedded IoT, networking, and cellular use cases ranging from energy and utilities to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications and supply chain.\n\n\u201cLeading edge AI, high-performance, low-power computing and unrivaled connectivity are built into custom hardware, software and service offerings designed for speed, scalability and reliability,\u201d Don McGuire, senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Qualcomm, wrote in a blog post.\n\nMuch of this is driven by the enterprise adoption of the edge and IoT, connected devices that can range from massive industrial systems on manufacturing floors and smaller servers on distant oil rigs to autonomous vehicles, small sensors on windmills, and everything in between. And their numbers are growing, from 18 billion last year to 39.6 billion by 2033, according to one estimate.\n\nPowerful and Power-Efficient\n\nChip makers are building more powerful \u2014 and power-efficient \u2014 CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs (neural processing units) to run in small and more capable systems from hardware makers to meet the rapidly growing demand for more compute, data processing, and security capabilities where the data is being created to reduce the latency and costs that come with sending massive amounts of data to the cloud. Now AI models and workloads are making their way to the edge, and all this is driving developers to develop AI and other software for the edge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the need for higher performance and better efficiency to run the latest AI models, frameworks, and agents,\u201d Arm\u2019s Williamson said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the need for improved security to protect the high-value software surrounding those. And we\u2019re seeing the need for developers to be able to update, refine, upgrade their software once it\u2019s been deployed in the field.\u201d\n\nIn use cases like industrial automation, smart cities, smart homes, \u201cthe value of AI inferencing at the edge is becoming more and more evident,\u201d he said.\n\nEnter the New Cortex-320 CPU\n\nArm\u2019s new v9 platform is designed to address much of that, creating the capability to run AI models with over 1 billion parameters on a device. It includes the designer\u2019s new highly efficient Cortex-A320 CPU and Ethos-U85 edge accelerator and performance-enhancing tools like Scalar Vector Extension (SVE) 2 for machine learning jobs, support for BFloat16 for new data types, and Matrix Multiply Instructions for more efficient AI processing.\n\nThe Armv9.2 architecture also better addresses security issues key to computing at the edge. Features include Pointer Authentication (PAC), Branch Target Identification (BTI) and Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) that enable more memory safety, control-flow integrity, and software isolation.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an incremental step forward,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt represents a fundamental shift in how we\u2019re approaching edge computing and AI processing. We believe it\u2019s going to drive forward that edge AI revolution for years to come.\u201d\n\nTaking a More Direct Route\n\nA key is that the latest platform removes the need for a microcontroller, he said, adding that the solution last year \u201cfocused on transforming network execution. This year, we\u2019ve taken Ethos-U85 and we\u2019ve updated the drive so that it can be driven directly by a Cortex-A320 without the need of a Cortex-M in the loop. This will improve latency and allow Arm\u2019s partners to remove the cost and complexity of using these separate controllers to drive the NPU.\u201d\n\nMemory is also a key improvement, with the Cortex-A320 adding support for larger addressable memory than Cortex-M platforms. The CPU is also more flexible at handling multiple tiers of memory access latency, enabling the platform to handle edge AI use cases that have larger neural networks and need software flexibility.\n\n\u201cThe continued demand for hardware to efficiently execute larger and multi-model networks is pushing memory size requirements, so systems with better memory access performance are becoming really necessary to perform these more complex use cases,\u201d he said.\n\nDevelopers Get Options\n\nFor software developers, flexibility is the word. Arm for years has been building IoT development platforms, continuing that last year with the introduction of Kleidi aimed at accelerating AI development with Arm\u2019s CPU architecture. The first offerings through the program were KleidiAI libraries for AI frameworks and KleidiCV for computer vision jobs. With the v9 platform comes Kleidi for IoT. KleidiAI already is integrated into IoT frameworks like Llama.ccp and ExecuTorch to speed up the performance of models like Meta\u2019s Llama and Microsoft\u2019s Phi-3.\n\nIt delivers as much as 70% improvement to the Cortex-320 when running Microsoft\u2019s Tiny Stories dataset on Llama.ccp, according to Arm.\n\nIn addition, Cortex-A320 can run applications that use real-time operating systems, like Free RTOS and Zephyr, Williamson said. That said, through Arm\u2019s A-Profile architecture there also is out-of-the-box support for Linux and portability capabilities for Android and other rich Oses.\n\n\u201cThis brings unprecedented levels of flexibility and allows you to target multiple market segments, applications, or operating system offerings that our partners provide and gives you superb choice when you\u2019re thinking about roadmaps for future products,\u201d he said. \u201cFor developers working on Linux, they can easily and quickly deploy that rich operating system on the A320. That\u2019s going to save them time, money and effort, leading to faster time-to-market for them and their products.\u201d\n\nDevelopers can take PyTorch applications at high-level environments and deploy them at the edge via the accelerations in the Cortex-A320 CPU.\n\n\u201cWe also allowed, with the implementation of the direct connect of the neural processor to the A-Class core, the ability for them for the first time to directly address the same memory system as the AI accelerator for these sorts of always-on tasks, which will make that development easier as well,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nWith all that, \u201cyou will see some interesting, completely new configurations from people stretching the boundary of what would have previously been done in a microcontroller but also giving Linux-based developers optimized performance,\u201d he said.\n\nTRENDING STORIES",

            "content": "Remember when you would load videos or websites on your phone and it would take forever? Videos would constantly buffer, and loading websites felt like watching paint dry. Thankfully, we no longer have to live like savages, thanks to 5G wireless technology that makes everything feel so zippy. Thanks to Qualcomm, who are already developing 6G wireless technologies, we will be looking at 5G in our rearview mirror.\n\nThe problem with 5G\n\nAt MWC Barcelona 2025, chipset maker Qualcomm revealed the first real steps toward making 6G a reality. While it won\u2019t be available for a few more years, the foundation is already being laid.\n\nRight now, 5G has become the new standard of mobile connectivity. It is a massive upgrade from 4G LTE\u2014allowing for faster internet, clearer video calls, and smoother online gaming. Is it perfect? Hardly. 5G coverage still has a long way to go, especially in more remote locations. 5G also suffers from network congestion\u2014ever tried getting a strong 5G connection while in a crowded stadium? We think not. Then, there is the issue of limited bandwidth.\n\nThese problems are only going to exacerbate the more we use high bandwidth applications, such as AI, cloud gaming, and VR/AR. However, these are issues Qualcomm wants to solve by developing standardized 6G technologies, which the company is doing this year.\n\nQualcomm dreams of 6G\n\nOne of the changes from 5G is that AI will be integrated into 6G across multiple layers of the network.\n\nWe know it sounds like Qualcomm is crossing off a lot of industry buzzwords, but there\u2019s a real use to it. Right now, networks are fixed\u2014they broadcast signals at set power levels, regardless of how many people are using them. With AI, 6G will be able to adjust in real time, ensuring that you always get the best signal possible.\n\nQualcomm also imagines AI being used in \u201cdigital twins\u201d 6G networks. \u201cDigital twins\u201d are virtual models of real-world networks. 6G\u2019s AI will do the same for wireless networks, preventing issues like slow speeds or dropped connections before you even notice them by predicting and anticipating them as they come.\n\nSo, what does all of this mean for the end user like yourself? It means we can look forward to faster and smoother internet streams. No more interruptions, lag that feels imperceptible, and even potentially better battery life on your mobile devices. Since AI will optimize network efficiency, your phone won\u2019t waste power searching for signals.\n\nBut don\u2019t hold your breath just yet. It will take a while before 6G becomes as ubiquitous as 5G. Countries like South Korea are predicting that it will launch 6G only in 2028, but it\u2019s good to see that companies like Qualcomm are wasting no time working on it.",

However, the appeals court ruled that the district court was correct in rejecting these claims.\n\nPer Bloomberg, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling pointed to similarities between the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and those made in an earlier Federal Trade Commission (FTC) case against Qualcomm. The FTC had previously accused the company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior through its licensing policies and exclusive agreements with major device manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung. The consumer plaintiffs\u2019 claims largely mirrored those in the FTC case, which was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nRelated: Qualcomm Secures Partial Victory in Licensing Dispute with Arm, Jury Splits on Key Issues\n\nJudge Ryan D. Nelson, writing for the panel, stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims failed for many of the same reasons as the FTC\u2019s allegations. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the district court\u2019s partial dismissal and partial summary judgment in favor of Qualcomm, though it did vacate a portion of the ruling.\n\nThis decision reinforces Qualcomm\u2019s long-standing position that its licensing and sales practices comply with antitrust laws. While critics have argued that the company\u2019s policies stifle competition, courts have consistently sided with the chipmaker in recent legal battles.\n\nThe ruling represents another setback for consumer plaintiffs seeking to challenge Qualcomm\u2019s business model under state and federal antitrust laws.\n\nSource: Bloomberg",

            "content": "It seems manufacturers are finally getting the message that people want to use their kit for longer without security issues, as Qualcomm has said it'll provide Android software updates, including vulnerability fixes, for its latest chipsets for eight years instead of four.\n\nLack of support for older kit has been a huge pain for those who are happy with non-cutting-edge hardware that works well enough, but still want security patches and other bug fixes and aren't too fussed about new functionality. Now Qualcomm, which provides chips for most of the major Android smartphone makers, is doubling down, perhaps recognizing that we all live in thriftier times. Or we're tired of devices being menaced by security holes.\n\n\"Qualcomm Technologies is excited to take this step forward, working closely with Google to facilitate the latest Android OS upgrades on devices with Snapdragon,\" said Chris Patrick, GM of mobile handsets at the chip biz, this week.\n\n\"With this advancement, we are raising the bar, providing more flexibility for our OEMs and ultimately enhancing user experiences. We\u2019re excited to see more OEM devices that support Android OS longevity soon.\"\n\nThere are, as ever, some terms and conditions. The eight-year pledge only applies to devices using Arm-compatible Snapdragon 8 Elite silicon and running Android 15, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 that The Register had a play with last month. Future iterations of the Snapdragon 8 and 7-series that'll ship later this year will also be covered by the new arrangement.\n\nAlso, it's very much down to who you buy from. Qualcomm will make Android software updates available, but it's down to device makers to actually follow through and push these patches to people's handsets. However, \"Qualcomm Technologies is already seeing commitments from OEMs to keep their devices available to consumers for longer,\" the US silicon shifter said.\n\nAs even a cursory look at the monthly Android patch releases shows, Qualcomm does a lot of fixing up. And while Google is now using its own Tensor processor silicon (supported by the web giant for seven years) for the latest in the Pixel smartphone line, it still uses a lot of Qualcomm components, meaning future Google devices will benefit from the eight-year promise.\n\n\"Qualcomm Technologies' efforts to extend the lifespan of Android devices are a key step for increasing the longevity of smartphones,\" said Seang Chau, GM of Android Platform. \"Through this collaboration, OEMs can more seamlessly update the software and security on their devices, ensuring a more secure and long-lasting Android experience for our users.\"\n\nIt's good news for other manufacturers, such as Samsung and OnePlus, who update the software for their Android-powered offerings regularly, as Qualcomm says it will provide them \"two upgrades to the mobile platform\u2019s Android Common Kernel (ACK) to support the eight-year window.\"\n\n\"The kernel is the core of every OS, and these ACK kernel upgrades for Android OS will allow OEMs to provide security for their devices longer,\" Qualy added. It'll also put pressure on those manufacturers who have been tardy with updates - we're looking at you Sony, with just two years of support on some handsets. \u00ae",

Qualcomm announced on Monday that \u201cup to eight consecutive years of software and security updates\u201d will be available to Android phones running on future Snapdragon 8 and Snapdragon 7-series chips.\n\nAs Android specialist Mishall Rahman points out, the \u201ceight consecutive years\u201d is a little misleading here because Qualcomm includes the year on which a device is released. That means the device can be supported for eight years, but receive seven years of Android version upgrades \u2014 bringing more Android phones in line with the seven years of support provided on Google\u2019s Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 lineup.\n\nQualcomm mentioned its support expansion plans in October, which started with devices running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform. That includes the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Xiaomi 15 Series, OnePlus 13, and Asus ROG Phone 9.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement extends that service to additional chipsets, but it\u2019s important to note that eligible phones aren\u2019t guaranteed to receive expanded support updates. This update makes it easier and more affordable for phone manufacturers to provide users with longer support, but Qualcomm says that it\u2019s ultimately up to device makers to decide whether they offer it on specific phone models.\n\n\u201cSupport for platform software included in this program will be made available to OEMs for eight consecutive years, including both Android OS and kernel upgrades, without requiring significant changes or upgrades to the platform and OEM code on the device,\u201d Qualcomm said.\n\nPhones running older Snapdragon chips won\u2019t be eligible for future support upgrades according to Qualcomm. The biggest caveat to all this beyond hoping device makers actually implement the expanded support update is that very few phones are likely to keep running for the full eight years. But if you\u2019re committed to reducing e-waste and continually repairing your Android phone, at least the option will be there.",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "It\u2019s been a season of upheaval on and off the pitch at Old Trafford. But for tech giant Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon brand adorns the club\u2019s shirts, investment in the club is paying off.\n\nWhen Qualcomm signed a $225m front-of-shirt sponsorship deal with Manchester United, the move raised eyebrows. The semiconductor giant \u2013 better known for powering smartphones than football teams \u2013 was making a major statement. Now, halfway through the first season of a three-year partnership that it has already extended for a further two years, Qualcomm chief marketer Don McGuire tells The Drum that the tie-up is giving the hitherto low-profile chip maker unprecedented global consumer visibility.\n\nAs McGuire is eager to stress when he sits down with The Drum at Web Summit Qatar, sports marketing shouldn\u2019t just be about logo placements. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward game that demands careful execution, cultural sensitivity and a long-term vision. The Californian company\u2019s foray into England\u2019s Premier League is no mere badging exercise, McGuire insists, but a strategic pivot designed to elevate the Snapdragon brand, build a global community and ultimately drive consumer preference.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nBetting big on sport\n\nBefore its move into sport, Qualcomm\u2019s marketing playbook was traditional for its category, encompassing advertising, PR and trade shows. But as McGuire explains, the company needed a bolder approach. \u201cIn order for us to ultimately be successful as we diversify, we really need to elevate awareness, preference and consideration. But when you make something that sits inside of something else, that makes it even more of a challenge.\u201d\n\nEnter sport. Qualcomm\u2019s agency, CAA Sports, helped identify the right fit. \u201cI need scale. I need premium,\u201d McGuire recalls saying. \u201cThey came back with, \u2018The biggest sport in the world is football. The most premium league is the Premier League. The most premium brand in the Premier League is Manchester United.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe deal gave Qualcomm access to United\u2019s vast global fan base \u2013 1.3 billion supporters worldwide, spanning key markets including China, India and the US. But it was never just about visibility. McGuire wanted to use the partnership not only for brand awareness reasons but also as a vehicle to demonstrate what its tech can do.\n\nNew era at Old Trafford\n\nOne of the most immediate impacts of the partnership has been felt at Old Trafford itself. As McGuire puts it, the stadium was a \u201cconnectivity black hole.\u201d Qualcomm stepped in to overhaul its wifi network, significantly improving connectivity for fans. But the ambitions go beyond infrastructure \u2013 Qualcomm is also involved in the redevelopment of United\u2019s Carrington training ground, exploring ways to integrate cutting-edge technology into player performance and back-office operations.\n\nHowever, activating in sport isn\u2019t always smooth sailing. \u201cThey don\u2019t need money right now, right?\u201d McGuire quips, referring to United\u2019s ongoing ownership upheaval and infrastructure uncertainties. \u201cWe\u2019d like to do more at Old Trafford, but they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to have a new Old Trafford, so let\u2019s focus on Carrington first.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeasuring success beyond traditional sponsorship KPIs\n\nFor any CMO justifying a multi-million-dollar sports sponsorship, ROI is everything. So, is it working?\n\n\u201cBeyond my wildest dreams,\u201d McGuire says. \u201c75% of Manchester United fans now know who we are and what we do. That\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s kit sales \u2013 home, away and third \u2013 have hit record highs, each launch becoming the biggest in the club\u2019s history. \u201cI\u2019ve got millions of billboards all over the world now,\u201d McGuire says. \u201cAnd the broadcast value alone of a home match is equal to a Super Bowl ad. I get 24 Super Bowl ads a season.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, the Snapdragon brand is transcending the tech space and embedding itself in popular culture. Walking through global cities, McGuire frequently spots United shirts with the Snapdragon logo \u2013 real-world proof of Qualcomm\u2019s growing consumer resonance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNavigating the challenges unique to sport\n\nSports sponsorship isn\u2019t without its pitfalls. In United\u2019s case, Qualcomm had to brace for the club\u2019s famously passionate \u2013 and often unforgiving \u2013 fanbase. \u201cThere\u2019s a subset of the fanbase that are very angry and they just lash out at anything,\u201d McGuire admits. \u201cWe had to protect Cristiano\u2019s [Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO] social platforms. Somehow, they got his email and started sending him messages. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nDespite being occasional collateral in some supporters\u2019 disquiet around ownership and on-field performance (once English football\u2019s standard-bearers, United currently languishes a lowly 15th in the Premier League table), the reception has largely been positive. The company\u2019s Snapdragon Insiders program, launched four years ago, has grown into a 19-million-strong fan community. It\u2019s a layered approach, with followers engaging at different levels \u2013 some simply following social channels, others contributing content and a top-tier group of influencers actively collaborating with the brand.\n\nWhile occasionally restless about their team\u2019s fortunes, United\u2019s passionate following has provided a perfect testbed for community engagement. Qualcomm has produced exclusive content featuring United superfans, partnered with Dell to integrate Snapdragon-powered PCs into content creation and offered unique experiences such as matchday activations and insider access.\n\nFurther expansion into sport\n\nQualcomm\u2019s success with United has already influenced its broader sports strategy. The company has expanded into Formula 1, working with the Mercedes-AMG Petronas team and backing female driver Doriane Pin in the Formula 1 Academy. McGuire sees parallels between the two partnerships \u2013 both provide Snapdragon with significant reach but also canvasses to demonstrate innovation.\n\nLooking ahead, Qualcomm is also exploring ways to push Snapdragon deeper into consumer consciousness. \u201cI\u2019d love for a consumer to walk into a car showroom and say, \u2018Is this car Snapdragon-powered? Because if it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t want it,\u2019\u201d McGuire says. While that reality is still years away, the United partnership has set a new benchmark for how Qualcomm thinks about brand-building.",

This should extend the lifespan of Android smartphones and allow users to benefit from their devices for longer.\n\nUntil now, Android smartphones received up to seven years of updates for the operating system and security. After that, the support cycle was considered complete.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm has reached an agreement with Google to guarantee these updates for up to eight years from now on. Qualcomm\u2019s smartphone processors are going to support this from now on.\n\nAccording to Qualcomm, this will allow users to get the most out of their Android smartphones for longer and extend the life of their devices. This reduces the need to purchase a new device sooner, allowing them to get more out of their investment.\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite and other chipsets\n\nThe extended software and security support initially applies to Android smartphones with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and Android 15 as the operating system.\n\nIn addition, other Android devices running on Snapdragon 8- and 7-series chipsets will also benefit from this extension. During these eight years, manufacturers can not only provide updates, but also add new features of their own. Older Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm are excluded from this arrangement.\n\nAdditional support\n\nAs part of the partnership with Google, the next five generations of Qualcomm\u2019s ASIC chips will be supported.\n\nIn addition, the new arrangement also includes two upgrades to the Android Common Kernel (ACK) for the Snapdragon chipsets. According to Qualcomm, this is crucial because ACK upgrades allow Android devices to have strong security for longer.\n\nThis extended support aligns with laws and regulations around enhanced security standards for hardware and software, both in the U.S. and the EU.\n\nWhich devices ultimately benefit from this extended support depends on the manufacturer.\n\nAlso read: Qualcomm presents Snapdragon 8 Elite with Oryon CPU cores",

            "content": "What you need to know\n\nQualcomm announced that it will be extending support to devices with its latest chipset for up to eight years.\n\nSmartphones that feature the Snapdragon 8 and 7 series will be eligible to receive this support.\n\nBy collaborating with Google, this move is said to increase both device longevity and sustainability while making sure that these phones get the latest OS for eight years.\n\nQualcomm announced this week that it will be teaming up with Google to bring 8 years of updates to new and upcoming Android devices that have the new Snapdragon 8 series chipset or the Snapdragon 7 series chips coming later this year.\n\nIn a press release, the company stated that this will roll out to devices that are running on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform. This means phones like the OnePlus 13, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Xiaomi 15, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and the Asus ROG Phone 9 are all among the devices included to potentially receive up to eight consecutive years of Android software and security updates.\n\nThis essentially means that the company promises to provide not just Android system updates but also underlying \"kernel\" updates (the core of the software, seemingly making it cheaper for manufacturers to provide these yearly upgrades.\n\n\"Through this collaboration, OEMs can more seamlessly update the software and security on their devices, ensuring a more secure and long-lasting Android experience for our users,\" said Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform.\n\nQualcomm is said to offer device manufacturers like the ones mentioned above the ability to bring Android software and security updates. Google has already done this since the Pixel 8 series, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the Galaxy S25 series. Now, it looks like Google is trying to bring that same level of support to other phones on the market.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nHowever, Qualcomm adds that the OEM decides whether or not a specific device will come with the extended updates. This means that it will be up to Samsung, OnePlus, or any other manufacturer to decide the level of support these phones will receive.\n\n\"We are raising the bar, providing more flexibility for our OEMs and ultimately enhancing user experiences,\" said Chris Patrick, Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis collab comes with a respite, as customers will potentially get to keep their devices for longer instead of upgrading to new phones every couple of years. This is particularly good for phones with the 7-series chips coming later this year, meaning cheaper devices could also receive extended support usually reserved for premium phones.\n\nThat said, it's a bummer that older phones, which don't have the latest chipsets, will not get any of these benefits, which means users may have to upgrade to recent-generation phones soon.\n\n\"Legacy platforms cannot take advantage of the extended support. Qualcomm Technologies will continue to work with OEMs on their software support needs for legacy platforms across our product lines,\" the presser added.",

            "content": "QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock up by 5.4% over the past three months. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to QUALCOMM's ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for QUALCOMM\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:\n\n39% = US$10b \u00f7 US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.39.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nQUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that QUALCOMM has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 12% net income growth seen by QUALCOMM over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 15% in the same period.\n\nNasdaqGS:QCOM Past Earnings Growth February 24th 2025\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QCOM?

The San Diego-based fabless chip designer says that device manufacturers are now assured of passing along to its customers the latest version of Android over the eight years of support that Qualcomm's top application processors (AP) can support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consecutive eight years of support is obviously a huge increase in the number of years of support that Qualcomm's APs can provide. Needless to say (but we will anyway), the eight years is also the longest number of consecutive years that Qualcomm's APs have been able to continue offering support for a mobile device.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest Android news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile device manufacturers will now receive support for platform software for eight consecutive years. This includes both Android OS and kernel updates. Devices offering extended support started hitting the market toward the end of 2024 according to Qualcomm. The first phones to be covered with this additional support are Android models powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite AP running Android 15\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we already noted, new phones released this year running new Snapdragon 8 and Snapdragon 7-series mobile platforms are also eligible for the extended eight-year coverage. But what we do need to point out is that the decision whether to give a particular phone eight years of Android and security updates is up to each manufacturer. Qualcomm says that it is already seeing commitments from manufacturers to keep their phones available to consumers for longer periods of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Qualcomm says that phones that have already been released using Snapdragon APs older than the Snapdragon 8 Elite cannot take advantage of the extended updates. Qualcomm does say that it will continue to work with device manufacturers to have the software support needs for their legacy devices met.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Qualcomm is pushing the boundaries of software updates on Android phones and has now announced that future Android phones will be capable of supporting eight years of software updates. This goes beyond what Google and Samsung are offering with their most recent phones. Google initially started supporting seven years of updates with the Pixel 8. Samsung then followed with the Galaxy S24 series, and then again with Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. Google also offers seven years of updates with the Pixel 9 series. The Galaxy S25 has seven years of support as well.\n\nSo far, this extended software support is limited to Google and Samsung\u2019s latest devices. As no other OEMs have committed to it. That being said, Qualcomm is helping to advance this kind of extended support and make it more possible for other manufacturers to offer it. And it all comes down to Qualcomm\u2019s latest mobile platform.\n\nEight years of updates on Android phones was made possible by the Snapdragon 8 Elite\n\nYou\u2019re likely familiar with this chipset now if you\u2019re even remotely tuned into the mobile computing world. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm\u2019s most advanced, flagship mobile platform, and you can find it in devices like the Galaxy S25 series, the ROG Phone 9 series, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra. More phones are powered by this chipset too, and more will be on the way.\n\nIn a blog post today, Qualcomm details how it has worked with Google to make the eight years of updates possible. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a big part of this. The company says \u201cQualcomm Technologies is excited to take this step forward, working closely with Google to facilitate the latest Android OS upgrades on devices with Snapdragon.\u201d\n\nWhile this is once again a major leap forward for the industry, it is a bit limited at first. That will change, however, and Qualcomm says it\u2019s committed to continuing to make this kind of support possible. That being said, the company also confirms that this will begin with upcoming phones that run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It might also end up supporting things that run on the platform that are already available. That will depend on the manufacturers though.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that this program doesn\u2019t guarantee support for eight years. Even on future devices. Qualcomm has enabled the support with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It will be up to the manufacturers to utilize that capability.\n\nQualcomm will continue this extended support for the next five generations\n\nIt starts with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it won\u2019t stop there. The company says that this extended support will cover the next five generations of Qualcomm\u2019s ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). In other words, the next five generations of Qualcomm mobile platforms will also have eight years of updates enabled. Again, though, it\u2019ll be up to the OEMs to use this. And not all of them will.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that any devices which do end up launching on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, will need to be on Android 15. The two will likely go hand-in-hand though. Qualcomm also plans to extend this support to devices running on new Snapdragon 8 and Snapdragon 7 series mobile platforms coming later this year. So it won\u2019t just be Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.\n\nFor consumers, this is a big deal. Because it sets the tone for even better longevity on Android phones. As opposed to forcing customers to buy a new phone or fall behind.",

            "content": "Apple finally launched its in-house 5G modem chip, the C1, on the iPhone 16e . It's been a long time coming even though Apple had dreamed about replacing Qualcomm's Snapdragon modem for years culminating in the purchase of Intel's smartphone modem business in the summer of 2019 for the low, low price of roughly $1 billion. There are some caveats related to Apple's C1 modem. It is not as fast as Qualcomm's and does not support the fastest high-band mmWave signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Apple saves money by using its own modem and the chip improves the battery life of the devices that are equipped with it. Speaking of those models, Mark Gurman, the newly crowned Managing Editor of all consumer technology content at Bloomberg, gave us a road map for Apple's in-house modem in the latest edition of his weekly Power On newsletter . According to Gurman, Apple is already testing the C2 and C3 5G modem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive the latest iOS news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nThe C2 will debut next year in premium iPhone 18 models and should support mmWave signals. The C3 is supposedly scheduled to arrive in 2027 and by then, Apple expects that its in-house 5G modem chip will be able to outperform Qualcomm's component. Yesterday, we told you that Apple's ultimate plan is to include its 5G modem in a single component along with the main processor. Gurman sees this becoming a reality in 2028 at the earliest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne interesting point made by Gurman is that in the video presentation unveiling the iPhone 16e , Apple uncharacteristically failed to promote the chip's capabilities as it usually does when introducing a new iPhone. It isn't known for sure why Apple downplayed the introduction of the C1 in the iPhone 16e , but Mark mentioned a few possible reasons. Apple might have been concerned that had it made a big deal of the C1, Qualcomm might have claimed that Apple used its technology and demanded royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighting the C1 might have called to attention how inferior the modem is to Qualcomm's current Snapdragon 5G modem. And lastly, Gurman wondered whether Apple was concerned about YouTube content creators posting videos showing how poorly the C1 fares against the Qualcomm modems used in other iPhone models.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Credit: Shutterstock\n\nIn a significant move, Apple is set to debut its in-house Wi-Fi chip in the upcoming iPhone 17 series, according to renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. This development follows the introduction of Apple's C1 modem chip, marking another step in the company's strategy to reduce reliance on external suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, a prominent Taiwanese tech equity analyst, recently shared on his X account that Broadcom's Wi-Fi chips will be replaced by Apple's in-house chips at a faster pace, following the transition from Qualcomm modems. Kuo noted, \"My latest industry survey indicates that all new 2H25 iPhone 17 models will feature Apple's in-house Wi-Fi chips (vs. only the slim iPhone 17 will adopt Apple's C1 modem chip). Beyond cost reduction, the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will enhance connectivity across Apple devices.\"\n\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to debut in mid-to-late September 2025, keeping with Apple's tradition of annual launches.\n\nThe iPhone 17 models are expected to support Wi-Fi 7, allowing them to utilize the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with compatible routers. This will enhance data transfer speeds, reduce latency, and improve connection stability. Qualcomm has highlighted that Wi-Fi 7 can achieve peak speeds exceeding 40 Gbps, making it up to four times faster than Wi-Fi 6E.\n\nApple's self-designed Wi-Fi 7 chips are likely to be produced using advanced processing nodes. Currently, the 6nm node process is used for Wi-Fi 7 chips available on the market. However, if Apple integrates more components for better energy efficiency and performance, it might opt for even more advanced nodes like 4/5 nm or even 3nm. Given that Apple's C1 and its transceiver have been mass-produced on TSMC's 4nm and 7nm technologies while the 4nm chip yields at TSMC Arizona have reached satisfactory levels, there's a possibility that the new Wi-Fi chips could be produced at TSMC's Arizona facility in the future.\n\nTaiwan's Commercial Times has reported that Apple's second-generation in-house 5G modem, codenamed 'Ganymede', is expected to be mass-produced on TSMC's 3nm process. This could be the C2 modem that Apple is currently testing. Following the C2, Apple is rumored to launch 'Prometheus', potentially the C3, as part of its aggressive push to integrate in-house baseband chips across its devices. The second fab of TSMC Arizona is dedicated to producing 2/3nm chips and is expected to start operation by 2027-2028.\n\nAs Apple continues to expand its in-house chip development, the company is poised to reduce costs and enhance the performance and connectivity of its devices. With the introduction of the in-house Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 17 series, Apple is taking significant strides towards a more integrated and efficient wireless setup, setting the stage for future innovations in chip technology.\n\nTo have more chips produced in America is a trend that TSMC\u2019s customers will be striving to do, as US President Donald Trump has announced that he will impose 25% tariffs on semiconductors imported to America. Although producing chips in America costs much more than in Asia, having chips made in America will help avoid the tariffs and reduce geopolitical uncertainties, while getting a better PR image in the Trump era.",

            "content": "Apple has underplayed the introduction of its first in-house cellular modem chip in the iPhone 16e, but future versions could be incorporated into the A-series chip, and even M-Series down the road.\n\nThe latest iPhone model includes a unique piece of tech: the Apple-designed C1 chip to handle cellular communication, replacing the usual Qualcomm cellular modem. Currently seen as simply a way to avoid paying Qualcomm fees for similar functionality, the C1 may herald some big changes to future iPhones and other devices \u2014 including Macs.\n\nA new report from Bloomberg speculates that the technology of the C1 will later be integrated onto Apple's System-on-Chip (SoC) main processors.\n\nWhile this certainly includes the A-series Apple Silicon processors, this could also carry over into the M-series Apple Silicon chips. Since the A-series was the basis for the creation of the M-series chips in the first place, it makes sense that developments appearing in the A-series will make their way to the M-series eventually.\n\nThe A-series is currently used primarily in iPhones, along with the iPad and iPad mini. The M-series, which debuted in 2020, is mostly used in Macs \u2014 but is also the chip in iPad Pro and iPad Air models.\n\nC1 technology to meld into future CPUs\n\nWhile the C1 cellular chip in the iPhone 16e will serve current needs, it presently lacks some technologies that will come into wider use going forward, such as Millimeter Wave (mmWave) cellular. Support for mmWave is expected in future versions of the chip, and could explain a report that the iPhone 17 won't feature the C1 modem.\n\nAlthough Apple is said to be working on a future C2 and even a C3 chip, the new report says that the technology will evolve to become part and parcel of future A- and M-series SoCs. This could conceivably bring Apple-designed cellular capabilities to machines that do not currently have it, such as future Macs.\n\nThe presence of the C1 chip \u2014 replacing previous Qualcomm-supplied tech \u2014 is part of what helps the new iPhone 16e have remarkable new levels of battery life. The chip is considerably more power-efficient than what it replaces, enabling the iPhone 16e to achieve up to 26 hours of video playback.\n\nThis is four hours longer than the comparable iPhone 16, which uses a Qualcomm cellular modem. The C1 will be superseded in 2026 by the C2 in higher-end iPhones, with a C3 expected in 2027 before Apple is confident that its own model will equal or surpass Qualcomm's capabilities.\n\nThe C1 chip helps the iPhone 16e achieve record-breaking battery life.\n\nThe new report speculates that the C-series as a separate chip will end there, becoming part of the main SoC for iPhones and other Apple devices. If true, this development would make the technology even more power-efficient and lower cost, making it possible to incorporate cellular capabilities in, for example, the MacBook lineup.\n\nThe future's so bright\n\nPortable Mac users have long desired a way for their devices to incorporate cellular technology, going back to the Powerbook era. This would allow the machines to connect to the Internet without having to \"hotspot\" from an iPhone's cellular connection.\n\nThat said, there are potential obstacles in the path: Qualcomm will likely go over the C1 with a fine-toothed comb for possible legal challenges. It's also true that the C1 is just a basic chip providing cellular capability, with much more development and refinement yet to come as cellular services themselves expand and evolve.\n\nAlthough it will likely be several more years in the making, eventually portable Mac fans could achieve a long-held dream of being able to use their devices to get online nearly anywhere. Between ubiquitous and ever-improving Wi-Fi standards and incorporating cellular connectivity, the C1 chip heralds a lot of potential for a number of Apple's present models, and devices yet to come.",

This means that, in the future, there won\u2019t be both an A18 chipset alongside a separate C1 modem, instead they\u2019ll all be one. This development will take a few years, though.\n\nIn the announcement for the new iPhone 16e, the new C1 modem went a little under the radar. It was Apple\u2019s first in-house 5G modem, part of a larger plan to eventually displace Qualcomm modems from the iPhone. This first generation modem is only available in the iPhone 16e, and likely won\u2019t be part of the whole iPhone lineup.\n\nFuture modem plans\n\nGurman outlines that we\u2019ll see the C2 modem next year in \u201chigher-end iPhones\u201d, and then the following C3 will ideally outperform Qualcomm modems altogether. Right now, the C1 is still a regression in some regards, although its power efficiency has enabled the new iPhone 16e to have the best battery life in a 6.1-inch iPhone.\n\nAfter they\u2019re done outpacing Qualcomm, Apple aims to integrate their modems inside of the main chipset of the device. According to Gurman, this is better for cost and efficiency. However, this development will take at least three years. Gurman says 2028 at the earliest.\n\nThis development leaves me asking one question: If the modem is integrated, will Apple make a separate version of the chipset without a modem? On the iPad and Apple Watch, cellular is a separate $50-150 upgrade depending on the model.\n\nIt\u2019d be really cool if Apple\u2019s in house modems enabled cellular capabilities on all devices by default, but only time will tell.\n\nMy favorite iPhone accessories on Amazon:\n\nFollow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram",

I'm not talking about Apple's AI features; the iPhone 16e and its binned SoC prove that Apple could offer more features to older phones if it wanted to do it. I'm talking about something most people don't care about \u2014 the modem.\n\nThe 16e is the first iPhone that uses Apple's new in-house C1 5G modem, which the company developed after a lot of expensive R&D and buying out Intel's 5G business. It's a modem that doesn't match up very well with Qualcomm's, at least on paper.\n\nThis is a bigger deal than you might think because Apple's C1 has no support for millimeter-wave 5G frequencies. That means two things \u2014 it will never get the hyper-fast 5G speeds we were promised and you might have seen yourself, and the network coverage in many places will be sub-par or fallback to LTE (4G).\n\nThis is because most of the technology to power a millimeter-wave modem is from Qualcomm. The company invented or re-invented it and marketed it in a way that it has become almost mandatory in North America. A lot of network tech is Qualcomm's and I imagine Apple has liscensed a good bit of it for its in-house offering, but it either declined to pay for better millimeter-wave support or Qualcomm is unwilling to license it at a cost Apple finds fair.\n\n(Image credit: Source: Qualcomm)\n\nI have no special affinity for Apple products but I don't like what I'm seeing here. On one hand, you might think that this proves Apple doesn't need Qualcomm so other manufacturers might not need the company, either. That's true if you're OK with a sub-par product with missing features found in many devices at all price ranges.\n\nWhat I see is that even Apple, a company with more than enough resources to do almost anything it imagines, couldn't break the grip Qualcomm has in North America.\n\nWe have no details about the process or licensing agreements (and probably never will) so we don't know exactly why Apple decided to forgo millimeter-wave 5G but I'm sure it's a decision that wasn't made lightly. Apple does not want its \"budget\" phone to be worse than a $300 OnePlus Nord when it comes to network performance, but it will in places like New York or Chicago.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nApple says it has plans to expand the C1's usage to other models in its lineup. I'm betting it will find a way to integrate millimeter-wave technology before that happens.\n\nWhat I know for sure is that Apple and Qualcomm have a long-standing love-hate relationship and this almost certainly factored its way into the decision-making process. Qualcomm does have competitors like Samsung and its Exynos 5G modems and there is more to a cellular modem than millimeter-wave support. There's also no denying that Qualcomm does it better. A lot better.\n\nQualcomm makes a great line of products, there is no denying that. It's just disheartening to see one company have such a strong grip that it can stifle competitors or charge exorbitant fees for patented IPs. If Intel couldn't do it, and Apple can't do it, can anyone?",

            "content": "Apple and Qualcomm's relationship has been strained for a decade and the iPhone 16e C1 chip is Apple's first move to cut ties once and for all.\n\nThe relationship between Apple and Qualcomm has been a tech soap opera. For over 15 years, Qualcomm's modem chips powered Apple's iPhones, enabling wireless connectivity to cellular networks. And now, it's over.\n\nBehind the scenes, the partnership between Apple and Qualcomm has seen disputes over royalties, patent fees, and personal and professional tensions. As Apple intensifies its efforts to reduce its reliance on Qualcomm, other smartphone companies are watching, according to a report by The Information.\n\nA functional partnership\n\nWhen Apple launched the first iPhone in 2007, Qualcomm's modem chips were a critical component. The collaboration seemed straightforward \u2014 Qualcomm provided the technology, and Apple integrated it into its iPhones.\n\nHowever, as iPhone sales skyrocketed, so did the royalty payments Apple owed Qualcomm. Analysts estimated that Apple paid over $2.5 billion in 2024 alone for Qualcomm's patent licenses, fees that Apple's leadership, especially CEO Tim Cook, considered too high.\n\nThe first public cracks in the relationship appeared in 2017 when Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing it of overcharging for patent royalties. Qualcomm countered by suing Apple and even managed to block certain iPhone models from being sold in China and Germany.\n\nThese legal skirmishes were partnered with behind-the-scenes snubs, including ignored phone calls and walkouts from high-stakes meetings. For example, former Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf once left a negotiation at Apple's Cupertino headquarters without informing Cook, leaving him surprised to learn Mollenkopf would not be returning.\n\nOther instances included Mollenkopf appearing disengaged during meetings, such as scrolling through photos of his dog on his phone, which Apple executives took as a sign of disrespect.\n\nPivoting to Intel and in-house modems\n\nIn 2019, Apple and Qualcomm reached a new agreement that ended their legal battle. The deal included a multiyear contract for Qualcomm to supply modems to Apple and a one-time payment of approximately $4.5 billion from Apple.\n\nBut for Intel, the outcome was bleak. Since Apple was its only modem customer, the new arrangement meant Intel was out of the picture.\n\niPhone 16e introduced the C1 modem chip. Image credit: Apple\n\nOn the same day the Apple-Qualcomm agreement was announced, Intel announced its exit from the modem business entirely.\n\nShortly after, Apple acquired Intel's modem business for $1 billion, bringing over 2,200 employees and a bunch of cellular patents to accelerate its in-house modem development.\n\nThe current state: C1 modem\n\nApple's recent launch of the budget-friendly iPhone 16e, featuring an Apple-designed C1 modem instead of a Qualcomm chip, is a big moment for the company. The C1 modem is significant as Apple's first in-house modem used in a production iPhone.\n\nThe company plans to phase out Qualcomm modems entirely by 2027, although it still owes royalties for using the 5G standard.\n\nWhile the C1 modem is a step toward independence, it currently lacks support for millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G technology, which offers ultra-fast speeds in specific areas. However, Apple is reportedly developing a second-generation modem with mmWave support, expected to debut in future iPhone models.\n\nApple's road ahead\n\nPlans from Apple to integrate C1 into an iPhone 17 model this fall and replace Qualcomm's modem in the Apple Watch Ultra with MediaTek's technology in 2025 will make the company more independent.\n\nThe entire iPhone 16e family\n\nLooking further ahead, Apple aims to introduce its Ganymede modem in 2026, bringing mmWave support to iPhones and at least one iPad. By 2027, the company hopes to release its Prometheus modem, which it believes could finally outperform Qualcomm's offerings.\n\nQualcomm's strategy moving forward\n\nOf course, Qualcomm won't be happy with Apple's modem efforts. Apple's move will impact its bottom line significantly.\n\nBut Qualcomm is already bracing for life without Apple as a customer. Earlier in February, CEO Cristiano Amon told analysts that by 2026, Qualcomm expects to supply modems for just 20% of iPhones \u2014 and none at all by 2027.\n\nTo soften the blow, the company has been branching out into other markets, including chips for cars, PCs, virtual and augmented reality, and smart devices, aiming to reduce its dependence on modem sales and patent licensing.\n\nEliminating Qualcomm modems will save Apple billions annually, as Apple paid around $23 per modem and $8 in patent fees per device.\n\nSuch a change might pressure Qualcomm to innovate faster and could influence other smartphone makers to explore alternatives to Qualcomm's dominance.",

            "content": "With Apple AAPL gradually shifting to its own chips, investors are closely monitoring Qualcomm's QCOM position in the semiconductor industry. Several ETFs have significant exposure to Qualcomm, making them noteworthy for those tracking developments in the sector:\n\nVanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF SMHX: This ETF provides exposure to major fabless semiconductor firms that are key players in wireless communication and AI-driven processing. The fund holds 5.35% of its assets in Qualcomm currently.\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX: One of the most popular semiconductor ETFs, SOXX holds a diversified portfolio of leading chipmakers, including Qualcomm, in which it currently invests 6.45% of its assets.\n\nInvesco Semiconductors ETF PSI: This ETF invests in semiconductor firms with strong growth potential. Qualcomm is one of its top three holdings, with 5.18% weightage.\n\nWhy is the exposure to Qualcomm the talk of town right now? Let\u2019s see.\n\nIs Qualcomm About To Lose A Key Customer?\n\nApple has leapt toward self-reliance with the introduction of its first custom-designed modem chip. Revealed on Feb. 19, this chip will power the newly launched iPhone 16e, a $599 model in Apple\u2019s latest smartphone lineup. This move could signal a major shift in Apple\u2019s relationship with Qualcomm, its long-time modem supplier.\n\nFor years, Apple has depended on Qualcomm for modem chips that connect iPhones to wireless networks. Qualcomm also supplies modems for Android smartphones and Windows laptops, making it a dominant player in the industry. However, Apple has been working on reducing its dependence on third-party suppliers and took a major leap with the development of the C1 subsystem\u2014a collection of components that now includes Apple\u2019s in-house modem chip.\n\nAlso Read: Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e To Drive Revenue Growth For Tim Cook\u2019s Company, Says Top Analyst\n\nCreating a modem chip isn't easy. It must be compatible with networks worldwide and work seamlessly with hundreds of carriers. Only a handful of companies, including Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei, have successfully developed their own modem chips.\n\nApple itself struggled in the past to move away from Qualcomm. It even had a legal battle with the chip giant before settling in 2019 and signing new supply agreements. But now, Apple believes it has cracked the code with its advanced C1 chip, which it plans to refine and expand across its devices in the coming years.\n\nWhat's Next For Qualcomm?\n\nQualcomm faces a significant challenge as Apple moves away from its modem business. The transition could result in a revenue hit to Qualcomm's annual revenue. Management at Qualcomm has already projected that it will supply only 20% of Apple\u2019s modem chips by 2026, according to a September 2023 Wall Street Journal report.\n\nQualcomm has been preparing for Apple's departure for years, but it still relies on the iPhone maker for over 10% of its total revenue, according to its annual filing for 2024.\n\nWith Apple gradually shifting to its own chips, Qualcomm could eventually lose one of its biggest customers. While Apple hasn't given a timeline for a complete transition, this development raises concerns for Qualcomm's future revenue from iPhone modems.\n\nOn the flip side, it is still too early to say whether Apple\u2019s modem chip is successful. Let\u2019s say if the phone does not perform as well as iPhones with Qualcomm chips, it will bolster investors\u2019 faith in Qualcomm. For now, investors can only keep an eye on the developments and tap ETFs carrying semiconductor companies including Qualcomm.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

            "content": "The introduction of Apple\u2018s iPhone C1 modem chip marks a pivotal advancement in the tech giant\u2019s strategy to curb its reliance on Qualcomm. Apple intends to reduce its dependency on Qualcomm\u2019s modem hardware by 80% by 2026. The C1 modem combines advanced technologies, including a 4-nanometre baseband processor, positioning it as a significant development since Apple\u2019s acquisition of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business for $1 billion in 2019.\n\nThis newly designed C1 modem chip is part of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e, retailing at $599. It reflects Apple\u2019s desire to internalize component design, particularly following its successful transition to ARM-based processors across its product lines. As Johny Srouji, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware technologies, highlights, \u201cWe build a platform for generations. C1 is the start, and we\u2019re going to keep improving that technology each generation.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the technical specifications reveals that the C1 modem supports enhanced network performance through its integration with Apple\u2019s processor chips. This integration prioritizes time-sensitive data amid network congestion, according to Arun Mathias, vice president of wireless software at Apple. However, the chip currently lacks millimeter-wave 5G support, an area where Qualcomm maintains a strong foothold.\n\nFrom a commercial standpoint, despite the forecasted reduction in Qualcomm\u2019s modem presence in Apple devices, Qualcomm retains its technology licensing agreement with Apple through at least 2027. Interestingly, this partnership is multifaceted, with Qualcomm\u2019s shares experiencing a slight increase following Apple\u2019s announcement, while Apple\u2019s remained unchanged.\n\nThe journey toward custom modem creation presents significant challenges. Only a few companies, like Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei, have achieved similar feats. Modem chips must be compatible with numerous global carriers and adhere to different regional standards, making this an arduous task.\n\nApple\u2019s history with Qualcomm is marked by a notable legal conflict that concluded in 2019, when Intel\u2019s modem capabilities proved insufficient. Nevertheless, Apple persisted in its in-house modem technology development, investing heavily in research. According to Srouji, Apple is not aiming to compete directly with other vendors like MediaTek but rather to offer unique benefits to its own consumers.",

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.7b US$14.1b US$13.6b US$16.3b US$18.5b US$20.0b US$21.2b US$22.4b US$23.4b US$24.3b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x9 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 7.94% Est @ 6.38% Est @ 5.29% Est @ 4.53% Est @ 4.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$12.6k US$12.0k US$10.6k US$11.8k US$12.3k US$12.2k US$12.0k US$11.7k US$11.2k US$10.8k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$117b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

She is also an experienced parliament reporter with occasional pursuits in the lifestyle and art industries.\n\nThe iPhone C1 modem chip, Apple\u2019s first in-house cellular processor looks set to slash the share of Qualcomm\u2019s modems in Apple hardware to 20% of its current level by 2026. The chip combines 4-nanometre baseband with 7-nanometre transceiver technology.\n\nThe C1 modem subsystem debuts in the $599 iPhone 16e, and represents the most important hardware development since Apple\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business in 2019. The custom chip forms part of Apple\u2019s broader strategy to bring more component design in-house following its transition to custom ARM-based processors for iPhones and Macs.\n\n\u201cWe build a platform for generations. C1 is the start, and we\u2019re going to keep improving that technology each generation so that it becomes a platform for us that will be used to differentiate this technology for our products,\u201d Johny Srouji, senior vice president of hardware technologies at Apple, toldReuters.\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe new iPhone C1 modem chip has been tested with 180 carriers in 55 countries to help ensure compatibility. While it includes custom GPS systems and satellite connectivity capabilities, the chip currently lacks millimetre-wave 5G capability \u2013 a technology where Qualcomm maintains significant expertise.\n\nThe C1 modem\u2019s integration with Apple\u2019s processor chips enhances network performance, the company claims. Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, said the integration allows the phone to prioritise time-sensitive data transfers during network congestion, ensuring better connectivity metrics during peak use periods.\n\nAccording to Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing at Apple, the iPhone 16e achieves superior battery life compared to other 6.1-inch iPhones, attributing the improvement to the C1. The 16e uses the same A18 processor chip as other iPhone 16 models and supports Apple\u2019s latest artificial intelligence features, currently provided by OpenAI.\n\nMarket impact\n\nDespite its declining modem share, Qualcomm maintains a technology licensing agreement with Apple until at least 2027. Following the announcement, Qualcomm\u2019s shares rose by 1%, while Apple\u2019s remained stable.\n\nThe development of custom modem chips represents a significant technical challenge. Only Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei have successfully created similar components. Modem chips need to maintain compatibility with hundreds of carriers globally and meet diverse regional network standards and specifications.\n\nIndustry evolution\n\nApple\u2019s move follows a complex history with Qualcomm, including a legal dispute settled in 2019 after Intel failed to provide viable alternative modem solutions. Despite new supply agreements with Qualcomm, Apple continued developing its in-house modem technology, investing significantly in research and development capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the merchant vendor to compete with Qualcomm and MediaTek and others. I believe we\u2019re building something truly differentiating that our customers will benefit from,\u201d Srouji said, emphasising Apple\u2019s focus on creating products tailored to their devices rather than matching competitor specifications.\n\nFuture implications\n\nApple executives have declined to specify when their chips might incorporate millimetre wave 5G technology or detail a timeline for phasing out Qualcomm silicon. However, Apple\u2019s levels of investment suggest a long-term commitment to in-house modems.\n\n(Photo by Apple)\n\nSee also: Can Apple AI crack China\u2019s market without surrendering to local control?\n\nWant to learn more about cybersecurity and the cloud from industry leaders?

The unveiling featured Qualcomm India leadership, including Kedar Kondap, Senior Vice President of Product Management at Qualcomm, who spoke to Business Today, shedding light on the company's strategy and vision for the Indian PC landscape.\n\nKondap emphasised Qualcomm's ambition to replicate its mobile phone success within the PC sector. \"We brought excitement in the phone industry for many years and it's about time that the PC industry saw some excitement as well.\" He highlighted three core pillars driving Qualcomm's approach to PCs: high-performance computing, energy efficiency, and the integration of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI).\n\nThe company has recently introduced its Snapdragon X series, encompassing the Elite, Plus, and X variants, each designed to deliver on these core attributes across different price points. \"When you think about India as a market,\" Kondap noted, \"the sweet spot of price points for India, the Indian consumer is very much focused around the X.\" He explained that the timing of this launch is strategic, aiming to cater to the specific price sensitivities of Indian consumers while providing access to cutting-edge technology.\n\nKondap pointed out India's unique position in the global adoption of Gen AI, observing its rapid growth and consumer familiarity. \"Generative AI is growing at a much more rapid pace in India than pretty much any other region in the world,\" he stated. He added that Indian consumers are quickly embracing generative AI in various forms, and developers are adept at creating relevant applications. This landscape makes India an ideal market for Qualcomm to showcase the AI capabilities of Snapdragon-powered PCs.\n\nAddressing concerns about the high computing demands of generative AI and its impact on power consumption, Kondap reassured that Qualcomm's architecture is inherently power-conscious, stemming from its mobile heritage. He detailed the integration of a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) across the Snapdragon X series, capable of handling 45 Trillion Operations Per Second (TOPS). \"We've had an NPU in our phone chips for more than 10 years,\" he clarified, highlighting Qualcomm\u2019s long-term investment in this technology. This dedicated NPU, coupled with heterogeneous architecture including dedicated CPU, GPU, video, and camera cores, ensures efficient processing and optimised battery life, even when running demanding AI tasks.\n\nThe newly launched Snapdragon experience zone at Croma is pivotal to Qualcomm\u2019s strategy in India. Kondap elaborated on the distinctive purchasing behaviour of Indian PC consumers, who prefer a \"touch and feel\" experience compared to online mobile phone purchases. \"They still like to touch and feel the device,\" he mentioned. The experience zones aim to bridge the awareness gap, demonstrating the capabilities of Snapdragon PCs, especially in Gen AI applications, to consumers who are already familiar with the Snapdragon brand in mobile phones.\n\nWhile the Croma partnership marks a significant first step, Kondap confirmed that Qualcomm is open to broader collaborations. \"There's nothing that prevents us\" from partnering with other retailers, including online platforms like Flipkart, with whom exciting future partnerships are anticipated.\n\nKondap encapsulated the driving force behind Snapdragon innovation as the pursuit of \"premium experiences\" rooted in \"great technology.\" He affirmed Qualcomm\u2019s commitment to \"outpacing innovation and leading the way,\" ensuring the development of cutting-edge technologies that translate into desirable products for consumers.",

Think sensors for tracking location, humidity and temperature. The ambient IoT concept also refers to devices that use energy harvested from radio waves, heat, motion or other sources.\n\nRelated 5G Advanced and the rise of ambient IoT\n\nABI Research expects more than 1 billion ambient IoT devices to be shipped in 2030, with more than 90% connected through short range wireless technologies.\n\n\n\nBluetooth is the big winner here, according to ABI Research analyst Jonathan Budd, who said the ambient IoT market will be dominated by Bluetooth Low Energy (LE).\n\n\n\n\u201cBluetooth is one of the most commoditized modems available in the wireless connectivity market, with Bluetooth LE offering lower data rates for ultra-low-power devices that require short bursts of data,\u201d he told Fierce.\n\n\n\nBut the Ambient IoT Alliance is broader than that, corralling Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular IoT into a single pen. The alliance\u2019s mission is to promote an open and multi-standard ecosystem for use in supply chains, retail channels, healthcare delivery services and more.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely about bringing things together. None of this works as an island. These standards \u2013 Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular \u2013 they\u2019re massive, especially the cellular standards,\u201d said Steve Statler, spokesman for the Ambient IoT Alliance. \u201cAll of this needs to integrate with all the other standards.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s much bigger than getting the Tupperware to talk to the smart speaker, he said. When medicine, eyeglasses, food containers and more of these very personal devices are connected, \u201cthe impact is really profound,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about dealing with all the privacy issues and data ownership issues.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re bringing in food safety experts, for example, to talk about the Food Safety Modernization Act, which calls for specific actions throughout the food distribution chain to prevent contamination and foodborne diseases. The act requires traceability records for certain foods by January 20, 2026.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe think ambient IoT is the best way of complying with the mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cAmbient IoT can basically automate something as simple as record keeping in the food chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the alliance, the simultaneous rise of ambient IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) will give businesses and consumers \u201cunprecedented understanding\u201d of the world around them. The alliance says it\u2019s focused on the next generation of ambient IoT standards for battery-free, low-cost technologies to connect products and assets, which can also improve AI service in the cloud.\n\nRoom for everyone\n\nWhile Bluetooth is currently the de facto technology choice for building energy harvesting applications, the cellular industry\u2019s 3GPP and Wi-Fi\u2019s IEEE are actively working with developers of IoT systems to better define, support and grow ambient IoT via cellular and Wi-Fi, Budd said.\n\n\n\nAs for fragmentation in the IoT industry \u2013 a longstanding challenge that protocols like Thread are designed to address \u2013 Budd said IoT is not about the \u201clast man standing.\u201d It\u2019s about securing a guaranteed business outcome from the toolbox of available technologies, which include an \u201call of the above\u201d model.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmbient IoT is best suited to low-complexity, power-sipping devices in controlled environments, giving the lower power protocols of Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee Green Power and EnOcean an advantage in minimizing power consumption,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWide area connections are expected to be lower in number but may be more widely used in mission-critical IoT applications involving high-value assets.\u201d",

It makes its debut in the iPhone 16e, but it isn't clear if the in-house modem will be ready for Apple's iPhone 17 lineup in the fall.\n\nThe long road to an Apple modem\n\nApple's modem ambitions have been no secret. The company has invested heavily in research, but reports suggested that development hasn't always gone smoothly.\n\nBy 2023, Apple was still finalizing its modem supply chain, with companies like ASE Technology and Amkor Technology competing to handle packaging for its custom chips.\n\nDespite that progress, industry insiders speculated that Apple's modem was running behind schedule. Some reports claimed that Apple's in-house design lagged about three years behind Qualcomm's top offerings, raising concerns about performance.\n\nWhile the C1 is a major step toward full independence, it still has limitations. The current version doesn't support millimeter wave 5G, a high-speed connectivity standard that Qualcomm modems have offered for years.",

            "content": "Update (Feb. 19, 3:20 p.m. ET): Added statement from Qualcomm spokesperson.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nApple today announced the iPhone 16e, a $599 midrange smartphone with an A18 system-on-a-chip and an Apple C1 modem.\n\nThe C1 modem is the first-ever Apple 5G modem, which required years of research and development \u2014 plus a big acquisition \u2014 to complete.\n\nWhat does this mean for Android? It's proof that if Google and Samsung make in-house modems and SoCs well enough, they can ditch Qualcomm entirely for better performance and efficiency.\n\nApple today announced the iPhone 16e, a $599 spiritual successor to the iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch screen and an A18 chip. There's a lot to like about this midrange smartphone, and it has the potential to shake up the market \u2014 potentially disrupting phones like the Google Pixel 8a and the OnePlus 13R. However, Android users should only be worried about one iPhone 16e specification, and that's the Apple C1 modem.\n\n5G modems are one of the rare mobile device components that only a few companies on the planet have created with success. Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, and Huawei are a few of them, and that's basically the end of the list. The iPhone 16e represents a breakthrough for Apple because it's the first device to use an Apple-designed modem, called the C1.\n\nJust like how Apple developed its own in-house silicon and phased out Intel for its Mac processors, you can expect future iPhones to eventually use Apple C-series modems exclusively. The company told Reuters that Apple will roll out its own modems across all of its products, though the exact timeline for that rollout is unclear.\n\nThe iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups use Qualcomm modems, which have, to date, been faster and more reliable than anything Apple has been able to develop on its own. For $1 billion, the company bought \"the majority\" of Intel's modem business in 2019. It wanted to make its own modems, but as of 2023, a Wall Street Journal report detailed Apple's struggles \u2014 and thus we got iPhones with Qualcomm modems for two more years.\n\nNow, it seems the company is finally on the right track to ditch Qualcomm in favor of its own 5G hardware. The Apple C1 chip features a baseband modem fabricated using the 4-nanometer process and a 7nm transceiver, per Reuters. It lacks millimeter-wave 5G support, but Apple says it offers \"industry-leading efficiency\" that leads to better battery life.\n\nMeanwhile, Qualcomm believes it's still the industry leader in cellular technologies.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The best commercial smartphones currently feature our leading 5G-Advanced modem-RF system, which uses AI to optimize for the fastest and highest-capacity networks in every country,\" a Qualcomm spokesperson told Android Central. \"We'll soon be unveiling the future of connectivity at MWC Barcelona.\"\n\nApple has no plans to sell C-series modems externally, and that's unlikely to change. So, why should Android fans care? The iPhone 16e and the C1 modem matter because they outline the blueprint for large Android OEMs to ditch Qualcomm themselves for their own in-house chips. Following the precedent Apple just set, it's possible that one day we could see Samsung use Exynos chips for both mobile processors and modems, which would be huge for the Android market.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 series uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, with a Qualcomm 5G modem, in all markets. (Image credit: Android Central)\n\nApple's reasons for using its own C-series modems are quite clear. For one, they're likely cheaper. Apple spent a billion dollars buying part of Intel's 5G business and maybe more on research and development, but it also pays a fortune to Qualcomm for the licensing of its technologies and the use of its modems. Based on napkin math and build-of-materials estimates from WCCF Tech, Apple could pay Qualcomm over $2.5 billion dollars if it meets its sales targets for the iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nAside from cash considerations, in-house modems allow Apple to tightly integrate its modems, processors, and software for greater efficiency.\n\nAndroid phones could use a lower BOM and more efficiency, too\n\nThe good news? There's absolutely no reason why Android phones from Samsung or Google couldn't also benefit from a lower build-of-materials cost and greater efficiency. If one of those companies managed to build an SoC and modem good enough, it could leave Qualcomm behind once and for all \u2014 result in Android phones with better battery life and potentially a lower price tag.\n\nAndroid phones are a bit trickier than iPhones, because modems are typically integrated at the SoC level. For instance, because the Samsung Galaxy S25 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, it also uses a Qualcomm modem. Apple and Samsung would both love to use their own in-house modems, but they're working in reverse. Apple made its processors first, then worked on modems. By comparison, Samsung already has the Exynos Modem 5400 ready \u2014 it's inside the Google Pixel 9 series \u2014 but it can't quite get its Exynos processors up to par.\n\nApple's strategy is simple. Start with cheaper, lower-stakes phones to iron out any potential issues with the Apple C1 modem without tweaking flagship iPhones before its 5G technology is ready for primetime. And in a way, Samsung is already employing this strategy. Plenty of Samsung devices already use Exynos processors and modems as the company desperately tries to ramp up its chipmaking quality.\n\nAll that's left is for Samsung to make an Exynos chip that can go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm's best. When it does, Samsung will be able to leave Qualcomm behind, having near complete control over the processors, modems, and software in its devices for peak efficiency.\n\nApple is officially proof that it's possible. However, if recent yield estimates for Exynos chips are any indication, Samsung has a long way to go.",

Now, a standard essential patent owner is sounding a similar alarm in Texas. Nonpracticing entity Polaris Innovations says the \"opaque\" corporate structure at Qualcomm makes a group pleading appropriate \u2014 but should the court disagree, discovery is warranted. If history is any guide, the Irish entity will get its wish.\n\nTags\n\nFebruary 18, 2025, 16:46 GMT | CommentA recent settlement at the Delaware Court of Chancery left unanswered the question of whether Broadcom Corp. engaged in a \u201cSingaporean scheme of arrangement\u201d when joining forces with Avago Technologies, as alleged by Realtek Semiconductor.At issue, there, was a 2015 cross-license between Realtek and Avago Technologies and Realtek\u2019s claim of standard essential patent, or SEP, holdup by Broadcom after it was acquired by Avago (see here ). The role a $0 corporate reorganization at Broadcom played \u2014 thereby creating what Realtek called a \u201ca gap in mutual ownership\u201d \u2014 was never decided when Realtek agreed to dismiss the lawsuit last month, just weeks after it was filed.In Texas, uncertainty over the role Qualcomm Inc. or QCI, plays in the manufacture and sale of its products has emerged.Polaris Innovations is fending off a motion to dismiss by QCI who, along with Qualcomm Technologies Inc., or QTI, are accused of infringing patents declared essential to the JEDEC memory standard with their \u201cSnapdragon\u201d and \u201cX Series\u201d system-on-chip processors.The November 2024 complaint by Polaris asserts QCI and its wholly owned subsidiary QTI \u201coperate as a singular, unitary business enterprise and are, thus, jointly, severally, and communally liable for the acts of patent infringement.\u201dIn a motion to dismiss last month, however, QCI countered that it engages in none of the accused conduct \u2014 which, it says, is tied to research, development, marketing and sales.While conceding, in a footnote, \u201cthere are instances in which group pleading is permissible,\u201d QCI says the instant dispute over Polaris\u2019s US Patent Nos. 7,184,339 7,872,936 and 8,161,344 is not one of them.\u201cThe Complaint contains no plausible factual allegations that QCI committed patent infringement by \u2018making, using, selling\u2019 the Accused Products,\u201d QCI contends, it and QTI \u201care, in fact, separate businesses with separate functions.\u201dPolaris \u2014 an Ireland-based nonpracticing entity and subsidiary of Wi-LAN Inc ., itself jointly owned by Quarterhill and Owlpoint Capital Management \u2014 fired back last week (see here ) that if the wrong defendant is named, it is through no fault of its own. Instead, Polaris contends, the \u201copaque\u201d corporate structure in place at Qualcomm is to blame.\u201cIn this case, Polaris at least plausibly alleges infringement by QCI. For example, given that QCI is registered to do business in Texas, it is at least plausible that QCI performs some of the infringing activities, such as selling the accused products,\" it said.Instead of dismissal, Polaris says, more discovery is needed to discern whether QCI should remain in the suit.In support of its position, the patent owner draws heavily from the 2022 Western District of Texas decision in ACQIS v. Lenovo . The case, which Polaris deems \u201cpertinent,\u201d involved similar questions surrounding a different multinational conglomerate \u2014 Lenovo Group.The China-based Lenovo argued that because it did not engage in the infringement alleged by ACQIS and because foreign conduct cannot constitute direct infringement, it and several subsidiaries were entitled to dismissal, leaving only Lenovo (United States) as a defendant.US District Judge Alan Albright disagreed, deeming dismissal warranted only where it is \u201centirely implausible\u201d that grouped defendants \u201cacted as alleged.\u201dCrucially, he deemed allegations of an \u201cobfuscated corporate structure\u201d entitled to weight, per the 2014 decision in Zond v. Fujitsu, in which a Massachusetts federal judge said it would be \u201cillogical\u201d to allow a defendant to \u201cescape liability because of its ability to keep its corporate structure confidential.\u201dThat\u2019s good news for Polaris, which, like ACQIS, is proceeding before Albright.In pushing back on QCI\u2019s assertion it is not a properly named defendant, Polaris says QCI's latest annual report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission \u201clumps together all of its corporate entities under the name Qualcomm.\u201dMoreover, Polaris says, the QCI website identifies QTI as operating \u201csubstantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, and substantially all of our products and services businesses, including our QCT semiconductor business.\u201d\u201cBut \u2018substantially all\u2019 is not \u2018all\u2019 and implies that QTI alone does not account for all \u2018engineering, research and development functions\u2019 and \u2018products and services businesses\u2019 attributable to Qualcomm. Indeed, this is why the Complaint states QTI \u2018together with its affiliates, serves and performs substantially all of Qualcomm\u2019s research and development efforts, its engineering operations, and its products and services businesses,\u2019\u201d Polaris observes.\u201cNotably,\u201d the Polaris adds, \u201cQCI is an affiliate of QTI.\u201dPlease email editors@mlex.com to contact the editorial staff regarding this story, or to submit the names of lawyers and advisers.",

            "content": "To complement the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 Ultra accelerator, the company has developed a software suite for AI inference workloads\n\nFrom an enterprise perspective, AI is all about putting data to work in a way that improves process and workflow efficiency, and creates new revenue opportunities. The center of data gravity is at the edge where connected devices of all sorts produce a steady stream of information that potentially contains valuable insights if only it could be effectively, quickly parsed and fed forward into whatever process or workflow the user has identified. At the moment, the center of AI gravity is in the cloud, although broad industry discourse suggests edge AI is a priority given the clear benefits around cost, latency, privacy and other factors. The high-level idea here is to bring AI to your data rather than bringing your data to AI.\n\nQualcomm has built a compelling narrative around edge AI and it\u2019s role in bringing to market products that propel AI from a series of point solutions to a larger system. Last month during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Qualcomm had a range of consumer-facing announcements covering automotive, personal computing and smart home tech; but they also had an interesting launch that speaks to enterprise adoption of edge AI solutions.\n\nDuring the show, the company announced its Qualcomm AI On-Prem Appliance Solution and Qualcomm AI Inference Suite which, when combined, let enterprises \u201crun custom and off-the-shelf AI applications on their premises, including generative workloads,\u201d according to a press release. This, in turn, can accelerate enterprise AI adoption in a way that reduces TCO as compared to relying on someone else\u2019s AI infrastructure estate.\n\nThe combined hardware and software offering \u201cchanges the TCO economics of AI deployment by enabling processing of generative AI workloads from cloud-only to a local, on-premises deployment,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s Nakul Duggal, group general manager for automotive, industrial IoT and cloud computing, said in a statement. On-prem enablement of a range of AI-based automation use cases \u201creduces AI operational costs for enterprise and industrial needs. Enterprises can now accelerate deployment of generative AI applications leveraging their own models, with privacy, personalization and customization while remaining in full control, with confidence that their data will not leave their premises.\u201d\n\nIndustrial giant Honeywell is working with Qualcomm to design, evaluate \u201cand/or\u201d deploy \u201cAI workflow automation use cases\u201d using the new hardware and software products. Aetina, a Taiwanese edge AI specialist, \u201cis among the first OEMs to provide on-premises equipment for deployments based on the AI On-Prem Appliance Solutions;\u201d that\u2019s in the form of Aetina\u2019s MegaEdge AIP-FR68. And, \u201cIBM is collaborating to bring its watsonx data and AI platform and Granite family of AI models for deployment across on-prem appliances, in addition to cloud, to support a range of enterprise and industrial use cases in automotive, manufacturing, retail and telecommunications.\u201d\n\nThe appliances leverage Qualcomm\u2019s Cloud AI 100 Ultra accelerator card. Relevant specs include:\n\nML capacity (INT8) of 870 TOPs\n\nPCIe FH3/4L form factor\n\n64 AI cores per card\n\n128 GB LPR4x on-card DRAM\n\n576 MB on-die SRAM\n\nThe inference software suite includes ready-to-use apps and agents for chatbots, code development, image generation, real-time transcription and translation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and summarization.\n\nClick here for details on the on-prem appliance, and here for more on the inference software suite.

The company will make various changes to the SE lineup, including a bigger display and a design similar to that of the higher-end variants. However, the device will also boast upgraded internals, which will be the highlight of the upgrade. Apple is expected to equip the device with its first in-house modem, but based on recent reports, it will have worse performance than Qualcomm's modem.\n\nApple's custom modem inside the iPhone SE 4 will deliver worse performance, but does it justify the lower price tag?\n\nApple and Qualcomm go way back, as the chip-maker has been responsible for providing Apple with customized modems for the iPhone. Apple is now seeking independence from the partnership as it has been working on its custom modems for almost 7 years. The iPhone SE 4 will be the first device to get Apple's custom modem, and once the company makes progress, it will trickle down to the rest of the lineup. We can safely presume that the device will also act as a testing ground for Apple and will only improve in the coming years.\n\nThe iPhone 16 lineup comes with Qualcomm-made modems that deliver top-of-the-line performance. A new report from Korea indicates that Apple's in-house modem will not perform on par with Qualcomm chips. While there are no tests available at this stage, it is a no-brainer that Apple's custom modem will not perform on the level of the Qualcomm X75 5G modem, but we can be sure that Apple will make improvements in the coming years, the same way it did with the M-series of chips. Apple's initial 5G modem is speculated to lack support for mmWave 5G and could offer fewer carrier aggregation features. This will result in slower upload and download speeds compared to Snapdragon's X75 modem.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 will be a catch if Apple plays its cards right. What this means is that the company has made very few compromises with the device, as it will finally feature an OLED display, an A18 chip for top-notch performance, Apple Intelligence, and an upgraded design. As for the compromises, we can count them on our fingers, which include a single-lens camera, Apple's custom modem, a notch instead of Dynamic Island, and that is all. It remains to be seen if the iPhone SE 4 will come with an Action Button, and if it does, it could give the standard models a tough competition.\n\nProminent industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that the iPhone SE 4 will sell well due to the improvements it will bring over the previous version. Coupled with 8GB, which opens the door to Apple Intelligence, the SE 4 will definitely be a strong device against the budget competition. As mentioned, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to be announced on Wednesday, and we will be covering the launch extensively.",

            "content": "This year's crop of flagship Android phones represents something of a victory lap for Qualcomm. Half a decade ago, Apple successfully scaled its A-series phone chips up to the laptop and desktop level. Now, Qualcomm is experiencing a similar leap in reverse. It designed laptop and desktop-class Snapdragon X Elite chips and brought their staple custom Oryon cores to the mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) level with the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.\n\nAs my colleague Harish Jonnalagadda recently confirmed in benchmark testing, the Snapdragon 8 Elite crushes what MediaTek and Google comparatively offer. However, Samsung and Qualcomm threw us a curveball when they co-designed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. It's a custom chip based on the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform but tailored to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series of smartphones.\n\nThat begs the question: how much better is the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip than the regular version? In their announcement, the two companies touted the custom chip's excellence in image processing, gaming, powering Galaxy AI features, and connectivity. Is that enough to make you think twice about buying a flagship with a standard Snapdragon 8 Elite chip?\n\nTo find out, the team at Android Central tested a slew of Snapdragon 8 Elite\u2013powered devices against the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra. For our Snapdragon 8 Elite lineup, we tested the Honor Magic 7 Pro, iQOO 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. We then stacked that up against the benchmark scores of the Galaxy S25 Ultra from Andrew Myrick's review and the Galaxy S25's scores from my review.\n\nTo say that the results were surprising would be an understatement. While the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip is plenty powerful, it rarely beats other top Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Benchmark Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy) Samsung Galaxy S25 (Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy) Honor Magic 7 Pro (Snapdragon 8 Elite) iQOO 13 (Snapdragon 8 Elite) RedMagic 10 Pro (Snapdragon 8 Elite) ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro (Snapdragon 8 Elite) PCMark Work 3.0 (Overall) 20129 19816 21008 16043 25320 25733 PCMark Work 3.0 (Web Browsing) 20601 20790 24889 16307 28463 25064 PCMark Work 3.0 (Video Editing) 8617 8664 8072 6899 9115 9311 PCMark Work 3.0 (Writing) 28484 28652 27504 20445 36806 34828 PCMark Work 3.0 (Photo Editing) 32689 33847 40642 39044 64891 56377 Geekbench 6 (single-core) 3001 3025 2965 2954 3136 3137 Geekbench 6 (multi-core) 9381 9640 6342 6650 9842 9936 Geekbench 6 (Quantized score) 4026 4503 2115 3915 3162 5479 3DMark Wild Life Extreme 4855 5307 6391 4514 5817 5935 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS) 29.08 31.78 38.27 27.025 34.84 35.54 3DMark Solar Bay (score) 8751 9724 11298 7287 9796 10038 3DMark Solar Bay (FPS) 33.28 36.97 42.96 27.695 37.25 38.17\n\nWe know a bit about the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. For starters, it's overclocked slightly higher than the base Snapdragon 8 Elite chip \u2014 the SoC can hit 4.47 GHz compared to 4.32 GHz. However, Qualcomm and Samsung haven't shared much else about the chip's under-the-hood tweaks.\n\nAfter running our full slate of benchmark tests, including PCMark, 3DMark, Geekbench 6, and Geekbench AI, it's clear that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy does not win often against Snapdragon 8 Elite\u2013powered devices. Three out of four of Snapdragon 8 Elite phones \u2014 the Honor Magic 7 Pro, RedMagic 10 Pro, and ROG Phone 9 Pro \u2014 posted higher PCMark overall scores than both Galaxy S25 devices. The latter two phones crushed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy devices by a margin of nearly 5,000 points.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThat general theme is consistent throughout our slate of benchmarks and stress testing. Aside from the iQOO 13, the other three Snapdragon 8 Elite phones edge out the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy\u2013powered models almost every time. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, a $1,299 Samsung flagship, didn't come in first place in a single test. For some reason, the base Galaxy S25 performed better, but it still didn't stack up against the best Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.\n\nThe takeaway here shouldn't be that the Galaxy S25 is better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, or that the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro is better than the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Instead, these benchmarking results signal that how a manufacturer chooses to run its processor of choice matters much more than whether it's the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip or the \"for Galaxy\" variant.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nThere's no better proof of this than the iQOO 13, which has the same chip as the ROG Phone 9 Pro but performs nearly 10,000 points lower in certain benchmark tests. The problem here isn't Snapdragon 8 Elite, it's that iQOO is artificially limiting the chip's performance. There could be a number of reasons for that, including battery life, TDP, or thermal throttling concerns.\n\nIt's likely that Samsung is doing something similar with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor in the Galaxy S25 series. It may be overclocked and customized for Galaxy phones, but the results speak for themselves: this chip isn't reaching its full potential. It's impossible to know why Samsung went this route for sure, though we noticed slight performance dips due to thermal throttling during graphics stress tests on both the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nReally, these results prove that you don't need to pick a smartphone for its processor in 2025. Benchmarks aside, all the phones tested are capable devices that have performed excellently in daily use. Even devices not listed here, like the Google Pixel 9 series, are more than capable.\n\nWhile it's clear that Samsung is doing impressive things with on-device AI and the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform, it's not materially better than all the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.",

            "content": "Editor\u2019s Note (February 19, 2025): Apple has officially announced the iPhone 16e as the \u201caffordable\u201d member of the iPhone 16 family, rather than an \u201ciPhone SE 4.\u201d\n\nBefore its official reveal, Apple\u2019s newest \u201cbudget\u201d phone was widely expected to launch under the name \u201ciPhone SE 4.\u201d Multiple industry reports suggested that Apple would debut its first in-house 5G modem. In the end, Apple confirmed the modem is in fact in-house, reflecting its ongoing push for vertical integration and reduced dependence on Qualcomm.\n\nThis development represents the next phase in Apple\u2019s broader silicon strategy. The company, one of the largest R&D investor, has for years been replacing external components with in-house tech. Now, with the iPhone 16e, Apple adds a homegrown modem to the A-series and M-series processors it already designs. First-generation hardware can come with caveats\u2014such as limits on mmWave\u2014but Apple has indicated it will maintain some Qualcomm usage through 2027, possibly to support customers in mmWave-dense markets.\n\nSub-6 only vs. full mmWave support: Prior to launch, rumors speculated that while the flagship iPhone 16 uses Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X75 modem (supporting both sub-6 GHz and mmWave in U.S. models), Apple\u2019s in-house C1 modem might be limited to sub-6 GHz only. It seems that speculation is true. iPhone 16e\u2019s C1 modem does not support mmWave, focusing instead on sub-6 GHz 5G and 4G LTE with 4\u00d74 multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) for power efficiency. On standard sub-6 GHz networks, however, the performance gap may be minimal, with the C1 still delivering reliable, efficient connectivity tailored to the iPhone 16e\u2019s $599 price point.\n\nCarrier aggregation and peak throughput: Rumors pointed to four-carrier aggregation (4x CA) on Apple\u2019s new modem, potentially capping peak speeds around 4 Gbps. Qualcomm\u2019s X75 supports up to five sub-6 carriers\u2014or ten with mmWave\u2014allowing theoretical top speeds of 7\u201310 Gbps. Early field tests showed the X75 delivering roughly 25% faster 5G speeds than the X70 in real-world conditions.\n\nPower and AI integration: One advantage Apple touts is the deeper integration between its A18 chip and the C1 modem. Qualcomm\u2019s X75 has a dedicated \u201c5G AI Processor Gen2,\u201d but Apple coordinates modem power states through its Neural Engine. According to MacRumors, this should help the iPhone 16e achieve respectable battery life, despite the modem\u2019s potentially less advanced manufacturing node.\n\nWhy Apple is going in-house\n\nStrategic independence from Qualcomm: Apple has long aimed to remove reliance on external vendors wherever possible, following its success with in-house A-series and M-series chipsets. Its 2019 acquisition of Intel\u2019s modem business jump-started its own 5G R&D. By first rolling out C1 in the iPhone 16e, Apple can test and refine on a mid-range device before risking any flagship reputation issues.\n\nCost savings and margin improvements: Producing modems internally can trim $15\u2013$20 off the bill of materials (BOM) per device\u2014a notable saving for Apple\u2019s lower-priced models. Despite renewing its Qualcomm licensing agreement until 2027, Apple\u2019s endgame is minimizing patent royalties and hardware fees from third parties.\n\nGreater ecosystem control: Apple\u2019s \u201cvertical integration\u201d extends deeper with in-house modem engineering, enabling tighter coordination of antennas, software, and power management. Future C-series modems are projected to add full mmWave support and advanced satellite capabilities. According to The Economic Times, Apple aspires to match Qualcomm\u2019s performance by 2026 and surpass it by 2027.\n\nConfirmed rumors Incorrect or different from rumors Apple\u2019s first in-house modem made its debut (now officially called C1), confirming the move away from Qualcomm reliance. The official name is iPhone 16e, not \u201ciPhone SE 4.\u201d The device indeed features a 6.1-inch OLED display and a 48MP main camera. The official starting price is $599, higher than the rumored $449\u2013$499 range. It has the A18 chip, providing performance on par with the flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The in-house modem is branded \u201cC1,\u201d rather than the rumored \u201cSinope.\u201d There is a significant battery life improvement over previous budget iPhones. Apple has not confirmed whether mmWave is excluded\u2014details were not addressed in the official press release. An Action button is present on the iPhone 16e, which was not predicted by earlier rumors.\n\nApple aims to close the modem gap\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s progress is evident, Qualcomm maintains leadership in carrier aggregation, mmWave throughput, and broad market certifications. Apple\u2019s second-gen modem, rumored for 2026, could add mmWave and approach 6 Gbps speeds, with a 2027 iteration aiming for advanced AI-driven radio features and enhanced satellite integration.\n\nTesting and certifying a new modem across multiple carriers worldwide remains Apple\u2019s biggest challenge. Earlier prototypes reportedly struggled with heat dissipation and power efficiency, leading to project setbacks. Launching C1 in the iPhone 16e\u2014rather than in the higher-profile flagship\u2014is a strategic way to minimize risk. Still, Apple remains liable for royalty payments on standard-essential 5G patents held by Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson, so \u201cgoing in-house\u201d isn\u2019t an immediate escape from licensing fees.",

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about QUALCOMM.\n\nView our latest analysis for QUALCOMM\n\nNasdaqGS:QCOM Ownership Breakdown February 16th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nQUALCOMM already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at QUALCOMM's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNasdaqGS:QCOM Earnings and Revenue Growth February 16th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

            "content": "A very hot rumor taking the February chill out of the weather has Intel selling a 20% stake in its Intel Foundry Services (IFS) unit to TSMC . Wall Street certainly feels that something is up after Intel's stock rose 22.5% over the last five trading days. That move started after Vice President J.D. Vance made comments in Paris about the U.S. manufacturing the most advanced chips in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the deal, Intel would produce the most advanced semiconductors in the U.S. as TSMC would run Intel's foundries following the closing of the rumored transaction. However, running Intel's fabs might not be such a seamless process for TSMC. Another report, this one from Taiwan's Economic Daily, says that TSMC might obtain a minority stake in Intel with help from fabless chip designers Qualcomm and Broadcom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny deal involving TSMC taking down a minority stake in Intel would require regulatory approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Commerce Department. Qualcomm and Broadcom can help the deal get done by entering orders with the combined Intel-TSMC foundry.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nThe Economic Daily report says that the Trump administration is hoping that TSMC acquires a 20% stake in Intel Foundry Services (IFS) since it would boost the administration's Made in America plans. The report also says that TSMC could make its investment via a cash injection or by providing technology to Intel. Broadcom and Qualcomm's participation in the deal would help them compete with Chinese chip designer MediaTek.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Huawei , which is banned from having its chips produced using the most advanced process nodes, MediaTek has no such restrictions allowing it to have its chips manufactured at cutting-edge nodes. As a result, MediaTek can compete against Qualcomm and Broadcom on price.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's stock is slowly trying to recover after the fiasco last year. In 2025, Intel's shares are up 16.7% year-to-date. But the real story is that over the last 12 months, Intel's shares are down 46%. The company is trying to become competitive in the contract foundry business which is led by TSMC followed by Samsung Foundry. TSMC has a client list that includes some of the top names in tech including Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek.\n\n",

            "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Qualcomm on Wednesday forecast sales and profits above analyst expectations as artificial intelligence features helped fuel demand for smartphones, and its share price fell after the bell on expectations of flat revenue from its patent licensing business.\n\nFor its current fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm forecast a sales range with a midpoint of $10.75 billion and adjusted profits of $2.80 per share, both above analyst estimates of sales of $10.34 billion and adjusted profits $2.69 per share, according to data from LSEG.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, Qualcomm executives said its lucrative patent licensing business, under which makers of 5G-connected products pay Qualcomm a small fee for its technology, will not have sales growth this year after an agreement with Huawei Technologies expired.\n\nShares declined 4.8% after the results and executive comments. Investors have been looking for booming payoffs from AI, and Qualcomm's stock price has rallied 14% so far in 2025, outperforming a gain of about 3% in the S&P 500.\n\nQualcomm last year stopped selling chips to Huawei but still retained a license agreement with the Chinese telecoms giant that analysts had estimated contributed 10 cents to 15 cents per share to its profits.\n\n\"The Huawei discussions are still in play, so the numbers don't actually include the potential from a renewal with Huawei,\" Alex Rogers, Qualcomm's licensing chief, said when asked about the forecast.\n\nQualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks, said last month it had won a major new deal with Samsung Electronics to provide chips for the South Korean firm's flagship mobile phones around the world. San Diego, California-based Qualcomm is also working with Microsoft and computer manufacturers to offer a range of laptops and PCs based on its chips.\n\n\"Expectations were somewhat high going into the print but we think it is justified as Qualcomm has a decent storyline for total addressable market expansion in the PC client market and share gain in the smartphone market with its strong position in the premium tier segment,\" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights.\n\nQualcomm reported sales of $11.67 billion and adjusted profits of $3.41 per share for its fiscal first quarter ended December 29. Both were well above analyst estimates of $10.93 billion for sales and adjusted profits of $2.96 per share, according to data from LSEG.\n\nAt the midpoints of the ranges, Qualcomm forecast second-quarter revenues of $9.2 billion for its chip business and $1.35 billion for patent licensing. Wall Street had expected $8.90 billion for chips and $1.43 billion for patent licensing, according to LSEG data.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has diversified its offerings into PCs, cars and other markets, the smartphone market remains its stronghold, supplying both Apple and Chinese handset makers such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. The Chinese smartphone market has struggled with weak demand, with the Chinese government stepping in to provide subsidies for low- and mid-tier handset sales in the country.\n\nQualcomm said it had fiscal first quarter handset revenue of $7.57 billion, up 13% from the $6.69 billion it reported a year earlier and below the 20% growth the company saw in its chip revenues overall. Analysts expected $7.01 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha.\n\nQualcomm said fiscal first quarter automotive chip revenue was $961 million while sales from \"internet of things\" chips - into which it also lumps PC chip sales - were $1.55 billion. A year earlier, automotive chip revenue was $598 million and internet of things revenue was $1.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts had expected $905 million in automotive revenue and $1.40 billion in IoT revenue, according to data from Visible Alpha.\n\nFor the just ended quarter, Qualcomm said overall chip revenue was $10.08 billion with licensing revenues at $1.54 billion. Analysts had expected $9.29 billion for chips and $1.54 billion for licensing.\n\nBernstein Research last year estimated that Huawei's licensing payments to Qualcomm accounted for about 10 cents to 15 cents per share of Qualcomm's profits. But Qualcomm on Wednesday disclosed that it has secured license agreements with two other Chinese smartphone firms.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengauluru; Editing by David Gregorio)",

Qualcomm switched to a fully-custom design after a decade, and the result is that the Snapdragon 8 Elite has generational gains over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is magnificent.\n\n\n\nMediaTek isn't sitting idly by either, and the Dimensity 9400 has notable design wins and much better performance. By contrast, Google's decision to play it safe with the Tensor G4 feels shortsighted, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't bring any meaningful upgrades in this area.\n\nHardwired (Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) In Hardwired, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.\n\nI used over a dozen phones powered by the latest chipsets in the last three months, and it's time to take a look at how they differ. Before I get to the benchmarks, a quick overview of what's new this year. Obviously, we need to start with Qualcomm, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite is different to what we've seen in the past.\n\n\n\nQualcomm went to a fully custom CPU design in a move that's similar to what Apple does with its own silicon, and it allowed the chip vendor to fine-tune the platform by a considerable amount. It isn't astonishing, then, that the platform has the best single-and multi-core CPU scores of anything I tested, and it even outmatches the iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2014 a huge deal in and of itself.\n\n\n\nThe gains with the GPU aren't as noticeable, and while it continues to be one of the best around, it doesn't have an outsized lead. Thankfully, MediaTek was also able to deliver a platform that's fantastic, and the Dimensity 9400 has enticing upgrades. Although it uses stock Arm cores, MediaTek's decision to exclusively leverage big cores makes a clear difference when it comes to performance. MediaTek has been doing this for two years now, and it nailed the fundamentals.\n\n(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)\n\nInterestingly, the GPU on the Dimensity 9400 is able to hold its own against what Qualcomm is offering. That just hasn't been the case in previous years, and I even managed to get better scores with the Immortalis-G925 than the Adreno 830. Qualcomm still leads the way with sustained performance, but it's great to see MediaTek gaining ground in this key area.\n\n\n\nThere isn't much to talk about the Tensor G4, as Google is using the same core configuration and manufacturing node as the G3. While Qualcomm and MediaTek made the switch to a 3nm node \u2014 delivering big gains in efficiency \u2014 Google is still using the 4nm node, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't quite have the same battery longevity.\n\n\n\nI'm using ASUS's Zenfone 12 Ultra as the Qualcomm baseline as it has a good thermal solution while still technically being a mainstream phone. I went with the Vivo X200 Pro to highlight the Dimensity 9400; while the Find X8 Pro also uses the same platform, I felt that the X200 Pro did a better job at gaming, so that's the one I'm using. And with Google, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermal management system in the Pixel 9 series, so that's the one I used.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Category ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra Vivo X200 Pro Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Geekbench 6 (single-core) 3116 2381 1895 Geekbench 6 (multi-core) 9824 7175 4111 PCMark Work 3.0 (Overall) 25558 15731 13028 PCMark Work 3.0 (Web Browsing) 32147 13716 10322 PCMark Work 3.0 (Video Editing) 9152 5823 7606 PCMark Work 3.0 (Writing) 32843 24744 15582 PCMark Work 3.0 (Photo Editing) 59086 13582 19293 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score) 4782 6070 2483 3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS) 28.64 36.35 14.8 3DMark Solar Bay (score) 7863 11021 NA 3DMark Solar Bay (FPS) 29.9 41.91 NA Geekbench AI (Quantized Score) 5478 2436 2620\n\nWhen it comes to the CPU, it's clear that Qualcomm has a definite edge this year. The custom design allowed devices like the Zenfone 12 Ultra and Honor Magic 7 Pro to net the best scores in Geekbench 6's single- and multi-core workloads, and I don't see this changing over the course of 2025. The Dimensity 9400 does a great job as well, and while it is faster than last year, it doesn't outshine Qualcomm.\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, the Pixel 9 Pro XL lags behind its rivals, posting scores that just don't measure up \u2014 the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-based OnePlus 13R does a better job. Annoyingly, it's a similar story with the GPU as well, and the device just doesn't come close to 2025 flagships. That said, I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use, and if anything, Google did a great job with optimization with the Android 15 update, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has much better fluidity than previous years.\n\n\n\nThe biggest issue is that the 9 Pro XL just doesn't deliver the same level of performance in demanding games. You don't get stable framerates, it throttles too soon, and it doesn't even measure up to Qualcomm and MediaTek's 2024 offerings, much less their latest platforms.\n\n\n\nGoogle says it positioned on-device AI as the differentiator with the Tensor G4, but even in this area, it doesn't do anywhere as well as Qualcomm. It has a slender lead over the Dimensity 9400 in Geekbench's AI workloads, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra once again has the distinct edge, with Qualcomm's NPU clearly the one to beat.\n\n(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, the Immortalis-G925 in the Dimensity 9400 delivered the best scores in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme and Solar Bay tests. That said, the platform tends to throttle aggressively, and the X200 Pro had a stability score of just 49% in the demanding Steel Nomad Light endurance run. By contrast, Qualcomm-powered devices managed a score of at least 70%, with most devices going up to 90% in the same test.\n\n\n\nThe downside to limited throttling is that Qualcomm-based devices tend to run hotter. The X200 Pro went up to a maximum of 44 degrees Celsius after an extended gaming session, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra hit 46 degrees, and Nubia's Z70 Ultra got up to 59 degrees \u2014 the highest of any phone I tested.\n\n\n\nSynthetic tests don't reveal the whole story, but having used these devices for an extended amount of time, what's clear is that both Qualcomm and MediaTek have done a fabulous job this year. I'm glad that MediaTek is able to deliver a product that goes up against Qualcomm in the high-end category \u2014 that just hasn't been the case in previous years.\n\n(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)\n\nAnother interesting point is the ISP; while Qualcomm continues to make gains in this area, MediaTek outdid itself this year, with the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro delivering the best camera packages of 2025. Of course, the camera hardware and tuning makes a sizeable difference, but the ISP on the Dimensity 9400 is an integral part of the package, and MediaTek did all the right things.\n\n\n\nIt's a similar situation with battery life. The key talking point is the introduction of silicon-carbon battery tech, and Dimensity 9400-powered devices have a clear edge when it comes to battery life. While the OnePlus 13 and Vivo X200 Pro have identical 6000mAh cells, the X200 Pro managed to last longer in my testing, delivering an additional hour of screen-on-time.\n\n\n\nI didn't do any quantitative battery testing, but my usage across devices is roughly unchanged, and the two phones that delivered the best battery life are the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro, both powered by the Dimensity 9400. Ultimately, both Qualcomm and MediaTek did a standout job with their 2025 designs, and while MediaTek is seeing better design wins, Qualcomm continues to dominate the North American market. I don't see that status quo changing anytime soon, but what's refreshing is that MediaTek has a viable alternative in the Dimensity 9400 in other global markets.",

The adoption of fixed wireless broadband via 5G networks is emerging as a key use case, particularly in India, where fiber penetration remains low and the demand for digital services continues to surge.\n\nAirtel will deploy Nokia\u2019s FastMile 5G outdoor receivers, designed to serve multiple households simultaneously, reducing connection costs. These receivers feature high-gain antennas to extend broadband coverage over long distances while optimizing radio resources. Additionally, the FastMile 5G outdoor receiver integrates Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) technology, enabling flexible installation on walls, balconies or poles.\n\nAs part of the deal, Airtel will also roll out Nokia\u2019s Wi-Fi 6 access points, which offer intelligent mesh networking and self-optimizing capabilities, Airtel said.\n\nAirtel also highlighted that Nokia\u2019s 5G FWA and Wi-Fi 6 devices will be manufactured in India.\n\nSandy Motley, president of fixed networks at Nokia, said: \u201cIndia\u2019s vast size and population density presents unique challenges for broadband connectivity. In those communities where fiber is difficult to deploy, FWA can be used to provide reliable wireless broadband connectivity. With our 5G FWA and Wi-Fi 6 solutions built in collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, Bharti Airtel will be able to provide customers with fiber-like speeds which are becoming essential in today\u2019s digital economy.\u201d\n\nIn November 2024, Nokia had secured a multi-year extension deal from Bharti Airtel to deploy 4G and 5G equipment across key Indian cities and states\n\nUnder the terms of this previous deal, Nokia will deploy equipment from its 5G AirScale portfolio including base stations, baseband units and the latest generation of Massive MIMO radios, all powered by its ReefShark System-on-Chip technology.\n\nThe European vendor noted that these solutions will enhance Airtel\u2019s network with additional 5G capacity and coverage. Furthermore, Nokia will modernize Airtel\u2019s existing 4G network with multiband radios and baseband equipment, which can also support 5G.\n\nIn October, Swedish vendor Ericsson said it had secured a new 5G contract for selling 5G equipment from Bharti Airtel.\n\nAirtel is currently using equipment from Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung to provide 5G services.\n\nBharti Airtel previously confirmed that it has started re-farming its existing mid-band spectrum with the main aim of accommodating the growing traffic demand on its 5G network. To accommodate the growing number of customers migrating to its 5G network, Airtel said it is in the process of re-farming its mid-band spectrum to expand 5G services on its 1.8 GHz, 2.1 GHz and 2.3 GHz bands across India.\n\nThe Indian operator had secured a total of 19,800 megahertz of spectrum in the 900 MHz, 1.8 GHz, 2.1 GHz, 3.3 GHz and 26 GHz bands in a previous auction carried out by the Indian government in July 2022.

Qualcomm says this new processor features improvements in power savings to potentially extend battery life, along with CPU improvements compared with prior Snapdragon 6 chipsets. There's also support for Bluetooth 5.4 and for Qualcomm's aptX lossless audio.\n\nThough the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 is the first of its line to support generative AI features, Qualcomm didn't specify any that would be coming to the chip (and thus phones using it). Perks from high-end chips generally trickle down to the low end over time, but it's unclear if any of the most advanced generative AI perks in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, like AI-directed selfie lighting and using the camera to recognize objects in real time, will make it to the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4. If they do, it's still up to phonemakers to choose which to build into their devices.\n\nThe Snapdragon 6 line typically arrives in phones that cost around $400 in the US, such as Motorola's Moto G Stylus. Qualcomm\n\nOther features are similar to those found in Qualcomm's prior Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which include support for 200-megapixel cameras and Wi-Fi 6E support.\n\nQualcomm says that in the coming months, the processor is expected to arrive in phones made my Realme, Oppo and Honor. The processor announcement is rather timely, as a number of phones that would likely compete against devices running the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 are rumored to be getting unveiled in the near future. The biggest at the moment are rumors of a new iPhone SE potentially hitting stores as soon as this week, replacing the current model that sells for $429. Other rumors are pointing to possible refreshes for Samsung's and Google's own midrange devices, with a possible Galaxy A56 and Pixel 9A potentially being revealed at some point this spring.",

After all, their prices range from $900 to $1,299.\n\nGood news: more Android phones will launch with the newly announced Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 chipset targeting mid-range Android handsets in 2025. So far, realme, Oppo, and Honor are already on board with the AI-touting chipset, with hardware reveals set to happen in \u201cthe coming months,\u201d according to Qualcomm.\n\nYou can expect some hallmark features of pro smartphones \u2013 Gen AI, 4K gaming and lossless audio \u2013 to come to Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 phones, even if the benchmarks aren\u2019t peaking like the Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nA render of the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 (Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nExpectations for the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4\n\nThe Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 is an 8-core 4nm chipset with a mix of one prime, three performance, and four efficiency cores. Qualcomm says its Gen 4 chip will be an upgrade over the last-gen Snapdragon 6 with an 11% improvement in the CPU, a 29% uptick in GPU performance, and 12% more power efficiency.\n\nHow will that translate to real-world performance in 2025 mid-range phones? New handsets will be able to tout 4K graphics, for one thing. This is the first time we\u2019ll see Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon Game Super Resolution and Adreno HDR Fast Blender dynamic rendering from mid-range smartphones.\n\nSnapdragon 6 Gen 4 specs detailed (Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nGen AI, which supports more efficient standards like INT4, will be the first for the Snapdragon 6 series, while high-quality aptX lossless audio comes via Snapdragon Sound. The chip\u2019s ISP supports a triple-lens rear camera of up to 200MP, although that\u2019s up to individual smartphone manufacturers to utilize that power.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite would have been called the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, but the name was changed to denote its significantly stepped-up performance. So, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 naming convention makes a lot of sense.\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that many of the hallmark features of top phones in 2024 \u2013 like console-quality gaming and deep-learning AI \u2013 will trickle down to $500 phones in the coming months of 2025. That\u2019s good news for consumers on a budget.\n\nHopefully, all of this means we\u2019ll see new handsets at MWC 2025 in early March.",

Whether Qualcomm is able to accomplish that or not, the on-paper power it brings is impressive.\n\nIt\u2019s always fun to break down flagship devices that get released and see what makes the internals so good at what they do. But the recent trend of flagships only bringing incremental changes year-over-year has shifted things a little bit, making the mid-range category more exciting.\n\nQualcomm announced a new version of an existing mid-range SoC, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4. The new generation takes aim at users who are looking to use their devices for gaming, some photography, and, of course, AI. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 uses the existing Kryo CPU found in the 8 Elite, along with the company\u2019s Hexagon NPU for AI processing.\n\nThe NPU in the system-on-a-chip is a welcome addition since we know how much OEMs are pushing generative AI along with models that assist in everyday tasks, like real-time translations during phone calls and message threads. The existence of an NPU also means heavy tasks can be handled on-device, which doesn\u2019t require an internet connection, though the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 boasts a 5G modem with Wi-FI 6E capability.\n\nAdvertisement - scroll for more content\n\nQualcomm is also emphasizing gaming on this chip. The specs indicate it can handle up to 4K gaming with Snapdragon Game Super Resolution. The SoC also brings Fast Blend, which renders games up to twice as fast. The GPU also brings some frame generation it seems with the Adreno Frame Motion Engine. The company is also tying audio into that with lossless options.\n\nAccording to proprietary comparisons to the previous generation, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 is 11% better in CPU performance and 29% better in GPU performance, which hammers home the notion that this chip is centered around gaming. Users should also expect a battery performance increase of around 12%, but again, those are early benchmarks that are subject to change in real-world scenarios.\n\nQualcomm notes that Oppo and Honor, among others, will be releasing devices with the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 chipset in the \u201ccoming months.\u201d The specific model names were not mentioned, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see which phones come with the new SoC.",

It's also the first in the Snapdragon 6 series to feature INT4 support to speed up AI workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's been a notable shift in processor development towards on-device AI capabilities, both on the desktop PC side and in mobile, which not only includes laptops and 2-in-1 devices, but also smartphones. And it's not just for flagship products, as the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 highlights.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to an onboard hexagon neural processing unit (NPU), Qualcomm's latest midrange chip packs a 1-3-4 CPU core configuration consisting of a single primary Cortex-A720 cores clocked at up to 2.3GHz, three additional big Cortex-A720 cores clocked at up to 2.2GHz, and four small Cortex-A520 cores clocked at up to 1.8GHz. The previous generation Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 skipped a prime core and paired four Cortex-A78 cores (2.4GHz) with four Cortex-A55 cores (1.8GHz).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Qualcomm\n\nIt also features an unspecified Adreno GPU. The result, according to Qualcomm, is an 11% uplift in CPU performance and a more sizable 29% gain in GPU performance for a big boost in gaming (and graphics in general). Meanwhile, Qualcomm says its newest silicon delivers an overall 12% power savings over the previous generation chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 will drive the next leap forward for smartphones in the mid-tier thanks to significant advancements in AI, gaming and photography,\" said Deepu John , senior director, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \"This platform brings a new level of performance and power efficiency for users to enjoy virtually anywhere with ultra-fast 5G and Wi-Fi, enhancing their everyday activities whether playing, creating, or working.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm also bumped up the memory support from 12GB to 16GB of LPDDR5-3200 or LPDDR4X-2133. Other notable changes include display support for up to FHD+ at 144Hz (up from 120Hz), an upgrade to Bluetooth 5.4 (up from Bluetooth 5.2), both HLG and HDR10/HDR10+ support (versus just HLG previously), and support for zero shutter lag at up to 64MP (versus 48MP previously).\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the latest chipset retains support for the same 5G standards (sub-6GHz and mmWave) and Wi-Fi 6E at speeds of up to 2.9Gbps.\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\n\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\n\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\n\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\n\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\n\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\n\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\n\nValue Score\n\nFor value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nGrowth Score\n\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMomentum Score\n\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nVGM Score\n\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\n\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\n\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\n\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\n\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\n\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\n\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\n\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\n\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\n\nStock to Watch: Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nHeadquartered in San Diego since 1985, Qualcomm is a fabless semiconductor company.\n\nQCOM is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\n\nMomentum investors should take note of this Computer and Technology stock. QCOM has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 9.1% over the past four weeks.\n\nNine analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.53 to $11.70 per share. QCOM also boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.\n\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, QCOM should be on investors' short list.\n\nShould You Invest in QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM)?\n\nBefore you invest in QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & President Trump\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses with insights on President Trump\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed President Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico and their impact on the car industry. Large US car manufacturers, particularly the firm that makes the F-150 truck, have their manufacturing plants based in Mexico. As a result, they can face significant disruption if import costs from the country increase in the aftermath of tariffs.\n\nHowever, while American car manufacturers are dependent on Mexico, Cramer pointed out that Japanese and South Korean car companies depend on their respective countries for imports. Since neither country has been targeted by tariffs, he wondered whether they could be next.\n\nAnother one of Trump\u2019s remarks that caught the CNBC TV host\u2019s attention was his demand that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates. The President has preferred low interest rates for quite some time, and his remarks in January that stressed that he would call on central banks worldwide to lower rates weakened the US dollar. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements, Cramer wondered \u201cis this discord or is it just a recognition that\u2019s just not the way to go.\u201d He added, \u201cI think the Treasury Secretary has won the President over in terms of the notion of, listen I\u2019ve got it under control, let me handle it, you don\u2019t need to yell at the Fed.\u201d\n\nCramer believes that simply demanding that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates might not yield any results. Referring to co-host David Faber, he shared \u201cDavid, yelling at the Fed, yelling at Jerome Powell, sucker\u2019s game. Doesn\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d Cramer believes \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t want to get in a sucker\u2019s game where he yells at the guy, and the guy then says look I really don\u2019t care what this President says. Because he doesn\u2019t like. . . . He likes fealty.\u201d\n\nAnother government official Cramer mentioned was Commerce Secretary Scott Bessent. In his previous shows, Cramer has praised Bessent and shared that he has heard good things about the Secretary. He maintained the positivity and shared:\n\n\u201cThis guy [Secretary Bessent] he\u2019s making a lot of sense I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to [get] the oil up . . .three million barrels. But I would say that he\u2019s a supreme intellect, and people who know him or read about him are kind of saying, wow, this guy\u2019s a stand up, take notice. . . he\u2019s a great practitioner of the game.\u201d\n\nCramer also wondered how the President would \u201cpay for the sovereign wealth fund without that fifty-year bond?\u201d The President recently signed an executive order to create a US Sovereign Wealth Fund. When Faber pointed out that it was pointless for America to create such a fund, Cramer replied \u201cWell the President says he wants a sovereign wealth fund. He doesn\u2019t say these things idly, he\u2019s thought them through.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 6th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 74\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the largest chip companies in the world. Its products power most of the world\u2019s smartphones, and advances in fabrication have enabled it to also target laptops and notebooks with the products. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\u2019s exposure to the smartphone industry which accounts for more than half of its revenue has led the stock to post weak returns. The shares fell by 3.7% in February after the firm\u2019s latest earnings, and Cramer commented on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\u2019s CEO\u2019s interview with CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt:\n\n\u201cI did not find Qualcomm disconcerting because it was interviewed, he was interviewed with Jon Fortt and he\u2019s a bit promotional but I do think he\u2019s gotten what he needs.\u201d\n\nOverall, QCOM ranks 9th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses with insights on President Trump\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

IFRS Net Loss includes significant non-cash interest expense, debt amendment and change in value of embedded derivative that are excluded from Non-IFRS measures\n\nGeorges Karam, CEO of Sequans, stated, \"2024 was a pivotal year for Sequans, marked by the successful $200 million Qualcomm deal. This milestone secures the future of our 4G business, strengthens our financial position, and enables us to continue innovating and developing new 4G/5G IoT products. Reinvigorated by this achievement, we grew our fourth-quarter total revenue by 9% sequentially while doubling our product revenue, in line with our guidance.\"\n\nMr. Karam continued, \"Looking ahead, we are committed to achieving operating income breakeven by 2026. This goal is supported by the renewal of strong business momentum and the anticipated growth from Monarch 2 and Calliope 2 shipments in 2025. Another key component of our strategy is new product development and innovation, validated by our recent acquisition of ACP, Advanced Circuit Pursuit A.G., strengthening our leadership in IoT cellular technology and accelerating the development of our 5G eRedCap chip.\"\n\nMr. Karam concluded, \"We are equally committed to improving revenue and reducing our cash burn from operating activities. By focusing on strong execution and financial discipline, we are positioning Sequans for sustainable, long-term success.\"\n\nQ1 2025 Outlook\n\nThe following statement is based on management's current assumptions and expectations. This statement is forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.\n\nManagement expects total revenue to be in the range of $7 -8 million, with product revenue contributing about 50% reflecting the seasonal weakness we typically see in the first quarter. In addition, licensing revenue related to the Qualcomm deal is expected to be lower than the amount recognized in Q4 2024.\n\nFourth Quarter 2024 Financial Summary:\n\nRevenue: Revenue was $11.0 million , an increase of 8.9% compared to the third quarter of 2024 and an increase of 130.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that are not historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements also often use words such as \"anticipate,\" \"committed to\", \"target,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"goal,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"aims,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"will\" or other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by Sequans in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty, because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future and the factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be correct, and you are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this announcement.\n\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results and are based on certain key assumptions. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the completion of the transaction; and potential negative effects of the consummation of the Qualcomm transaction on the market price of Sequans' ADS and ordinary shares. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are changes in the global, political, economic, business and competitive environments, market and regulatory forces. If any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if any one or more of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Sequans' filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, subsequent filings on Form 6-K and other documents that may be filed from time to time with the SEC. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Sequans undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. We have not filed our Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result, all financial results described in this earnings release should be considered preliminary, and are subject to change to reflect any necessary adjustments or changes in accounting estimates, that are identified prior to the time we file our Form 20-F.\n\nUse of Non-IFRS/non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, we disclose certain non-IFRS, or non-GAAP, financial measures. These measures exclude the non-cash stock-based compensation and the non-cash impacts of convertible debt extensions, effective interest adjustments related to the convertible debt with embedded derivatives and other financings; deferred tax benefit or expense related to the convertible debt and other financings. We believe that these measures can be useful to facilitate comparisons among different companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that the non-GAAP measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures in the table attached to this press release.\n\nAbout Sequans Communications\n\nSequans Communications S.A.

            "content": "As most informed artificial intelligence (AI) stock investors know, not all of these investments are multibaggers. In fact, some have struggled to outperform the S&P 500 during specified time periods.\n\nSuch has been the case with prominent semiconductor stock Qualcomm (QCOM 3.05%). Despite the company leading the way in smartphone chipsets and pivoting into AI, investors have not warmed to this stock amid a slower upgrade cycle and competitive concerns.\n\nHowever, it may now have the catalyst to finally take this stock to new highs and beyond. Here's why.\n\nWhy Qualcomm now?\n\nAdmittedly, now may not seem like an opportune time to take an interest in Qualcomm as it faces its most serious competitive threats in decades. The company admitted that Chinese tech giant Huawei no longer needed chips from Qualcomm. Additionally, Apple rolled out a plan to replace the company's chips in the iPhone by 2027, potentially costing it another major customer.\n\nQualcomm often prospered due to upgrade cycles, but with this latest cycle, Qualcomm has struggled. After the 5G upgrade cycle ran its course, Qualcomm's revenue growth turned negative. To reverse this trend, the company pivoted into AI on the hope that it would spark the next upgrade cycle. While Qualcomm is again growing revenue, it has yet to match the faster growth that once came from the upgrade to 5G.\n\nNonetheless, that could change with AI usage set to skyrocket thanks to the DeepSeek breakthrough. More consumers may now want to upgrade to capitalize on the AI functionality. Since the handset segment remains Qualcomm's largest revenue source, that should bode well for the company.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm is not just bringing AI to the smartphone business. The company has long envisioned a world where consumers might use smartphones less. To that end, Qualcomm pivoted into the Internet of Things and automotive applications to bring communications technology into other environments.\n\nMore recently, it has also developed chips to power PCs. This move puts the company in direct competition with Apple and AMD and could become an opportunity to gain ground on struggling chip giant Intel. Such technologies place Qualcomm at the forefront of AI and are likely to make its role in this industry even more prominent.\n\nWhere Qualcomm stands financially\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm's financials had already begun to benefit from AI, and the most recent earnings release appears to confirm that.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 29, 2024), revenue of $11.7 billion grew 17% compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2024. This was faster than the 9% increase in fiscal 2024 and the 19% pullback in fiscal 2023.\n\nNot surprisingly, the higher revenue has also made Qualcomm more profitable. Q1 net income to $3.2 billion rose 15% from year-ago levels. A tripling of income tax expenses slowed profit growth modestly, but that slowdown should not reflect on the company's successes.\n\nAlso, the outlook likely should not discourage investors. Indeed, the estimated Q2 revenue of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion would represent a sequential slowdown to 14% at the midpoint. Still, in the previous quarter, the company forecast up to $11.3 billion in revenue for Q1, a prediction it handily beat. If that trend continues, revenue growth will accelerate.\n\nAdditionally, the stock sells at a P/E ratio of about 18, the lowest earnings multiple of the major semiconductor companies. This means if it can benefit from the higher demand for AI functionality, a combination of growth and multiple expansion could take this stock significantly higher.\n\nConsider Qualcomm stock\n\nThanks to its market positioning and DeepSeek's recent breakthrough, Qualcomm could emerge as a top AI stock.\n\nAdmittedly, losing Huawei was a significant setback, and Apple dropping Qualcomm as a supplier could signify the loss of a critical competitive advantage.\n\nNonetheless, Apple has failed to replace Qualcomm more than once, and it is unclear whether it will succeed this time. Also, with AI modeling becoming significantly cheaper, more consumers will have a good reason to upgrade their smartphones.\n\nFurthermore, higher demand for AI could lead to increased interest in Qualcomm's other products. At a P/E ratio of 18, the promise of its technology, along with a low valuation, could position Qualcomm stock for considerable returns.",

            "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM 3.05%) shares fell despite the semiconductor company reporting robust fiscal first-quarter results and issuing upbeat guidance. The stock is up just over 15% over the past year as of this writing, but off about 28% from the high it hit in June.\n\nLet's dig into Qualcomm's results to see if this is a good opportunity to buy the stock on the dip.\n\nRecord revenue\n\nFor the third quarter in a row, Qualcomm posted double-digit revenue growth, setting a new quarterly record in the process. For its fiscal Q1 ended Dec. 29, revenue jumped 17% to $11.67 billion, which easily topped the $10.93 billion consensus as compiled by LSEG.\n\nRevenue for its chip segment (QCT) climbed 20% to $10.1 billion. Handset revenue, which includes smartphones, rose 13% to $7.6 billion, while automotive revenue soared 61% to $961 million. Internet of Things (IoT) revenue surged 36% to $1.5 billion.\n\nThe company credited its solid handset revenue performance to higher volumes from premium Android devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 devices, which use its Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. It also said that its sales to Chinese customers were strong, as the premium part of the market grows in the country.\n\nIn the automotive chip segment, the company said automakers are using its \"high-performance, low-power computing, and connectivity chips to bring next-generation experiences to consumers.\" It also said that it is teaming up with a number of automakers on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered, in-cabin, and advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, in IoT, it said it is seeing strength across the consumer, networking, and industrial verticals.\n\nRevenue for its high-margin licensing segment (QTL), meanwhile, rose 5% to $1.5 billion. It said it extended key agreements with major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) during the past year and that it is set to soon renew two new long-term license agreements with additional big OEMs.\n\nMetric Handsets (QCT) Auto (QCT) IoT (QCT) QCT segment QTL segment Revenue $7.6 billion $961 million $1.5 billion $10.1 billion $1.5 billion Growth 13% 61% 36% 20% 5%\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 24% to $3.41, topping analyst consensus expectations of $2.96.\n\nQualcomm guided for fiscal Q2 revenue between $10.3 billion and $11.2 billion, equating to growth of 10% to 19%. It is looking for chip revenue between $8.9 billion and $9.5 billion and licensing revenue between $1.25 billion and $1.45 billion. It is forecasting adjusted EPS in the $2.70 to $2.90 range. Analysts were looking for adjusted EPS of $2.69 and revenue of $10.3 billion, so the midpoint of its guidance was solidly ahead of those expectations.\n\nQualcomm is looking for handset revenue to rise by about 10% in the quarter, helped by increased shipments for Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphones. Meanwhile, it is looking for auto revenue to grow by about 50% and IoT revenue to increase by about 15%. Licensing revenue is expected to slip sequentially due to seasonality.\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nQualcomm turned in a great quarter and offered an outlook that was well ahead of analyst expectations, but the stock nonetheless fell. Its high-margin licensing revenue was a tad below expectations both for the just-reported quarter and Q2 guidance, which could be part of the reason. However, that is some pretty heavy nitpicking for what otherwise was a blowout quarter.\n\nQualcomm is still very heavily tied to smartphones with both its chips and licensing businesses. This is a more mature market at this point and an AI-fueled upgrade cycle has not really taken hold as some expected. However, the company is doing a good job of trying to diversify away from smartphones and is looking to generate about $22 billion in non-handset revenue by 2029. That would more than double the non-handset revenue run rate that it saw in fiscal Q1.\n\nQualcomm trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 times based on current fiscal year analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.6. Stocks with PEG ratios under 1 are generally viewed as undervalued, while growth stocks will often trade at PEG ratios well above 1.\n\nThe sell-off in Qualcomm shares looks like an overreaction in my view. It was a strong quarter with solid guidance and the stock is cheap. The company still needs to diversify away from a mature smartphone market, but thus far it's doing a nice job growing within the automobile and IoT segments.\n\nAs such, I would be a buyer of the stock on the dip.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

This expansion into new markets is seen as a strategic move to mitigate reliance on the smartphone market, which has been Qualcomm\u2019s traditional stronghold but is now complemented by these emerging sectors.\n\nThe company\u2019s patent portfolio, particularly in 5G technology, remains a significant revenue source, compelling companies like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung to pay licensing fees irrespective of whether they use Qualcomm\u2019s hardware. Following the earnings, Qualcomm provided a Q2 guidance that further exceeded expectations, with projected revenue and EPS both topping consensus estimates. This performance has led to positive reactions from analysts, including TD Cowen raising its price target to $195 from $180 with a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. The firm cited Qualcomm\u2019s solid results and guidance, driven by record handset revenue. However, they also noted that investors are focusing on the flat year-over-year outlook for Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenue, especially with Huawei royalty revenue removed.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s stock however, has reacted positively, closing at $167.96 on Friday, up 9.33% year-to-date, and outperforming broader market indices like the Nasdaq Composite (COP) and S&P 500 (SPX), which gained 1.10% and 2.45%, respectively. This performance, combined with Cathie Wood\u2019s investment, underscores a market sentiment that views Qualcomm not just as a mobile technology leader but as a key player in the expanding fields of automotive, IoT, and AI technologies.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

Nuvia had signed an architecture license agreement (ALA) with Arm that allowed it to design its own Arm-compatible CPU cores.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s latest quarterly financial report revealed that on January 8, 2025, Arm signalled it was no longer pushing to axe the agreement. Confirming the news on Qualcomm\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Cristiano Amon said: \u201cArm has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm Architecture License Agreement. We're excited to continue to develop performance-leading, world-class products that benefit consumers worldwide, including our incredible Oryon custom CPUs.\"\n\nArm isn\u2019t out of the courtroom just yet despite backing off from this fight. In a regulatory filing, the company admitted that both sides had filed post-trial motions to clarify legal issues following the jury\u2019s verdicts\u2014meaning a new trial could still be on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, Arm\u2019s CFO Jason Child tried to play down the impact of the case, telling investors the company never expected to win outright and had already assumed Qualcomm would continue paying royalties at existing rates.\n\n\"The primary reason for the lawsuit very much was around defending our IP and that's important,\"* Child claimed.\n\nQualcomm isn\u2019t letting Arm off the hook so quickly\u2014it's still suing the British firm, accusing it of failing to honour contractual obligations.

When Qualcomm bought Nuvia for its CPU designs and used it as part of the Oryon CPUs found in its Snapdragon chips, Arm was up in arms, saying that Nuvia cannot transfer its designs without prior approval, reports The Register.\n\nThis has led to a massive legal feud between the two companies, with Arm terminating Qualcomm\u2019s license and demanding that Nuvia\u2019s blueprints be destroyed. Arm says that it\u2019s missing out on $50 million of annual royalties because Qualcomm did not renegotiate Nuvia\u2019s license after the acquisition; however, the Snapdragon designer argues that its Oryon CPU cores use less than 1% of original Arm tech, saying that it\u2019s almost entirely custom.\n\nDespite Qualcomm\u2019s victory, Arm is still asking for further clarification on the legalities of the deal, especially as the jury is hung on whether Nuvia was in breach of its contract with the company. Because of this, there\u2019s a chance that Arm would ask for a retrial, at least for this issue.\n\nNevertheless, Arm\u2019s legal defeat to Qualcomm has no expected effect on the company\u2019s bottom line and revenue forecast. Arm CFO Jason Child said the company assumed it wouldn\u2019t win the lawsuit and would continue receiving royalties from Qualcomm from its existing ALA and other licenses. \u201cThe primary reason for the lawsuit was very much around defending our IP and that\u2019s important,\u201d Child said. \u201cBut from a financial perspective, we had assumed that we\u2019ll continue to be receiving royalties at basically the same rates that they\u2019ve been paying for in the past and will continue to pay.\u201d\n\nEven though Arm was unsuccessful in forcing Qualcomm to renegotiate its contracts, it still benefits from the latter\u2019s success. During its last quarterly earnings announcement, the Snapdragon maker said that its revenue jumped by 18% yearly, leading to a 15% growth in its net income. It also claimed it cornered 10% of the U.S. Windows PC retail market for $800 and up devices. Arm\u2019s revenue for this period also increased by 18% year over year, showing how closely the two companies are connected.",

Whether it was the lack of native applications available for this platform at launch, the high starting price, or the quality control issues that resulted in the high return rate of these notebooks, December 2024 turned out to be a better month for Qualcomm statistically.\n\nThe latest figures only focused on the U.S. market, but Qualcomm could improve its shipment tally with a new Snapdragon X chipset that targets $600 notebooks\n\nThe numbers were shared by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the company\u2019s latest earnings call, with Windows Central reporting that the Chief Executive mentioned that he is pleased with the early reception of customers, even though they are still in the transitionary phase of Copilot+ PCs. Sharing data from a market research firm, Cristiano Amon provided the following statistics regarding Snapdragon X shipments for the U.S. market:\n\n\u201cWhile we are still in the early phase of the transition to Copilot+ PCs, we are pleased with consumer reception for our Snapdragon X Series, which has exceeded our expectations. According to Circana, in December, Snapdragon X Series had more than 10% share of the greater than $800 Windows laptops in U.S. retail.\u201d\n\nIt is interesting that the worldwide figures for Snapdragon X laptops were not shared, and we cannot imagine that Qualcomm\u2019s CEO would not have access to these numbers. However, we would assume that the U.S. is where the premium machines would be purchased the most, and luckily for the San Diego firm, it has found a place amongst alternatives powered by AMD and Intel. Qualcomm intends to shake up the affordable notebook market as well with the release of an 8-core Snapdragon X, which will power $600 machines, in the coming weeks.\n\nFor now, if you wish to secure a Windows laptop powered by Qualcomm\u2019s current-generation chipsets, we have some excellent options, starting with the Galaxy Book4 Edge, which offers a Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD for $782.86. For the second option, you can get the 13-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop, which sports the same SoC, RAM, and storage but offers a touchscreen, for $899.99 after a 25 percent discount.",

            "content": "Arm has given up on terminating one of its key licenses with Qualcomm, leaving the latter free to continue producing homegrown Arm-compatible chips for PCs, phones, and servers.\n\nThe Brit biz had sought to end that license in a lawsuit it brought against Qualcomm in 2022. That suit is rooted in Qualcomm's 2021 acquisition of a startup called Nuvia, which was co-founded by the brains behind Apple's custom processors and had signed an architecture license agreement (ALA) with Arm that allowed it to design its own Arm-compatible CPU cores.\n\nNuvia produced CPU blueprints so fine that Qualcomm, also an Arm ALA licensee, decided to buy the company and use the upstart's custom core designs in future Snapdragon system-on-chips. Those CPU designs were marketed by Qualcomm under its Oryon brand.\n\nArm didn\u2019t like any of that for an array of reasons \u2013 one being that, in Arm's mind, Nuvia wasn't allowed to transfer its Arm-derived designs to Qualcomm without Arm's prior approval \u2013 and claimed in its lawsuit that Nuvia and Qualcomm were in breach of their agreements with Arm. The Softbank-owned biz went as far as seeking to end its ALA with Qualcomm \u2013 which would leave Qualy unable to develop or ship chips relevant to that license \u2013 and demanded the destruction of Nuvia CPU blueprints as well as compensation.\n\nThe matter wound up in court last year and a jury largely found in Qualcomm\u2019s favor.\n\nOn Wednesday, Qualcomm\u2019s latest quarterly financial report [PDF] revealed Arm had indicated on January 8, 2025 it was no longer seeking to kill off Qualcomm's ALA.\n\nDuring Qualcomm\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings conference call with Wall Street, CEO Cristiano Amon confirmed Arm \u201chas no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm Architecture License Agreement. We're excited to continue to develop performance leading, world-class products that benefit consumers worldwide that include our incredible Oryon custom CPUs.\u201d\n\nOryon features in the Snapdragon X Series and Snapdragon 8 Elite SoCs that respectively power PCs and high-end smartphones. Both products have won plaudits. The Snapdragon X Series were at one point the only processors Microsoft had certified for powering AI-crammed Windows Copilot+ PCs. Samsung will use only the 8 Elite in its flagship Galaxy S25 smartphones, after previous models shipped with either Qualcomm or its own Exynos parts.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Arm noted in a regulatory filing [PDF] that post-trial motions had been filed on both sides to clarify the legal situation following the jury's verdicts, and a new trial may be sought.\n\nOn its own latest quarterly earnings call, which like Qualcomm\u2019s took place on Wednesday, Arm\u2019s CFO Jason Child was asked about the impact of the case. He said Arm\u2019s revenue forecasts assumed the biz was \"not going to prevail in that lawsuit,\" and that it expected to continue receiving payments from Qualcomm, which licenses various technologies from Arm and doesn't just hold an ALA.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for the lawsuit very much was around defending our IP and that's important,\" Child said. \"But from a financial perspective, we had assumed that we'll continue to be receiving royalties at basically the same rates that they've been paying for in the past and will continue to pay.\"\n\nQualcomm continues to pursue another case against Arm, alleging the UK outfit didn\u2019t honor some of its contractual obligations. Arm reckons that matter will reach the courts in the first half of 2026.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk money and AI\n\nQualcomm\u2019s latest financial figures, which cover the three months to December 29, 2024, record $11.7 billion in revenue, an 18 percent year-on-year jump. Net income grew 15 percent to reach $3.18 billion. $10.1 billion of revenue came from chip sales, the first time Qualcomm topped $10 billion in a single quarter.\n\nArm\u2019s revenue for the three months to December 31, 2024 grew 18 percent year-on-year to reach $983 million. Net income was $252 million, topping the result from the same quarter last year by $28 million (Arm\u2019s net income bounces around a lot).\n\nOn their earnings calls, both companies were asked the question of the moment: Will DeepSeek\u2019s apparently meager appetite for compute power be bad for business?\n\nNeither is troubled.\n\nQualcomm's big cheese was excited by the availability of small-but-powerful large language models (LLMs) that can run on-device, and said his company will ensure sure its silicon make that possible.\n\nArm CEO Rene Haas had a slightly different take, admitting that today\u2019s smartphone chips were designed before LLMs appeared.\n\n\u201cWe're in a phenomenal time in our industry where the compute demands are outpacing the silicon to serve it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get lots of questions about the smartphone market and the AI capabilities to harness what's going on inside there. You have to remember that these smartphones were - the chips for these smartphones were designed two, three years ago, the memory subsystem, the power, everything was predefined.\"\n\n\u201cSo, to be able to fit these small language models or anything that goes inside the phone is quite a challenge given the fact that you still have to run a display, you still have to run an operating system, you still have to run apps,\u201d he added.\n\nArm will try to develop products faster so device-makers have the kit they need to make on-device LLMs sing. Or draw, write, and otherwise improve apps and OSes. Allegedly. \u00ae",

CRN reported in December that Qualcomm was ramping up hiring for key channel sales positions across the world.\n\nWith Qualcomm now offering a competitive alternative to Intel and AMD processors, Houser said it\u2019s integral for channel partners to have the proper resources to ensure business customers are selecting the correct PCs for their workforce.\n\n\u201cFor many years, selling a PC has been simple. Now with multiple PC manufacturers and new chipset architectures, partners must ensure their salesforce is ready to help guide the customer device selection process,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd with Copilot+ PCs featuring a slew of first- and third-party AI features, Houser said it\u2019s important for customers to understand what kind of AI capabilities are available.\n\n\u201cCustomers aren't sure what to do with AI, the benefits of AI, and where certain workloads should live,\u201d where that\u2019s the cloud, the data center or the PC, he said.\n\nIn his Channel Chiefs profile, Houser detailed how his global commercial channel organization has spent the last year influencing businesses and trying to get them to buy Snapdragon X-based PCs through activities with partners.\n\nBetween June and December last year, Houser said, his commercial channel team \u201claunched and executed over 36 channel campaigns\u201d with partners that prompted more than 6,000 business customers to test Snapdragon X-based PCs within the first two quarters of product availability. He added that his team also pushed \u201cmultiple scaled commercial deployments\u201d in the past year.\n\nHouser said his team also \u201cbuilt programs that enable [Qualcomm\u2019s] channel partners to help customers migrate to Snapdragon X series from other architectures, such as Intel or AMD CPUs, which resulted in more than 400 channel-led proofs of concept in the first two quarters of product availability.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to provide customers an \u2018easy button\u2019 approach to the architecture shift, create services revenues for our partners, and drive scaled adoption of Snapdragon X Series in the market,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHouser said other investments his team made over the past year included a 150 percent increase in market development funds, the launch of a \u201clucrative incentive program\u201d to support the launch of Copilot+ PCs as well as the creation of three dedicated commercial partner campaign kits and over 100 partner sales tools and enablement assets.\n\nAmong the areas Houser would like to see partners invest in are \u201cAI ecosystem services and labs to help customers define their AI strategy between edge and cloud,\u201d which should include partnerships with ISVs, hardware vendors and chip vendors on \u201cunique use cases.\u201d\n\nHouse said partners should also invest in \u201ccompelling offers, incentives and services that help drive the Windows 11 refresh to Snapdragon as well as demonstrate the lifecycle benefit of each chipset architecture across hardware.\u201d",

According to analyst Sravan Kundojjala, the company said that 10% of Windows PC sales in the U.S., worth $800 and above, are powered by Snapdragon X chips. This is quite an assertion, especially as it only captured 0.8% percent of the market in the third quarter of 2024, having only sold 720,000 units.\n\n- Auto revenue up 61% y/y to $961M; 6 quarters of q/q growth- On track for $4B+ revenue target for FY26- IoT revenue up 36% y/y to $1.5B; 3 quarters of q/q growth- 80 PC designs (planned/launched) for \u201925; 100+ designs in \u201826- Claims 10% Windows PC retail share in the US\u2026February 6, 2025\n\nThis headline PC shipments figure rings somewhat true, especially with the qualifiers included in the statement. The Windows PC retail market is tied to consumer purchases only, so Qualcomm probably didn\u2019t consider institutional purchases, like those coming from the government and other private businesses. Aside from that, it also only counted PCs worth $800 or more, which is slightly above the average laptop selling price of $750 in 2024.\n\nWhatever the case, we\u2019re going to see more Snapdragon laptops and PCs this coming year. Qualcomm has already announced an 8-core Snapdragon X chip that will bring down prices to around $600, making its devices more accessible for buyers. We\u2019ve also seen mini-PCs with these chips coming to market a few months after the company abruptly canceled its $899 dev kit. These new devices are part of the 80 or so models planned to arrive (or already launched) in 2025, with a further 100+ more coming next year.\n\nWindows on Arm PCs still have a long way to go to reach market share parity with x86_64 devices, especially as they continue to have some compatibility issues with legacy software and gaming. However, they also come with several advantages, especially in the efficiency department. We\u2019ve even seen Snapdragon X Elite laptops lasting more than 15 hours of real-world use on a single charge, finally allowing Windows devices to somewhat catch up with the battery life you can find on Apple's MacBooks.\n\nWith continued development, we might eventually see a time when Windows devices are evenly split between Arm and x86 processors. But it will likely take time, and we can only wait and see if the Qualcomm CEO\u2019s prediction that the Snapdragon X chips will take 50% of the Windows PC market by 2029 will come true.",

The company, as compared to Q1 2024, saw 13% growth in handsets, 61% in automotive, and 36% in its IoT segment which includes PCs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re off to a great start in fiscal \u201825,\u201d CEO Cristiano Amon said. \u201cOur mobile roadmap is the strongest in our history with exceptional traction for Snapdragon in premium-tier handsets, and we\u2019re are delivering growth across our diversification initiatives.\u201d To that last point, Qualcomm is targeting $22 billion in non-handset revenues by fiscal year 2029.\n\nOn the earnings call and in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt, Amon detailed the company\u2019s position in the dynamic AI landscape. \u201cWe started talking about AI on the edge, or on devices, before it was popular,\u201d he told Fortt. And now with the launch of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 model\u2014which is already avialable on Snapdragon-powered devices\u2013Amon talked through the larger opportunity for edge AI.\n\n\u201cOur advanced connectivity, computing and edge AI technologies and product portfolio continue to be highly differentiated and increasingly relevant to a broad range of industries,\u201d he said on the earnings call. \u201cWe also remain very optimistic about the growing edge AI opportunity across our business, particularly as we see the next cycle of AI innovation and scale.\u201d\n\nHe called that next cycle \u201cthe era of AI inference.\u201d The big idea here is around the emerging test-time AI scaling law where techniques applied at inference improve overall model performance without the time-consuming and costly need to re-train the underlying foundation model. This aligns with other trends around model size reduction allowing them to run locally on devices like handsets and PCs.\n\n\u201cWe expect that while training will continue in the cloud, inference will run increasingly on devices, making AI more accessible, customizable and efficient,\u201d Amon said. \u201cThis will encourage the development of more targeted, purpose-oriented models and applications, which we anticipate will drive increased adoption, and in turn, demand for Qualcomm platforms across a range of devices.\u201d\n\nBottomline, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re well-positioned to drive this transition and benefit from this upcoming inflection point.\u201d Expanding on that point in conversation with Fortt, Amon said the shifting AI landscape is \u201ca great tailwind for business and kind of materializes what we\u2019ve been preparing for, which is designing chips that can run those models at the edge.\u201d\n\nHeres more on the emerging test-time AI scaling law, and here\u2019s some commentary from Qualcomm\u2019s Durga Malladi talking edge AI during CES last month.",

On top of that, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance ($10.75 billion at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.2% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $3.41 per share was 14.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy Qualcomm? Find out in our full research report.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Q4 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $11.67 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.94 billion (17.5% year-on-year growth, 6.7% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $3.41 vs analyst estimates of $2.97 (14.9% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $4.75 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.29 billion (40.7% margin, 10.6% beat)\n\nRevenue Guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $10.75 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $10.32 billion\n\nAdjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2025 is $2.80 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $2.71\n\nOperating Margin: 30.5%, in line with the same quarter last year\n\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 36.9%, up from 27.5% in the same quarter last year\n\nInventory Days Outstanding: 111, down from 146 in the previous quarter\n\nMarket Capitalization: $191.3 billion\n\nCompany Overview\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nProcessors and Graphics Chips\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nSales Growth\n\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Qualcomm grew its sales at a solid 10.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n\nQualcomm Quarterly Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Qualcomm\u2019s recent history marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 2.7% over the last two years.",

Its QCT division, which includes sales from physical chips, rose 20% to $10.1 billion.\n\nThe company's adjusted earnings figure excluded items such as expected revenue resulting from the settlement of a dispute, acquisition-related items, as well as research and development expenditures.\n\nQualcomm said net income increased 15% to $3.18 billion, or $2.83 per share, from $2.77 billion, or $2.46 per share, a year earlier.\n\nFor the March quarter, Qualcomm said it expects revenue of between $10.2 billion and $11 billion, which at its midpoint tops LSEG expectations of $10.34 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings of between $2.70 and $2.90 a share. The middle of the range is higher than Wall Street's estimate of $2.69 per share.\n\nHere's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 29:\n\nThe most important market for Qualcomm is mobile handsets, which grew 13% on an annual basis to $7.57 billion in sales. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $7.04 billion in handset sales, or about 5% growth.\n\nThe fastest-growing market for Qualcomm is its automotive business, which grew 61% to $961 million in sales, as long-term contracts for the company's parts and software turn into recorded revenue.\n\nQualcomm saw big demand from customers in China for expensive \"premium-tier\" smartphones, CEO Cristiano Amon told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos. The company also benefited from Samsung's latest Galaxy device using Qualcomm processors exclusively. Qualcomm said it expected handset revenues to grow 10% in 2025.\n\nAmon said on a call with analysts that the company believes the recent release of the DeepSeek R1 AI model is good for Qualcomm, because its chips can run the efficient model locally, instead of in the cloud.\n\n\"DeepSeek R1 and other similar models recently demonstrated that AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable and efficient, and now able to run directly on device,\" Amon said.\n\nQualcomm's Internet of Things, or IoT, business includes low-power chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Qualcomm sells to Meta to power its Quest headsets and Ray-Ban-branded Meta smart glasses. It also includes sales of Snapdragon Elite chips for Windows laptops. The first Qualcomm laptop chips were released in 2024, and Qualcomm said Wednesday that it had 10% market share in laptops over $800.\n\nRevenue in the company's IoT business grew 36% during the quarter to $1.55 billion.\n\n\"The Snapdragon-based Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to exceed expectations as they adopt more AI features,\" Amon said. \"We remain optimistic that we are at the beginning of an inflection point for smart glasses to gain scale as they become wearable.\"\n\nQualcomm also has a licensing business, called QTL, where other technology companies pay it for access to its intellectual property related to 5G and cellular technology. Qualcomm reported $1.54 billion in sales in the division. It said it had signed notable Chinese smartphone maker Transsion to a 4G license, as well as finalized negotiations for long-term licenses with two other Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"We remain very pleased with the execution of our QTL business in recent years, and we're well positioned to maintain fiscal '24 revenue scale going forward,\" Amon said on the call.\n\nQualcomm said it paid $942 million in dividends and spent $1.8 billion on share repurchases during the quarter.\n\n",

Adjusted EPS soared to $3.41, exceeding the analyst estimate of $2.96. Revenue reached $11.67 billion, topping the predicted $10.91 billion. The quarter highlighted significant growth across key segments, particularly in Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), reflecting strong operational execution and market demand.\n\nAltogether, the quarter was marked by significant achievements though potential macroeconomic challenges loom.\n\nMetric Q1 Fiscal 2025 Analysts' Estimate Q1 Fiscal 2024 Change (YOY) Adjusted EPS $3.41 $2.96 $2.75 24% Revenue $11.67 billion $10.91 billion $9.92 billion 18% Adj. net income $3.83 billion - $3.1 billion 24% QCT revenue $10.08 billion - $8.42 billion 20%\n\nAbout Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is an industry leader in mobile innovation, known for its pioneering role in developing wireless technologies such as the Snapdragon chipset platform and 5G technology. It operates primarily through two segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), which develops integrated circuit (IC) products, including mobile semiconductors, and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), which licenses intellectual property essential to wireless communications.\n\nRecently, Qualcomm has been honing its focus on expanding beyond mobile devices to build strengths in the automotive and IoT sectors. These initiatives are critical success factors, allowing the company to diversify its revenue streams and reduce dependency on smartphone-related revenue. Such strategic diversification aligns with its mission to maintain connectivity leadership while tapping into burgeoning markets for smart vehicles and connected devices.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter, Qualcomm posted standout growth across several metrics.\n\nThe Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment, which represents a significant portion of Qualcomm's revenue, saw revenue soar to $10.08 billion, driven by robust performances in handsets, automotive, and IoT sub-segments. In the handsets category alone, revenues rose 13% year over year to $7.57 billion, highlighting the continued success of its Snapdragon platform. Meanwhile, QCT's automotive revenue saw a remarkable 61% increase, reaching $961 million as a result of the growing adoption of its Snapdragon Digital Chassis.\n\nQualcomm's Technology Licensing (QTL) segment generated $1.54 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the previous year. Despite the modest growth, the licensing segment remains a key contributor to Qualcomm's revenue, underpinned by its solid 5G patent portfolio.\n\nOne-time events were largely absent from this quarter's results, providing a clear picture of the company's organic growth. Management didn't declare any significant dividend changes, although the solid financial performance might sustain future shareholder returns. Qualcomm returned $2.7 billion to stockholders, including $942 million in cash dividends paid and $1.8 billion through repurchases of 11 million shares.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nFor the upcoming second quarter, Qualcomm established a revenue guidance in the range of $10.3 billion to $11.2 billion, with an adjusted EPS expectation of $2.70 to $2.90. The adjusted guidance reflects ongoing anticipation of solid demand in its diversified markets, albeit with acknowledged risks from shifting economic landscapes and market transitions.\n\nInvestors should watch Qualcomm\u2019s continued push into automotive and IoT markets, as these areas are expected to play pivotal roles in future growth. Management has set a target of achieving $22 billion in non-handset revenue by fiscal 2029. As the company reduces its reliance on handheld devices, monitoring its strategic efforts to capture emerging markets will be crucial for its sustained momentum.",

            "content": "Qualcomm reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings today although in after-hours trading shares of the fabless chip designer plunged. First-quarter earnings came in at $3.41 per share which was 24% above last year's fiscal Q1 results and the earnings were far beyond the $2.96 earnings per share number that Wall Street expected. Revenue, at $11.67 billion, rose 18% on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit that designs and sells chips to mobile device manufacturers saw its revenue rise 13% year-over-year to $7.57 billion. Wall Street analysts speaking to FactSet were looking for Qualcomm to announce chip sales for mobile products of $7.04 billion which would have been an annual increase of only 5%; Qualcomm more than doubled that estimate. Demand was heavy for Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipsets used on premium, flagship smartphones according to company CEO Cristiano Amon.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalaxy S25 and Qualcomm also reaped the benefits of Samsung's decision to equip all of its Galaxy S25 flagship series handsets with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy application processor (AP). Typically,and Galaxy S25+ units outside of the U.S., China, and Canada would have been powered by Samsung's own Exynos 2500 AP. However, poor yields achieved by Samsung Foundry for 3nm chip production led Samsung to hold off using the Exynos 2500 AP until the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Flip FE are released this summer.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest mobile news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nGalaxy S25 series handsets Last month we told you that Samsung's decision to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy AP on allseries handsets resulted in the sale of 12 million additional Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipsets by Qualcomm . These sales generated $2 billion in added revenue for the San Diego-based Qualcomm. This year, Qualcomm expects the revenue from sales of smartphone chips to rise 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm CEO Amon also pointed out that the company will benefit from the recent release of the DeepSeek R1 AI model out of China. That's because its Snapdragon chips can run DeepSeek on device rather than in the cloud. Qualcomm also sells the chips used by Meta to drive its popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. In addition, the first Snapdragon Elite chips for laptops went on sale last year and already Qualcomm has a 10% market share in chips for laptops priced at $800 and above.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if everything is going good, why did Qualcomm's shares drop $7.98 or 4.54% in after hours trading when the numbers were released? The decline is being blamed on the company's Intellectual Property licensing revenue which has a high profit margin of 75% compared to 32% for chips. A small miss in expectations in this segment ($1.54 billion in revenue versus analysts' expectations of $1.56 billion) led to the sell-off in the stock.To make matters worse, 2025 licensing revenue is expected to be 2% lower than estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n75% of Qualcomm's chip revenue comes from its smartphone customers. The business is not a fast-growing one which has led Qualcomm to seek out sales of chips for high-end Android handsets which carry higher prices and higher margins. Qualcomm needs this business since it will start to lose sales of its 5G modem chips to Apple beginning with the iPhone SE 4 (expected to be released during spring 2025) and continuing later this year with the iPhone 17 line.\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm's fastest-growing business segment is its automotive unit which had a strong 61% gain in fiscal Q1 revenue to $961 million.\n\n",

The company reported earnings of $3.41 per share on revenue of $11.67 billion versus analysts\u2019 predictions of $2.96 per share on revenue of $10.9 billion. Interestingly, QCOM has beaten earnings estimates in its previous nine quarters (including today).\n\nThe most significant segment for the company was the QCT segment, which designs and provides software and other technologies for smartphones and other devices. QCT sales grew by 20% year-over-year to $10.084 billion. Handsets were the major growth driver of QCT sales, as revenue increased 13% to $7.574 billion.\n\nGuidance for Q2 2025\n\nLooking forward, management has provided the following guidance for Q2 2025:\n\nQ2 revenue between $10.2 billion and $11.0 billion versus estimates of $10.36 billion\n\nQ2 EPS of $2.70 to $2.90 compared to expectations of $2.71\n\nAs you can see, the guidance was better than expected. Still, even when combined with the strong Q1 results, the stock price fell in after-hours trading.\n\nIs Qualcomm a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on QCOM stock based on 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 24% rally in its share price over the past year, the average QCOM price target of $198.15 per share implies 12.7% upside potential.

With a strong focus on wireless innovation, it also manages a vast intellectual property portfolio and invests in emerging technologies like 5G and generative AI.\n\nShares of the chipmaker have outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. QCOM stock has risen 21% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 20.8% . On a YTD basis, shares of QCOM are up 11.6%, compared to SPX's 1.8% gain.\n\nIn addition, the San Diego, California-based company has also outpaced the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's ( XLK ) 12.5% return over the past 52 weeks and a 2.1% YTD dip.\n\nShares of QCOM rose 4.3% on Nov. 6 due to stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.69 and revenue of $10.2 billion, driven by robust demand for Android handsets and automotive solutions. Qualcomm reported record automotive revenues for the fifth consecutive quarter, with a 68% year-over-year increase to $899 million, highlighting strong traction for its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform. Additionally, Qualcomm's strong Q1 2025 guidance, projecting revenue of $10.5 billion - $11.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.85 - $3.05, boosting investor sentiment..\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in September 2025, analysts expect QCOM's EPS to grow 8.3% year-over-year to $9.16 . The company's earnings surprise history is promising.

Their earnings will have a lot of influence on the broader market, especially chip-heavy exchange traded funds (ETFs) like SMH\u2014the VanEck Semiconductor ETF.\n\nThe earnings come after DeepSeek-R1, an open-source artificial intelligence model from China, caused a recalibration in the way markets think about spending on AI. R1 can operate on a reduced hardware loadout, which means fewer chips may be needed for AI.\n\nQualcomm is one of the top fabless semiconductor producers, with application not only for AI but also for automotive and mobile applications.\n\nArm\u2019s royalties will be key to its growth because the company produces most of its revenue from royalties from its chip architecture designs. However, AI demand will be in focus as well because its technology is heavily incorporated into AI hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do investors expect?\n\nAnalysts anticipate Qualcomm\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) will cross the wires at $2.96 on $10.9 billion in revenue. That would compare to a year ago when QCOM posted EPS of $2.75 on $9.92 billion in revenue.\n\nAnalysts are neutral to bullish on QCOM, with 22 strong buy and buy ratings and 18 hold ratings. There\u2019s only one sell rating on the stock. The average one-year price target was 199.72, about 15% above Tuesday\u2019s stock price.\n\nARM is expected to post EPS of $0.34 on $949.3 million in revenue, compared to a year ago when EPS was at $0.29 and $824 million in revenue.\n\nRatings on ARM are also bullish to neutral, with 25 strong buy and buy ratings and 13 hold ratings. There are 4 strong sell and sell ratings on the stock. The average one-year price target was 151.75, or about 7% below Tuesday\u2019s trading price.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Qualcomm earnings\n\nQCOM traded with an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 59, meaning volatility is modestly elevated compared to the past 12 months of trading. The options market expects an implied move of +/- 11 points, or 6.4% of Tuesday\u2019s stock price.\n\nJanuary was strong for QCOM, with the stock price gaining 12.57% in the month. That was the best monthly performance since May 2024. If the company delivers a rosy report, the stock could rally and target the recent swing high from November at 182.10, which could offer some resistance. Alternatively, a disappointing report could send prices down toward levels traded in December when it traded at a multi-month low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading Arm Holdings earnings\n\nARM traded with an IVR of 22, meaning volatility is subdued compared to the past 12 months of trading. However, the near-term expirations, such as the Feb. 5 strike, show an expected move of +/- 15.87 points, or 9.7%, which is a larger expected move than QCOM has priced in. This makes the IVR somewhat deceptive in this case because there is still plenty of premium across the chain.\n\nARM performed exceptionally well in January, rising about 29.3%, its best performance since June. An above-estimates earnings report may revive the recent gains and push prices toward the January swing high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. #@fxwestwater\n\nFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\n\nTrade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive Inc. and tastytrade Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.",

            "content": "The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.\n\nCloud Networking Focus: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable their customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.\n\nThe firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies providing various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, Qualcomm Inc. , Motorola Solutions, Inc. and InterDigital Inc. are likely to profit from solid growth dynamics owing to the widespread proliferation of IoT, continued fiber densification and shift to cloud services.\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is poised to capitalize on the healthy demand trends driven by a fast-track 5G deployment and transition to cloud and fiber network infrastructure upgrades. However, large-scale investments for seamless 5G evolution, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels, inflated raw material costs due to macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical conflicts and uncertain business conditions might erode profitability.\n\nStory Continues\n\nShort-Term Profitability at Stake: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East tensions.\n\nUncertainty regarding chip shortage (albeit at a lesser extent) and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and scarcity of other raw materials due to geopolitical unrest are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High customer inventory levels, owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and intense market volatility, pose another headwind for the companies.\n\nFiber Densification: To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the telecommunications industry's scalability, security and universal mobility and propel the wide proliferation of IoT.\n\nExpansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Trends\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #36, which places it in the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nBefore we present a few wireless equipment stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms S&P 500, Sector\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry has outperformed the S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector over the past year.\n\nThe industry has surged 33.3% over this period compared with the S&P 500 and sector\u2019s growth of 23.9% and 25.1%, respectively.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of trailing 12-month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing telecom stocks, the industry is currently trading at 36.47X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 18.92X.

It\u2019s not called Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, as expected, but the 8 Elite is the official sequel to the premier chip found in Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 phones \u2013 and more.\n\nQualcomm is bringing a new level of performance to next-generation Android phones.\n\nThe best news is that the Snapdragon 8 Elite phones list will grow into 2025. OnePlus and Samsung launched the first US smartphones with the chipset in January 2025. According to our extensive list below, they won\u2019t be alone as the year goes on. Qualcomm is bringing a new level of performance to next-generation Android phones.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s official Snapdragon 8 Elite launch event was in Hawaii in October. There, the company hosted The Shortcut and other technology publications to preview and benchmark its next-generation Android chipset. Here\u2019s what we know.\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite phones list\n\nGlobally, the first four Snapdragon 8 Elite smartphones out of the gate are the Xiaomi 15, Honor Magic 7 Pro, Asus ROG Phone 9, and the RealmeGT 7 Pro. The OnePlus 13, which was initially announced in China, launched in January 2025 and Samsung\u2018s trio of Galaxy S25 phones are arriving in the US on February 9.\n\nOnePlus 13\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nXiaomi 15\n\nRealme GT7 Pro\n\nHonor Magic 7 Pro\n\nAsus ROG Phone 9\n\nAsus ROG Phone 9 Pro\n\nSnapdragon 9 Elite is powering the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, OnePlus 13, and almost every flagship Android phone in 2025, offering a \u201cgenerative AI powerhouse,\u201d according to Qualcomm. Its System on a Chip utilizes an 8-core Oryon CPU for more on-device AI and an Adreno 830 GPU for up to a 40% boost in gaming performance.\n\nWhich phones will the Snapdragon 8 Elite be in?\n\nYou can expect all major phone manufacturers to use in their flagships by the end of 2025 \u2013 just not the rumored Google Pixel 10 and Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 Air.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a major star on the Snapdragon 9 Elite phones list, but it wasn\u2019t the first to utilize the Qualcomm chipset.\n\nSamsung is no longer leading the pack, as Chinese phone manufacturers now like to rush out devices with the latest chipset to wow consumers. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even the first in the US. The OnePlus 13 was the first phone in the United States to feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite System on a Chip.\n\nRumored Snapdragon 8 Elite phones list\n\nOfficially, Qualcomm said that Snapdragon 8 Elite phone manufacturers will include \u201cASUS, Honor, iQOO, OnePlus, OPPO, RealMe, Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, and more.\u201d\n\nBased on that information and what we know about last year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 list, here\u2019s our list of rumored Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\n\nXiaomi 15 Ultra\n\nMotorola Razr+ 2025\n\nOppo Find X8 Ultra\n\nVivo iQOO 13\n\nVivo iQOO 13 Pro\n\nZTE Nubia Red Magic 10 Pro\n\nZTE Nubia Red Magic 10 Pro Plus\n\nAmong the Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra may launch next at MWC 2025. The newly unveiled Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is also widely expected to carry the chipset despite its super-slim design.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite specs in all their glory (Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite specs\n\nWe\u2019re basically getting a sneak peek at what the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and other Android smartphones will be capable of three months in advance.\n\nAt the heart of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm's Oryon CPU, an 8-core CPU configuration with two 4.32GHz power cores and six 3.53GHz smaller cores. It'll have both a 45% single-core and 45% multi-core improvement on the 8 Gen 3 chip. Web browsing is expected to be 62% faster. Qualcomm is sticking with DDR5 RAM, but upgrading it to a 5.3GHz dual-channel LPDDR5X RAM.\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite gaming performance\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, Qualcomm says it'll have a 40% performance improvement with a 35% boost in ray tracing via a new sliced architecture. Basically, it seems like Qualcomm wants to match what Apple is capable of with its A18 Pro chipset and ability to run triple-A games on the iPhone 16 Pro series. We'll have performance benchmarks to prove all of these specs soon.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite is kept cool by this large S25 Ultra vapor chamber (Image credit: Matt Swider / The Shortcut)\n\nOne thing to note is that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has a much larger vapor chamber to keep the Snapdragon 8 Elite cool during long gaming sessions. It\u2019s 40% larger than the vapor chamber found inside the S24 Ultra, leading to year-over-year CPU performance gains of 37% and GPU performance gains of 30%.\n\nNew Snapdragon 8 Elite camera (Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite camera ISP\n\nWhile we don't know the Samsung S25 Ultra camera capabilities, the Snapdragon 8 Elite gives us some insight because the Camera ISP allows for 33% more throughput with up to 4.3GP/s. It allows for limitless segmentation (up to 250 different layers) and comes with features like AI relighting, AI Pet Suite and Video Magic Eraser onboard.\n\nJust as important as any of the specs above, all of this power is nothing without energy efficiency. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite is touting a 27% powering savings overall. Breaking down the number, its specs suggest a 44% CPU, 40% GPU, and 45% AI performance per watt.\n\nThe Shortcut will continue to test and review Qualcomm\u2019s new chipset between now and when more phones are added to the list at MWC 2025. Stay tuned for even more benchmarking scores and real-life tests in the next update, according to our findings from the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.",

            "content": "The battle between Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM is heating up as both chipmakers gear up to report earnings.\n\nAs AMD struggles to regain momentum, Qualcomm is riding a bullish wave.\n\nLet's break down the numbers and technical signals to see which stock is primed for a stronger move.\n\nAMD: A Chip Giant Under Pressure\n\nAMD stock has had a brutal year, dropping 33.12% over the past 12 months and down 3.40% year-to-date. Wall Street expects fourth quarter earnings of $1.08 per share on revenue of $7.53 billion, but the stock remains trapped in a strongly bearish trend.\n\nChart created using Benzinga Pro\n\nTechnically, AMD stock is flashing multiple sell signals as it trades below its eight-day, 20-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, reinforcing downward momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) sits at a negative 2.86, and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.50 suggests AMD stock is nearing oversold territory.\n\nHowever, analysts see a silver lining: The most recent ratings from Rosenblatt, Susquehanna and Melius Research set an average price target of $181.33, implying a staggering 57.42% upside.\n\nRead Also: US Stocks Likely To Open Lower As Trump\u2019s Trade War Continues To Impact The Market: \u2018Volatility Is The Toll We Pay To Invest,\u2019 Says Expert\n\nQualcomm: Riding The 5G, AI Wave\n\nQualcomm stock is on the opposite trajectory, gaining 19.73% in the past year and up 12.24% year-to-date. The company is set to report first quarter earnings on Wednesday, with analysts forecasting $2.96 EPS on $10.92 billion in revenue.\n\nUnlike AMD, Qualcomm's technicals lean bullish.\n\nChart created using Benzinga Pro\n\nQCOM stock trades above its eight-day, 20-day and 50-day moving averages, signaling strength, though it remains below its 200-day SMA. The MACD of 3.57 suggests bullish momentum and an RSI of 62.99 indicates there's still room to run before overbought levels.\n\nAnalyst sentiment is more tempered than AMD's, with Barclays, Mizuho and Melius Research setting an average price target of $193.33, implying a 12.75% upside.\n\nThe Verdict: Will AMD Or Qualcomm Dominate?\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Qualcomm holds the edge, boasting bullish momentum and stronger year-to-date gains. AMD, on the other hand, remains in a deep correction but has a high potential upside if it can stage a turnaround.\n\nInvestors betting on a rebound may find AMD attractive at these levels, but Qualcomm appears to be the safer pick heading into earnings.\n\nWith both companies set to report soon, all eyes are on whether AMD can break out of its slump or if Qualcomm will extend its lead in the semiconductor race.\n\nRead Next:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +23.94% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through February 3, 2025. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

            "content": "Cloud Networking Focus: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable their customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment. Short-Term Profitability at Stake: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and Middle East tensions. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage (albeit at a lesser extent) and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and scarcity of other raw materials due to geopolitical unrest are expected to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High customer inventory levels, owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and intense market volatility, pose another headwind for the companies. Fiber Densification: To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the telecommunications industry's scalability, security and universal mobility and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies providing various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is poised to capitalize on the healthy demand trends driven by a fast-track 5G deployment and transition to cloud and fiber network infrastructure upgrades. However, large-scale investments for seamless 5G evolution, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels, inflated raw material costs due to macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical conflicts and uncertain business conditions might erode profitability. Despite short-term headwinds, Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI and InterDigital Inc. IDCC are likely to profit from solid growth dynamics owing to the widespread proliferation of IoT, continued fiber densification and shift to cloud services.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Trends\n\nThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #36, which places it in the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects.

But a leaked shipping manifest has revealed their existence \u2014 including, interestingly, an Ultra Premium version.\n\nCorrelating this with the rumor mill pointing to a launch in the second half of this year, the stars begin to align. If I were a betting man, I\u2019d say Computex 2025 is looking like a mightily tempting place to launch a chip like this.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say Qualcomm\u2019s Arm chip didn\u2019t come with some problems. Issues that other companies have capitalized on, from the x86 CPUs from Intel and AMD not having any of those pesky app compatibility issues, to Apple turbocharging its integrated graphics.\n\nSo with that in mind, what does Snapdragon X2 have to do to not only keep up but get ahead of the laptop pack? I\u2019ve got five ideas.\n\n1. Smoother compatibility\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nYes, I know this is done through software, so it\u2019s more of a Windows problem and not a Qualcomm one. But this is easily the biggest sticking point with Snapdragon X laptops.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

Unlock gaming\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nGaming on a Snapdragon laptop is nowhere near as good as the likes of Intel and AMD\u2026 That being said, it\u2019s really not as bad as you think.\n\nThis deficit comes down to two factors: that compatibility issue I just mentioned, and the underpowered integrated graphics in comparison to the x86 crew. It\u2019s become increasingly clear that more needs to be done in the integrated GPU to match up to what\u2019s going on elsewhere.\n\nI mean, the AMD Ryzen AI Max in the ROG Flow Z13 has been seen to be almost as powerful as a damn RTX 4070 dedicated GPU! There\u2019s some catching up to do here.\n\n3. Laptop companies, design for the chip, not with the chip!\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nFor the first year, Snapdragon X laptops were all about one thing \u2014 taking traditional laptop shells and popping the new Arm chip inside. One question I\u2019ve been asking Qualcomm for a while now is what the reshuffled emphasis on performance and power efficiency in a small chip like this can do for the design of a laptop.\n\nThe answers have been vague, but we\u2019re now seeing more concrete responses with the Asus Zenbook A14 and Honor MagicBook Art 14 . Snapdragon laptops can get away with being a whole lot smaller and a whole lot lighter.\n\nThis looks to be a real strength of going for these notebooks, as you\u2019re seeing x86 systems compromising certain performance metrics in place of portability and weight. Steer into this, laptop vendors.\n\n4. Time for dedicated GPU support\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nQualcomm confirmed that Snapdragon X Elite laptops can support dedicated GPUs\u2026so where are they? I know that Arm gaming is on its way, but it's not quite there yet. However, can you imagine an RTX 50-series Snapdragon laptop?\n\nI know it\u2019s a matter of waiting for that curve to steer more towards Arm, but if (and most likely when) that happens, the bandwidth of that Snapdragon chip paired with a GPU would be crazy for not just performance, but potentially power efficiency too.\n\n5. Make AI have a real impact\n\n(Image credit: Tom's Guide)\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing this happen, as Microsoft is adding a smaller local version of DeepSeek R1 to your Snapdragon machine. Things are moving in the right direction.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that, so far, the Copilot+ PC features have been fun but gimmicky. I used Paint Cocreator all of three times and never opened Paint again. Recall is\u2026well let\u2019s not talk about that until Microsoft figures out the whole privacy thing around it.\n\nIt\u2019s time for that AI PC vision to become a reality. We need local models small enough to run on the NPU, a slicker integration of AI directly into the OS, and less of the \u201clook, that\u2019s cool\u201d things that people end up not caring about.",

Either way, if you\u2019re shopping for one of the best laptops out there, you should probably get a \"made for AI\" machine.\n\nQualcomm and Microsoft started this whole trend off with CoPilot+ laptops. It means you get a PC with brains kinda similar to those of a phone, and a few bespoke Windows 11 features.\n\nIntel wasn\u2019t having any of that, though, so it struck back with its Ultra Series 2 processors, with a lot of the same benefits \u2013 super-long battery life, great peak performance, and not much heat generated.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed just about every CoPilot+ laptop under the sun so far, and have been playing with the top Intel contender Asus Zenbook S 14 OLED for a few weeks. But which is better? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nBut, spoiler alert, if you\u2019re remotely interested in gaming after the work day, then you'll definitely want an Intel Ultra Series 2 CPU laptop (unless you opt for a top gaming laptop in its own right).\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Design\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIt\u2019s slim and light all the way\n\nNo Thunderbolt for Snapdragon PCs\n\nYou currently have more options with Snapdragon\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make a new type of laptop, the basic rule is that it should start off slim, pretty looking and expensive \u2013 if you want to attract the masses anyway. That\u2019s what you get with this AI crowd.\n\nQualcomm is working on a new more affordable mid-tier \u201cmade for AI\u201d range of laptops. But for now, you\u2019re looking at spending a hefty chunk of change on these PCs. They all have metal casings, are light for their screen size, and feel great in use. Across the board, there\u2019s not a true design dud among them, yet.\n\nSign up to the T3 newsletter for smarter living straight to your inbox Get all the latest news, reviews, deals and buying guides on gorgeous tech, home and active products from the T3 experts Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nYou\u2019ll find slightly more design diversity on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite side of the fence right now, mostly because of Microsoft. Its Surface Pro laptop is, just like the older generations, a true hybrid with a screen part and a keyboard that hooks on magnetically.\n\nAt the time of writing, all the Intel Lunar Lake laptops are just that \u2013 laptops. All these laptops, across the board, also have cracking displays. Most of them use OLED panels too. It\u2019s another side effect of these being high-end laptops.\n\nOne key difference between Intel Ultra and Snapdragon laptops, though, is that the latter machines do not support Thunderbolt ports. They\u2019ll most likely have USB 4 connectors instead. These two are the same in terms of port type and are ultra-fast \u2013 just don't offer the same speeds. Laptops with them will typically support connection to up to two 4K monitors. The number and type of connections you get in a particular model are going to be far more important for most folks than Thunderbolt versus USB 4.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Performance\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite has the edge for work\n\nIntel Ultra Series 2 takes an easy win for gaming\n\nThey\u2019re both super-efficient\n\nThere\u2019s a clear split in the performance of Intel Ultra Series 2 Lunar Lake and Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite laptops. The most interesting part? Intel steamrolls Qualcomm for gaming.\n\nWith an Asus ZenBook S14, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s benchmark glides by comfortably at a 48fps average with medium settings, 1080p resolution. The Qualcomm-powered Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 only averages 26fps. That\u2019s a massive 84% additional frames per second for the Intel laptop, heading from jerky to playable.\n\nWe've seen similar results elsewhere in big games through the years. Lord of the Rings: Shadow of Mordor ran 50% better, with a 96fps average to the Qualcomm\u2019s 64fps average. Alien Isolation ran 82% better on the Intel laptop, with 102fps to 56fps. In almost every game, the Intel-powered PC had far better results than the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite one.\n\nYou can play pretty demanding and recent games with an Intel Lunar Lake laptop, without using embarrassingly poor resolutions and graphics settings. It\u2019s going to be much more of a strain with a Qualcomm Snapdragon system. And, sure, while the the snobs will point out neither has the grunt of a dedicated gaming laptop, can those systems play for up to 2.5 hours off battery? And without losing most of their performance? And not cause a racket at the same time? Didn\u2019t think so!\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a flip when we look at raw processor performance, though. By our numbers, the Intel Ultra 7 Lunar Lake laptop is noticeably less punchy on raw CPU power than a Qualcomm.\n\nThis has varied a bit between models of Snapdragon X Elite PCs, even when they have exactly the same specs on paper. It\u2019s likely because there\u2019s a balance of both noise and power consumption when on battery, which matters because the latter is one of the top features of these laptops.\n\nIf you want your laptop to go in all guns-a-blazing, you\u2019ll have to put in a decent fan even with one of these AI laptops. Sure, it\u2019ll only make a fraction of the noise of a gaming laptop or even some older ultraportables, but I\u2019m yet to use a truly fanless one of these laptops. Even the tablet-style Surface Pro 11 has one, where the MacBook Air is currently a fanless design.\n\nBut if you want peak number crunching rather than gaming, Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops win in this fight, albeit with some qualification.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Battery life\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nGreat light use battery life from both camps\n\nThe capacity is going to matter more than anything else\n\nOut tests show Intel may have a slight edge\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops slightly blew minds with their battery life when they arrived. They absolutely trashed the first-generation Intel Ultra crowd, and outlasted the traditional battery-lover\u2019s choice, AMD Ryzen, without a massive drop of performance on battery.\n\nSecond-generation Intel Ultra chipsets then arrived and pretty much did the same thing. In our experience, the longevity of the two breeds of laptop are comparable.\n\nHowever, second-generation Intel Ultra Asus laptop we reviewed did outlast most of the Snapdragon X Elite crowd. It ran for 18 hours of video, and around 2.5 hours of Cyberpunk 2077. There\u2019s perhaps room for Intel to sneak a victory here, but the difference is not worth hinging your purchase decision on.\n\nFor light tasks you\u2019re looking at real-world battery life well into the teens of hours. That\u2019s for jobs like writing documents, video streaming or browsing where you aren\u2019t keeping 17,000 tabs open the entire time. We are guilty of doing that about 94% of the time.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, serious system-straining gaming might leave you with around 2.5 hours of battery life or less. That\u2019s better than a proper gaming laptop, but clearly worse than a Nintendo Switch OLED, whose power draw is reportedly limited to around 6.5W when playing a tough game like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nCompare it to the often sub-60-minute longevity of a hulking gaming laptop, though, and you start to appreciate the flexibility of these new AI PCs.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Compatibility\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nIntel Ultra is better for app compatibility\n\n\u2026but Qualcomm Snapdragon is surprisingly good\n\nBoth run apps like any old Windows laptop\n\nDespite being around for months longer than the 2nd Generation Intel Ultra laptops, Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops have far more compatibility issues. Do most apps work? Sure. Do most games work? Yep. But we have encountered a handful of issues during our testing that just aren\u2019t a problem with Intel Ultra Series 2 generation PCs.\n\nThese include hardware accessories that you plug in but flat-out won't be recognised, some games crashing on start-up, and some apps complaining they need an \u201cx86\u201d system to run.\n\nWithout wanting to get too nerdy on you, this highlights the big difference between Snapdragon and Intel Ultra. The first uses an ARM architecture, once mostly reserved for phones, while even newer Intel Ultra chipsets are still of the classic x86 breed.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been impressed by how well stuff runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and how rarely you need to think about compatibility, you\u2019re likely to encounter issues before too long if you stray from the most popular or basic of apps. This also takes some of the shine off the raw processor power gains of Qualcomm systems. Bear that in mind.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Verdict\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops and ones with second-generation Intel Ultra chipsets are made with the same job in mind. They are here for great battery life and AI-ready chops that can go head-to-head with the best from Apple.\n\nThe best all-rounder for the average buyer right now is probably an Intel Ultra Series 2 laptop, even if it doesn\u2019t win in all areas.\n\nA Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite will win on CPU power, while Intel claims the gaming and graphics victory. Either of those is pretty significant. But the fewer compatibility issues of the Intel Ultra series pushes it over the top for us. However, at the time of writing some will want to wait for more options to appear in retailers.",

Either way, if you\u2019re shopping for one of the best laptops out there, you should probably get a \"made for AI\" machine.\n\nQualcomm and Microsoft started this whole trend off with CoPilot+ laptops. It means you get a PC with brains kinda similar to those of a phone, and a few bespoke Windows 11 features.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntel wasn\u2019t having any of that, though, so it struck back with its Ultra Series 2 processors, with a lot of the same benefits \u2013 super-long battery life, great peak performance, and not much heat generated.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed just about every CoPilot+ laptop under the sun so far, and have been playing with the top Intel contender Asus Zenbook S 14 OLED for a few weeks. But which is better? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nBut, spoiler alert, if you\u2019re remotely interested in gaming after the work day, then you'll definitely want an Intel Ultra Series 2 CPU laptop (unless you opt for a top gaming laptop in its own right).\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Design\n\nCredit: Future\n\nIt\u2019s slim and light all the way\n\nNo Thunderbolt for Snapdragon PCs\n\nYou currently have more options with Snapdragon\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make a new type of laptop, the basic rule is that it should start off slim, pretty looking and expensive \u2013 if you want to attract the masses anyway. That\u2019s what you get with this AI crowd.\n\nQualcomm is working on a new more affordable mid-tier \u201cmade for AI\u201d range of laptops. But for now, you\u2019re looking at spending a hefty chunk of change on these PCs. They all have metal casings, are light for their screen size, and feel great in use. Across the board, there\u2019s not a true design dud among them, yet.\n\nYou\u2019ll find slightly more design diversity on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite side of the fence right now, mostly because of Microsoft. Its Surface Pro laptop is, just like the older generations, a true hybrid with a screen part and a keyboard that hooks on magnetically.\n\nAt the time of writing, all the Intel Lunar Lake laptops are just that \u2013 laptops. All these laptops, across the board, also have cracking displays. Most of them use OLED panels too. It\u2019s another side effect of these being high-end laptops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne key difference between Intel Ultra and Snapdragon laptops, though, is that the latter machines do not support Thunderbolt ports. They\u2019ll most likely have USB 4 connectors instead. These two are the same in terms of port type and are ultra-fast \u2013 just don't offer the same speeds. Laptops with them will typically support connection to up to two 4K monitors. The number and type of connections you get in a particular model are going to be far more important for most folks than Thunderbolt versus USB 4.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Performance\n\nCredit: Future\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite has the edge for work\n\nIntel Ultra Series 2 takes an easy win for gaming\n\nThey\u2019re both super-efficient\n\nThere\u2019s a clear split in the performance of Intel Ultra Series 2 Lunar Lake and Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite laptops. The most interesting part? Intel steamrolls Qualcomm for gaming.\n\nWith an Asus ZenBook S14, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s benchmark glides by comfortably at a 48fps average with medium settings, 1080p resolution. The Qualcomm-powered Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 only averages 26fps. That\u2019s a massive 84% additional frames per second for the Intel laptop, heading from jerky to playable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've seen similar results elsewhere in big games through the years. Lord of the Rings: Shadow of Mordor ran 50% better, with a 96fps average to the Qualcomm\u2019s 64fps average. Alien Isolation ran 82% better on the Intel laptop, with 102fps to 56fps. In almost every game, the Intel-powered PC had far better results than the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite one.\n\nYou can play pretty demanding and recent games with an Intel Lunar Lake laptop, without using embarrassingly poor resolutions and graphics settings. It\u2019s going to be much more of a strain with a Qualcomm Snapdragon system. And, sure, while the the snobs will point out neither has the grunt of a dedicated gaming laptop, can those systems play for up to 2.5 hours off battery? And without losing most of their performance? And not cause a racket at the same time? Didn\u2019t think so!\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of a flip when we look at raw processor performance, though. By our numbers, the Intel Ultra 7 Lunar Lake laptop is noticeably less punchy on raw CPU power than a Qualcomm.\n\nThis has varied a bit between models of Snapdragon X Elite PCs, even when they have exactly the same specs on paper. It\u2019s likely because there\u2019s a balance of both noise and power consumption when on battery, which matters because the latter is one of the top features of these laptops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want your laptop to go in all guns-a-blazing, you\u2019ll have to put in a decent fan even with one of these AI laptops. Sure, it\u2019ll only make a fraction of the noise of a gaming laptop or even some older ultraportables, but I\u2019m yet to use a truly fanless one of these laptops. Even the tablet-style Surface Pro 11 has one, where the MacBook Air is currently a fanless design.\n\nBut if you want peak number crunching rather than gaming, Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops win in this fight, albeit with some qualification.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Battery life\n\nCredit: Future\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreat light use battery life from both camps\n\nThe capacity is going to matter more than anything else\n\nOut tests show Intel may have a slight edge\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon laptops slightly blew minds with their battery life when they arrived. They absolutely trashed the first-generation Intel Ultra crowd, and outlasted the traditional battery-lover\u2019s choice, AMD Ryzen, without a massive drop of performance on battery.\n\nSecond-generation Intel Ultra chipsets then arrived and pretty much did the same thing. In our experience, the longevity of the two breeds of laptop are comparable.\n\nHowever, second-generation Intel Ultra Asus laptop we reviewed did outlast most of the Snapdragon X Elite crowd. It ran for 18 hours of video, and around 2.5 hours of Cyberpunk 2077. There\u2019s perhaps room for Intel to sneak a victory here, but the difference is not worth hinging your purchase decision on.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor light tasks you\u2019re looking at real-world battery life well into the teens of hours. That\u2019s for jobs like writing documents, video streaming or browsing where you aren\u2019t keeping 17,000 tabs open the entire time. We are guilty of doing that about 94% of the time.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, serious system-straining gaming might leave you with around 2.5 hours of battery life or less. That\u2019s better than a proper gaming laptop, but clearly worse than a Nintendo Switch OLED, whose power draw is reportedly limited to around 6.5W when playing a tough game like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nCompare it to the often sub-60-minute longevity of a hulking gaming laptop, though, and you start to appreciate the flexibility of these new AI PCs.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Compatibility\n\nCredit: Future\n\nIntel Ultra is better for app compatibility\n\n\u2026but Qualcomm Snapdragon is surprisingly good\n\nBoth run apps like any old Windows laptop\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being around for months longer than the 2nd Generation Intel Ultra laptops, Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops have far more compatibility issues. Do most apps work? Sure. Do most games work? Yep. But we have encountered a handful of issues during our testing that just aren\u2019t a problem with Intel Ultra Series 2 generation PCs.\n\nThese include hardware accessories that you plug in but flat-out won't be recognised, some games crashing on start-up, and some apps complaining they need an \u201cx86\u201d system to run.\n\nWithout wanting to get too nerdy on you, this highlights the big difference between Snapdragon and Intel Ultra. The first uses an ARM architecture, once mostly reserved for phones, while even newer Intel Ultra chipsets are still of the classic x86 breed.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been impressed by how well stuff runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and how rarely you need to think about compatibility, you\u2019re likely to encounter issues before too long if you stray from the most popular or basic of apps. This also takes some of the shine off the raw processor power gains of Qualcomm systems. Bear that in mind.\n\nQualcomm vs Intel: Verdict\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops and ones with second-generation Intel Ultra chipsets are made with the same job in mind. They are here for great battery life and AI-ready chops that can go head-to-head with the best from Apple.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best all-rounder for the average buyer right now is probably an Intel Ultra Series 2 laptop, even if it doesn\u2019t win in all areas.\n\nA Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite will win on CPU power, while Intel claims the gaming and graphics victory. Either of those is pretty significant. But the fewer compatibility issues of the Intel Ultra series pushes it over the top for us. However, at the time of writing some will want to wait for more options to appear in retailers.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

Meanwhile, the Intel-based, 13.8-inch model starts at $1,499\u2014a staggering $500 more than its Qualcomm-based opponent. Although Microsoft didn't give a starting price for the larger 15-inch model, we're assuming it'll start at $1,799.\n\nYou can now buy a Qualcomm Surface Laptop 7 through Microsoft or other retailers. However, if you want an Intel Surface Laptop 7, you'll have to wait until February 18 to receive it.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 Intel vs. Qualcomm: Display and design\n\nBy looking at them, it'll be difficult \u2014 if not nearly impossible \u2014 to tell the difference between an Intel-based Surface Laptop 7 and a Qualcomm-based one.\n\nMicrosoft's Intel-based Surface Laptop 7 models. | Credit: Microsoft\n\nBoth Surface Laptop 7 models feature a sleek, MacBook-inspired look with the Microsoft logo centered on the top cover and a thin, lightweight chassis.

You'll have a choice between a 13.8-inch (2304 x 1536) 120Hz touchscreen display and a 15-inch (2496 x 1664) 120Hz touchscreen display, whether you go with a processor from Qualcomm or Intel.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 Intel vs. Qualcomm: Performance\n\nPerformance is one of the biggest categories in which these two laptops will differ, with one powered by Intel's Core Ultra Series 2 (Lunar Lake) chip and the other powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite or X Plus chip.\n\nLaptop Mag's Surface Laptop 7 review unit featured a Snapdragon X Elite X1E80100 processor backed up by 32GB of RAM. When we ran the Geekbench 6 overall performance test, the laptop scored an impressive multi-core score of 14,426.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe haven't been able to test one of Microsoft's new Intel-based, 7th-gen Surface Laptops yet, so we don't have our own Geekbench 6 scores to compare. However, Tom's Guide tested an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor in a Dell XPS 13 and an Intel Core Ultra 9 288V processor in an Asus Zenbook S 14 and received multi-core scores of 11,033 and 11,125, respectively.\n\nIt's not clear whether these laptops were equipped with 16GB or 32GB of RAM, which could make a difference in multi-core scores. That said, based on our limited knowledge so far, it looks like Qualcomm has a leg up over Intel regarding raw performance power.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 Intel vs. Qualcomm: Battery life\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the 15-inch, Snapdragon X Elite-powered Surface Laptop 7 features up to 22 hours of battery life for video playback. The smaller 13.8-inch model can last up to 20 hours. Specs for Intel-powered Surface Laptop 7 models suggest similar video playback estimates.\n\nCredit: Future/Rami Tabari\n\nAccording to battery life estimates directly from Microsoft based on \"active web usage,\" the Intel-powered Surface Laptop 7 can last up to 12 hours on the 13.8-inch model and up to 14 hours on the 15-inch model. Alternatively, the Qualcomm-powered Surface Laptop 7 can last up to 13 hours on the smaller model and up to 15 hours on the larger model.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our Surface Laptop 7 review, the laptop lasted 15 hours and 44 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test, which involves continuous surfing through web pages over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness.\n\nFor comparison, Tom's Guide ran a battery test on the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V chip in a Dell XPS 13, which lasted 17 hours and 29 minutes. These aren't identical laptops, and processors behave differently within unique configurations. However, this helps us know what battery life with Intel's new Lunar Lake chips could be like before we get our hands on one to test.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 Intel vs. Qualcomm: App compatibility\n\nWe've come a long way since the first Copilot+ PC launched in July 2024 when it comes to app compatibility on devices running Windows on Arm.\n\nCredit: Future/Rami Tabari\n\nAccording to research from Microsoft, 90% of the time people spend on Copilot+ PCs \u2014 which at the time were solely powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips \u2014 is spent in \"native experiences including popular apps like Chrome, Zoom, Brave, Photoshop, Opera, Slack, Spotify, Private Internet Access, Surfshark, Windscribe, OpenVPN, and many others.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechRadar has a massive list of apps supported natively through Windows on Arm, but Steam is the only one absent. So far, Valve hasn't created a native Steam app for Windows on Arm, and there's no telling when it'll be available or if it's even in the works. Currently, there are emulation workaround solutions, but gaming on a laptop running Windows on Arm is more complicated than on an x86-based laptop.\n\nWith growing native app compatibility, there's a good chance this won't be a deciding factor for much longer when buying an x86-based, Intel-powered laptop vs. a Windows on Arm, Qualcomm-based laptop.\n\nBut for now, I'd suggest listing all the apps you typically use regularly and confirming whether they have native app support for Windows on Arm before you buy.\n\nSurface Laptop 7 Intel vs. Qualcomm: Outlook\n\nUltimately, the battle between an Intel-powered and a Qualcomm-powered Surface Laptop 7 is an extremely close one. Both processors are powerful enough to qualify the laptop as a Copilot+ PC under Microsoft's guidelines, and they'll both feature better battery life than we've seen in years from Windows laptops.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil we get our hands on a Surface Laptop 7 with a new Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processor, we can't definitively declare a winner or say whether one laptop will be better for most people. However, based on battery life and performance estimates we've seen thus far, the Snapdragon X Elite-powered variants seem to have a slight leg up over Intel models.\n\nThe only area where Intel wins out over Qualcomm right now is in regards to native app compatibility, and Qualcomm is quickly catching up. And a year or two from now, nearly all the apps people use on a regular basis could have native Windows on Arm versions.",

            "content": "The Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook is still among the top laptops and stands out as one of the best Chromebooks, even after three years.\n\nIts premium experience sets it apart, especially with its stunning OLED display that rivals pricier laptops.\n\nChromebooks require less power, so they last longer than Windows 11 laptops.\n\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook proves this with its impressive specs, including 8GB RAM, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen2 chip, and Wi-Fi 6.\n\nThese features made it a strong performer in 2021, and continue to deliver excellent performance.\n\nSpecifications\n\nFeature Details Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen2, 2.55GHz Graphics Qualcomm Adreno GPU Memory 8GB LPDDR4 Storage 128GB eMMC Flash Display 13.3-inch OLED, 1920 x 1080p, multitouch, 400 nits brightness Cameras Front: 5MP RGB; Rear: 8MP RGB with autofocus Ports 2 USB Type-C 3.2 Gen1, Pogo pin connector Wireless Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1 Battery 42WHr with Rapid Charge Weight 2.24 lbs (1.02 kg) Dimensions 12.04 x 7.35 x 0.28 inches (305.86 x 186.74 x 7.23 mm)\n\nThe Duet 5 Chromebook has a 13.3-inch keyboard that feels more like those on Ultrabooks.\n\nWhile not the most spacious, it is more accessible and comfortable than the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook.\n\nWith its 16:9 screen ratio and larger size, the device functions like a laptop that can turn into a tablet.\n\nHowever, it is less convenient to use as a tablet than last year\u2019s 10.1-inch model with a 16:10 ratio, which had a cramped keyboard but worked better as a tablet.\n\nThe keyboard on the Duet 5 Chromebook lacks backlighting and remains flimsy, similar to its predecessor.\n\nThe trackpad also has room for improvement, as it creates friction that affects swiping and gestures. However, users can adapt by adjusting the pressure applied.\n\nThe magnetic kickstand issue from the previous model persists. It can be difficult to extend, and adding a pull tab or lanyard could resolve the problem. Unfortunately, the design remains unchanged.\n\nLenovo includes a small slot on the backplate for the Active Pen. You need to buy the pen separately, which costs extra if available.\n\nLast year, buyers found great value in the Duet Chromebook, which started at $279 / \u00a3279 / AU$424.\n\nIn comparison, Lenovo prices the Duet 5 Chromebook at $429 ($499 as tested) and AU$799 in Australia.\n\nThe UK price is much higher, starting at \u00a3899. Lenovo will share updates after explaining the price difference.\n\nThe increased price of the Duet 5 Chromebook reflects its larger size and improved hardware, though the UK pricing remains a notable concern.\n\nThe hardware improvements start with the display. The previous Duet Chromebook featured a 1,920 x 1,200 LCD IPS panel, which was excellent for a 10.1-inch screen.\n\nThe Duet 5 Chromebook lowers the resolution to 1,920 x 1,080 but upgrades to an OLED panel. This change makes the display much brighter and more vibrant.\n\nBoth models are rated 400 nits of brightness, but the OLED panel delivers a far superior visual experience.\n\nThe OLED display alone makes the higher price worth it. The starting price of $429 in the US offers excellent value.\n\nEven the upgraded version with 8GB RAM for $499 provides a 13.3-inch 2-in-1 Chromebook with a 1080p OLED display, which is rarely available under $500.\n\nThe Duet 5 Chromebook also improves on the processor. It replaces last year\u2019s MediaTek P60T chip with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen2.\n\nBoth processors are ARM-based and focus on efficiency rather than raw power.\n\nWhile they don\u2019t match the performance of Intel Core i3 processors in more powerful Chromebooks, the Snapdragon 7c Gen2 offers a significant upgrade.\n\nIn the Kraken JavaScript benchmark, the Snapdragon 7c Gen2 achieved 1,845ms, nearly twice as fast as the MediaTek P60T\u2019s 3,940ms. This performance boost is noticeable during use.\n\nThe Snapdragon 7c Gen2 lags behind other Chromebooks in benchmarks but feels responsive in daily tasks.\n\nPerformance issues are unlikely to stand out unless you compare them directly to models like the Asus Flip C536 or Acer Spin 713.\n\nPerformance Tests\n\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook showed the following results in our benchmark tests:\n\nKraken JavaScript: 1,845ms\n\nOctane 2.0 JavaScript: 23,798\n\nJetstream 2: 83.4\n\nBattery Life (TechRadar movie test): 16 hours and 20 minutes\n\nBuy it if\u2026\n\nYou prefer the top 2-in-1 Chromebook.\n\nThe lightweight design is easy to convert and offers excellent comfort, solid performance, and battery life.\n\n\n\nYou want a Chromebook with OLED.\n\nGetting an OLED screen in a Chromebook is rare but impressive.\n\n\n\nYou need long-lasting battery life.\n\nFew Chromebooks offer battery life like this, reaching 18-19 hours with the correct settings.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Cheap Quarterly Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other cheap quarterly dividend stocks.\n\nGrowth stocks are typically seen as companies with the potential to outperform the market in the future, even if they are currently unprofitable or trading at high valuations. While they offer the possibility of substantial returns, they also come with significant risks. In contrast, value stocks tend to perform well when the broader economy is expanding. These are well-established companies with consistent profits, many of which pay dividends. Investors are drawn to them because they are often perceived as undervalued relative to their true worth. Sectors like banking, utilities, and healthcare fall into this category. Historically, value stocks have outpaced growth stocks for much of the market\u2019s history, but that trend has reversed over the past decade.\n\nOver the past five years, the growth stocks in the Vanguard Fund have surged approximately 111%, with much of the increase occurring after the fourth quarter of 2022. This momentum was largely driven by major tech firms introducing artificial intelligence products and services, which accelerated earnings growth and lifted valuations. Meanwhile, value stocks have struggled to keep pace. Since late 2022, the value stocks in the Vanguard Fund have lagged behind its growth-focused counterpart and have gained only 48% over the past five years. In theory, this gap suggests value stocks could eventually rebound. Many of these companies continue to generate profits and return a portion to shareholders, so at some point, buyers may step in, pushing their performance closer to historical norms.\n\nBy the end of 2024, the value fund was trading at around 16 times its projected earnings for the year, significantly lower than the growth fund, which was valued at approximately 27 times earnings. This represents a roughly 40% discount, compared to the average 30% gap over the past decade, according to Barron\u2019s analysis of FactSet data. This valuation gap makes value stocks look more appealing. If these companies deliver earnings in line with or above analysts\u2019 expectations, they could demonstrate to the market that they are worth more than their current prices suggest, potentially leading to strong stock performance.\n\nAlso read: 15 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nAs noted earlier, value stocks are often associated with dividend payments. These stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. When it comes to dividend investing, dividend growth plays a crucial role. The Dividend Aristocrats Index serves as a key benchmark for dividend-focused strategies, tracking companies that have increased their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\nA report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted that investment strategies focused on income generation tend to display value-oriented characteristics. Stocks with high dividend yields and lower valuations frequently attract investor interest. However, the report also pointed out that the Dividend Aristocrats Index blends both growth and value traits rather than leaning heavily toward one style. A comprehensive analysis of the index from 1999 to 2022 revealed that, on average, 59.04% of its holdings were value stocks, while 40.94% were classified as growth stocks. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best cheap quarterly dividend stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned through Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and selected dividend companies with strong dividend histories and yields of at least 1%, as of January 30. From that list, we picked dividend stocks with forward P/E ratios below 16, as of January 30. The low price-to-earnings ratio shows that they are traded below their intrinsic value. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their P/E multiples. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 15.02\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an American semiconductor company that provides a wide range of wireless technology services. While recent AI developments from DeepSeek have introduced some uncertainty to the market, the outlook for the year remains unclear. However, trends in handset demand and the expansion of AI within the industry are independent factors. Qualcomm has integrated AI into its latest technologies, including IoT and automotive applications. In the IoT sector, AI enhances data analysis directly on devices, improving efficiency for users. Meanwhile, in the automotive segment, AI plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous driving technology. The stock has surged by nearly 18% in the past 12 months.\n\nIn fiscal Q4 2024, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported solid financial performance, with revenue rising 18% year-over-year to $10.24 billion. Net income saw a 33% increase from the same period in the previous year, reaching $3.5 billion. In addition, the company achieved annual earnings per share growth of more than 30% for the fiscal year. The stock has a forward P/E ratio of 15.02, which makes it one of the best cheap quarterly dividend stocks.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is not only recognized for its innovations and portfolio expansion but also for its strong dividend policy. The company maintains ample cash reserves to support its dividend payments, finishing the quarter with $8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It generated $12.2 billion in operating cash flow, an increase from $11.3 billion in the previous year. Demonstrating its commitment to shareholder returns, the company paid out $2.2 billion in dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 20 years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.98%, as of January 30.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 74 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), down from 100 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is more than $3.23 billion. With over 1.8 million shares, Tiger Global Management LLC was one of the company\u2019s leading stakeholders in Q3.\n\nOverall QCOM ranks 6th on our list of the cheap quarterly dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential for QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

            "content": "Career Close-up is a new video interview series where we chat to senior employees in Ireland\u2019s leading multinationals about their career journeys. This week, we talk to Paul Kelleher, VP of engineering at QT Technologies (Qualcomm Ireland) in Cork.\n\nWelcome to episode three of our new Career Close-up series. In partnership with IDA Ireland, we sit down with senior figures from some of Ireland\u2019s most innovative international companies, to get a sense of their exciting career trajectories.\n\nIn our third instalment, Silicon Republic reporter Colin Ryan chats with Paul Kelleher, vice-president of engineering at QT Technologies Ireland Ltd (Qualcomm Ireland). As well as an interest from a young age in maths and physics, a young Kelleher was also very involved in sports, and he credits his sister with his education in engineering at University of Limerick (UL), as she saw his aptitude and put engineering on his CAO form.\n\n\u201cMy sister filled up the CAO form and put down engineering,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cShe knew I was good at solving problems, logistics and logical thinking, so that made her think engineering would be a good fit for me. It turned out to be true, so I\u2019m very grateful to her to have picked my career many years ago.\u201d\n\nIndeed he describes his education at UL as \u201cone of the key points\u201d in his career, and he\u2019s thankful in particular to three of his professors who he says heavily influenced him, and to the cooperative education internship programme there. \u201cI still remember what they taught me today,\u201d he says.\n\nKelleher says the Cork location is ideal from the point of view of working across the time zones during the day in what is very much a global operation there, but he points to many more benefits of living and working in his native city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Cork, so I\u2019m a bit biased, but the universities, the environment, the ecosystem and the technology cluster here in Cork enable us to grow. We\u2019re here in the beautiful Port of Cork, a very vibrant area. It has everything we need: communications, the transport, the talent. We have good neighbours around us and collaboration with other companies, so it\u2019s a good place to live, work and just enjoy.\u201d\n\nKelleher is a great believer in working well and hard, but also having a good work-life balance, something which he says is helped by the demands of his own teenagers. As regards career, Kelleher has plenty of advice for those starting out, but in particular he recommends having a wide skillset. \u201cBuilding broad skills over your career will help you later in life. Be patient, build your communication skills, your network. It\u2019s really important to be connected into a large company like Qualcomm. And enjoy life, I think that\u2019s one of the messages I\u2019d tell myself.\u201d\n\nHe says that when it comes to working in the tech industry, building resilience is key. \u201cThis is a long career in an industry that has ups and downs. You need to build out your skills. Don\u2019t be reliant on one skill, you need skills across multiple areas, everything from writing code, verification, backend, DFT. That will help you become a more well-rounded engineer, that will help you through the difficult times but also help you to appreciate what you have.\u201d Good advice indeed, for any role in the industry.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

            "content": "is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\n\nThe rumors are true. Microsoft is launching Intel-powered versions of its Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7. Available on February 18th, both of these new Surface devices are Copilot Plus PCs, but instead of using Qualcomm\u2019s Arm-based Snapdragon X series of chips, they\u2019ll use Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake processors.\n\nMicrosoft is targeting these models at businesses, much like how it released Intel-only versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 last year. Business customers will now be able to pick between Intel or Qualcomm inside Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 designs that are identical.\n\nThe Intel-powered Surface Laptop 7. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 for businesses will be available starting at $1,499.99, which is $500 more than the starting price of the Qualcomm variant. Two different screen sizes will be available: 13.8-inch and a larger 15-inch model, and both can be configured with Intel Core Ultra 5 or Ultra 7 chips, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. Microsoft is promising up to 14 hours of battery life (based on active web usage) on the 15-inch model and up to 12 hours on the 13.8-inch variant. These estimates are only an hour behind the same figures Microsoft provides for the Qualcomm versions of the Surface Laptop 7.\n\nThe ports on the Intel-powered Surface Laptop 7 are largely unchanged, with Microsoft opting for a USB-A 3.2 port instead of the USB-A 3.1 that ships on the Qualcomm version. There are also two USB-C 4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports, the Surface Connect charging port, and a headphone jack. Microsoft is also using the same PixelSense displays on the Intel variant of the Surface Laptop 7 as the Qualcomm version.\n\nMuch like the Surface Laptop 6 for businesses, Microsoft is shipping an optional smart card reader in certain markets. Microsoft is also launching a 5G version of the Surface Laptop 7 later this year, and the company plans to share more details on this model \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe Intel-powered Surface Pro 11 is largely identical to the Qualcomm version. Image: Microsoft\n\nThe Surface Pro 11 for businesses is also largely identical to the Qualcomm version, but it starts at $1,499.99 instead of the $999.99 starting price of the Qualcomm version. You can pick between a 13-inch LCD or OLED panel, with both displays the same as on the Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro 11. Businesses will be able to configure the Intel-powered Surface Pro 11 with Core Ultra 5 or Ultra 7 processors, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of storage.\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t made any changes to the ports on the Intel Surface Pro 11, so there are two USB-C 4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports and a Surface Connect for charging. If you want to use headphones on the Surface Pro 11, you\u2019ll have to use Bluetooth-powered ones or connect a wired pair over USB-C. The Surface Pro 11 also has a built-in NFC reader to support security keys like the YubiKey 5C NFC.\n\nBoth of these Intel-powered Surface devices come just months before Windows 10\u2019s end of support on October 14th. Microsoft is now pitching these Copilot Plus PCs as upgrade devices for businesses that are transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11. As they both include NPUs capable of Copilot Plus features, they\u2019ll be able to access the latest Windows AI features including Recall and Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered Windows Search.\n\nMicrosoft is also tempting businesses with a new USB 4 dock that will also be available on February 18th, priced at $199.99. Designed to work with all Surface devices with a USB-C port, the dock supports two 4K displays at 60Hz and includes 65-watt passthrough charging and up to 40Gb/s for data transfers. Front-facing ports include a single USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port and a USB-C 4 Gen 3 port, while at the rear, there is a single USB-C 4 Gen 3 port, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and a USB-C connector for the 100-watt power supply.\n\nMicrosoft is opening up business preorders for the Intel-powered Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 today, and both devices ship on February 18th.",

            "content": "Investors in Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 14th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the QCOM options chain for the new March 14th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.\n\nThe put contract at the $170.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.65. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $170.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $162.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of QCOM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $171.34/share today.\n\nBecause the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.50% return on the cash commitment, or 38.23% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Qualcomm Inc, and highlighting in green where the $170.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $180.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of QCOM stock at the current price level of $171.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $180.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.35% if the stock gets called away at the March 14th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if QCOM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Qualcomm Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing QCOM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $180.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\nConsidering the fact that the $180.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.30% boost of extra return to the investor, or 28.02% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 42%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 39%.\n\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $171.34) to be 38%.

According to the Windows Blog, the feature will first arrive on Qualcomm Snapdragon X PCs, to be followed by Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) and other chips. The initial release will feature DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, which an AI research team from UC Berkeley has discovered is the smallest model that delivers correct answers, but larger models featuring 7 billion and 14 billion parameters will arrive shortly thereafter.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s optimizations meant that it needed 11x less compute versus its Western competitors, making it a great model to run on consumer devices. However, it also uses Windows Copilot Runtime so developers can use on-device DeepSeek APIs within their apps.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft claims that this NPU-optimized version of DeepSeek will deliver \u201cvery competitive time to first token and throughput rates, while minimally impacting battery life and consumption of PC resources.\u201d This means that Copilot+ PC users can expect the power and performance of competing models like Meta\u2019s Llama 3 and OpenAI\u2019s o1 while ensuring that the devices it\u2019s installed on still offer great battery life.\n\nThat said, DeepSeek\u2019s availability on Copilot+ PCs is geared more toward programmers and developers instead of consumers. Perhaps Microsoft is using it to encourage them to build more apps that would take advantage of AI PCs as many people still don\u2019t see the need for it and market research suggests users only purchase these devices because they\u2019re the only available option nowadays.\n\nAnother thing that got us curious is Microsoft\u2019s preferential treatment for Qualcomm Snapdragon X PCs at this time. While it launched the Copilot+ branding with these chips last July, the latest mainstream Intel and AMD laptops now also have built-in NPUs. AMD has even released instructions on how users can run it on Ryzen AI CPUs and Radeon GPUs, with the company even claiming that the RTX 7900 XTX runs DeepSeek better than the RTX 4090.\n\nWhatever the case, we\u2019re still excited about the possibilities that DeepSeek unlocks for AI. Since it\u2019s open source, nearly anyone can download it and run it locally, allowing others to build upon the advancements and optimizations the original model has put into place.",

            "content": "Microsoft switched the Surface Pro tablet and both sizes of Surface Laptop from Intel and AMD's processors to Qualcomm's Arm-based processors last summer, part of a renewed hardware and software push to make the Arm version of Windows a thing. That ended a few years of a bifurcated approach, where the Intel and AMD versions of Surface PCs were the \"main\" versions and the Arm variants felt more like proof-of-concept side projects.\n\nBut if you work in a large organization or you're an IT administrator, the bifurcated approach continues. Microsoft announced some business-only versions of the Surface Pro tablet and the Surface Laptop last year that continued to use Intel processors, and today it's announcing two more, this time using Intel's Lunar Lake-based Core Ultra CPUs.\n\nThe refresh includes a new Surface Pro tablet and both 13- and 15-inch versions of the Surface Laptop, updated with most of the same design tweaks that the Qualcomm versions of the devices got last year (for example, a slightly larger 13.8-inch screen on the smaller version of the Surface Laptop, up from 13.5 inches). Generally, they have similar dimensions, weights, and configuration options as their Arm counterparts, including an OLED display option for the Surface Pro.\n\nOfficially, Microsoft refers to the devices as the Surface Pro 11th Edition for Business and the Surface Laptop 7th Edition for Business, the same generation numbers it uses for the Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon versions it sells to consumers.\n\nWhy the business-specific branding? Microsoft's x86-to-Arm app translation layer, now called Prism, is capable of running many legacy apps, and it has become much more common for developers to release both x86 and Arm-native versions of their Windows apps. But Windows and x86 processors were closely intertwined for decades, and lingering compatibility issues remain. Companies and other large organizations are more likely to have made large investments in obscure software or hardware that uses specialized drivers, things that can't be translated automatically by Prism and whose developers are less incentivized to prioritize niche features like Arm compatibility.\n\nThe Lunar Lake processors include a neural processing unit (NPU) fast enough to qualify for Microsoft's Copilot+ PC label, which unlocks a few AI and machine learning-related features that aren't available on most Windows 11 PCs. At this point, many of those features are still in preview, including the overhauled Windows Recall, a feature called Click To Do that \"identif[ies] text and images on your screen that you can take actions with,\" and an updated Windows Search that tries to do a better job understanding plain-language queries. For now, at least, it's worth noting that the Snapdragon Copilot+ PCs are all getting these features first, and so far, Intel and AMD PCs have gotten them weeks later.",

As of 31 December, the two cities comprised 81 percent of the REIT\u2019s portfolio by leasable area.\n\n15% Rent Escalation\n\nAt the stated compensation, Mindspace REIT is paying its sponsor the equivalent of INR 1,406 per square foot for the 2023-vintage asset, with the deal priced at a 7.5 percent discount to the average of two independent valuations.\n\nMindspace REIT\u2019s new slice of Commerzone Raidurg is leased to Qualcomm for another 12 years, with the US tech giant paying INR 69 per square foot per month for the full building deal. Rents are set to rise 15 percent every three years under the terms of the lease.\n\nMindspace REIT is financing the acquisition by issuing INR 6.13 billion in new units, with INR 13.8 billion to be secured through debt and an additional INR 440 million financed from other sources.\n\nMindspace had rights of first offer for the property located 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from Raidurg Metro station in Hyderabad\u2019s Madhapur area under a pre-existing agreement.\n\nThe deal is Mindspace REIT\u2019s second Hyderabad acquisition in the last three months, after the trust\u2019s board in October approved the INR 2.75 billion purchase of 260,000 square feet of space in K Raheja\u2019s Mindspace Madhapur Park in the city from a third party.\n\nIn its quarterly financials released last week, the trust said that it is evaluating an opportunity to acquire an additional Hyderabad office asset from a third party.\n\nHyderabad on the Rise\n\nIn a statement, Mindspace REIT CEO Nair said he expects vacancy in Hyderabad to drop significantly, as well as in Bengaluru, Pune, and Gurugram, as demand outpaces supply, helping to push up rents.\n\nOccupiers leased a record 12.3 million square feet of office space in Hyderabad in 2024, according to a Cushman & Wakefield report this month. Deals exceeding 100,000 square feet accounted for 56 percent of leasing in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the consultancy, largely driven by requirements from global capability centres, which are commonly used to provide outsourced services to multinationals.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, there are more than 355 global capability centres in Hyderabad including facilities serving Microsoft, Amazon, and Wells Fargo.\n\nOther investors also picked up Hyderabad office assets in the past year. In May, Singapore sovereign fund GIC and private equity firm Xander Investment Management teamed up to buy a business park in the city for ($260 million), with CapitaLand India Trust agreeing during that same month to acquire 2.5 million square feet of office properties in the city.",

            "content": "The market expects Qualcomm (QCOM) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $10.92 billion, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.93% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm?\n\nFor Qualcomm, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.34%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Qualcomm will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of $2.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.69, delivering a surprise of +5.08%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nQualcomm appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\n7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days\n\nJust released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Breaks Silence On DeepSeek AI Sell-Off & Discusses These 12 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off.\n\nOn the day that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock bled 17% in the wake of investors panicking about Chinese AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s low development costs for AI, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the topic. Cramer has been one of the biggest fans of the GPU company, and right off the bat, he started out by sharing that the key thing to consider now is whether the GPU orders for the firm will materialize.\n\nHe also commented on \u2018traveler stocks\u2019 or those that have benefited from the broad AI sentiment. Cramer shared \u201cWhat I find most interesting is that, the fellow travelers to these are the nuclear stocks that have been up a lot. . . .Are the memes. Are the crypto.\u201d He commented that the fact that these stocks were all simultaneously losing value was not great for the market. According to Cramer, \u201cSo looks [like] they are all you know one stock and that is not good. That\u2019s not good because that says you have hype and froth in here that has to come out no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his experience using DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model. In his previous remarks, Cramer revealed that he was a fan of ChatGPT and had used OpenAI\u2019s product to research stocks ahead of his appearances on CNBC. However, he wasn\u2019t impressed by R-1. Cramer outlined that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of R-1 that left him unimpressed was censorship. \u201cThis is a Chinese product,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo when I put into my very helpful DeepSeek, what famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank? And it initially says, the famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he added. While this is all good, soon after the initial response, R-1 \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope,\u201d according to him.\n\nWhen co-host Carl Quintanilla asked him whether it was worth buying any of the AI stocks, Cramer was rather direct. He shared \u201cI don\u2019t have the knowledge to be able to make that decision. It\u2019s better to own that.\u201d Cramer also noted that before Monday\u2019s appearance, there was a debate about whether \u201ccan we just make a determination, or is the determination that we don\u2019t want to let anybody down so we can\u2019t make that?\u201d Given the absolute bloodbath in the premarket that day, he felt \u201clike, whatever you do, maybe twisted between now and the opening.\u201d As a result, Cramer shared \u201cBut sometimes you have to admit, like if you were at the hedge fund you\u2019d just say, you know I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s not a cop-out. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\n\nHowever, with respect to the doubt surrounding AI, he added \u201cWhen in doubt do you go against Zuckerberg? Do you go against Ellison? And I come back and say, I don\u2019t know. Sometimes it\u2019s better to say I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLike social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s AI, DeepSeek is also open source. When asked about whether being open source threatens the ecosystem, Cramer replied \u201cYeah I know that, again, I don\u2019t want to front row Mark Zuckerberg on what he\u2019s saying, but I would say that we do have tremendous chip allocation problems here. And I know that David, we, if you have open source, would you think, that you do not need as many chips. Right. Not necessarily.\u201d\n\nThe sell-off in tech stocks did make him feel that \u201cit\u2019s not such a bad idea to look away from one moment and go back and say the healthcare rotation was so powerful last week.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 74\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the largest semiconductor designers in the world. The firm\u2019s shares struggled in 2024 and closed the year with just 8.7% in gains primarily due to sluggishness in the global smartphone market. More than two-thirds of its revenue comes from the smartphone industry, and the woes were exacerbated due to the slowdown in China. However, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\u2019s smartphone exposure also meant that the stock was unfazed as investors rotated out of enterprise-facing AI stock names. The share performance didn\u2019t skip Cramer\u2019s attention either:\n\n\u201cWhat are the second day\u2019s rally? It\u2019s very cheap, Apple not going down, Qualcomm not going down makes no sense whatsoever but there are adherents of Qualcomm.\u201d\n\nOverall, QCOM ranks 6th on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This discovery comes from a shipping document shared by Everest (also referred to as Olrak29_). It builds on prior leaks from last year, where Qualcomm\u2019s secretive \u201cProject Glymur\u201d appeared alongside the codename \u201cSC8480XP.\u201d Early testing around mid-2024 hinted at a potential \u201cSnapdragon X Elite Gen 2\u201d series for desktop platforms, suggesting that Qualcomm is pursuing a broader range of use cases for these next-generation processors. Qualcomm has acknowledged efforts to develop new in-house Oryon CPU cores for a 2025 release, focusing on artificial intelligence capabilities and enhanced efficiency. Reports indicate that the second generation of these cores is intended for smartphones, while the third generation will address more intensive computing scenarios such as AI-centered PC systems.\n\nThe leaked reference to an \u201cUltra Premium\u201d model implies a product tier beyond the existing \u201cElite\u201d category, though official performance metrics have not been disclosed.

            "content": "Amid the race to compete in artificial intelligence (AI), investors interested in this sector have tended to ignore Qualcomm (QCOM 3.05%). Part of the reason for this is that the longtime leader in smartphone chipsets is at a bit of a crossroads regarding its future as it seeks to diversify its product offerings away from smartphones. Additionally, the struggles Apple is seeing selling AI-enabled phones and the fact that Apple appears ready to drop Qualcomm as a chipset supplier have led some investors to sour on the semiconductor stock.\n\nGiven the uncertainties and headwinds for the company, it may surprise investors that Qualcomm is likely in a strong position to prosper in 2025 and its shareholders to benefit, regardless of what happens in the broader market. Here's why.\n\nQualcomm and AI\n\nAs mentioned, Qualcomm's chipsets have long led the chipset market. As the 5G upgrade cycle has cooled, the company has pivoted to designing AI-enabled chips. To that end, it has developed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip for this purpose, and it should improve on its capabilities with the upcoming release of a Gen 4 chip.\n\nAmong the functions that such chips can offer are enhanced photography, real-time language translation, and facial recognition. Admittedly, these features have not motivated consumers to upgrade in large numbers, but as the full potential of AI becomes better known, Qualcomm has better positioned itself to capitalize on the technology when consumers are ready.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm has worked to incorporate AI into its newer technologies, such as IoT and automotive. On the IoT side, AI can help users analyze data on their devices, increasing efficiency for users. In its automotive business, AI is the technology that makes autonomous driving possible. In fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 29), automotive was only 7% of Qualcomm's revenue. However, since it grew by 55% over the previous year, it could become a critical driver in Qualcomm's stock performance over time.\n\nFurthermore, Qualcomm's AI has expanded into PCs, where it will compete with Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Considering its use of AI in numerous areas, Qualcomm appears to be evolving into an increasingly critical AI company.\n\nAdmittedly, the recent AI-related news from DeepSeek brings uncertainty to the AI market, and how it will perform this year is not yet known. Nonetheless, handset demand and the growth of AI in the automotive sector are separate matters. Moreover, Grand View Research forecasts AI's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at an astounding 37% between 2024 and 2030.\n\nThe Grand View estimate came before the DeepSeek news. However, even if DeepSeek reduces the cost and growth of AI, the rising demand for Qualcomm's products should help the stock regardless of what happens to the overall market.\n\nQualcomm's financial performance\n\nIts successes in AI appear to be already helping the company's financials. Although Qualcomm's overall performance may not excite growth investors at this moment, its financial performance should bring stability to the stock. In fiscal 2024, revenue of $39 billion grew by 9%. This represents a reversal of the revenue decline in fiscal 2023, as rising demand for handsets and automotive products drove the growth.\n\nMoreover, over that time, costs and expenses rose by only 3%. That allowed Qualcomm to report a net income of more than $10 billion, an increase of 40% from year-ago levels. Indeed, fiscal 2025 looks like more of the same, as consensus estimates point to 9% revenue growth again. That may explain why the stock rose by only 14% over the last 12 months.\n\nStill, the case for it performing well regardless of the market's performance hinges heavily on its valuation. As of now, its P/E ratio is only 19. That is far below all of its major peers, including its manufacturing partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which has historically sold at a discount to chip design companies like Qualcomm.\n\nThe low earnings multiple also makes it less vulnerable to a sell-off in a down market and more likely to rise if the overall market increases. Thus, as long as Qualcomm can match or exceed the aforementioned growth expectations, its stock is in a position to rise irrespective of the market's direction.\n\nQualcomm as a winner\n\nConsidering its technical lead and financial condition, Qualcomm stock is likely to win in 2025 regardless of the broader market's performance. To be clear, the likely loss of Apple as a customer will be a huge setback. So too is the fact that the AI-driven upgrade cycle in Apple iPhones has so far not translated into the rapid revenue increases that growth investors would like to see.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm has registered enough growth in other segments of the business to bring about a recovery. Additionally, it is fostering new revenue sources, and the AI-driven potential of its automotive platform is showing particular promise. With its P/E ratio mired in the teens, the improving profits should limit its potential downside and drive gains over the course of 2025.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

            "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Qualcomm, a relative newcomer to the highly fragmented market for advanced driver-assistance system technology, appears to be gaining traction with its Snapdragon Ride software platform \u2013 most notably with a low-cost system that combines cockpit and ADAS functionality in a single SoC.\n\nRide combines Qualcomm\u2019s latest-generation perception stack with automated-driving software developed with BMW. It will be available on BMW\u2019s Neue Klasse vehicles, beginning with the iX3 model later this year, and Qualcomm is making the co-developed platform available to other automakers as well. The technology is targeted for production vehicles in more than 60 countries, Qualcomm says.\n\nThe U.S.-based chipmaker ultimately will offer four versions of Snapdragon Ride. Its entry-level Assist system provides Level 2 functionality (eyes-on, hands-on) for highway and some urban driving and functions with a single vision sensor. It\u2019s available as a turnkey solution that offers automakers basic ADAS capability without significant customization opportunities.\n\nA step up is Qualcomm\u2019s Pilot software that is similar to what BMW will deploy. It delivers Level 2-plus capability (eyes-on, hands-off) and functions with inputs from five to seven sensors (camera, radar), including a driver monitor camera, and offers automakers more options to customize functionality for their brands.\n\nPlanned for release in 2027 are two higher levels of Ride based on Qualcomm\u2019s more powerful Snapdragon Elite line of chips launched in October. The Pilot Plus technology is a Level 2-plus system that takes feeds from 11 camera and radar sensors that provide road data at a distance up to nearly 1,000 ft. (300 m). The premium Pilot Max promises Level 3 driving (eyes-off, hands-off) that will incorporate up to 12 sensors, including an optional forward-facing lidar.\n\nPilot Max also makes use of Agentic AI, meaning it will be able to perform tasks independently, learn from its experiences and adapt to changing situations. An example might be the vehicle automatically avoiding a known pothole on a frequently traveled route.\n\nAll the Ride systems have crowd-sourced 3D mapping data available (provided by Qualcomm ecosystem partner Mapbox) but can function solely off inputs from the cameras and other sensors, if automakers prefer to forgo the extra layer of precision.\n\nOf particular note is ground being made with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Ride Flex platform, which combines cockpit and ADAS functionality on one chip. It was demonstrated flawlessly in early January at CES 2025 here along with vehicles equipped with the Pilot system and the still-in-development Pilot Max automated-driving stack.\n\nRide Flex appears to be winning applications, particularly in China and emerging markets such as India, where it\u2019s relatively low-cost, but the company also says it is beginning to draw interest in the more mature European and U.S. markets. Qualcomm officials say automakers can save 25%-50% with Flex compared with the cost of employing two distinct SoCs to operate the digital cockpit and control ADAS functionality individually.\n\nAlthough the industry has been cautious when it comes to embedding critical ADAS operations on the same chip as cockpit controls, insiders believe Qualcomm successfully has demonstrated Flex is safe and say automakers rapidly are warming up to the concept of a single SOC for cockpit and ADAS management. They predict the cost advantages ultimately will make the Flex platform \u2013 or similar solutions \u2013 the standard for entry-level vehicles even in mature markets, and they expect Flex to reach a global-application production scale by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cWe believe this platform should become the de facto choice for a lot of solutions,\u201d says Rajat Sagar, vice president of Autonomous Driving Products.\n\nAmong the wins for Qualcomm is a collaboration with Hyundai Mobis announced at CES that will see the Snapdragon Ride Flex SOCs and automated-driving stack combined with the Korean supplier\u2019s software controlling advanced cockpit features, instrument clusters and driving and parking solutions.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nQualcomm's ambitions to dominate the ARM-based laptop market took another step forward with the apparent shipping of the Snapdragon X2 Ultra (Premium?) chip, as revealed by recent shipping logs spotted by enthusiast and occasional leaker Everest (@Olrak29_ on X/Twitter). The logs, dated around New Year's, reference \"SNAPDRAGON X2 ULTRA PREMIUM 12CH X20,\" confirming the chip's branding and possibly the core count\u201412 cores, matching the Snapdragon X Elite. While \"Ultra Premium\" could be an internal moniker, the logs suggest this is Qualcomm's next big swing in the laptop chip arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom NBD.ltd. Spotted by Everest.\n\nThe Snapdragon X2 Ultra (Premium?) is likely to be the final form of the \"Glymur\" chip leaked in October 2024 by German site WinFuture . That first report indicated that Qualcomm began testing Glymur samples as early as July, using the internal model number SC8480XP. For context, current Snapdragon X processors, including the X Elite, are purportedly based on the SC8380XP platform and carry the codename \"Hamoa.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps not the world-beating performance some expected, but absolutely competitive. (Native ARM code.)\n\n\n\nThis development follows last year's success of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors, which showed that ARM-based designs could hold their own against AMD and Intel, at least on native code. Qualcomm's commitment to improving their custom Oryon cores\u2014which debuted in the first-gen Snapdragon X series \u2014is evident. At their Investor Day in November of last year, the company confirmed they are skipping directly to a third-generation Oryon design for 2025. Details remain scarce, but the move signals an aggressive development strategy.By its own word, Qualcomm is positioning itself to capture 50% of the non-x86 laptop market by 2029, a bold target given the competition. Besides Apple, there's also NVIDIA, who is rumored to be entering the laptop CPU market with a new processor developed in partnership with Mediatek . Still, the Snapdragon X2 Ultra Premium hitting this shipping milestone shows the company is moving quickly to secure its foothold.Obviously, we have no idea how the X2 Ultra's performance compares to existing Snapdragon X chips, but the branding suggests it will be Qualcomm's most ambitious laptop processor yet. Enthusiasts and analysts alike will be watching for official announcements, likely within the next few months. Qualcomm's latest chip could mark another leap forward for ARM in laptops\u2014and a major headache for x86 incumbents.",

Instead, Samsung decided to equip all of the phones in the Galaxy S25 line with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. Because Samsung decided to go with Qualcomm's chipset on all Galaxy S25 units this year, the chip designer was able to sell Samsung an additional 12 million units of its flagship application processor running at a higher speed for Galaxy phones.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalaxy S25 series is 100%. Those incremental Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy APs brought Qualcomm an extra revenue gain of $2 billion according to JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee who continues to give Qualcomm's stock an overweight rating. Based on the $2 billion Qualcomm took in for selling 12 million additional application processors to Samsung, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy was priced at $166.67 for each chipset. While Qualcomm had a 70% share of the chipsets used on the Galaxy S24 line, its share of theseries is 100%.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest Android news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nThe extra $2 billion coming into Qualcomm's coffers will translate into an additional 63 cents for Qualcomm's 2025 earnings per share (EPS). That amount is 5% of the consensus Wall Street forecast for the fabless San Diego chip designer's 2025 EPS. Qualcomm introduced its own Oryon CPU cores in the Snapdragon 8 Elite AP replacing the CPU cores Qualcomm used to license from Arm Holdings. The \"For Galaxy\" custom chipsets have a peak CPU core performance speed of 4.47GHz compared to 4.32GHz on the regular variant.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A new video shows that the AAA title that launched in 2018 can run well on a Snapdragon 8 Elite, but the visual quality needs to take a hit.\n\nWhile Red Dead Redemption 2 never touches 60FPS on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a new video shows that it is more than playable\n\nA video uploaded to the Chinese platform Bilibili was spotted by @NoI_Revenant, providing crystal clear evidence that the Snapdragon 8 Elite can easily run Red Dead Redemption 2. In the comments, it is mentioned that Winlater was used to emulate the game, as it can deliver an above-satisfactory experience without hammering the framerate too much. As for the video settings, there is no proof that Red Dead Redemption 2 is running at the highest settings, but the person who uploaded the clip mentions that the game was probably running at the lowest quality.\n\nEven then, it is remarkable how far smartphone chipsets have come, and more evidence of that comes from our previous reporting, which mentioned that the Snapdragon 8 Elite can obtain a whopping 160FPS in Red Dead Redemption, which is the first installment. However, remember that the same game gives the RTX 4070 zero problems when running at the 8K resolution, but it is still a worthy achievement for the Snapdragon 8 Elite. A more impressive feat was that the SoC managed to run Cyberpunk 2077 at 60FPS but at low settings.\n\nRED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 RUNNING ON SNAPDRAGON 8 ELITE \ud83d\ude32 THE FUTURE OF MOBILE GAMING IS ANDROID \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/hV2ZPyHgTx \u2014 \u20a6\u00d81 \u5341 \u2c64\u0246V\u0246\u20a6\u20b3\u20a6\u20ae \u2122 (@NoI_Revenant) January 27, 2025\n\nIn related news, we talked about how the Snapdragon 8 Elite managed to obtain above 60FPS in A Plague Tale: Innocence, which is a testament to its gaming performance, but it is surprising now developers are ignoring its capabilities and refusing to port their titles.

However, in the current market, the SoCs have been overshadowed by the new releases, such as AMD's Strix Point APUs and Intel Lunar Lake chips, showing that there is need for Qualcomm to come up with a second iteration, and it looks like they are already in development, as SKUs have surfaced up on shipping manifests (via Olrak_29).\n\nWhile the shipping manifests have revealed any specifics about Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon X2 lineup, it is safe to say that they are already in the development process. The manifests possibly point at ICs in the supply chain right now, and interestingly, there's mention of \"Ultra Premium\" with the SKU's name, suggesting that the San Diego chipmaker might introduce a new lineup alongside its mainstream \"Elite\" series, but that is uncertain for now.\n\nWe reported a while back on Snapdragon X2 SKUs, where it was revealed that there were SKUs coming with the SC8480XP naming scheme, which utilizes the \"Glymur\" or \"Project Glymur\" codename, and were tested back in Q3 2024. Back then, it was stated that these SoCs were in pretty early stages of development, so it is safe to say that Qualcomm's 2nd-generation Snapdragon laptop chips won't debut anytime soon.\n\nThe information around Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 chips is pretty slim, except for the fact that they will debut with next-gen Oryon cores, and will come with higher core-counts. If the \"Ultra Premium\" lineup does exist, it will certainly feature the top-end SoCs from Qualcomm, competing with the higher-end offerings from AMD and Intel. As far as when we can expect the new lineup to arrive, H2 2025 is the timeline mentioned in previous rumors, and the surfacing up of shipping manifests does make us believe that it is possible.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nAI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain.\n\nThe report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan.

            "content": "Why Samsung cannot abandon Exynos development\n\nBy Nam Hyun-woo\n\nSamsung Electronics\u2019 businesses for smartphone application processors (APs) are facing growing concerns as Arm, which holds over 90 percent of the market share in the global AP architecture market, is expected to hike the royalty rates for its clients by as much as 300 percent.\n\nSamsung Electronics has been reliant on Arm\u2019s intellectual property (IP) for designing its in-house AP, the Exynos series. If the fee hike is realized, a rise in the manufacturing costs for the Exynos series is inevitable, dealing additional damage to the company\u2019s already struggling foundry business.\n\nReuters on Jan. 14 reported that Arm is developing a long-term strategy to hike its royalty rates by as much as 300 percent, citing Arm\u2019s strategy revealed during its unsuccessful court trial to secure higher royalties from Qualcomm\u2019s APs. An AP is a chipset that works as the brain of a smartphone, combining functions of a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU) and other core components like the modem, memory controller and power management unit.\n\nIn the trial, Arm claimed that Qualcomm should pay higher royalty rates for breaching the terms of its design subsidiary Nuvia\u2019s license with Arm while producing new Snapdragon chips based on Nuvia\u2019s Oryon technology.\n\nQualcomm claims that Oryon has \u201c1 percent or less\u201d of Arm's original technology, and a U.S. federal court found that Qualcomm can use Nuvia\u2019s technology in producing APs without paying additional royalty rates.\n\nThis came as a temporary relief for Samsung which used Oryon-based Snapdragon 8 Elite for its latest Galaxy S25 smartphones, but at the same time increased the likelihood of Arm pursuing more aggressive profit strategies, such as the 300 percent fee hike, after losing the suit.\n\nA fee hike could deal a hefty blow to Samsung\u2019s in-house AP, the Exynos series, which uses Arm\u2019s IP such as Arm v9 architecture.\n\nThe latest Exynos 2500 has already been facing questions due to its manufacturing yield, which refers to the ratio of good and error-free units to the total number of units produced. The chip was set to be produced at the Samsung foundry\u2019s 3-nanometer process and supposed to empower the Galaxy S25 series, but the company apparently failed to improve the process in time for the phone\u2019s launch.\n\nTo address the yield problem, Samsung even considered outsourcing Exynos 2500\u2019s production to its foundry rival TSMC, but was rejected, according to a Jan. 15 report by tech media PhoneArena.\n\n\u201cIt is a really bad sign that Samsung is not using its own APs, even though its foundry business is suffering a loss,\u201d said Lee Jong-hwan, a professor at Sangmyung University\u2019s Department of System Semiconductor Engineering. \u201cNot using its in-house chipset means that the company\u2019s biggest strength as the total service provider is becoming its biggest weakness.\u201d\n\nIndustry watchers expect that a 300 percent increase in fees to Arm could force Samsung to withstand greater costs for developing the Exynos series down the road, and the company may become less committed to maintaining its development. This is especially so when comparing the costs of paying the quadrupled fees to Arm versus the expenses of using Qualcomm's Snapdragon, which will eventually become independent of Arm\u2019s licensing.\n\nDespite the challenges, Samsung seeks to improve the yield of Exynos 2500 in time to use it in the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip 7 series, which will debut in the latter half of this year Also, the company is reportedly developing Exynos 2600 for use as the AP for its upcoming smartphones.\n\nIndustry officials say the company is bound to be holding onto its in-house chipsets because of the cost advantages that Samsung has been enjoying as the world\u2019s only total service provider which can design and fabricate chips and even produce end-devices such as smartphones.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, when Samsung used only Qualcomm\u2019s chipsets for its Galaxy S23 series, the cost of purchasing APs from outside parties accounted for 18.1 percent of its total spending for smartphone parts and materials. The ratio declined to 16.6 percent in the third quarter of 2024, when Samsung used Exynos 2400 chipsets for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s pricing strategy is also another reason for Samsung to continue making efforts on the Exynos series. Reportedly, Qualcomm has increased the price of Snapdragon 8 Elite between 20 to 30 percent, and U.S. media reports assume that Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 could see a significant price hike in 2025.\n\nFor Samsung, which maintained the prices of Galaxy S25 phones despite the increased expenses for purchasing APs, Exynos\u2019 success is critical for the profitability of its smartphone business as well.\n\n\u201cFrom Samsung\u2019s perspective, the current situation could be a conundrum,\u201d Lee said. \u201cSamsung is assumed to be exploring ways to address the situation, such as developing its own design technology or securing more IP through partnership design houses, but we all know that this is a challenging and time-consuming process.\u201d",

Judge Taranto authored the opinion.\n\nIn its 2021 decision, the CAFC found in part that Intel satisfied Article III standing requirements for appealing from the PTAB but remanded the case on a number of issues. The present appeal involves Qualcomm\u2019s challenge to the PTAB\u2019s new claim construction of the term \u201chardware buffer\u201d in which it \u201cchanged its earlier construction, which excluded \u2018a temporary buffer\u2019 from the scope\u2026to a broader construction, under which a \u2018hardware buffer\u2019 is \u2018not limited to a \u2018permanent\u2019 buffer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe parties generally disagreed about what is required for the buffer to be a \u201chardware buffer.\u201d Intel said that a buffer is a \u201chardware buffer\u201d if \u201cthe memory cells used by the buffer are \u2018physically separate\u2019 from the memory cells into which the software is loaded and from which the processor executes it (\u2018system memory\u2019).\u201d\n\nQualcomm proposed a narrower view, namely, that \u201ca buffer is a hardware buffer only if its memory cells are never used for system memory, rather than assigned to be used for that function (allocated) upon the turning on of power (or runtime).\u201d\n\nThe Federal Circuit, however, said that \u201cneither party provides an illuminating or persuasive explanation of its position\u201d regarding Qualcomm\u2019s assertion that Intel\u2019s view renders \u201chardware\u201d superfluous, and thus the court turned to the specification and prosecution history for guidance. Upon analysis of the specification, the CAFC said none of the three uses of the phrase \u201chardware buffer\u201d elucidated why either Qualcomm\u2019s or Intel\u2019s approach is the right one.\n\nAs to the prosecution history, though, the court said it was \u201cilluminating.\u201d In response to an examiner rejection, \u201cQualcomm did not even hint, let alone declare, that the Svensson [prior art] intermediate storage area\u2014undisputedly allocated at runtime\u2014was outside its claimed \u2018hardware buffer.\u2019\u201d As a result, although the court felt that \u201cthere is something to be said for each side\u2019s view of how to read the claim phrase \u2018hardware buffer,\u2019\u201d there was no need to decide which meaning is better. The opinion explained:\n\n\u201cThis case is governed by the broadest-reasonable-interpretation standard\u2026which recognizes the distinctive duty of applicants or patentees to respond to uncertainty of scope by making clarifying changes\u2026 We conclude that Qualcomm has not persuasively shown the Board majority\u2019s current claim construction to be unreasonable. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s claim construction and its resulting unpatentability determinations.\u201d\n\nThe CAFC thus affirmed the PTAB\u2019s decision to hold all challenged claims of Qualcomm\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,838,949 unpatentable.",

The report mentions that the company\u2019s incremental share gain with the latest smartphones amounts to an incremental 12 million units. Seeing as how Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 family was estimated to have shipped 40 million units in 2024, Qualcomm is not only expected to witness a 100 percent share with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but a higher shipment volume should benefit the company financially.\n\nEven though Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 range looks nearly identical to last year\u2019s Galaxy S24, the Korean giant incorporated some key hardware changes, not to mention introducing more AI features that should elevate the user experience. On this occasion, Samsung has bumped up the base RAM count to 12GB instead of 8GB while employing a more advanced manufacturing process for the memory to reduce power consumption and improve efficiency, resulting in better battery life. While we cannot confirm the following, it is possible that Samsung handed Qualcomm a premium for using an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nWhile we anticipate the SoC\u2019s power consumption to rise with this version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, we have reported that the Galaxy S25 Ultra has beaten the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Geekbench 6 and 3DMark Steel Nomad Light tests thanks to this upgrade. However, Samsung continues its efforts with the Exynos 2500, with a previous rumor stating that the chipset could be used in the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7 to reduce component costs. Of course, these plans could be scrapped in favor of Qualcomm\u2019s less powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite, which features a 7-core CPU cluster.\n\nThe reduced number of cores means that this Snapdragon 8 Elite will be offered to Qualcomm\u2019s partners who want to equip their devices with a flagship chipset at a lower cost, and we could see Samsung possibly utilizing this version in its foldable smartphones if it produces better results than the Exynos 2500. This move will once again contribute to Qualcomm\u2019s annual revenue, which we will continue to provide updates about, so stay tuned.",

Whether you\u2019re a US or global consumer buying a baseline or Ultra model, there\u2019s no Samsung Exynos chip in sight, though the company remains tight-lipped on the exact reason. The good news for us is that this ensures battery, feature, and performance parity across the field, but for Samsung, it looks like another chipset setback.\n\nAnyone familiar with the long-running Samsung Exynos versus Qualcomm Snapdragon saga will know that the race is sometimes close and other times not so much, but in recent years, Qualcomm has gradually been gaining the upper hand. As far back as 2022, both the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and Exynos 2200 inside the Galaxy S22 ran overly hot, owing to yield problems at Samsung Foundries and its 4nm node, resulting in the GOS throttling controversy. Qualcomm addressed this issue by switching to TSMC for an 8 Plus Gen 1 refresh, the 8 Gen 2, and all of its subsequent chips, but Samsung remained trapped with its underperforming node. As a result, the Galaxy S23 series went all in on Snapdragon for the first time, while Samsung claimed it was \u201creorganizing\u201d its chip business model.\n\nSamsung seemed to have at least partially recovered with the Galaxy S24, which returned to an Exynos and Snapdragon regional split. That is, except for the Ultra model, which featured the 8 Gen 3 exclusively in all regions. Rumors persisted that Exynos yields were still not brilliant, and opting for Qualcomm in its most premium of premium handsets is a tacit admission that either the performance differential was too great or that Samsung couldn\u2019t make enough suitable 4nm chips. Even today, rumors abound that Samsung asked TSMC to manufacture its latest Exynos but was declined, likely due to conflicts of interest.\n\nWill you miss the Exynos version of the Galaxy S25? 593 votes No, Snapdragon is best. 80 % Yes, I like Exynos. 5 % It doesn't matter. 16 %\n\nC. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nEven as the gap re-narrowed last year, Qualcomm veered down a road Samsung couldn\u2019t follow with this year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite and its in-house Oryon/Phoenix CPU cores. A return to custom Arm CPU development marked a significant shift for Qualcomm and the Android ecosystem, which finally levels the playing field and even exceeds the performance of Apple\u2019s custom Arm-based CPUs. If Samsung wants to hang with the very best, the 8 Elite is really the only game currently in town.\n\nThe Oryon-derived Pheonix L and M cores in the 8 Elite not only provide performance in excess of Arm\u2019s off-the-shelf Cortex-X and Cortex-A solutions used by Samsung, Google, MediaTek, etc, but have also resulted in a notable benefit to energy efficiency and, therefore, battery life, in the handsets we\u2019ve tested so far. Qualcomm\u2019s latest Adreno architecture also throws massive amounts of GPU power into the mix, along with its usual assortment of AI, networking, and other improvements.\n\nQualcomm's custom CPU ramps up the pressure on Samsung after years of manufacturing issues.\n\nThose with a long memory will remember that Samsung also had its own custom Arm CPU cores in the form of Mongoose. This effort ran from 2016 and was retired with 2020\u2019s Mongoose M5 after producing a string of middling results, particularly regarding energy efficiency. Today, Samsung has no custom CPU efforts to approach performance or efficiency parity with Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon. Arm\u2019s latest CPU and GPU cores certainly aren\u2019t sluggish; they run wonderfully in MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 9400, for instance. However, Samsung\u2019s conundrum is that it, ideally, needs to duck the bad press from any meaningful gap between would-be Exynos and Snapdragon versions of its handsets.\n\nEven if it was viable from a manufacturing standpoint (we know the Exynos 2500 exists; it\u2019s more a question of how good the yield is), opting for Exynos this generation would have resulted in a much wider discrepancy of capabilities across its Galaxy S25 line-up than in previous years, which it\u2019s been keen to avoid as much as possible in the past. That said, Samsung might still have opted for the dual-chip strategy if its 3nm manufacturing setup had been issue-free; we just don\u2019t know. In any case, Samsung has probably picked the best option overall, but we\u2019ll have to be prepared to pay the \u201cSnapdragon tax\u201d for this extra performance \u2014 the 8 Elite doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nIs Exynos destined for foldables or the FE instead?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAlthough Snapdragon may have taken the crown for yet another Galaxy generation, the battle with Exynos certainly isn\u2019t over. In a recent earnings call, Samsung recommitted to its custom silicon development efforts, noting that it\u2019s concentrating on supplying chips for \u201cflagship products\u201d this year while preparing its next-generation chips based on a future 2nm node. Likewise, rumors suggest its current 3nm setup might finally be in a better state, just in time to ramp up Exynos 2500 production in time for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 later this year.\n\nStill, this presents Samsung with the same dual- or single-chip strategy conundrum for foldables. Does it attempt to keep up with what\u2019ll almost certainly be the superior Snapdragon 8 Elite and hope international markets won\u2019t mind, or simply plump for one over the other? Rumors suggest Samsung is keen to use its in-house chip in at least some models. Perhaps Exynos for the more mainstream Flip and Snapdragon for the power-user-oriented and more expensive Fold makes the most sense, but Samsung decision-makers might feel differently, I suppose.\n\nExynos might be MIA from the S25, but we could see it in 2025's foldables and FE models.\n\nIf Samsung is consigned to silver in the performance metrics, at least for the time being, Exynos should still have a future in the Galaxy FE line-up, at the very least. The slightly trimmed-down Exynos 2400e in the Galaxy S24 FE performs admirably for heavy workloads and gaming, and is a key factor in keeping the price a very reasonable $650. Samsung is also reportedly preparing a Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, another more affordable model that would be prime for another e-variant of Samsung\u2019s flagship Exynos chipsets.\n\nI\u2019m repeating myself lately, but we\u2019re long past the point of absolute top-tier performance being all that important for a brilliant smartphone. If anything, the sky-high prices are making ultra-premium chips and phones harder to justify for many. Exynos doesn\u2019t have to top the benchmarks to power phones that people, myself included, will want to buy. Pixels manage just fine with Tensor, after all. If Samsung can successfully navigate this troubled manufacturing and development period with a targeted chipset strategy, it may remerge with a true Snapdragon challenger in the coming years. Although that\u2019s a tall order as things currently stand.\n\nYou might like",

            "content": "JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee has maintained an \u2018Overweight\u2019 rating on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), reflecting optimism about the company\u2019s prospects following Samsung Electronics\u2019 launch of its new flagship smartphone, the S25. This device marks a significant shift as it incorporates Snapdragon chipsets across all its variants, a departure from the previous generation S24 where only the high-end models in North America and China used Qualcomm\u2019s technology. This change underscores Qualcomm\u2019s stronghold in mobile processor technology, further cemented by its growing influence in automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets.\n\nThe transition to Snapdragon in all S25 variants represents a notable share gain for Qualcomm. Chatterjee estimates this shift will add approximately 12 million units to Qualcomm\u2019s tally compared to the S24 lineup, translating into an incremental revenue opportunity of $2 billion within the Handset Total Addressable Market (TAM). This increase is expected to boost Qualcomm\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) by about $0.63, which is roughly 5% of the fiscal 2025 EPS consensus.\n\nPreviously, Chatterjee pegged the S24 shipments at around 40 million units, with 20 million being the high-end Ultra models, where Qualcomm had secured a 70% share due to its use in the U.S. and China markets. With the S25, Qualcomm\u2019s share jumps to 100%, highlighting a strategic win for the company in one of the world\u2019s leading smartphone markets.\n\nThis development prompted Chatterjee to place Qualcomm on Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of its upcoming earnings release, scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 5, after the market closes, expecting the share gain at Samsung to be a significant driver of performance. Despite these positive forecasts, Qualcomm\u2019s stock saw a slight decline on Friday, closing at $172.11 \u2014 down 1.29% for the day \u2014 and slipping further to $172.05 in after-hours trading. However, the stock has seen a 12% surge year-to-date, reflecting broader market confidence in Qualcomm\u2019s strategic direction and market expansion.\n\nThis move by Samsung to exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips in the S25 series not only validates Qualcomm\u2019s technological edge but also potentially sets a precedent for future collaborations, driving further growth in Qualcomm\u2019s core and emerging markets.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now.\n\nIn recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.\n\nOn January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction.\n\nEurope has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach.\n\nConversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world\u2019s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback by sustainably-minded investors as the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nFor asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise.\n\nUS-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This \u201cgreenhushing\u201d strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAs the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies. We then looked at their ESG rating from S&P Global and picked 8 companies that have a minimum ESG score of 60. We also used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024 to find the number of hedge fund holders for each company. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nESG Score: 62\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading semiconductor and telecommunications company recognized for its innovations in wireless technology. The company generates revenue through intellectual property licensing and the sale of semiconductors for mobile devices and IoT applications.

            "content": "Making smart investments often requires you to not follow the crowd. In the semiconductor industry, you can't follow the crowd any less than buying Intel (INTC 1.48%) stock. While Intel is struggling right now, the company's manufacturing investments still hold a lot of potential and could be the key to the company's turnaround.\n\nAnother neglected semiconductor stock is Qualcomm (QCOM 3.05%), which trades at an uninspiring valuation. While Qualcomm's core smartphone chip business is mature, the company has plenty of long-term growth opportunities in other areas.\n\nIf you've got $1,000 to invest, want exposure to semiconductor stocks, and are willing to take some risk, Intel and Qualcomm should be on your radar.\n\nLeft for dead\n\nIntel is going through one of the biggest crises in its decades-long history. The company's expensive bet on becoming a semiconductor foundry has been slow to show progress, market share losses in PC and server CPUs are putting pressure on the financials, and a complete failure to become a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is a particularly embarrassing black eye. There are some bright spots, notably the company's second-generation graphics cards, but overall, the picture certainly looks rough.\n\nFormer CEO Pat Gelsinger, who crafted Intel's current strategy, was pushed out in December. The company now lacks a permanent CEO, and its strategy is up in the air. The stock was understandably hammered following abrupt layoffs and a dividend suspension in August, and the rout continued amid the leadership shuffle. Shares of Intel are down more than 55% from their 52-week high, and they trade for below book value.\n\nThe silver lining is that Intel is the only U.S.-based advanced logic semiconductor manufacturer. The company's vast manufacturing assets, based in the U.S. and Europe, are valuable beyond their carrying value on the balance sheet. Intel is almost certainly too important to fail, although spinning off the manufacturing business or other maneuvers are a possibility.\n\nWhile Intel's predicament looks dire, the company's upcoming Intel 18A manufacturing process could be an inflection point. Intel 18A is expected to bring Intel back on par with TSMC in terms of manufacturing technology, and the company is banking on the process to give its upcoming Panther Lake PC CPUs and Clearwater Forest server CPUs a distinct edge. Microsoft and Amazon are both signed up to use Intel 18A for various home-grown chips, and if the process meets expectations, more customers could follow suit.\n\nI won't sugarcoat it: Intel stock is risky, and you're going to need an iron stomach to hold the stock through the attempted turnaround. But with Intel valued at less than $100 billion, down about two-thirds from its decade high, the upside for investors could be enormous if the company can get back on its feet.\n\nLong-term growth opportunities\n\nQualcomm makes the majority of its revenue from smartphone chips. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company generated $6.1 billion in revenue from smartphones out of $10.2 billion total. Most of the rest came from Internet of Things, automotive, and technology licensing.\n\nWhile the smartphone market is mature and may not be a major source of growth for Qualcomm, the company is branching out into other areas that hold some long-term promise. One of those areas is the PC market. Qualcomm launched its first PC CPUs last year, which are based on the Arm architecture just like its smartphone chips, and it worked with Microsoft to make sure Windows and most Windows software worked well on laptops powered by the new chips.\n\nWhile Qualcomm's PC chips are powerful and efficient, progress has been slow. The company expects to generate $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a small fraction of what market leader Intel generates each year. One thing holding back Qualcomm is compatibility issues. While many applications work fine, some PC games and other applications suffer from serious issues, which may be driving away customers. However, these problems should eventually be solved, and there's no reason why Qualcomm can't turn its PC chip business into a sizable source of revenue in the long run.\n\nServer CPUs are another area where Qualcomm could build another multibillion-dollar business from nothing. The company has already tried and failed once with Arm-powered server CPUs, but it looks likely that it will try again. Arm in the data center is becoming more common as tech giants design their own in-house server chips, meaning that the software ecosystem should be more accommodating to Qualcomm as it reenters the server CPU market.\n\nQualcomm stock isn't overly expensive, trading for around 15 times the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings. Growing earnings is going to depend on Qualcomm's success outside of the smartphone market, so multiple failures could keep the stock price in check. However, if the company finds success with PCs, servers, or both over the next five years, Qualcomm stock could be a market-beating winner.",

            "content": "Samsung Galaxy S25 gets the Snapdragon Elite chip\n\nThe all-new Galaxy S25 phone range is finally here, and there's good news if you live in areas such as the UK. Last year's Galaxy S24 range had a mix of Qualcomm and Samsung's slightly less desirable Exynos brains inside, which made things mightily confusing. In 2025, Samsung is returning to Qualcomm for its entire fleet of call makers, with all getting the Snapdragon 8 Elite tucked inside.\n\nThis chip was announced late last year at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii and already powers other devices from Android rivals such as Honor and OnePlus. However, Samsung reckons it is taking things up a notch with the S25 getting an exclusive and \"uniquely customised\" version of the 8 Elite that's made just for Galaxy. This upgrade not only boosts the overall power and efficiency but also helps to enable improved Galaxy AI features aimed at making the S25 smarter than ever. These include better Circle to Search and new things such as the \"Now Brief\" and \"Now Bar\" updates. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 series are the first commercial devices to feature Snapdragon Satellite which allows consumers to send and receive messages via satellite if they find themselves in a remote area without a phone signal. That's a feature that has been available on iPhone for some time, so it's nice to see it finally arriving on Android.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25\n\nQualcomm also says it has worked closely with Samsung to customise the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy to deliver premium image quality and power consumption on a Galaxy smartphone display. That should mean more time glued to TikTok and less time charging things up. \"We are thrilled to introduce the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, which represents a significant leap forward in mobile technology, offering more intelligent, customized experiences \u2013 from personalized AI assistants to exceptional AI-generated images,\" said Chris Patrick, senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \"Our strategic partnership with Samsung is a driving force behind this innovation, setting new standards for performance and efficiency.\"\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I used the Surface Laptop 7, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, for the entire time. For me, that\u2019s a big deal.\n\nI distinctly remember traveling to an Intel Developer Forum conference, most likely in San Francisco, and witnessing an SSD fail completely on a fellow reporter\u2019s laptop. Since then, I\u2019ve generally taken not one but two laptops to industry events, in case one failed or ran out of juice. I know, it\u2019s ridiculous. But I could rest assured that I\u2019d be able to file my story, and that\u2019s what mattered to me.\n\nAnd it was ridiculous, for even as corporate briefings became ever more populated with power outlets, planes did too. That extra laptop became a rather heavy safety blanket that I\u2019d have to wrestle with not only in airport security lines, but also toting it around on the daily. And with power outlets everywhere, did I really need a thin-and-light? Why not something with a little more oomph for a quick game on the go?\n\nJosh Hendrickson / IDG\n\nBut something else happened over the past two years: The power outlets began disappearing again. In the last year, I traveled to Los Angeles, then to Berlin, and finally to Las Vegas. I actually had to haul out a battery pack and charging cord during a session to avoid trying to surreptitiously hunt down a power cord during a presentation. Coincidentally, 2024 was the year of the low-power processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite, Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake, and AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300. All three are superb.\n\nOn the Snapdragon-equipped Surface Laptop, I don\u2019t think I ever hit less than 40 percent battery life after a full day\u2019s work.\n\nWith Windows on Arm, however, there was always a risk. Would there be something that prevented me from getting the job done? I\u2019d gone through this while using Chromebooks. Google Docs would be fine for 95 percent of what I needed to do. But when it came to a resume, I needed Word, and at the time Word only ran on Windows.\n\nWith Arm, initial Snapdragon X laptop buyers complained about the lack of native Arm versions for Google Drive, Slack, various printers, and VPNs. But \u2014 and I give the Windows on Arm community a lot of credit here \u2014 the ecosystem listened and actively solved the lack of compatibility. Today, Google Drive, several VPNs, and other apps run just fine on Windows on Arm.\n\nSo, I was heading to Vegas. Would I bet it all on the Surface Laptop? No. I brought a backup laptop anyway. To be fair, I did so as much as to have an extra screen as an extra laptop, so I could refer to a page of notes while I wrote on another. But I didn\u2019t really need to.\n\nLong battery life, no compatibility issues whatsoever\n\nPut simply, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop performed superbly.\n\nI\u2019ve come to believe that trade shows or conferences, where you\u2019re shuttling from a conference room to a booth to a demo suite, are the true test of a laptop, where you simply doesn\u2019t have the time or the convenience to hunt down a charger. Instead, it\u2019s meeting after meeting, waking the laptop, typing and/or inking notes, and closing it. Rinse and repeat. Add in a breakfast meeting, something over lunch and maybe a lingering evening briefing, and you could have hours of uptime.\n\nhighly recommended Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 (13.8\u2033) Read our review\n\nIn all, I had a day or two with five meetings in Las Vegas as well as quiet \u201cwriting times\u201d where I had a short period to file a story. On the Snapdragon-equipped Surface Laptop, I don\u2019t think I ever hit less than 40 percent battery life after a full day\u2019s work. (At night, I\u2019d plug in.) I used Wi-Fi pretty constantly while the laptop was awake, usually tethered to my phone for connectivity. I didn\u2019t print once and never ran into a situation where I needed to download or use some weird little app to connect to a hotel Wi-Fi. (If I did, I had a VPN at the ready.)\n\nSo no, I wasn\u2019t trying to stress-test the laptop. Instead, I was using it a conveniently as I could to get my job done in an environment that prioritized long battery life. And everything just worked, for hours and hours and hours.\n\nYour mileage will vary, as they say, both at home and on the road. But I can say that I\u2019ve now survived a lengthy, high-tension business trip with no thought to what chip was in my laptop \u2014 just that it got the job done. Do I like Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite as a business tool? You bet. I\u2019ve learned to quit worrying and love Qualcomm.",

            "content": "Samsung faces triple dilemma: Galaxy S25 leans on Qualcomm chips\n\nSamsung unveiled its latest trio of flagship smartphones this week, with promotional campaigns set to roll out across major global markets in the coming weeks. However, persistent concerns about its chip strategy have placed Samsung in a challenging \"triple dilemma\" that remains unresolved.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as the Galaxy S24, the Galaxy S25 series features three distinct models, all powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. This chip was specifically designed to support the expanding capabilities of Samsung's Galaxy AI features. While Samsung confirmed months ago that the Galaxy S25 would exclusively use Qualcomm chips, the decision to rely entirely on Qualcomm for two consecutive years has raised concerns. Industry observers now believe it is nearly impossible for Samsung to reintroduce its own Exynos chips into the Galaxy flagship lineup.\n\nTSMC production rumors surface\n\nAccording to market speculation, Samsung initially planned to transfer the production of Exynos chips to TSMC. However, the foundry giant reportedly rejected the proposal, citing concerns about potential technical leaks.\n\nIndustry insiders familiar with the semiconductor sector argue that, given Samsung's status as a non-sensitive manufacturer, it would be unlikely for TSMC to genuinely refuse the order based solely on such concerns.\n\nWhile the validity of these rumors remains uncertain, transferring Exynos production to TSMC is viewed as one possible solution to help alleviate Samsung's current dilemma. However, this move could have significant ramifications, particularly by impeding the development of Samsung's own foundry business. Samsung's \"triple dilemma\" now makes it increasingly difficult to balance all three critical areas.\n\nUnderstanding the triple challenge\n\nSamsung's triple dilemma stems from the need to balance three crucial aspects: foundry services, integrated circuit (IC) design, and mobile phone sales. Given the current state of technology, it appears impossible for Samsung to address all three areas simultaneously without sacrificing at least one to preserve the other two.\n\nTransferring Exynos production to TSMC could ensure that its hardware manufacturing capabilities remain competitive with industry leaders like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple, according to experts. However, this shift would only address one part of Samsung's broader dilemma, as their advanced manufacturing capabilities remain the most challenging gap to close.\n\nExynos faces mounting challenges\n\nThe question now is how Exynos can be salvaged. The challenge grows more formidable as time progresses. Mobile SoC (System on Chip) experts point out that the rapid pace of technological iteration in the sector makes it difficult for Exynos to regain a competitive edge, especially given its two-year absence from the flagship market. Without real-world feedback and product improvements, it will be challenging for Exynos to catch up with its rivals.\n\nIf Samsung continues to prioritize mobile phone sales over chip development, Exynos will become less reliable for the company's mobile division, ultimately eroding consumer confidence. The extended absence from the market makes it increasingly difficult for Exynos to regain its footing.\n\nMediaTek advances in the premium segment\n\nMeanwhile, MediaTek's Dimensity flagship series continues to challenge Samsung's dominance in the high-end smartphone market. MediaTek has already established a presence in the premium tablet market and is reportedly targeting the Galaxy FE series for the second half of 2025. This move would intensify competition with Qualcomm for dominance in the Galaxy S series over the next two years.\n\nStrategic implications\n\nIndustry experts assert that both Qualcomm and MediaTek now maintain a firm grip on the mobile SoC market. With Samsung falling behind in both production and design technologies, Exynos will likely continue to trail in the mobile SoC arena. As a result, Samsung's triple dilemma may ultimately force the company to prioritize its mobile sales, potentially leaving its chip ambitions in jeopardy.",

            "content": "Samsung unveils phones with Qualcomm chips\n\nReuters, SEOUL and SAN FRANCISCO\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Electronics Co on Wednesday unveiled its newest Galaxy S25 smartphones, powered by Qualcomm\u2019s chips and Google\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) model, hoping its upgraded AI features can reinvigorate sales and fend off Apple Inc and Chinese rivals.\n\nSamsung also previewed a thinner version of the flagship models at the end of an event in California, aiming to launch the Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of this year ahead of Apple\u2019s anticipated rollout of its slimmer iPhone.\n\nSamsung was faster than Apple in launching an AI-powered smartphone, but failed to regain its crown in the global smartphone market last year, squeezed by competition with the US rival in the premium market and with Chinese firms in the lower-end segment.\n\nA person demonstrates an artificial intelligence-powered drawing function on a Samsung Electronics Co Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphone during a media event in Seoul on Wednesday. Photo: Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWe are one step ahead of the industry in terms of offering AI features. I believe we are going in the right direction,\u201d said Park Ji-sun, the executive vice president who leads Samsung\u2019s Language AI team.\n\nSamsung kept the prices of its Galaxy S25 series unchanged at between US$799 and US$1,299.\n\nThe new Galaxy S25 uses Gemini offered by Alphabet\u2019s Google as its default AI engine and features Samsung\u2019s upgraded in-house voice assistant, Bixby, Park said.\n\nThe two tools complement each other and Bixby plays a key role at Samsung, whose products span mobile phones to TVs and home appliances, he said.\n\nThomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester, said that differentiating Bixby would be a challenge for Samsung.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is really a killer application today that you know would convince them [consumers]: \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to buy this one because it\u2019s an AI smartphone,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, AI features could create a halo effect around the Samsung brand, Husson said.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 would offer a more personalized AI experience. For example, its \u201cNow Brief\u201d service \u2014 which makes recommendations to users based on personalized data that is stored and processed on the phone for privacy reasons \u2014 would display a suite of customized items such as calendars, news and bedroom air temperature and carbon dioxide levels, Park said.\n\nThe phone would be able to carry out multiple tasks with a single command, such as finding upcoming sporting events and then adding them to users\u2019 calendars.\n\nSamsung used Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for the entire Galaxy S25 lineup, ditching its own mobile chip Exynos, a major change of strategy for a company that previously used both to have more bargaining power with suppliers.\n\nUsing a Qualcomm chip is a setback to the South Korean firm\u2019s chip business, which counts its mobile division as one of its major customers.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said that Samsung is looking to use the Exynos chip in its foldable phones to be launched later this year.\n\n\u201cThe Galaxy S25 series\u2019 sale is important at a time when Samsung\u2019s foldable phone sales have been stagnating in the face of challenges from Chinese companies,\u201d said Lim Su-jeong, associate director at research firm Counterpoint.\n\nSamsung\u2019s preliminary fourth-quarter profit, released earlier this month, missed estimates by a large margin due to chip development costs and rising competition in the smartphone market.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

The Sustainability Megatrends Report by Cushman & Wakefield highlighted that 60% of global investors reported higher performance yields from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments. This positive financial outcome is driving a surge in demand for ESG funds, with 78% of investors willing to pay higher fees for these products. One of the most significant trends is that Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the financial advantages of ESG-focused investments, leading to a transformation in how companies allocate capital. Therefore, strong ESG performance is becoming a critical factor in attracting investment, with companies that excel in this area seeing a surge in capital inflows.\n\nInvestors are drawn to socially responsible companies because of the alignment with their personal values. Many investors are driven by a desire to make a positive impact on society.

They maintain high standards of transparency, accountability, and integrity in their operations and decision-making processes. This includes ethical business practices, fair competition, and responsible marketing.\n\nAnother important aspect of socially responsible companies is their focus on social equity. These companies promote fair labor practices, support community development, and respect human rights. This includes providing fair wages, safe working conditions, and opportunities for employee growth and development.\n\nSocially responsible companies are businesses that integrate social and environmental considerations into their core operations and decision-making processes.

The new Galaxy S25 series uses Google\u2019s Gemini AI model as the AI engine.\n\nThe company also previewed a slimmer version of the flagship models, with the goal of getting a jumping on Apple\u2019s own slimmed-down devices by launching the Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of the year.\n\nFor QCOM it comes at an important juncture ahead of its next earnings report and fears about potential losses from Apple earnings, something one analyst suggests should be discounted.\n\nSamsung Market Share Central to QCOM\n\nAlongside the Samsung announcement came Qualcomm, which unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for Galaxy.\n\nSamsung said this is the most powerful chipset ever on the Galaxy S Series, delivering a performance boost of 40% in the all-important neural processing unit demanded by AI functions.\n\nAs such, the chip\u2019s power means more functions that were previously cloud-based can be carried out on the device itself.\n\nAccording to ZDNet editor Sabrina Ortiz, with the QCOM and GOOGL-powered phones Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of AI in consumer devices.\n\n\u201cWith the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, we are not just enhancing performance; we are redefining the user experience by integrating cutting-edge on-device AI and connectivity features that will shape the future of mobile technology,\u201d said O.H. Kwon, senior vice president and president, Qualcomm APAC.\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy time for QCOM\u2019s Arm-based Snapdragon series. At CES 2025, the company unveiled an 8-core Snapdragon X chip that will power budget laptops and mini-PCs in the $600 range.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this week five-star JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee placed QCOM on a \u201cpositive catalyst watch\u201d, citing potential share wins with Samsung to lead to a positive earnings print, ahead of the 2025 Fiscal first quarter release on January 29th.\n\nHe cited potential gains from the Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphone as a key reason to be positive, and highlighted a shift in investor\u2019s focus from AAPL-related revenue losses to QCOM-driven factors such as a higher silicon content supporting AI functions on high-end devices. The analyst also noted that company is experiencing a boost from its engagement with Chinese smartphone makers.\n\nIs QCOM a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nOverall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy rating on QCOM, based on 11 Buys, 10 Holds and one Sell. The average QCOM price target of $198.05 implies around 16% upside from current levels.

            "content": "Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist, Chris Senyek, offers a unique perspective on investing in dividend stocks. While investors typically focus on companies with growing dividends and high yields, Senyek suggested exploring other opportunities. He highlighted companies initiating dividends for the first time and those that have recently reduced their payouts. Initiating a dividend indicates management's confidence in maintaining steady earnings and cash flow, while also attracting a new group of investors.\n\nIn 2024, companies in the broader market that paid dividends returned around 35% of their net income and 45% of their free cash flow to shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg. The average dividend yield for these companies was approximately 2.3%, while the market capitalization-weighted yield stood at about 1.5%.\n\nOther analysts also suggested that dividend-paying stocks might stage a comeback in 2025 due to growing investor demand for cash returns. The broader market\u2019s dividend yield fell below 1.19% in 2024, marking a 20-year low, compared to its long-term average of 4.3%. With interest rates recovering on risk-free investments like Treasurys, companies are facing increased competition for yield. As a result, many are raising dividends or initiating them for the first time. Notably, some major tech giants began paying dividends in 2024, signaling to the market their shift toward value positioning within a high-growth sector.\n\n\"From a valuation standpoint, dividends look more attractive than they did a year ago, and that's partially because of the relative underperformance that they've had. Bonds are certainly more competitive relative to dividends. But if you look at dividend-paying stocks relative to the rest of the equity markets, I think they're becoming more attractive relative to other stocks.\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't suggest that dividend stocks are fundamentally weak or that they won't rebound in the future. Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of product management for equity indexes, believes that changing market dynamics could benefit dividend investors. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\nDividend stocks, while popular among investors, have been underperforming for a while. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, attributed this lag to a straightforward reason: their limited exposure to the technology sector. Although technology wasn\u2019t the top-performing sector in 2024, it came close and now represents a significant portion of the market.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 15 Stocks to Invest in with Steady Dividends . In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSenyek also noted that shares of companies that cut dividends tend to underperform leading up to the cut, perform in line with the market shortly after, and begin to outperform about six months later. The key is to identify companies that may be at risk of cutting dividends and to reconsider those that reduced payouts a few months earlier. To forecast potential cuts, Senyek examines companies with high dividend yields, substantial debt, and elevated payout ratios. For potential new dividend payers, Senyek seeks out companies with robust free cash flow yields that are actively repurchasing shares and maintaining manageable debt levels. In view of this, we will take a look at stocks with steady dividends.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of January 20. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

In fiscal Q4 2024, the company delivered strong financial results, with revenues climbing to $10.24 billion, an 18% increase from the same quarter the previous year. Net income rose 33% year-over-year, reaching $3.5 billion. The company also posted an annual earnings per share growth exceeding 30% for fiscal 2024.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has built a strong foothold in the smartphone chip industry and is well-poised to benefit from the fast-growing generative AI smartphone market. IDC projects this market to expand at an annual rate of 78% through 2028, with annual shipments expected to hit 912 million units by that time. Furthermore, Counterpoint Research places the company as the second-largest in the smartphone application processor market, commanding a 31% market share. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by over 9%.\n\nMadison Investments highlighted QCOM in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. were the largest detractors. Qualcomm has given back some of its first half gains after the CFO commented at a conference that its entrance into the AI PC business would take time to ramp. We continue to see Qualcomm as well positioned with growth from AI moving into the mobile phone, from new opportunities in the Internet of Things (IoT), and within the Auto industry but will also look to future growth as they enter the PC market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its innovations and efforts to expand its portfolio, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is also known for its strong dividend policy. The company has sufficient cash to fund its dividend payments. It ended the quarter with $8 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. The company generated an operating cash flow of $12.2 billion, up from $11.3 billion in the prior-year period. It also remained committed to returning value to shareholders, paying $2.2 billion to investors in dividends. It is one of the best stocks with steady dividends as the company has raised its payouts for 20 years straight. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.03%, as of January 20.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q3 2024, 74 hedge funds owned stakes in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), worth $3.23 billion in total.\n\nOverall QCOM ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend stocks with high yields. While we acknowledge the potential for QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stock To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Galaxy S25 handsets can even access Qualcomm\u2019s Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF.)\n\nThis allows for \u201csharper-than-ever low light video capture capabilities\u201d, even at 8K 30fps, all while \u201cmaintaining world-class power consumption efficiency.\u201d Of course, the SoC was also customized to take full advantage of Samsung\u2019s Gemini suite of AI tools.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 isn\u2019t the only smartphone to use Snapdragon 8 Elite. The Xiaomi 15, Honor Magic 7 Pro, Asus ROG Phone 9 and Realme GT 7 Pro are expected to utilize the SoC, albeit not the custom version co-designed by Samsung.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the AI Boom. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other semiconductor stocks.\n\nMore than two years have passed since the proliferation of the disruptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) megatrend, symbolically marked by the launch of OpenAI\u2019s revolutionary product \u2013 ChatGPT. Since then, the AI revolution has accelerated rapidly, with 2023 and 2024 seeing a surge in demand for advanced AI applications across industries. This transformation has driven companies to increasingly rely on robust data centers that can support the computational power required by the intelligent algorithms.\n\nIn tandem with the rise of AI, the data center sector has experienced substantial growth. The need for larger, more efficient, and scalable data storage and processing capabilities has created a boom in infrastructure investments. Data centers, which house the powerful servers needed for AI workloads, have become critical enablers of this technology\u2019s expansion. This increase in demand for data center capacity is a key factor that has propelled semiconductor stocks, as these centers rely heavily on cutting-edge semiconductors to deliver the speed, efficiency, and power necessary to process vast amounts of data in real time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shortlisted 35 semiconductor stocks using the holdings of iShares\u2019 Semiconductor ETF. Then we merged these stocks with Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary hedge fund holdings database and identified the 10 most popular hedge fund semiconductor stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nQUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and licenses wireless technologies while designing chips for smartphones, making it a key player in the industry. With foundational patents in CDMA and OFDMA technologies powering 3G, 4G, and 5G networks, QCOM licenses its IP to nearly all wireless device makers and is the largest global supplier of wireless chips, providing advanced processors to top handset brands. The company also offers RF front-end modules for smartphones and supplies chips to automotive and IoT markets.\n\nQCOM stock is up +16% in the last years and shows solid momentum as the company works on diversifying its business beyond smartphones, targeting $22 billion in revenue from adjacencies over the next 5 years. The automotive sector is a major growth opportunity as well, with the company seeing strong traction in digital cockpit solutions incorporating AI capabilities and expecting ADAS revenue to start materializing in the coming years. In the PC market, QCOM is gaining traction from the shift to AI PCs and projects $4 billion in revenue by 2029, while in smartphones, the focus is centered on premium and high-tier devices, seeing a 10% CAGR fueled by more computing and AI content.\n\nQUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) management commented on their accelerating markets during the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference. Here is what they said:\n\n\u201cI think we see GenAI as a very good accelerant of that opportunity, especially content. I am optimistic about the PC, looking at the landscape right now from the competitive environment we have built. I think we\u2019re well positioned. I think one of the things I said in the earnings call, and I said that design traction is very good. We started with 20 platforms in May. We have 58 designs now by \u2014 in November, line of sight to about 100 designs as we get to early 2026. So, I\u2019m excited about that. One thing that we think is very novel is what we\u2019re doing of industrial, which is the same exact thing we did automotive, which is let\u2019s not thinking about building a connected microcontroller for auto. Let\u2019s build a different platform. That\u2019s exactly what to do with industrial with GenAI at the edge. I\u2019m excited about that, even though that\u2019s new, we\u2019re still going to have to prove as with the annual milestones as we execute. But I think the opportunity of AI at the edge in industrial when you go from cloud back to on-prem is probably underestimated. I think that\u2019s a great opportunity for us.\u201d\n\nOverall QCOM ranks 7th on our list of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the AI boom. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Analyst Samik Chatterjee has maintained an \"overweight\" rating on the stock, setting a price target of $200. Chatterjee believes that Qualcomm's earnings performance is strong, which may help alleviate concerns about potential revenue declines from Apple (AAPL) in the coming years, although this may be temporary.\n\nOne key positive factor is the robust growth in the Chinese smartphone market, where Qualcomm holds significant opportunities, impacting major players like Apple and Samsung. Additionally, recent government subsidies could drive device upgrades, further contributing to Qualcomm's growth.\n\nChatterjee also highlights potential gains from the Samsung Galaxy S25 smartphone and a shift in investor focus from Apple-related revenue losses to Qualcomm's strong content-driven factors. These factors are driven by higher silicon content supporting AI functions on high-end devices.\n\nChatterjee explains that revenue is expected to return to double-digit growth, supported by diverse end markets. This growth could lead to a reevaluation of Qualcomm's price-to-earnings ratio, which remains at a moderate level of 14x, or mid-to-high when excluding Apple's contribution to QCT revenue.",

            "content": "Samsung has just announced the new Galaxy S25 lineup with a major focus on AI features, and based on the first look, the devices feel refreshed. While the general design language is more or less the same, the company ensured that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is way faster than last year's model. It is now being reported that the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip for Galaxy is a slightly tweaked version developed by Qualcomm solely for the new handsets. The new version offers better CPU and GPU performance compared to the standard variant of the chipset.\n\nSamsung and Qualcomm teamed up to develop a customized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip for the Galaxy S25 lineup\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is miles ahead of Qualcomm's previous chips for smartphones, with notable computational and graphical performance gains. Samsung's Galaxy S25 lineup, on the flip side, comes with a tweaked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which has been overclocked for an even better performance. Qualcomm has also confirmed to the Android Authority that the upgraded chip features a 4.46GHz peak CPU speed, which boils down to roughly 150MHz boost over the standard variant of the chip.\n\nEveryday use would not showcase the chip's increased performance, but based on the numbers Samsung showcased on stage, the CPU is 37 percent faster, and the GPU is 30 percent faster than the previous generation chip. Additionally, the NPU is 40 percent faster, which will boost AI tasks. This is a major performance gain and a vital addition since the entire Galaxy S25 lineup comes packed with a slew of new AI features.\n\nSamsung's year-over-year performance gains with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip were limited to 20 percent, which concludes that the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is significantly faster than the previous chips. However, the NPU performance gains are more or less similar to the previous version. Samsung and Qualcomm also worked together to customize the chipset for the Galaxy S25's unique display specifications. According to the source, the chip bolsters the new S25's ProScaler image scaling solution and mDNIe tech for better efficiency.\n\nThe chipmaker also states that it worked with Samsung to integrate Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) into the image signal processor, which allows better low light video capturing in up to 8K at 30fps resolution. However, this specific feature is generally available on all variants of the chip. Since the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is based on Qualcomm's 3nm process, it will not only deliver better performance but consume less power as well, which will ultimately be reflected in the device's battery life. We will share more details on the chip, so be sure to stick around.",

            "content": "Elon [look at me] Musk, Global Foundries, and Qualcomm are in Florida, where they will are rumoured to be plotting to buy Intel.\n\nAccording to Semi Accurate, representatives of the three met at the Mar-a-Lago estate owned by Donald Trump.\n\nAt the same time, Citibank analyst Christopher Daly said that selling Chipzilla to Musk would negatively affect the company.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a poor outcome for Intel unless it was able to hire a CEO who would exit the merchant foundry business,\u201d analyst Danely wrote.\n\nHowever, he seems to be in the minority. Wall Street's cocaine nose jobs have already reacted positively to the development, with Intel's shares rising by nearly 10 per cent.\n\nSince Intel started going down the gurgler, there have been several approaches from different companies that want to buy Intel\u2019s bits. In September 2024, Qualcomm approached Intel with a proposal to buy out the company\u2019s business.\n\nIntel had a rough 2024, with its stock falling by 54 per cent over the past year and 69 per cent since April 2021. The company faces struggles in both its data centre business and its attempts to compete in the foundry business.\n\nThe rise of AI has led companies to prefer GPUs from NVIDIA over Intel\u2019s CPUs. Intel also struggles to compete with Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor in manufacturing chips for other companies, failing to stay on the cutting edge of technology and attracting new customers.\n\nOne major debate in the semiconductor industry is whether Intel should split up its \u2018Integrated Device Manufacturer\u2019 model, which designs its chips and offers manufacturing services to other companies.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has achieved a dominant market share by only manufacturing chips, reducing the risk for companies like AMD, who might otherwise be hesitant to use Intel\u2019s services. The geopolitical concerns about Taiwan\u2019s position also highlight the importance of Intel\u2019s foundry business to the United States.\n\nBuilding advanced foundries is an expensive endeavour. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to spend $40 billion this year, while Intel spent $26 billion in 2023 and $25 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, Chipzilla has only $24 billion in cash compared to $50 billion in debt, and its operating cash flow has significantly decreased from $36 billion in 2020 to $9.7 billion over the past year. Intel can\u2019t afford to keep investing in its foundry business.\n\nMusk\u2019s new AI company, xAI, aims to build a data centre with one million networked GPUs, making him a key figure in addressing the risks of not having a domestic capacity for advanced chip manufacturing. Potential solutions could involve Qualcomm buying parts of Intel\u2019s business and Musk providing capital to the foundry business.\n\nAlthough these are just speculations, such a deal could help Intel navigate its current challenges.",

From job postings, the company is recruiting key positions such as \"Server System on Chip (SoC) Security Architect.\" Moreover, Qualcomm's data center team is committed to developing high-performance, energy-efficient server solutions for data center applications. They plan to develop a reference platform based on Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC, covering a comprehensive range of content including hardware, software, reference designs, user guides, and SDKs.In terms of talent, Qualcomm has attracted the joining of Sailesh Kottapalli, the former Chief Architect of Intel's Xeon, who now serves as Senior Vice President. Kottapalli worked at Intel for 28 years and was one of the core figures in Intel's server chip design. His addition brings a wealth of server chip design [] experience to Qualcomm.At the same time, Qualcomm's server CPU will adopt the Nuvia core based on the Arm architecture, which is seen as a strong challenge to the server market dominated by the x86 architecture. The Nuvia core has achieved significant success in the mobile chip field with its outstanding performance and energy efficiency ratio. Qualcomm expects to apply it to server chips to break the existing market pattern.02 Market Potential and Historical BackgroundQualcomm is not the first time attempting to enter the server chip market. As early as 2016, Qualcomm launched the Centriq series of server CPUs. However, due to the relatively weak Arm server ecosystem at that time, as well as challenges such as patent lawsuits and hostile acquisitions faced by Qualcomm itself, this business was eventually forced to be abandoned in 2018. However, with Qualcomm's successful acquisition of Nuvia and the launch of the Snapdragon X series AI PC chips [], its technical strength and market experience in the server processor field have been significantly enhanced.Currently, the market share of servers based on the Arm architecture has exceeded 10%, and the ecosystem is becoming increasingly perfect. Unlike PC products, the server market does not completely rely on the x86 application ecosystem, which provides more opportunities for Arm architecture manufacturers like Qualcomm. The successful application of Amazon's Graviton processor in the data center field has proved that solutions based on the Arm architecture have huge market potential. This has also prompted Qualcomm to re-examine its strategy and decide to return to the data center processor market.03 Future OutlookQualcomm's return will not only bring a new competitive landscape to the server processor market but also promote technological innovation and market diversification. Qualcomm has full-stack control capabilities from hardware to software, giving it a certain competitive advantage in this market. The first devices to adopt Qualcomm's data center processors may be its 5G platforms, and will eventually expand to the 6G base station field.This strategic move by Qualcomm will not only help it achieve a breakthrough in the data center market but also further reduce its dependence on the smartphone market and expand its business map in the field of technology. As Qualcomm's layout in the server processor market gradually unfolds, we can expect to see more high-performance, energy-efficient server solutions based on Qualcomm technology in the coming years.Conevo Electronics SolutionsConevo Elec is a semiconductor component distributor, providing rich and diversified ic resources.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nQualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.93 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.30 indicates a change of +10.2% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",

In 2024, shares were having an incredible year, rising 57% by mid-June. However, by the time early Aug. rolled around, shares had plummeted, losing over 30% of their value from the peak. Detrimental developments surfaced, crushing the optimism that many had.\n\nQUALCOMM Today QCOM QUALCOMM $156.58 +4.64 (+3.05%) 52-Week Range $149.43 \u25bc $230.63 Dividend Yield 2.17% P/E Ratio 16.73 Price Target $205.32 Add to Watchlist\n\nThe shares recovered slightly from September to October but ended the year lower than their August low. Now that the company has resolved key issues and/or mitigated them. A new bullish cycle may await the stock. This has somewhat already started to materialize. As of noon Eastern time trading on Jan. 17, Qualcomm shares are up over 7% yearly. Additionally, based on new analysts' ratings tracked by MarketBeat, Wall Street sees a solid upside in shares. The average of two price targets released in January from Barclays and Mizuho implies a 21% upside.\n\nGet QUALCOMM alerts: Sign Up\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll detail the developments that put a dark cloud over Qualcomm in the second half of 2024 and show how they played out. I\u2019ll also describe new developments around the firm that could be growth drivers in the new year.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Apple Problem and Efforts to Mitigate\n\nOne of the issues surrounding Qualcomm for years now has been its relationship with key customer Apple NASDAQ: APPL. For a long time, Qualcomm has been supplying the 5G modems that Apple puts into its immensely popular iPhone devices. These modems are essentially the chips that allow Apple devices to connect to 5G networks. For at least \"half a decade,\" Apple has been, according to Bloomberg tech analyst Mark Gurman, building its own 5G modem.\n\nIn 2023, Qualcomm renewed its deal to supply the iPhone until 2027. But, in mid-2024, rumors spread that Apple would use its own modems sooner. Those rumors appeared to be true, as the company will be putting its own modem into its lower-end iPhone SE in 2025. By 2027, Apple expects to fully phase out Qualcomm modems.\n\nQUALCOMM MarketRank\u2122 Stock Analysis Overall MarketRank\u2122 99th Percentile Analyst Rating Moderate Buy Upside/Downside 31.1% Upside Short Interest Level Healthy Dividend Strength Strong Environmental Score -0.89 News Sentiment 1.19 Insider Trading Selling Shares Proj. Earnings Growth 5.01% See Full Analysis\n\nStill, Qualcomm has known this was an essential inevitability for a long time. It has been diversifying its business significantly due to this. The company\u2019s automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses now exceed the size of its business with Apple. Last year, it generated around $2.6 billion in revenue, while its Apple revenue was approximately in the lower $2 billion range.\n\nAdditionally, Qualcomm expects the automotive and IoT businesses to grow much faster. In Q1 2025, the company expects a \"mid-single-digit\" increase in handset revenue from last year's quarter. However, it expects IoT revenues to grow by more than 20% and automotive revenues to increase by 50%. For the next several years, the company sees combined growth in these segments exceeding 20% annually.\n\nARM Dispute Win, AI-PCs Can Provide Growth\n\nAnother issue hanging over the firm was its litigation with ARM NASDAQ: ARM. In December, a jury found that Qualcomm's AI-PC chips were properly licensed with Arm. This gives the company the go-ahead to keep selling the components and grow its PC business, a central pillar of its IoT growth strategy. Arm says it will pursue further litigation, but this remains a win for Qualcomm.\n\nStill, Qualcomm\u2019s AI-PCs have other issues and news surrounding them. In 2024, reports indicated that many applications were incompatible with the chips. This includes popular games like Fortnite and League of Legends. Overall, industry analysts note that other laptops have superior gaming performance. However, Qualcomm also recently announced that its latest chips will power AI-enabled laptops for $600. This lower price could boost PC sales. The company aims to capture billions in revenue from this market over the next few years.\n\nAlso, Qualcomm's poor laptop gaming abilities may not matter to many customers. Data from 2023 shows that gamers massively prefer playing on desktop computers to laptops. Only 13% of gamers are likely to be playing on laptops. This suggests that Qualcomm's laptop gaming issues might not push many customers away.\n\nQualcomm Set for a Big 2025?\n\nOverall, with several issues largely behind them or mitigated, Qualcomm shares could be ready to take off in 2025. The issues with its laptops may be overblown, meaning they could overperform expectations. The company's automotive and IoT growth drivers show promise. They soften the blow of the Apple relationship wind-down. Additionally, the company has a nice added bonus in being a chip stock that provides a solid dividend yield of 2%.\n\nBefore you consider QUALCOMM, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and QUALCOMM wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile QUALCOMM currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

The standard one offers an 8-core CPU cluster, while the less capable one features a 7-core one, and is the latest entrant into the family. We now take a look at the performance differences between the two, with the latest comparison showing a 14 percent delta in the multi-core category.\n\nThe new Snapdragon 8 Elite was benchmarked when running in OPPO\u2019s Find N5, one of the thinnest foldable smartphones around\n\nBefore its imminent launch, the OPPO Find N5 was spotted on Geekbench 6, with the most notable change being that it features a Snapdragon 8 Elite with a 7-core CPU cluster instead of an 8-core one. Thankfully, the reduction of cores was not accompanied by a downclock downgrade, as the performance and efficiency cores are both running at their default speeds of 4.32GHz and 3.53GHz, respectively.\n\nGoing over the scores, the OPPO Find N5 obtains around what we expected in the single-core results, but the multi-core figures are a different story altogether. With a score of 8,865, the 7-core version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is around 14 percent slower than the 8-core overclocked variant, which is the one whose performance cores operate at a higher 4.47GHz instead of 4.32GHz.\n\nWith the level of thinness achieved by the Find N5, it is safe to say that no expense was spared when designing the ultra-sleek foldable flagship. It is possible that OPPO resorted to using the 7-core version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite as it would reduce the overall components bill and allow the manufacturer to pocket some earnings from the device\u2019s sales.\n\nTo be fair, the difference in scores will likely only be visible in benchmarks like Geekbench 6, and we doubt that real-world scenarios would deliver the same results. Then again, those who wish to own the latest and greatest will want to pay a hefty premium in exchange for experiencing the best possible performance.\n\nNews Source: Geekbench 6",

Bluetooth doesn't have the bandwidth for the highest of hi-res audio streams, and Qualcomm's system to use Wi-Fi as an alternative is finally coming.\n\nThe technology is called XPAN, short for 'expanded personal area network', and it uses Wi-Fi to deliver lossless audio that's also very low latency. With Bluetooth, you have to choose between highest quality and lowest latency, but XPAN claims to offer both simultaneously.\n\nThe system is part of the Snapdragon Sound technology \u2013 particularly the Snapdragon S7 Gen 1 Sound Platform \u2013 and that means it won't be coming to iPhones or AirPods any time soon: XPAN requires Snapdragon chips in both the phone/tablet and the headphones.\n\nThe first earbuds with XPAN were predicted to launch before the end of 2024, but of course that didn't happen. However, products are imminent: Qualcomm has confirmed to Android Authority that it and its hardware partners will be announcing new headphones \"very, very soon\".\n\nWhat sound quality does XPAN deliver?\n\nXPAN promises 24-bit/192kHz lossless audio, and says that power consumption for lossless at 96kHz is identical to that for a lossy Bluetooth stream at the same sampling rate.\n\n24-bit/192kHz is very high resolution. Even the mighty LDAC audio codec tops out at 96kHz, and while aptX Adaptive is also capable of 96kHz, the quality varies by signal strength (hence the \"adaptive\" bit) and its first generation was only 24-bit/48kHz, so any first-gen products have the same limit.\n\nAccording to Qualcomm, the new XPAN system will enable you to roam freely around your home without having to stay close to your smartphone or tablet, and if you go out of range of your Wi-Fi network and have your phone on you, your headphones will roll back to Bluetooth.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Whether it's hi-res audio, a game soundtrack or just a phone call, the next generation of wireless headphones will potentially sound just as good as some of the best wired headphones.\n\nWe've seen Wi-Fi streaming on some of the best wireless headphones already, including the Sonos Ace and the HED Unity Wi-Fi headphones \u2013 but it's always extremely power hungry and often awkward to use. Qualcomm's system may fix that\u2026 it's just a shame you might need a specific phone and headphones combination to make it work.",

The special foldable version, carrying the part name SM8750-3-AB, features one less Performance core, meaning it has a seven-core CPU cluster.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQualcomm never officially talked about the 7-core version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but a footnote in the SoC's technical specification PDF reveals that the chip is available with a 7-core CPU.\n\nAs per Mishaal Rahman's \"OEM sources,\" this binned version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is meant for foldables.

Despite one fewer core, the foldable version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite should deliver almost the same performance as the regular version.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the manufacturer to decide whether to use the binned version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite in their foldables. So there's always a possibility we may see some foldables launch with the 8-core variant of the chip.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA possible Geekbench score of the upcoming Oppo Find N5, which will be marketed as the OnePlus Open 2 in the US, has emerged online, indicating that it will feature the 7-core Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.\n\nThis is the first time Qualcomm has launched a binned version of its flagship SoC with one less core for foldables.

We've already heard rumors that the brand could be prepping a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Elite chip and a higher-tier Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy system-on-a-chip. Now, the chipmaker has quietly announced a separate seven-core Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, according to a newly-listed document.\n\nAs spotted by Android Authority, this new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip appears to be identical to the regular version, minus a performance core. It's listed under part number SM8750-3-AB on Qualcomm's website. You'll get two Prime cores with this chip, just like the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite, but only five performance cores instead of six.\n\nThis could be a \"binned\" Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. SoC binning is when a chipmaker offers a lower-cost and lower-performance version of a processor with cores disabled, and it's a way to get usage out of chips that may not meet the general quality control and yield requirements for the regular variant.\n\nAlthough one performance core appears to be disabled on this Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, everything else is the same, including the clock speeds. The two Prime cores are clocked at up to 4.32GHz, while the five performance cores are clocked at up to 3.53GHz.\n\n(Image credit: Qualcomm)\n\nAlthough this lesser Snapdragon 8 Elite model and its 2+5 configuration will undoubtedly be weaker than the full-fledged Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unclear by how much. If the binned Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with seven cores provides similar performance to the octa-core Snapdragon 8 Elite, it could be enticing to OEMs. It has been widely reported that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more expensive than past Snapdragon chips, and a cheaper chip would be an attractive option for midrange devices.\n\nHowever, due to the wide variety of flagship devices that offer an eight-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unlikely that OEMs would be able to use the seven-core variant in a smartphone without offering a lower sticker price.\n\nWe'll have to wait for this new Snapdragon 8 Elite variant to show up in a device to test how it compares to the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite. Additionally, it's worth keeping an eye out for the other Snapdragon 8 Elite revisions rumored to debut soon, like the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite \"for Galaxy\" and the Snapdragon 8s Elite.",

Just recently, we reported on how SemiAccurate, a renowned research firm, claimed that there's a 90% chance of an Intel buyout, and the \"paywalled\" report mentioned the name of Elon Musk involved in the negotiations, further fueling the rumors to new heights.

Dylan from SemiAnalysis claims that there are some kinds of talks going around that involve Elon Musk, the semiconductor firm Global Foundries, and the chipmaker Qualcomm, saying that all of these parties are at Mar-a-Lago potentially discussing Intel's takeover along with several other aspects.\n\nInterestingly, Citibank's analyst Christopher Danely has discussed the \"Intel-Elon\" rumor as well, and here's what he had to say:\n\nWe view this as a poor outcome for Intel unless it was able to hire a CEO who would exit the merchant foundry business. - via SeekingAlpha\n\nElon getting involved in the party is undoubtedly huge for Intel as a business, given how big of an influence he would have on the takeover. While there's uncertainty around how big of a role Elon will play in this deal, it's likely that he might put his financial resources to good use, transforming Intel into something completely different and maybe revolutionary. While this rumor should be taken with a grain of salt for now, it shouldn't be ruled out entirely, given that Musk tends to surprise us several times.\n\nInvestors have already reacted positively to the development, with Intel's shares rising by up to nearly 10 percent.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best cheap stocks to buy for 2025.\n\nThe U.S. consumer prices report released this week revealed a less-than-expected increase in December, signaling a potential cooling in inflation pressures. This data has sparked bets on further tame inflation and a drop in interest rates. The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2%, down from 0.3% over the previous four months. This marks the first decrease in the rate of core CPI growth in six months, driven by lower hotel prices, slower increases in medical care costs, and moderate rent growth.\n\nThe data has renewed hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates sooner than anticipated. Before the report, most market participants expected rate cuts to occur in the second half of the year, if at all. However, the latest data has bolstered expectations for two cuts this year and even the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. Following the release, Treasury yields dropped, the S&P 500 rose, and the dollar weakened.\n\nThe sharp surge in equity prices is not surprising, as lower interest rates are generally bullish for several reasons. When interest rates fall, borrowing becomes cheaper for companies, which can lead to increased investment and expansion. Stock prices are often valued based on the present value of future earnings or cash flows, discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates reduce the discount rate, increase the present value of future earnings, and make stocks appear more valuable.\n\nRead Also: 11 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy and 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on January 16, Christopher Waller, Governor of the Federal Reserve, discussed the recent economic data and its implications for future monetary policy decisions. Waller welcomed the strong jobs report from the previous week and the latest inflation prints, which he found particularly encouraging. He noted that the inflation data was very positive, with core PCE inflation coming in below 0.2% for the sixth month out of the last eight. This trend, he believes, is bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target in terms of core, despite a couple of bumps in September and October.\n\nWaller emphasized that while the inflation data is promising, it is crucial to see if this trend continues. He mentioned that base effects from last year will play a role, but he is hopeful that a repeat of the shock experienced in January and February of last year will not occur again. If the current trend persists, he suggested that rate cuts could be on the table in the first half of the year.\n\nWhen asked about the exact timing of potential rate cuts, Waller indicated that much depends on the continued improvement in inflation data. He stressed that the Fed is not in a rush to act, as Chair Jerome Powell has stated, and that they need to see more progress on inflation before making any decisions. Waller mentioned that while March is not entirely ruled out, any significant economic disruptions could push the timeline back. Regarding the number of rate cuts that might be expected this year, Waller reiterated that the data will drive the Fed\u2019s decisions. He noted that the extent of progress on inflation and the perception of the neutral rate among policymakers will influence the number of cuts.\n\nThe latest consumer price data has sparked optimism among investors, as easing inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts create a more favorable environment for businesses and markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 best cheap stocks to buy for 2025, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest companies trading below the forward P/E ratio of 15 as of January 15.

            "content": "C. Scott Brown / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Qualcomm has listed a new 7-core variant of the Snapdragon 8 Elite.\n\nThis new variant (SM8750-3-AB) is essentially the same as the flagship chipset with one fewer Performance core.\n\nQualcomm released its latest flagship mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, last October. The octa-core chip has already made its way to the market, powering top-end devices from OnePlus, Nubia, and Xiaomi. This chip will also make an appearance on Samsung\u2019s upcoming Galaxy S25 series, but Qualcomm seems to have another, less capable variant of the Snapdragon 8 Elite that could power a new range of affordable flagships.\n\nThe chipmaker recently listed this Snapdragon 8 Elite variant (part number SM8750-3-AB) on its website. The main difference between the flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite and this new variant is that the latter features one less performance core.\n\nThe flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite packs eight CPU cores, consisting of two Prime cores clocked at up to 4.32GHz and six Performance cores clocked at up to 3.53GHz. In contrast, the new chip has Prime and Performance cores in a 2+5 configuration. The remaining specifications remain unchanged, leading us to believe it could be a binned version with one Performance core disabled.\n\nThe hepta-core Snapdragon 8 Elite will likely cost less than the full-blown flagship chipset and, as such, could help OEMs launch a new range of affordable flagship phones. However, we currently don\u2019t have any confirmation on that front, so we\u2019ll have to wait to see how things pan out.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Qualcomm is also said to be working on another sub-flagship SoC called the Snapdragon 8s Elite. Leaks suggest that this chip will feature one Cortex-X4 Prime core clocked at 3.21GHz, three Cortex-A720 Performance cores clocked at 3.01GHz, two Cortex-A720 Efficiency cores clocked at 2.80GHz, and two more Efficiency cores closed at 2.02GHz.\n\nThe rumored Snapdragon 8s Elite has the same core configuration as last year\u2019s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip but has lower clock speeds across the board. Therefore, it shouldn\u2019t be as capable as the hepta-core Snapdragon 8 Elite, potentially limiting it to premium mid-range smartphones.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

It\u2019s THE most powerful SoC for smartphones right now, and while that means more smartphone manufacturers will use it, it also means some will miss out due to the high pricing of the SoC. Hence, there\u2019s a new slower Snapdragon 8 Elite variant in town.\n\nAs per this official product brief, Qualcomm has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, codenamed SM850-3-AB. It\u2019s a Snapdragon 8 Elite (benchmarks) but with one less performance core in a nutshell. The original variant had the codename SM850-AB and came with 2 x 4.32 GHz Prime cores and 6 x 3.53 GHz performance cores. The new SKU, on the other hand, only has 5 x 3.53 GHz cores besides the 2 x 4.32 GHz Prime cores.\n\nImage Credit: Qualcomm (edited by Abubakar Mohammed / Beebom)\n\nQualcomm says the altered 8 Elite still achieves significant performance gains over the 8 Gen 3. This hepta-core SoC could be for manufacturers who want to save on hefty costs of the original 8 Elite. It could essentially be a skinned-down version of the 8 Elite with one core disabled.\n\nAlso Read: A New Snapdragon X Chip Is Here for Budget Laptops\n\nWhile smartphone buyers would still expect OEMs to include the original SKU, we believe the SM850-3-AB could do well in price-sensitive markets. The second-generation Oryon cores are great, and yanking off one core from the equation shouldn\u2019t bring the performance down dramatically.\n\nThat said, it should be interesting to see which manufacturers take the new 8 Elite up at all. That\u2019s because we still don\u2019t know the price difference between the regular 8 Elite and the nerfed SKU. If it enables manufacturers to come up with sub-$500 smartphones, it might be worth it after all.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the slower Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC? Let us know in the comments below.",

Apparently, there is another Snapdragon 8 Elite that features one less core, and likely exists to allow Qualcomm\u2019s partners to continue launching flagships with the SoC, but keeping the price in check.\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite with a 7-core cluster is likely the result of chip-binning, Qualcomm following the same approach as Apple and others\n\nThe new Snapdragon 8 Elite features the unique identifier \u2018SM8750-3-AB,\u2019 and thankfully, the two performance and efficiency cores are running at their same default clock speed, meaning that Qualcomm made no compromise in this area. The San Diego firm has reduced the total number of cores, so smartphones that ship with this SoC will flaunt a 7-core configuration instead of an 8-core one.\n\nIt is clear that Qualcomm has resorted to chip-binning, which is an approach followed by Apple when using an A17 Pro with one less GPU core for the iPad mini 7 last year. This strategy allows companies to develop less powerful versions of their current-generation chip instead of discarding the entire batch. This particular variant might not compromise on the single-core scores, but its multi-core result will be lower than the 8-core part.\n\nThen again, given how expensive it is to produce the Snapdragon 8 Elite, some of Qualcomm\u2019s phone partners will gladly want to save up on component costs for a small performance cut that is only visible in synthetic benchmarks. The only problem is for consumers, as they have to keep a closer eye on a smartphone\u2019s specifications before undertaking a purchase.\n\nOftentimes, a buyer will get overly excited over the fact that a Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered handset is available for less than the typical price of a flagship powered by Qualcomm\u2019s chipset, so looking at these details with an eagle eye just became a whole lot more important.\n\nNews Source: Qualcomm",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock\u2019s 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won\u2019t undermine the companies\u2019 future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\nNASDAQ\u2019s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market\u2019s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market.\n\nThe NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends.\n\nWe recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy . In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOverall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds\u2019 sentiment toward them.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

            "content": "Qualcomm underwhelmed at CES but had a few disclosures worth talking about. SemiAccurate would love to go into detail about the releases but the source material was lacking.\n\nThere were five major groups of \u2018news\u2019 the company released at the show, two of which had actual data in them. The other three, automotive, IOT cloud services, and smart home, were devoid of actual technical anything. The automotive section was a release about several partnerships but no mention of product that we could find. After several hours of briefings, SemiAccurate is still at a loss about the actual automotive offerings, things like the names of chips, much less specs.\n\nThe IOT cloud services offering is, well we aren\u2019t sure. There was a deck showing pretty diagrams but nothing that said anything about what is actually being used, just the idea as a useful business choice that makes smiling stock photo businessdrones seem happy. The smart home bit was just a copy of their blog, something we contend is silly to put out because it is essentially competition that we can\u2019t add anything useful too.\n\nLuckily from here things got a little better. The first bit is the release of Purwa SE although Qualcomm never called it that. Purwa SE is the little brother to the Qualcomm Homoa/X Elite SoCs.\n\nWe like the silicon but the end user product is so stunningly bad that we can\u2019t get it to do more than boot loop after several months of trying. Software enablement matters people. That said Purwa is a cut down Homoa with essentially half the GPU. The GPU was the painfully weak part of Homoa and to save money, Qualcomm halved it. They didn\u2019t touch the utterly useless \u2018AI\u2019 unit because marketing is based on it, same for the CPU. GPUs didn\u2019t feature in the marketing materials so they had to go.\n\nCompletely inadequate for purpose but not for marketing\n\nPurwa SE/Snapdragon X has 8 cores in this tier, tops out at 3GHz, and the NPU is still at 45 TOPS. That Microsoft CoPilot sticker has lots of MDF behind it, but the silicon is unchanged from the IFA debut. In short it is slower at everything, so why do it? Officially it is to enable a lower priced PC coming in at $600 but Qualcomm curiously never mentions yield salvage anywhere in the releases. The only Purwa SE device we saw at CES had a price tag of $899 so\u2026 err\u2026 stick with Intel devices, they actually work and aren\u2019t hardware backdoored by a third party. There is no reason for anyone to buy a \u2018PC\u2019 based on Purwa SE/Snapdragon X.\n\nThe last chip is kind of interesting in a historical sense, remember the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 chip from the \u2018before time\u2019? In the distant days of 2019, Qualcomm teased an AI ASIC called Cloud AI 100 and SemiAccurate thought it was really interesting. A 16nm inference chip backed by the software stack from the Qualcomm phones actually sounds interesting doesn\u2019t it? The bit about no fans was also a positive sign that no one else seems to have caught at the introduction. Then it vanished, poof, radio silence.\n\nNow step forward five years and it is finally out! Yay? A 16nm inference chip that doesn\u2019t need a fan, on the card it appears, and supports the best AI formats of the last decade. Things have advanced in the interim. 16nm begat 12nm which gave way to 10nm. 7nm then took over and 5nm was next, the former was current at the time of the 2019 introduction. 4nm and 3nm are in place now with 2nm on the near horizon, plus many half-nodes between. 16nm seems a tad\u2026 err\u2026 dated. But it is out and it looks like this.\n\nWhy does anyone care in 2025?\n\nThe Cloud AI 100 name is never mentioned in the slides but the renderings have it on the cards. There are three variants, Standard, Pro, and Ultra. From what we gather, Pro is the full chip, Standard is a cut down version, and Ultra is two of the Pro chips on a card with significantly more memory. If you tease apart the specs though, interesting bits pop out. DRAM is 16/32/128GB of (we assume they meant) LPDDR4x and bandwidth scales with size from the Pro to the Ultra. This means the Standard and Pro have the same number of channels but different DRAM densities. So far so blindingly obvious.\n\nWhen you get to SRAM, Standard and Pro are close so the SRAM is likely tied to the compute units, a few of which are fused off in Standard. SRAM has the same ratio as the FP16 numbers so there you have it. INT8 scales the same as the FP16 values in case you needed more data there. When you move to the Ultra card though, the RAM bandwidth goes up 4x, SRAM capacity has the same multiple so the performance goes up by a similar amount, right? Not so fast there cowpoke.\n\nOn the above chart, INT8 performance scales superlinearly from Pro to Ultra, something you would expect from 2x the compute chips and 4x the memory size and bandwidth. PCIe bandwidth also doubles in case you were wondering but FP16 performance is up a mere 44%. No clue why on this one but if something screams \u2018serious architectural bottleneck\u2019, this is it. Since there is absolutely no technical info on how the card is laid out or how the chip works, we can\u2019t say but we have glaring red light here folks.\n\nSo who would want the best inference silicon from 2019? Good question. Qualcomm is showing off chassis from Aetina and Lenovo, likely for edge inference but, well, aren\u2019t there better solutions than a 75-300W chassis for this now? This isn\u2019t to say that these things won\u2019t do the job, just that there is better out there now. Process tech has moved on and on and on and on, plus models now use formats simply not supported by the Cloud AI 100. Sure you can refactor your model but why bother?\n\nThe reason we are down on this device is simple, an Intel Lunar Lake CPU has a CPU, GPU, and NPU with a combined 120 TOPS for the platform. This takes between 17-37W, including memory, and supports all the latest models and data formats. Two of these would fit in the same TDP as a single AI 100 Pro card and deliver 60% of the performance. Without a GPU and with CPU resources lowered to match the AI needs, Lunar could easily beat AI 100 in PPW. True dedicated inference hardware, even Qualcomm\u2019s own, would annihilate either platform.\n\nIn short there seems to be little reason for AI 100 to tempt buyers in the year 2025. Worse yet is that if you deploy AI hardware, you probably don\u2019t want to code and tune whatever it is you are doing for one generation of hardware, then have to redo it\n\nfor another architecture. Intel, I am looking at you too. In the 5+ years since introduction, Qualcomm hasn\u2019t uttered a peep about a roadmap, successor parts, or anything else. Would you invest in that?\n\nOne bright note is the OS support for AI 100, generic Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and CentOS. Note what is missing. Without knowing what is on the chip and card, it is hard to say if Cloud AI 100 has an OS running on it or is just an add-on device for a real CPU. Just one of a long line of questions that make us a tad gunshy of this offering, it matters for edge use cases.\n\nSo all in all Qualcomm talked up two devices at CES, Purwa SE and Cloud AI 100, plus three other fluffy things that had nothing behind them. Purwa SE is flat out inadequate on the graphics and compatibility front, Cloud AI 100 is too little too late, and the rest is pure fluff. Nothing bad but nothing good either.S|A",

            "content": "The server CPU market has long been dominated by Intel (INTC 1.48%) and AMD (AMD 2.92%). Both companies make chips based on the x86 architecture. While there are other types of CPUs used for specialized purposes -- think IBM mainframes -- x86 reigns supreme in the data center. Software is compiled and optimized for x86 chips, which creates significant switching costs.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM 3.05%) has already tried and failed once to bring chips based on the Arm architecture, which dominates the smartphone market, to the server market. Qualcomm's Centriq server CPUs failed to gain any traction when they were launched in late 2017, leading the company to greatly scale back its efforts. Switching to Arm-based chips or mixing-and-matching architectures just wasn't worth the effort for any major server CPU customer.\n\nTrying again\n\nQualcomm launched its first Arm-based PC CPUs last year, and although they haven't exactly been a smash hit, partly because of compatibility problems, Arm-based PC are likely to be here to stay. Qualcomm is now seemingly looking to re-enter the server CPU market with new chips.\n\nAccording to a LinkedIn post, Intel veteran and a chief architect of the Xeon server processor family Sailesh Kottapalli is joining Qualcomm after nearly three decades at Intel. In December, Qualcomm disclosed in a job posting that its data center team was working on server products for data center applications. Kottapalli is expected to lead that effort.\n\nWhile Qualcomm's PC chips have issues running certain types of applications, particularly games, using emulation, they provide solid performance and efficiency. Qualcomm can build on that work to go after the data center market.\n\nIt might be different this time\n\nBack in 2018, Qualcomm had little chance of success with its Centriq server CPUs. There was too much inertia behind x86, and the software ecosystem was centered around the dominant architecture.\n\nQualcomm might have better luck this time around thanks to artificial intelligence. Tech giants like Microsoft are spending mountains of money building brand new AI datacenters, and some are even designing their own Arm-based CPUs. The software stack is still evolving, and with Microsoft, Amazon, and others now getting behind Arm-based server CPUs, there's a lot more momentum in 2025 than there was in 2018.\n\nWhile the environment is more welcoming for Qualcomm, the company will face competition from potential customers' in-house chip design efforts as well as any other company that jumps into the market. Nvidia already sells its Grace family of data center CPUs based on the Arm architecture, and others could follow as Arm gains more traction.\n\nDon't count out Intel and AMD\n\nWhile Intel and AMD will face more competition if Qualcomm reenters the server CPU market, both companies have solid product lineups that will be tough to beat. Intel improved its competitive positioning last year with its powerful Granite Rapids chips and efficiency-focused Sierra Forest chips, and this year it plans to use its cutting-edge Intel 18A manufacturing process for Clearwater Forest.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD officially launched its Turin family of server CPUs in October, which goes up to 192 cores. Included in the lineup is a CPU specially designed to act as the host node CPU for a cluster of AI accelerators. AMD's last-generation server CPUs were a big hit, and the company will look to build on that progress.\n\nQualcomm appears to be gearing up to try again in the server CPU market. This time should go better than last time as the environment is far more conducive to Arm-based CPUs, but competition will be fierce.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nConsumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 revolved around AI. If not, it\u2019s all that exhibitors could show. Talking about the highlight of the show, it was undoubtedly the keynote from Jensen Huang. The keynote included new products to advance gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and agentic AI. Huang kicked off his talk by reflecting on the company\u2019s 3-decade journey. Later on, he highlighted several significant advancements.\n\nTakeaways From CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s Keynote at CES 2025\n\nAs per Huang, AI has been advancing at an \u2018incredible pace.\u2019 It started with perception AI, meaning understanding images, words, and sounds. Then it came to generative AI, meaning creating text, images, and sound. And now, it\u2019s the era of physical AI, meaning AI that can proceed, reason, plan, and act. The AI giant introduced GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which are powered by Blackwell architecture. These GPUs provide significant improvements in AI-driven rendering, enhancing gaming and creative workflows. Furthermore, Huang unveiled \u201cCosmos,\u201d which is a suite of foundational AI models capable of generating photorealistic video. The models have been designed in such a way that train robots and automated systems more efficiently, further advancing robotics and autonomous technologies.\n\nThe company and its partners have rolled out AI Blueprints for agentic AI, which includes PDF-to-podcast for efficient research and video search and summarization for assessing significant quantities of video and images \u2014 allowing developers to build, test, and run AI agents anywhere.\n\nAgentic AI- Road Ahead in 2025\n\nTechInformed interviewed experts from leading technology companies to explore predictions about Agentic AI. As per Steven Webb, UK chief technology and innovation officer, Capgemini, 2025 will see wider adoption of small language models (SLMs) and AI agents as an era of Agentic AI is fast approaching. Using multiple SLMs throughout a toolchain is expected to play a critical role in the AI evolution. This will include going beyond the already familiar LLMs such as GPT.\n\nFurthermore, Alan Jacobson (chief data and analytics officer at Alteryx) believes that 2025 will see the rise of Gen AI agents used to solve problems. This is an approach that is made possible by reducing costs and improving the performance and speed of LLMs. Frameworks for orchestrating Agentic AI work are expected to emerge. Notably, a large percentage of use cases are expected to start to employ this approach.",

But a new report suggests that this was just one more bullet in Qualcomm\u2019s growing anti-Intel arsenal, and one that could prove a problem for Intel later on, as though it did not already have enough. Investors are optimistic, though, and sent shares up fractionally in Thursday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nQualcomm has tried to enter the server market before, noted reports, and the result did not go so well for Qualcomm. But apparently, Qualcomm did not take its earlier failures kindly, and went after some of Intel\u2019s leading talent in the form of Sailesh Kottapalli. Kottapalli, who had been with Intel since the 1990s, will now be leading Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to get server products in place.\n\nWhile Qualcomm\u2019s attempts to get in on the server market failed previously with the Centriq server processor, the rise of Arm-based processors from several companies suggests more momentum in the field. That could give Intel a major new competitor at a time when that is about the last thing it needs right now. Intel, however, will not go down quietly; it already has the Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest chips, and will be putting the 18A process to work for the upcoming Clearwater Forest line.\n\nAn NPU Rising?\n\nMeanwhile, a report from Laptop Magazine further underscored the growing rivalry between Intel and Qualcomm with a picture at an Intel event. The picture featured a stage presentation for Intel, complete with the words \u201c21 Games did not run on Qualcomm 84-100.\u201d In that way, Intel is working to make its Arrow Lake processor line more effective, and ultimately, give Intel back some of its edge.\n\nThe Arrow Lake launch did not go well in 2024, the report noted, and thus Intel needs the launch of the mobile version to go a lot better. And with Intel hitting the Consumer Electronics Show strong with the Ultra 200H and 200HX, there are signs that these could help bring things back for Intel. With Arrow Lake mobile chips reportedly doing well on power use, that could be just the extra help that Intel needs, especially in a mobile environment where power use is so vital.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on one Buy, 21 Holds and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 56.42% loss in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $24.48 per share implies 23.7% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Up to 300 per cent British chip technology supplier Arm wants to jack up tits royalty rates by up to 300 per cent and develop its own chips in a move that could place it in direct competition with its largest customers.\n\nThe plans, originating under SoftBank\u2019s ownership and discussed during a recent trial with Qualcomm, underscore Arm\u2019s ambition to expand its revenue and market influence.\n\nFor decades, Arm has supplied chip designs and intellectual property to major companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Microsoft, charging modest royalties for each chip manufactured using its architecture. Despite its pivotal role in powering billions of devices, Arm\u2019s fiscal-year 2024 revenue of $3.23 billion pales compared to its customers\u2019 earnings. Apple, for instance, generates more than 90 times that amount from its hardware products alone.\n\nSoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Arm CEO Rene Haas are determined to bolster the company\u2019s position. Internal documents and testimony from the Qualcomm trial revealed a long-term plan, codenamed \u201cPicasso,\u201d to raise per-chip royalties, particularly for Arm\u2019s latest architecture, Armv9, and generate an additional $1 billion in annual smartphone revenue over the next decade.\n\nA 2019 strategy document highlighted a proposed 300 per cent hike in royalty rates for certain ready-made chip design elements. However, large customers such as Apple and Qualcomm, capable of creating chips from scratch using Arm\u2019s architecture, may bypass these increases. Qualcomm\u2019s 2021 acquisition of Nuvia was noted as a step toward reducing its reliance on Arm\u2019s pre-designed solutions.\n\nHaas has also suggested a potential shift in Arm\u2019s business model, advocating for the sale of complete chips or chiplets in addition to blueprints. During the trial, he downplayed the possibility of entering the chip-design market, framing it as part of long-term strategic discussions rather than an imminent move.\n\nArm\u2019s evolving strategy has raised concerns among its customers. During a 2022 meeting with Samsung executives, SoftBank\u2019s Son reportedly pointed out the impending expiration of Qualcomm\u2019s Arm license in 2025, creating uncertainty around future supply agreements. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon testified that the episode prompted Samsung to shorten a chip supply deal with Qualcomm from three years to two.\n\nMeanwhile, Arm continues to expand its reach beyond smartphones into PC and data centre markets, a move that reflects its efforts to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving industry.",

However, the new SKU in the Snapdragon X family was hardly the most interesting thing Qualcomm brought to the computing space of CES. Qualcomm has expanded its app partnerships for Windows on Arm to include the Moises App, DJay Pro, Steinberg Cubase, and Capture One.\n\nSo what's new with Snapdragon?\n\nDJay Pro and Capture One\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nQualcomm announced a partnership with Algoriddim for DJay Pro back in May 2024 at Microsoft Build. The application is usable on all Snapdragon platforms, including the new budget Snapdragon X chipset. DJay Pro wasn't quite ready to go for Windows on Arm at launch, but it is available now on Snapdragon X devices.\n\nThe special feature Qualcomm showcased at CES 2025 was DJay Pro's Neural Mix software, which allows for real-time music source separation, allowing you to adjust and remix singular elements of a track in real time to isolate beats, instruments, or vocals in the midst of a performance. So, if you want to emphasize the cowbell in \"Livin on a Prayer,\" you can now get speedy isolation support on Snapdragon machines and Apple's MacBook line.\n\nQualcomm also showcased CaptureOne in a demo photo studio complete with a multi-monitor setup, studio lights, and a camera that was plugged into the Snapdragon X Elite laptop for additional control right from the digital workstation. Not only did the Snapdragon X-powered workstation control the camera and a dual monitor setup, but Qualcomm also leveraged the built-in Hexagon NPU for quicker and easier photo editing, essentially allowing photographers to leverage post-production effects in pre-production.\n\nWhile both the DJay Pro and CaptureOne applications had been announced for Snapdragon X prior to CES, this was our first time seeing both applications in action on Snapdragon X Elite laptops.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMoises Live\n\n(Image credit: Moises)\n\nNew for CES 2025 was a demo of the Moises Live feature in the Moises App. A preview build of this feature was showcased at Snapdragon Summit in October 2024, but the feature is now live and exclusive on the Snapdragon X Series.\n\nMoises Live will leverage the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU to isolate vocals and instruments in any audio streamed on a Snapdragon X platform. So whether you're streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, you can get crystal clear audio tuned to your specific needs in seconds with the Moises Live application.\n\nQualcomm demoed the app using a recording of live music, and the adjustments were seamless.\n\nSteinberg Cubase\n\n(Image credit: Steinberg Cubase)\n\nFinally, Qualcomm showed off Steinberg Cubase and Nuendo, which are now available on Windows on Arm with Snapdragon X. This was the one live demo Qualcomm showcased on Snapdragon X Plus machines, while all of the others were running on Snapdragon X Elite platforms.\n\nNot only has Qualcomm achieved MIDI support for electronic instruments, and pioneered low-latency audio with a native ASIO driver, but the company hosted a live music riff session showing off the low-latency drivers and MIDI support using Steinberg Cubase to cover various guitar effects pedals. If I didn't know the entire performance was run on a few Snapdragon X laptops, I would honestly have believed it was performed using standard effects pedals and amplifiers.\n\nWhile Steinberg's music applications are useful for live music, and that's how Qualcomm showcased the applications, they're also used in music production and recording. This allows Qualcomm to compete with Apple's native and third-party music recording software.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nCreatives, particularly in the music and photo studio space, have long been a core user base for Apple. Because Apple's platform is plug-and-play, it makes it easy to connect a camera, a guitar, or a set of turntables to a MacBook and get started. So, with MIDI support, native ASIO drivers, and multi-monitor support, the Snapdragon X series is a solid competitor to the MacBook.\n\nAnd considering the massive updates to Qualcomm's native application portfolio, the company is clearly hoping creatives will flock to Snapdragon X laptops instead since they'll be available for much less than the MacBook Pro line. Plus, unlike previous Snapdragon X demos, which used custom hardware to run DaVinci Resolve, all of these demos were run live on consumer laptops that are currently available on the market.\n\nBut it's hard to predict that these creatives will ditch the MacBook anytime soon. Apple's dominance in art spaces has been running for decades, lasting through the final Intel-Mac years, which were inarguably Apple's worst MacBook hardware in recent years, with the much-maligned \"butterfly\" keyboard and Touch Bar. If those weren't enough to get creatives to switch to Windows, I'm not sure Snapdragon will move the needle.\n\nBut you've got to respect the efforts Qualcomm has put into building out the Windows on Arm ecosystem over the course of a single year. Apple's reputation with creatives wasn't built in a day either, so perhaps Qualcomm can slowly win over a new generation.",

            "content": "Qualcomm is actively working on expanding its product range by diversifying into broader categories and offering more varied pricing. Now, a new report claims that the company is working on a new high-end chipset that will focus on introducing a new tier falling between the Snapdragon 8 Elite and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This move could potentially stem from the need to bridge the gap between the Snapdragon 7 series and the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 lineup. By introducing another SoC in the \"s\" category, the intention remains to extend to more market segments by offering high-end performance without the price associated with the top-tier offering.\n\nA new report claims that Qualcomm is working on a new chipset called the Snapdragon 8s Elite\n\nQualcomm is experimenting with its chipsets and pivoting into new directions by adopting new strategies that cater to more users and bring more flexibility for OEMs. Now, as per a renowned tipster's report, Digital Chat Station, Qualcomm is working on a new niche by introducing a high-end chipset. The Snapdragon 8s Elite is said to sit between the company's flagship and premium SoC, meant to offer near-flagship performance at an affordable price range.\n\nAs per the report shared on Weibo, the Snapdragon 8s Elite (Qualcomm SM8735) will feature a sophisticated CPU architecture that delivers high performance and efficiency. It would come with a well-balanced core configuration that includes a single high-performance Cortex-X4 core at 3.21 GHz and three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01 GHz, along with two Cortex-A720 efficiency cores at 2.80 GHz. Along with this, there would be two more efficiency cores operating at 2.02 GHz meant to be optimized for less demanding tasks.\n\nIf we look at Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, it seems to be purely focused on performance. It emphasizes power over energy saving as it does not come with dedicated efficiency cores. Instead, it has two powerful Oryon cores at 4.32 GHz and six performance cores clocked at 3.53 GHz. It stands out from earlier models with greater emphasis on raw computational power.\n\nThe CPU configuration for the Snapdragon 8s Elite and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are quite similar, but the cores for the 8s Elite come at a relatively lower speed, which further reflects how it is not meant to offer the full performance of the flagship chipsets yet offer strong performance. The report further claims that Redmi or iQOO might be the first one to power the chipset and could, in fact, appeal greatly to users looking for a premium mid-range phone. Although the report does not specify a potential release date for the Snapdragon 8s Elite, considering the previous pattern, it could be launching soon.",

Following the same formula as the Snapdragon 6, 7 and 8 series, Qualcomm plans to return to the market with another \u201cs\u201d chipset.Reliable leakerhas provided us with the first technical details of the Snapdragon 8s Elite (Qualcomm SM8735). According to his post on Weibo , the upcoming chipset features one prime Cortex-X4 core clocked at 3.21 GHz, three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01 GHz, two efficiency Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 2.80 GHz, and another two efficiency cores clocked at 2.02 GHz.In comparison, Qualcomm\u2019s flagship chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, features two prime Oryon cores clocked at 4.32 GHz and six 3.53 GHz performance cores. Unlike previous generations, the Snapdragon 8 Elite lacks any efficiency cores.Although the Snapdragon 8s Elite has similar CPU configuration as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, its cores provide lower speeds, which indicates that the upcoming SoC is meant for sub-flagships rather than full-fledged top-of-the-line smartphones.The report also mentions some brand names like iQOO and Redmi, which are said to be among the first to release phones powered by Qualcomm\u2019s unannounced Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset.Unfortunately, the leaker doesn\u2019t provide any information about the possible launch date of the Snapdragon 8s Elite. However, considering that Qualcomm released the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset in March, the Snapdragon 8s Elite might be coming in two months from now if the company decides to follow the same marketing strategy",

            "content": "Arm Holdings, a technology supplier to chip firms, is developing a long-term strategy to hike prices by as much as 300% and has discussed designing its own chips in a move to compete with its biggest customers.\n\nFor decades, the British firm kept a low profile while operating at the heart of billions of dollars of chip sales per year. It licenses the intellectual property that Apple, Qualcomm, Microsoft and others use to design their chips, charging a small royalty for each chip produced with Arm technology.\n\nDespite its key role in the rise of smartphones and energy-efficient data center chips, Arm has remained small compared with its customers, with $3.23 billion in revenue for fiscal-year 2024. In its most recent fiscal year, Apple\u2019s revenue from hardware products, which are all powered by Arm-based chips, was more than 90 times larger. But Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group, which owns 90% of Arm, and Arm CEO Rene Haas, are determined to change that, according to plans revealed in a trial last month in which Arm aimed unsuccessfully to secure higher royalty rates from Qualcomm. The details of Arm\u2019s ambitions, which were described in court testimony and documents that remain under seal, have not been previously reported.\n\nArm and Qualcomm declined to comment.\n\nKnown in its early stages as the \u201cPicasso\u201d project, Arm\u2019s plans, which date back to at least 2019, aim for a roughly $1 billion increase in annual smartphone revenue over about 10 years, according to sealed executive testimony.\n\nArm planned to achieve this partly by increasing the per-chip royalty rates that customers pay for ready-made parts of chip designs that used its latest computing architecture, called Armv9.\n\nDuring the trial, documents were shown from August 2019 in which Arm executives discussed a 300% rate increase. In December 2019, Arm\u2019s then-CEO, Simon Segars, told Son, Arm\u2019s board chairman, that Arm had secured a deal with Qualcomm to use ready-made technology under the \u201cPicasso\u201d initiative.\n\nBut Qualcomm and other large customers such as Apple are sophisticated enough to design their own chips from scratch using Arm\u2019s architecture without needing Arm\u2019s higher-priced ready-made offerings, meaning they would not necessarily be subject to all of those rate increases.\n\n\u201cWe have rough legacy agreements with Qualcomm and Fender,\u201d Haas said in a Microsoft Teams chat held the day Qualcomm bought Nuvia in 2021, shown at trial. The startup would help Qualcomm use less of Arm\u2019s ready-made technology.\n\n\u201cFender\u201d is Arm\u2019s internal code name for Apple. Apple declined to comment.\n\n\u2018CHILL\u2019 FOR CUSTOMERS\n\nAfter SoftBank acquired Arm in 2016, the British firm\u2019s computing architecture went from powering smartphones to making big inroads in PC and data center markets.\n\nThe plans Arm executives discussed included potentially inching closer to making a complete chip design of Arm\u2019s own, according to testimony and documents at trial. Arm sells chip-design blueprints, but most of its customers still spend months completing the chip design.\n\n\u201cIt was news to me that Arm is even thinking about (making its own chip),\u201d said Tantra Analyst founder Prakash Sangam, who attended the trial. \u201cIt should send a chill down the spine of their customers.\u201d\n\nAt the trial, Qualcomm attorneys showed a slide from Haas\u2019 presentation to Arm\u2019s board in February 2022 when he applied to become CEO that suggested Arm change its business model. Haas said instead of selling only chip blueprints, Arm should sell chips or chiplets, a smaller building block used to make some processors made by Advanced Micro Devices and others.\n\nIn a conversation with another Arm executive a few months earlier, Haas expressed confidence that Arm could compete against its own customers if it put a chip into the marketplace, according to testimony and documents.\n\n\u201c(The) rest are hosed,\u201d Haas said in a Teams message from December 2021, shown during the trial, referring to the problems chip companies such as Qualcomm would face competing with a complete Arm chip design.\n\nDuring the trial, Haas downplayed those comments, saying they reflected the long-term strategic spitballing in which many executives engage in talks with colleagues and board members.\n\nHaas said while Arm never got into the chip-design business, he is always considering possible strategies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I think about, is the future,\u201d he told the eight-person jury.\n\nThe trial also included showing Arm sought to work more closely with device makers.\n\nIn October 2022, Son and Haas met with executives at Samsung . During that meeting, Son told Samsung executives that Qualcomm\u2019s license with Arm would expire in 2025.\n\nQualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon testified that Samsung later expressed concern about Qualcomm\u2019s ability to supply Samsung with chips. Amon testified he assured Samsung that Qualcomm has an Arm license until 2033.\n\nSamsung later reduced a three-year chip supply agreement with Qualcomm to two years because of the uncertainty created by the episode, Amon testified. Arm has objected to some aspects of Amon\u2019s testimony. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max A.

            "content": "Still, underwater archaeology is tricky; communication and documentation is challenging and objects can be fragile and difficult to reach or view. And, it can be hard to survey marine sites while conserving them in their present states. That\u2019s where technology \u2014 or the \u201ccyber\u201d part of cyber-archaeology \u2014 comes in.\n\n\u201cCyber-archaeology is the marriage of archaeology, computer science, engineering and the natural sciences that takes advantage of the information technology revolution,\u201d Levy explained. Applying cyber-archaeological technologies like 3D mapping, photogrammetry and remote sensing (among many others) can make marine archaeology more accessible.\n\nQualcomm Institute Associate Research Scientist Neil Smith helped develop many of those techniques; a computational research scientist, he co-directs the CCAS with Levy, who was his graduate advisor during his time as a doctoral student in anthropology at UC San Diego. One such technique? Underwater photogrammetry, which stitches together hundreds of photos to form movable 3D images.\n\nThis type of rapid photo capture can quickly produce digital models of delicate underwater sites or massive archaeological digs; said reproductions \u2014 sometimes called digital twins \u2014 can be manipulated and viewed from anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cOur goal with the center is to preserve at-risk cultural heritage,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cNow, we\u2019re starting to move into this realm of \u2018How do we allow people to understand and learn about the archaeology that we\u2019ve had the privilege to see with our own eyes?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe hopes that virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) could be one way to do so.\n\nSmith directs the Immersive Visualization Center at UC San Diego, which develops VR and AR technologies for mainstream and academic uses \u2014 including archaeology. Through projects like the digital artifact library called the Cyber-Archeology Warehouse, Smith is pushing to bring digitization and gamification to the forefront of archeological methods.\n\n\u201cMy vision for cyber-archaeology over the next several years is that it\u2019ll become a methodology and an approach to archaeology that becomes universally adopted by all archaeologists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the point where we drop the word \u2018cyber\u2019 from the front and those methods become what archaeology really is.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Levy pointed out, \"Today, the drivers of cyber-archaeology are the historical and anthropological questions we seek to answer. As the Eastern Mediterranean and Israel's Carmel coast are on the land bridge between Africa and Asia, the region is one of the richest places in the world to investigate these unique connections from remote prehistory to the recent past.\"",

Kottapalli spent 28 years at Intel and worked on various projects, including x86 and Itanium, as well as CPUs and GPUs. More recently, he was responsible for multiple generations of Xeon processors.\n\n\"As we head into 2025, I am excited to share that I have joined Qualcomm,\" Kottapali wrote in a post on LinkedIn. \"The opportunity to innovate and grow while helping to scale new frontiers was immensely compelling to me, a once-in-a-career opportunity that I could not pass on. The start of this new chapter also coincides with the closing of a previous one at Intel that lasted 28 years. This experience was tremendously gratifying, and I would like to acknowledge it.\"\n\nKottapalli joins Qualcomm as a senior vice president and will lead the company's data center CPU efforts. Qualcomm's upcoming server CPUs are expected to use cores developed by engineers from Nuvia, a company Qualcomm acquired for $1.4 billion in 2021. Nuvia originally designed its Arm-based Phoenix (now called Oryon) cores with data centers in mind, but Qualcomm uses them for Snapdragon X system-on-chips (SoC) for consumer PCs, which upset Arm and led to litigation between the two companies.\n\nThis is not Qualcomm's first foray into server CPUs. The company previously attempted to enter the market with Centriq but abandoned those efforts in 2018 and laid off its development team. This new initiative marks a return with a stronger focus and expanded resources.\n\nIt should be noted that a wider range of data center software now supports the Arm instruction set architecture. Furthermore, as Amazon expands its Graviton-based offerings, the data center industry's confidence in Arm processors increases, so Qualcomm has every reason to assume that demand for its upcoming server processors will be higher than it was back in the day. To some degree, the hire of Sailesh Kottapalli serves the same purpose as people tend to trust server industry veterans.\n\nJust yesterday we also learned that Qualcomm is looking for an SoC Security Architect for its Data Center Team.",

At the same time, he can help his new employer explore new frontiers. It was an opportunity Kottapalli said he could not pass up. Qualcomm has been coveting the server silicon market for years. This is a high-margin sector with established players.\n\nLong career\n\nKottapalli has the necessary skills to support the company in this endeavor. According to his Intel biography, he was Platform Engineering Group Director for Datacenter Processor Architecture. The biography also describes a long career that began with work on the first Itanium processor. He eventually advanced to chief engineer for more chips in that product line before becoming chief architect for a range of Intel Xeon server processors.\n\nWork in this area even earned Kottapalli an Intel Achievement Award for achieving record-breaking one-generation performance in a high-end server product.\n\nGood performance Snapdragon\n\nKottapalli\u2019s parting message does not specify what he will work on at Qualcomm, but the company has plenty of reasons to pursue the server market.

The San Diego chipmaker has revealed intentions to aggressively look into new business opportunities in the past as well, and server CPUs are what the company will target next. In light of this, Qualcomm has reportedly hired Intel's Chief Architect for Xeon CPUs, Sailesh Kottapalli, who will now be the Senior Vice President at his new workplace and will be responsible for Qualcomm's next big project.\n\nInterestingly, in a recent job listing, Qualcomm has been looking for a \"Server SoC Security Architect,\" claiming that the job will be a part of the firm's data center team, validating that the San Diego chipmaker is working in this particular segment. Here's the more important part of the job listing, revealing what we can expect from Qualcomm's server CPUs:\n\nOur focus is on developing reference platforms based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC, delivering a comprehensive solution that includes hardware, software, reference designs, user guides, SDKs, and more.\n\nWith Qualcomm formally hiring a key part of Intel's Xeon team, the firm is certainly determined to compete in this segment, coming right after the mainstream competitors. In terms of what Qualcomm's server CPUs could look like, they will employ Nuvia's HPC-specific cores, as disclosed last year in a legal filing. And given that Nuvia x Qualcomm initially intended to push out server CPUs before the Snapdragon X Elite series, it won't be wrong to say that development is already in progress,\n\nQualcomm's Centriq Server CPU\n\nAnother interesting take on Qualcomm's server CPU ambitions is that this might be one of the first ARM-based mainstream solutions for the data center markets, given that x86 has dominated with AMD and Intel options. There are projects such as Amazon's Graviton and Ampere Computing's processors, but they haven't seen the market spotlight for now. Considering how Qualcomm has successfully executed \"Windows on ARM\" successfully, we can see the firm doing the same with its upcoming server CPUs.\n\nQualcomm has already pushed out server CPUs in the past, under its \"Centriq\" lineup back in 2016, and while the CPUs gained immense market spotlight, the San Diego chipmaker failed to deliver on expectations, given the limited software support with ARM-based solutions, and the x86 dominance at that time, so this is something Qualcomm has to nail perfectly in order to succeed in this segment.\n\nNews Source: CRN",

            "content": "As one year ends and another begins, this is often the time when people change jobs and companies change strategies. So it is never much of a surprise to see key people in datacenter compute change jobs, seeking new opportunities and better strategies, or to hear about potential acquisition targets.\n\nOddly, the scuttlebutt and job changes are about datacenter CPUs when what the world is focused on \u2013 and what an increasing amount of datacenter dollars are spent on \u2013 are datacenter GPUs and the interconnects that lash them together.\n\nThe big move this week, which is not a rumor but a fact, is that Intel Fellow and chip architect Sailesh Kottapalli, which was at the chip maker for nearly three decades and who was the main designer of the last several generations of Xeon datacenter CPUs, has joined Qualcomm as a senior vice president. Kottapalli did not give out his precise job description in his job change announcement on LinkedIn, but it is not hard to figure that he will be working on datacenter compute engines of some kind.\n\nThe circumstantial evidence that Qualcomm is going to take a third run at the datacenter CPU market is mounting, particularly with a December 9 job posting by the Qualcomm Data Center team saying that the company \u201cis developing High performance, Energy efficient server solution for data center applications.\u201d Not sure why High and Energy are capitalized in that description, but perhaps that is a subliminal message to job seekers to drink a lot of coffee and be motivated. In any event, that particular job is for an SoC security architect, and is obviously not the job that Kottapalli is taking. But it seems unequivocal that Qualcomm is rubbing its hands together when looking at the datacenter and a particularly weakened Intel with its underbelly exposed as it wrestles with foundry and datacenter product line issues.\n\nQualcomm released a prototype Arm server CPU back in 2016 under the guiding hand of Anand Chandrasekher, the general manager at Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies and formerly one of the top execs at Intel in charge of workstation and then mobile products. The \u201cAmberwing\u201d Centriq 2400 processor, with 48 Armv8 cores, was unveiled in November 2017, and by May 2018 Qualcomm pulled the plug on its server CPU aspirations. This was before the hyperscalers and cloud builders excepting Amazon Web Services started designing their own Arm server CPUs, and the rumor was that Google \u2013 and possibly Facebook and Microsoft \u2013funded the Centriq effort. This was never confirmed, but perhaps the Amberwing chip underwhelmed and the price was too high.\n\nSince then, of course, Google and Microsoft have created their own respective Axion and Cobalt Arm server CPUs chips, AWS has deployed millions of its own Gravitons, and other hyperscalers and cloud builders are working on their own CPU designs, too. This all begs the question as to why Qualcomm thinks it can break into the server CPU racket even with a substantially weakened Intel, albeit one with a reasonable X86 product line even if it cannot beat AMD Epycs at its own X86 game.\n\nWhen Qualcomm acquired Arm server CPU startup Nuvia in January 2021 for $1.4 billion \u2013 a company that a year earlier had told us it was definitely creating server CPUs \u2013 Qualcomm put the kibosh on the idea that it wanted to resurrect its server CPU aspirations. Qualcomm did create its own Cloud AI 100 matrix math accelerators for AI inference, which we profiled when Cerebras Systems added them as sidecars to its third generation waferscale WSE3 matrix engines for AI training.\n\nWith the major hyperscalers and cloud builders representing more than half of server CPU shipments and slightly less than half of the server revenues in the worldwide systems market, and with these same tech titans all having their own Arm server CPU designs and compelling economic reasons to use their homegrown Arm server CPU chips, it would seem that now is not a good time to launch a third Arm server CPU effort (if you include Nuvia) at Qualcomm. Then again, more and more applications are written for Linux and that means they can run on Arm and are not dependent on X86 servers. So there might just be a place for an Arm server CPU maker in the market to address the needs of enterprises and service providers who are not big enough to design their own chips.\n\nSoftBank To Buy Ampere Computing?\n\nIt would seem that Ampere Computing, which was founded by a bunch of ex-Intel execs and that had its initial Arm foundation from the team and intellectual property of Applied Micro, one of the early Arm server chip designers, should be that second source. It has put multiple generations of its Altra processors as well as its 192-core \u201cPolaris\u201d AmpereOne into the field, after all, and is working towards getting a 256-core \u201cMagnetrix\u201d out this year and a 512-core \u201cAurora\u201d chip out further down the road.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg reported a rumor that Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the majority stakeholder in Arm Ltd, was looking to buy Ampere Computing, which has taken investments not only from Carlyle Group but also from Oracle (which has a 29 percent stake) and SoftBank (whose stake is unknown). This is an odd bit of rumor, considering that Ampere Computing no doubt wants to go public. But with 1,110 employees and hyperscalers and cloud builders focused on their own Arm server CPU efforts, perhaps Ampere Computing is stretched thin. Or perhaps Carlyle Group and/or Oracle want to cash out for their own reasons.\n\nAnd perhaps SoftBank really does want a working CPU from Ampere Computing and a working AI accelerator from GraphCore, which it acquired in July 2024, to make its own systems and install them in its own datacenters, which it then uses and also rents out. That\u2019s what the big clouds are doing, and as long as the AI models run, a lot of users won\u2019t care what they run on so long as the price is reasonable.\n\nWe have a hard time believing that SoftBank can put together a company, maybe using the Ampere Computing brand, that will sell iron into enterprises, governments, and lower-tier service providers, but we do think if it created infrastructure that abstracted the hardware away and just offered CPU cycles and accelerator tensor cores running open source models like Llama from Meta Platforms, it could seed lots of clouds that could do AI crunching as a service \u2013 and possibly undercut the pricing of the big clouds and still make a profit. This is no different, in fact, than what AWS, Microsoft, and Google are doing with homegrown CPUs and AI accelerators compared to running AI on X86 servers with Nvidia GPUs.\n\nFrom Intel To Microsoft To Google\n\nPeople change jobs for a lot of reasons, but sometimes it is because they are a hot commodity. This appears to be the case for Rehan Sheikh, who has been named vice president of global silicon chip technology and manufacturing at Google as of December 2024.\n\nSheikh started out his engineering career as a member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Labs back in the early 1990s, and spent 24 years at Intel, between 1997 and 2021, becoming one of its experts in high volume manufacturing, power and performance tuning, quality and yield control, and post-silicon engineering. These skills made him an Intel Fellow, and that skillset was valuable to Microsoft when it started its own Cobalt Arm server CPU and Maia AI accelerator efforts several years back. Microsoft made Sheikh a general manager of its silicon manufacturing and packaging engineering, and a little more than a year ago raised him up to a vice president.\n\nIt looks like Google Axion and TPU v6 have a new shepherd making sure they get to the datacenter on time and with good yield.",

The listing said the data center team is focused on building \u201creference platforms\u201d based on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon system-on-chips.\n\nThe server SoC security architect will lead the development of a \u201csystem architecture for confidential computing in data center products,\u201d according to the listing. Confidential computing has become a standard feature in Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC CPUs over the last few years.\n\nQualcomm did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be Qualcomm\u2019s only effort to sell products in the data center market. Over the past few years, the company has been selling AI accelerator chips under the Qualcomm Cloud AI brand. These chips have been supported by major IT companies such as Amazon Web Services, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Revitalized CPU Push Started With PCs\n\nKnown best for its Arm-based Snapdragon processors for smartphones, San Diego, Calif.-based Qualcomm last year launched a renewed effort to compete with Intel and AMD in the PC CPU market with its Snapdragon X series of chips.\n\nThe company has been building out a global partner program and organization to enable and incentivize channel partners to sell Snapdragon X-based PCs, CRN has reported.\n\nThe Snapdragon X series is the first product lineup to use the company\u2019s new custom, Arm-based CPU cores, which are based on technology Qualcomm gained from its $1.4 billion acquisition of chip design startup Nuvia in 2021.\n\nWhen Qualcomm announced the Nuvia acquisition, the company said it would use the CPU cores for several product areas, including laptops, smartphones, digital cockpits, advanced driver assistance systems, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions.\n\nHowever, the company confirmed in a legal filing last year that it also planned to continue developing CPUs for the data center market, as Nuvia originally intended.\n\nThe legal filing was a complaint against Arm, the British chip design licensor that sued Qualcomm and Nuvia in 2023 for allegedly breaching its licensing terms by continuing development of Nuvia\u2019s CPU cores under Qualcomm after the acquisition closed.\n\nThe lawsuit ended in a mistrial in late December because a federal U.S. jury sided with Qualcomm on two key issues but deadlocked on a third. Arm, which sought the halting of sales and destruction of products based on the Nuvia CPU cores, plans to seek a retrial.\n\nQualcomm previously attempted to enter the server CPU market several years ago, but it stepped back from those efforts in 2018, which resulted in layoffs.\n\nThe Qualcomm job listing was first reported by Tom\u2019s Hardware.",

            "content": "Qualcomm is assembling a team of developers to design server processors for the data center. Evidence of this comes via a vacancy posted on the company's own website (noticed by Longhorn). The company is looking for a server system-on-chip (SoC) security architect, and the details of the listing outline that the company is \"developing reference platforms based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC, delivering a comprehensive solution that includes hardware, software, reference designs, user guides, SDKs, and more.\"\n\nThe job listing confirms the existence of a 'Qualcomm Data Center' team that is designing a 'high-performance, energy-efficient server solution for data center applications.' While we are, of course, speculating, Qualcomm may plan to use the high-performance energy-efficient cores designed by its Nuvia team for data center applications. This same team developed the company's Snapdragon X processors for laptops, but it originally designed server processors before it was brought into the Qualcomm stable.\n\nIn fact, Qualcomm used to develop and sell Arm-based data center CPUs back in the day without much success, which is presumably why it stopped. However, Amazon\u2019s Graviton processors have proven that Arm-based solutions can thrive in the data center, and the market is wide open for more innovative entrants. Apparently, Amazon's success made Qualcomm rethink and return to the drawing board with data center CPUs.\n\n\"We are seeking experienced SoC Security Architects to join our team,\" the job listing reads. \"If you possess a deep understanding of hardware security architecture and are passionate about architecting and designing complex SoCs at advanced process nodes, we would be pleased to hear from you. This critical role involves architecting the next-generation security system and hardware infrastructure by collaborating with other platform architects to optimize overall Power, Performance, Area (PPA) efficiency and security assurance while ensuring compliance with industry standards.\"\n\nInterestingly, when acquiring Nuvia, Qualcomm specifically noted that it planned to use Nuvia's Phoenix cores in its processors for client PC and not data centers, despite the fact that Nuvia originally designed its cores with the data center in mind. Nowadays, the cores dubbed 'Oryon' power Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors for client PCs.\n\nBut now that Qualcomm has apparently changed its mind about data center products and is assembling a team of SoC developers (the core team is already there), it is reasonable to expect the company to develop a data center solution within the next couple of years. While we do not know for sure, the first devices to use Qualcomm's CPUs would likely be the company's platforms for 5G and then eventually 6G base stations, a space where the company controls the hardware and software stack. As for Qualcomm's development of chips for data centers currently dominated by x86, only time will tell if that is the company's ultimate intention.",

            "content": "Qualcomm Incorporated is a global wireless technology leader and a key semiconductor industry player. Founded in 1985 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Qualcomm's mission is to enable the convergence of mobile communications and computing technologies. The company designs and manufactures chips and other technologies for smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other wireless devices. Its products and services include processors, modems, radio frequency chips, software, and patent licensing. The company operates in over 40 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.\n\nQualcomm's leadership team comprises seasoned industry professionals with a wealth of experience in engineering, technology, and business. Cristiano Amon was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Qualcomm in July 2021, succeeding Steve Mollenkopf, who retired after leading the company for seven years. Amon has been with Qualcomm for over 20 years and has held various leadership positions, including president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), where he oversaw the company's chip business.\n\nOver the past few years, Qualcomm has delivered consistent financial performance driven by strong demand for its products and services. Qualcomm has consistently reported increasing revenue, net income, and profit margin over the past several years. The company's debt levels are manageable, with enough assets to cover liabilities.\n\nQualcomm's valuation metrics are broadly in line with those of its peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios parallel others in the semiconductor sector. Qualcomm's valuation appears reasonable, reflecting the company's solid financial performance and growth prospects.\n\nQualcomm's stock has been relatively volatile recently, reflecting the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects. The volatility is due to weakening chip sales in the cellphone industry, weakening quarterly reports, and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Qualcomm operates in the wireless communications segment, characterized by strong demand for mobile devices and increasing use of data-intensive applications. The company faces significant competition from other semiconductor companies, including Broadcom, Intel, and NVIDIA. Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory and political pressures, particularly in data privacy and security. Qualcomm has been at the forefront of industry innovation and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in the wireless communications segment.\n\nDespite Qualcomm's market position and financial performance, the company is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is actively pursuing new growth opportunities to expand its business and increase revenue.\n\nOne key growth opportunity for Qualcomm is the development of new 5G technologies. As the world continues to move towards a more connected future, 5G networks will become increasingly important, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company has already made significant investments in 5G technology and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nAnother growth opportunity for Qualcomm is in the automotive industry. As cars become more connected and autonomous, the need for advanced technologies and communication systems will increase, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to provide these solutions. The company has partnered with several major automakers to develop new technologies and will likely continue to do so.\n\nQualcomm is also looking to expand into new markets, particularly in Asia. The company already has a strong presence in China but is looking to expand into other Asian countries, such as India, with significant demand for advanced technologies.\n\nWhile Qualcomm has many strengths, the company has risks and challenges. One of Qualcomm's most significant risks is the threat of increased competition. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and new competitors are always emerging. Qualcomm must stay ahead of the curve to ensure it retains market share with its competitors.\n\nAnother potential risk for Qualcomm is regulatory changes. The technology industry is heavily regulated, and changes to regulations could have a significant impact on Qualcomm's business. For example, changes to patent laws or international trade agreements could limit Qualcomm's ability to protect its intellectual property or sell its products in specific markets.\n\nQualcomm faces the risk of economic downturns. Like all companies, Qualcomm is vulnerable to changes in the broader economy, and a recession could lead to reduced demand for its products and services.",

Available in mid-range laptops priced at roughly $600, the Snapdragon X is designed to provide consumers with the power to run on-device AI applications and features without having to break the bank.\n\nBut the company isn\u2019t content with simply taking on the likes of AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) in the laptop space. It has also launched new mini desktop computers with partner Lenovo geared toward consumers and enterprise customers.\n\nAnd during an interview with Yahoo Finance, CEO Cristiano Amon hinted that the chip giant has more up its sleeve in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe want to be able to have a portfolio that can go into every price point with a Copilot+ PC,\u201d Amon said outside Qualcomm\u2019s booth on the CES showroom floor in Las Vegas. \u201cWe're not stopping here. We're just starting with [that] portfolio of products.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Amon said, Qualcomm is looking to expand into the high-performance PC graphics market, something that would put the company into direct competition with heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nQualcomm\u2019s PC push\n\nQualcomm isn\u2019t new to the PC space. The company previously attempted to break into the market with chips designed for Windows 10 laptops, but the effort never gained any traction due to compatibility issues with Windows apps.\n\nBut things are different this time around. Reviews of laptops running on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips are generally positive, with reviewers pointing to impressive performance and long-lasting batteries that you don\u2019t find on AMD or Intel-powered systems.\n\nQualcomm has debuted its new Snapdragon X chip for laptops and mini-desktop PCs, challenging market leader Intel. (Image: Qualcomm) \u00b7 Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is also working with Microsoft (MSFT) to ensure that apps designed to run on AMD and Intel\u2019s chips can run on Qualcomm\u2019s. So far, the companies are doing well enough at the task. In my own testing, Microsoft\u2019s Snapdragon-powered Surface Laptop provided exceptional battery life and plenty of performance power and didn\u2019t suffer from any app compatibility issues.\n\nGaming, however, is a different story. Gamers require serious processing and graphics power, and while the Snapdragon X Elite is a strong chip, gamers, especially desktop gamers, will be looking for dedicated graphics chips that can run their favorite titles.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Qualcomm is even angling to hit that particular space; Amon could simply mean the company is working on chips with more powerful integrated graphics chips built into its Snapdragon line of processors.",

            "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM 3.05%) is dead set on winning a significant portion of the PC CPU market. The company's Arm-based Snapdragon X chips are efficient and powerful, and they can run Microsoft Windows and most standard Windows applications without issue thanks to an emulation layer.\n\nThe initial batch of Qualcomm-powered laptops launched last year were skewed toward the higher-end portion of the market. At CES 2025, Qualcomm unveiled an 8-core Snapdragon X chip that will allow partners to launch laptops and mini-PCs in the $600 range. Pushing down the price will open a large new swath of the market to Qualcomm.\n\nQualcomm claims that its new budget chip can deliver big performance and efficiency gains over competing chips from Intel and AMD, although third-party reviews will be necessary to get an unbiased view of performance in real-world applications. The company expects devices powered by the new chip to be launched in early 2025 from a variety of partners.\n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nWhile bringing down the cost of entry into the world of Qualcomm PCs should broaden the appeal, there remains one fundamental problem: compatibility. Windows has traditionally run on x86 processors from Intel and AMD, and every Windows application is compiled and optimized for that architecture.\n\nQualcomm's PC chips run an Arm-native version of Windows, but to support decades of legacy applications, the chip uses a software emulation layer. This is the same thing that Apple does with its Arm-powered Macs.\n\nThis emulation works well most of the time, but not all the time. This is the biggest problem with Qualcomm's PC chips, and it's likely a deal breaker for many potential customers. PC games are particularly problematic, with popular titles having various issues running on Qualcomm devices.\n\nYou can imagine someone walking into a Best Buy and buying a new Qualcomm laptop, only to find that some application that they depend on doesn't work right. They'll likely return it, since there's no real solution other than swapping it out for an Intel or AMD laptop. The uncertainty over what will work and what won't work is enough to make the whole prospect of buying a Qualcomm laptop less attractive.\n\nBeyond the consumer PC market, Qualcomm is never going to win over business users until these compatibility problems are solved. A business might need to run some mission critical 20-year-old application, and if it can't be 100% sure it's going to work, Qualcomm is going to be out of the question.\n\nThe situation will get somewhat better as newer applications ship with Arm versions that run natively, but compatibility problems are likely to linger for quite some time.\n\nThis is going to take a while\n\nArm-powered laptops are likely here to stay, and consumers having more choices is ultimately a good thing. But Intel and AMD are going to remain dominant for the foreseeable future as compatibility issues make Qualcomm laptops less appealing than the alternatives. Both Intel and AMD have a solid lineup of laptop CPUs, and it's not clear whether Qualcomm has any real advantage when it comes to battery life or performance.\n\nArm's CEO stated last year that he expected Arm-powered PCs to make up more than 50% of the market by 2029. That prediction was wildly optimistic at the time, and it now looks next to impossible given that Qualcomm's initial effort has faced challenges.\n\nPCs may eventually be an important business for Qualcomm as the Windows on Arm ecosystem matures. But for the next few years, Intel and AMD don't have too much or worry about.",

The event will be held in San Jose, California, and will see Samsung launch its latest devices in a bid to top the best phones lists for another year. We also now know that another significant hardware supplier will also be there.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to Samsung\u2019s announcement of Galaxy Unpacked, Qualcomm replied, saying it would also be there.\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about the hardware that\u2019s going to power the next-gen Samsung phones, but with Snapdragon (Qualcomm\u2019s branding for its mobile device chips) saying it\u2019s going to be there, we at least have confirmation of what\u2019s going to be inside the Galaxy S25.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the Samsung Galaxy S25 family will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the chip that was announced in October 2024. Samsung will also be one of the first manufacturers to release devices on this new hardware, with the OnePlus 13 being a significant alternative.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of debate surrounding the hardware in the Galaxy S25 devices. In the past Samsung has flipped between offering Snapdragon across all its phones globally (which was the case for the Galaxy S23), before reverting to a mixture with the Galaxy S24. In both cases, the Samsung devices ran a special version of the Snapdragon hardware, branded as Snapdragon for Galaxy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t seem to have stemmed Samsung\u2019s ambitions to have Exynos (Samsung\u2019s own hardware solution) powering all its devices. Earlier in 2024, it was suggested that the Galaxy S25 family might all be Exynos-powered, it was later suggested that the Galaxy S25 would be Snapdragon-powered because of the increased demand for AI.\n\nWe then saw benchmark results appearing for new Samsung phones with Exynos hardware, suggesting that Samsung might be looking to offer a mixture once again.\n\nWith Snapdragon using its official social media presence to confirm its attendance, it does beg the question of whether we\u2019ll see representatives from Qualcomm taking to the stage. Does this also mean that we\u2019re going to be seeing a continuation of Snapdragon for Galaxy hardware?\n\nThe launch of the new devices is now tantalisingly close, so there won\u2019t be long to wait to find out exactly what Samsung\u2019s plans are.",

And be sure to follow Tom's Guide on TikTok for the coolest videos live from the show.\n\nQualcomm has rounded up its lineup of AI-powered Snapdragon X series chips with its announcement of the Snapdragon X, making Copilot+ PCs more affordable. Today, the company showed off the performance of its CPUs compared to Intel Lunar Lake devices, and there's a huge difference in performance.\n\nDuring a demo at CES 2025, Qualcomm gave us a taste of various NPU-powered features Snapdragon X series PCs could do. Most notably, however, the company weighed up the difference in performance, battery, and price of its chips agasint Intel \u2014 and it didn't hold back.\n\nAccording to Geekbench scores from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon model scored 2408 on single-core and 14,129 on multi-core, while the Intel model only had 1,250 single-core and 6,760 multi-core. Clearly, there's a better model here.\n\nAs pointed out by a spokesperson, the Snapdragon X Elite also offers a 90% performance increase over Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2 chips when unplugged, with both machines running on the default Balanced mode. Apparently, this is due to Intel's NPU cores not being as efficient, and this is also taxing on a device's battery life and cooling.\n\nWe've noted the differences in chipsets before, as I tested the Acer Swift 14 AI with Intel Lunar Lake and Snapdragon, with the latter being the clear winner. In the demo shown, Qualcomm offered a side-by-side comparison of a Dell XPS 13 with Snapdragon X Elite and an Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nWhile I'm not too surprised by the scores Qualcomm boasted, it's the more affordable Snapdragon X chip that will be the CPU to look out for, especially if it offers performance gains over Intel's chips. Unfortunately, these results weren't shown off, but its AI capabilities are still impressive.\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nQualcomm also gave us a look at different NPU-powered software in action, with music being a focus, allowing users to isolate vocals and different instruments instantly in YouTube videos.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Snapdragon X series could also simulate sounds for different instruments in real time with little-to-no latency. More impressively, this can be done using the lower-end Snapdragon X chip, meaning this AI software can be used in devices ranging from $600.\n\nMore NPU-powered experiences are set to arrive, too, including multiple apps such as Zoom, Blender, Cephable, Capture One, djay Pro and plenty more.\n\nWhile Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series chips continue to impress, Intel Core Ultra 200H and HX Series chips have arrived, and their performance looks promising.\n\nOnce we get our hands on Snapdragon X-powered machines (such as the recently announced Lenovo mini PCs), we'll have a better idea of how Qualcomm compares to its competition in our testing. In the meantime, check out the very best of CES 2025.",

This time around, leaks and rumors heavily pointed to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series being Snapdragon-only.\n\nWith just a few weeks to go until the Galaxy S25 is officially revealed at Galaxy Unpacked, Samsung and Qualcomm's playful banter on social media is as close to a confirmation we'll get that the two companies are working together on the next-generation smartphones.\n\nSamsung announced that it'll reveal the Galaxy S25 series at a Galaxy Unpacked event on Jan. 22 with a post on X (formerly Twitter). That post went live on Monday, Jan. 6, but the interesting part came a day later. The official account for the Snapdragon brand quoted Samsung's post on Jan. 7 with the cryptic message: \"See you there.\"\n\nWe\u2019re just as hyped as you are! \ud83d\ude4c Mark your calendars \u2014 what\u2019s coming at #GalaxyUnpacked will redefine the future of innovation \ud83d\udc40January 8, 2025\n\nWhile not a confirmation in the traditional sense, this post from Qualcomm signals that Snapdragon will be a focal point of the Galaxy S25 series. Right now, there's only one Qualcomm mobile chipset that would fit the bill, and that's the powerhouse Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. Geekbench 6 scores hint that Samsung could be using an overclocked \"Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy\" chipset for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and perhaps the rest of the lineup.\n\nPut it all together, the prior reports about Samsung's low Exynos yield rates, the Geekbench 6 scores, and now Qualcomm's cryptic post all seemingly confirm that the Galaxy S25 series will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.\n\nIf existing Snapdragon 8 Elite phones, like the OnePlus 13 and the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro, are any indication, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series should be a performance champion \u2014 especially if it's overclocked. You can reserve your phone today at no cost and no commitment to save big if you end up buying a Galaxy S25 phone when pre-orders open.\n\nReserve at Samsung Reserve your free $50 Samsung credit today Don't miss your chance to reserve a Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone. It's completely free, and will net you a $50 Samsung credit and up to $1,250 off the price of a Galaxy S25 device (with trade-in and instant credit) if you decide to pre-order.",

The two companies signed an extensive multi-year partnership at the IFA 2022 in Berlin.\n\nThe partnership extends the existing relationship between the social networking giant and the American chipmaker. Qualcomm currently produces the Snapdragon XR2 that powers Meta\u2019s Quest 2.\n\nHowever, going forward, expect a more significant collaboration between the two companies\u2019 engineering and product teams \u201cto deliver next-generation platforms and core technologies to accelerate a fully realized metaverse.\u201d\n\nThe deal currently rules out any plans by Meta to fulfill its Metaverse ambitions with its own processor, at least in the short term, just like Microsoft, which also relies on Qualcomm for augmented reality (AR) chips, and unlike NVIDIA, Google, and Apple, all of which design their chips.\n\nThe Meta-Qualcomm partnership does, however, provide Menlo Park an opportunity to experiment with developing with Qualcomm, an established industry leader in chip design, and brings its staff a little bit closer to acquiring crucial experience.\n\nMetaverse, which Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees as the successor to the mobile internet, would require the development of an entire ecosystem of products and services, both in terms of software application and hardware.\n\nDavid Chen, co-founder and CTO of Orbbec, wrote for Spiceworks, \u201cFrom a hardware standpoint, the fulfillment of the metaverse will require three forms of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, wholly accurate and digital duplication, via scanning or digital construction, will need to take place. Next, networks will need to render those physical environments in the cloud or on devices in real time, making them easy to visit. The third and most challenging will be display technologies that provide a convincing real-world experience.\u201d\n\nChen continued, \u201cThe devices and systems that enable this new era are well underway and, within a few years, will allow the metaverse to flourish. Processing power, rendering engines, display technologies, cellular networks and virtual content are all reaching new levels.\u201d\n\nSee More: Tech Giants Establish the Metaverse Standards Forum, But Apple Isn\u2019t Among Them\n\nBarring the last, i.e., virtual content, Meta has little expertise in others. So through the partnership with Qualcomm, Meta will aim to create a niche for itself, much like what Apple did with its internally-developed M1 and M2 chips for Macs and Google with its Tensor chip for smartphones, as well as other AI development services. Apple is also developing the underlying hardware for its upcoming VR product in-house.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to build more advanced capabilities and experiences for virtual and augmented reality, it has become more important to build specialized technologies to power our future VR headsets and other devices,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cUnlike mobile phones, building virtual reality brings novel, multi-dimensional challenges in spatial computing, cost, and form factor. These chipsets will help us keep pushing virtual reality to its limits and deliver awesome experiences.\u201d\n\nBesides XR, both Qualcomm and Meta are working on AR products. The former clarified to CNET that the partnership does not encompass its AR-platform Snapdragon Spaces and that Meta\u2019s XR products will be developed on Meta\u2019s Presence Platform.\n\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs division, responsible for AR/VR/XR and Metaverse development, posted a loss of $2.806 billionOpens a new window in Q2 2022 against earnings of $452 million. The company expects revenue from Reality Labs to slide further in Q3 2022, despite the rising demand for AR/VR headsets (jumped 241.6% in Q1 2022Opens a new window ), of which Quest commands the lion\u2019s share.\n\nHowever, Meta remains optimistic, given it seeks to pour in additional investment in Reality Labs and is now partnering with Qualcomm. To offset AR/VR R&D costs, Meta relies on its vast advertising business, which is presently stifled by privacy-related features introduced in Apple\u2019s iOS 14.5 onwards, not to mention global macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nMeta has responded by jacking up the prices of Quest 2 by $100 starting August 1, 2022. Quest 2 now costs $399.99 and $499.99 for the 128 GB and 256 GB versions, respectively.\n\nLet us know if you enjoyed reading this news on LinkedInOpens a new window , TwitterOpens a new window , or FacebookOpens a new window .

The chip, which the company says will be available in PCs beginning this month, is the fourth in Qualcomm\u2019s line of Snapdragon X processors behind its Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus, and high-powered Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nThe company says its Arm-based Snapdragon X, which is built using a 4-nanometer process, packs eight CPU cores and offers 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second). TOPS is a general way to measure AI workload performance. Thanks to that, the Snapdragon X falls under Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Copilot+PC umbrella of AI PCs, which means it\u2019s capable of running Microsoft\u2019s onboard AI apps including Recall and Click to Do.\n\nAI PCs are a category of PCs that can natively run certain AI applications without having to rely on cloud processing. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t use cloud computing at times, but rather that they can handle AI apps that would take non-AI PCs far longer, such as photo editing or text summarization.\n\nQualcomm is lining up the Snapdragon X against Intel\u2019s (INTC) Core 5 120U processor, which is also used to power mid-range PCs. Overall, the company says its Snapdragon X offers better performance per watt than the competing Intel chip and is better suited for AI tasks.\n\nBut on-device AI isn\u2019t something most customers need at the moment. Especially since apps like ChatGPT need to connect to the web to provide answers to users\u2019 queries. In fact, it\u2019s the Snapdragon X\u2019s battery life that will likely draw users\u2019 attention.\n\nAccording to Qualcomm, a Snapdragon X-equipped test PC lasted 106% longer while streaming Netflix than an Intel Core 5-powered notebook. Battery life has been a persistent problem for Intel-based systems for years.\n\nIn fact, Apple (AAPL) significantly boosted the battery life of its MacBook laptops after ditching Intel as its primary chip partner and switching to its own homegrown Arm-based (ARM) processors.\n\nIntel isn\u2019t sitting idly by though. The company has already debuted its second-generation Core Ultra chips, which it says can compete with Qualcomm\u2019s offerings.\n\nQualcomm has debuted its new Snapdragon X chip for laptops and mini-desktop PCs, challenging market leader Intel. (Image: Qualcomm) \u00b7 Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm also announced it is bringing its Snapdragon chips to desktop PCs. Don\u2019t expect them to start cropping up in giant, glowing gaming PCs though. Instead, Qualcomm says its processors will be available in super-compact desktops, otherwise known as mini-PCs.\n\nThe company's decision to expand deeper into the laptop and desktop business is part of its broader strategy to move beyond the slowing smartphone industry, which is its primary breadwinner.",

The company claims that the chip, built on a 4nm fabrication process, delivers up to \u201cmulti-day\u201d battery life and robust performance at an affordable price point.\n\nThere are still a few software compatibility issues to be worked out with Windows on Qualcomm\u2019s chip architecture. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from forging ahead with new processors in a bid to gain on rivals AMD and Intel.\n\nQualcomm has a long way to go: According to one recent industry report, Qualcomm captured just 0.8% of the PC market in Q3 2024.\n\nThe company said Snapdragon X will power a range of Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 machines with AI-powered tools and applications, set to launch in Q1 and priced at around $600. Packing Qualcomm\u2019s Oryon CPU with eight cores clocked up to 3GHz, Snapdragon X also has a neural processing unit (NPU), which supposedly accelerates AI workloads.\n\nImage Credits:Qualcomm\n\nOther highlights include Bluetooth 5.4 compatibility, support for Wi-Fi 7, and the ability to power up to three external UHD (4K) monitors running at 60Hz. PC manufacturers that adopt Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Platform, a new hardware reference program, will also get additional tech such as Qualcomm\u2019s A/V suite and proprietary image processing.\n\nExpect to see Snapdragon X in laptops from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThere are over 60 Copilot+ PC designs powered by Snapdragon now available or in development,\u201d Peter Burns, senior director of product marketing at Qualcomm, wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch last week. \u201c[And in] 2024, we saw a remarkable 3X increase in native Windows apps for Snapdragon.\u201d\n\nSnapdragon comes to desktop\n\nQualcomm last year abruptly canceled its Windows-based mini PC, but the company said during CES that it\u2019ll help bring to market desktops powered by its Snapdragon X Series processors in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe all-new mini and tiny desktop PCs mark a significant milestone in our PC journey,\u201d Burns wrote. \u201cDevelopers building applications on Windows on Snapdragon desktops can now take advantage of new design options and unprecedented power efficiency, enabling them to create more efficient and powerful applications with NPU-accelerated features.\u201d",

In a report outlining 101 tech trends that will \u2013 and won't \u2013 shape 2025, the analysts at ABI say they expect that \"Arm-based PCs will represent only 13% of total PC shipments in 2025.\" This prediction might chill the hearts of companies like Qualcomm, and its investors, so let's take a closer look.\n\nBy the summer it seemed like we had been waiting for eons for the first Nuvia (Oryon) core-powered Arm processors to be released by Qualcomm for the PC market, and they were duly trotted out at Computex 2024. We also heard rather a lot of bluster and bravado regarding the expected fortunes of Arm PCs over the coming half-decade. Most notably, both the Arm CEO and Qualcomm CEO talked in public about Arm Windows PCs gaining a 50% market share within five years.\n\nAt release, the first Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus machines were propelled by featuring the first processors certified for Microsoft's Copilot+ PC program, and the stellar battery life offered by these laptops redefined untethered portability for Windows users. However, people weren't, and still aren't, impressed by Microsoft's Copilot+ misfire(s), and it only took a few months before the incumbent Intel and AMD Windows laptop rivals trotted out efficiency-tuned architectures to basically nullify the greatest selling point for Arm Windows PCs \u2013 battery life.\n\nIs it any surprise, then, that ABI Research now thinks that there is limited potential for further Arm PC penetration in the coming year? The report highlights this is a pivotal year for the Arm PC platform, but it looks like it may be a dud.\n\nABI notes that as well as AMD and Intel spoiling the Arm PC dream, there has been disruptive legal squabbling between Arm's biggest players, especially regarding licensing and royalties. Last but not least, ABI doesn't see the x86 software advantage going away this year, either.\n\nThough the laptop segment is the biggest target for Arm PC proponents, we reported on a very interesting Cinebench world record-setting 128-core Arm PC desktop tower yesterday.\n\nOther ABI predictions for 2025\n\nThe full report from ABI touches on many other aspects of tech. We think readers might also be interested to hear that the analysts think AI PCs will become the new normal in 2025. Hopefully, moving local AI out of premium means there will be more reasons to own an AI PC, in a chicken-and-egg kind of fashion.\n\nStay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware Newsletter Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

This is a powerful and versatile chip that integrates ADAS (driver assistance systems) and IVI (infotainment systems) functions into a single centralized controller. This approach addresses the growing complexity of modern cars, which require a centralized computing system to effectively manage multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\nKey features of the xDC platform\n\nIntegrated ADAS and IVI control. With Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC capabilities, the xDC platform can simultaneously process data from ADAS and IVI systems. This results in smoother, faster vehicle response, improving safety and driving comfort.\n\nThe platform offers ADAS Confidence View, which combines 3D and 2D graphics to provide clear and understandable visual cues to the driver. This helps you focus on the road and react more quickly to changing circumstances.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the platform is the ability to combine driving information with entertainment content. Drivers and passengers will be able to receive ADAS alerts, real-time traffic updates, and personalized recommendations based on their preferences without distractions.\n\nThe main advantages of the xDC platform include cost savings (combining ADAS and IVI systems reduces the number of components required), design optimization (the platform provides high performance by adapting solutions to automakers\u2019 requirements), and improved safety (integrating data processing increases the vehicle\u2019s response time in critical situations).\n\nLG and Qualcomm will demonstrate the xDC platform for the first time at CES 2025. Subsequently, the companies plan to develop solutions tailored to the needs of automakers through component integration and design optimization.\n\nSource: lgnewsroom",

            "content": "Chipmakers are gaining a lot of attention amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave. While Nvidia (NVDA) quickly captured the robust demand for advanced chips required in building AI models, other semiconductor companies are either gradually catching up or are comparatively lagging in innovation. Moreover, chipmakers are looking to capture demand in other attractive end markets like automotive. Bearing that in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to place Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) against each other to pick the chip stock with the highest upside potential, according to analysts.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nIntel shares plunged by more than 60% in 2024, marking the worst year for the company since it went public in 1971. The decline reflects investors\u2019 concerns over the lack of innovation, product delays, strategic missteps, and failed turnaround efforts under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, who resigned in December 2024.\n\nMoreover, investors are disappointed that Intel has not been able to capitalize on the generative AI boom, unlike players like Nvidia. The company is trying to restore investor confidence by reducing costs, streamlining operations, strengthening its manufacturing and foundry capabilities, and enhancing its product offerings. However, the stock market seems to be skeptical due to Intel\u2019s poor track record when it comes to execution.\n\nIs Intel a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nLast Month, Citi analyst Christopher Danely reiterated a Hold rating on Intel stock with a price target of $22. The analyst is sidelined on the stock due to several factors, including worries related to the company\u2019s strategic direction and leadership, especially the ongoing search for a new CEO.\n\nDanely is also concerned about the company\u2019s foundry business and thinks that exiting this segment could improve Intel\u2019s financial performance and boost its stock\u2019s value.\n\nWall Street has a Hold consensus rating on TipRanks, backed by 21 Holds, five Sells, and one Buy recommendation. The average INTC stock price target of $24.53 implies 19.3% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTC analyst ratings\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices shares have declined 7.4% over the past year. The company has not been able to capture the opportunities in the AI chips market to the extent that rival Nvidia has done. Further, challenges in the company\u2019s gaming and embedded segments have been weighing on its overall performance.\n\nNevertheless, AMD remains confident about robust growth in the AI space in the times ahead. While the Q4 guidance lagged expectations, the company raised the estimate for the full-year sales from its AI-accelerators to more than $5 billion from $4.5 billion. Following a 122% rise in data center revenue in Q3, CEO Lisa Su said the company still sees a lot of demand from cloud providers and other companies to build AI infrastructure.\n\nIs AMD Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nNorthland analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on AMD stock and a price target of $175. The analyst said that AMD is one of the Top Picks of his firm for 2025. Richard expects AMD to continue to gain share in AI GPUs, server CPUs, and the PC market as pressures in the embedded and gaming segments fade. Notably, Richard expects the PC refresh cycle to be much stronger than expected. Richard sees more upside in 2025 than risks.\n\nOverall, AMD scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys and eight Hold recommendations. The average AMD stock price target of $184.52 implies 47.2% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm shares have advanced by about 15% over the past year. The company is a key chip supplier to smartphone makers. However, there are concerns about the impact on Qualcomm from the loss of business from Apple (AAPL) when the contract to supply modem chips for smartphones ends in 2026.\n\nNonetheless, Qualcomm is trying to bolster its business by diversifying into attractive areas like AI, IoT (Internet of Things), and automotive. The company is gaining traction in these key growth areas, with the automotive business delivering a 68% year-over-year revenue growth to $899 million in Q4 FY24.\n\nAnother favorable aspect is Qualcomm\u2019s recent win against Arm Holdings (ARM). The jury ruled that Qualcomm did not breach its licensing agreement with Arm following the acquisition of startup Nuvia in 2021. The ruling addressed some concerns about the company\u2019s expansion into the laptop market.\n\nIs Qualcomm a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nFollowing the favorable ruling in the Arm Holdings case, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reiterated a Hold rating on Qualcomm stock with a price target of $150. Despite this favorable news, Vinh remains sidelined on QCOM stock due to macro challenges and company-specific risks like the possibility of displacement of QCOM modems with Apple\u2019s own internal modems and in-house \u201csilicon verticalization\u201d by mobile OEM (original equipment manufacturers) customers, implying that there is a threat that OEM clients could develop their own chips in the years ahead.\n\nVinh also noted intense rivalry in the mobile chipset market and maturing smartphone market growth.\n\nWith 11 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell recommendation, Qualcomm earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $199.88, the average QCOM stock price target implies 26.6% upside potential.\n\nSee more QCOM analyst ratings\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is optimistic on AMD and Qualcomm but sidelined on Intel due to the ongoing pressures. Currently, they see more upside potential in AMD stock than the other two chip stocks. Several analysts see the pullback in AMD stock as an opportunity to build a position and gain from the semiconductor giant\u2019s growth potential in areas like AI.\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Samsung lost a huge chunk of its business to TSMC due to its poor management and yield ratio, but it appears that the company could bounce back. The Galaxy-branded smartphone maker is now expected to gain TSMC's 2nm chip business, as Qualcomm reportedly has its eyes on Samsung Foundry for all its production needs. It was recently reported that the high production cost and poor production capacity have scared Apple into adopting 3nm chips this year for the iPhone 17 Pro. It can be observed that the issue is widespread and has affected Qualcomm's operational plans as well.\n\nQualcomm plans to move away from TSMC and shift to Samsung for its 2nm chip business due to higher costs and limited production capacity\n\nTSMC is potentially increasing the price for its advanced chips by 5 to 10 percent this year, which could end up increasing the price of the handsets. With rising costs, clients are now planning to switch to Samsung for its 2nm business, but it remains to be seen how the South Korean giant will handle its lower yields (via TrendForce). Qualcomm potentially wants its future 2nm chips to be cheap, which will also benefit Samsung to retain its lost position in the market.\n\nQualcomm could also have shifted to Samsung Foundry because Apple, TSMC's biggest client, has reserved 2nm chip production at its facility. This gives Apple an upper hand compared to the rest of the industry, but we recently covered that the Cupertino giant would have to wait to use TSMC's offerings. To tackle this, the iPhone 17 Pro models will stick to the supplier's 3nm node but will utilize its new N3P process.\n\nWhile Qualcomm is moving away, TSMC plans to increase its production capacity significantly in 2026. The supplier had a market share of 64.9 percent in the global semiconductor foundry as of 2024, and we suspect the numbers will go below the mark unless it decides to fix technical issues involving higher costs and limited production capacity. The supplier is slated to increase its 2nm capacity from 10,000 to 80,000 wafers during the trial production per month in 2026.\n\nApple will potentially use TSMC's 2nm chips for 2026 iPhone 18 Pro models based on the N3P process for better performance and power efficiency. In contrast, Qualcomm will stick with Samsung in manufacturing the Snapdragon 8 Elite series of chips in the future, and while exact details are scarce, we believe the South Korean supplier will improve its yields and costs significantly. This will also allow Qualcomm to have a dedicated supplier for 2nm chips other than TSMC, which will create healthy competition and keep costs at bay.\n\nAccording to South Korea's Chosun Daily, it might be Samsung's last chance to attract clients for 2nm business if it wants to continue operations. Currently, Samsung is way behind TSMC as it is handling billions of dollars in losses. We will share more details on the subject, so be sure to stick around for more details on Qualcomm shifting its focus from TSMC to Samsung Foundry for 2nm chips.",

            "content": "Most PC makers are waiting until next week to unveil new computers powered by some of the chips that are set to launch during CES 2025. But ECS jumped the gun a bit by introducing three new laptops ahead of CES, including one model powered by an \u201cAMD Krackan\u201d processor.\n\nThe ECS UP42KP is a 14 inch notebook sporting one of AMD\u2019s new chips that are expected to be a slightly cheaper alternative to Strix Point. Meanwhile the upcoming ECS UP42PW and ECS UP52PW are 14 and 15.3 inch laptops that will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processors.\n\nECS doesn\u2019t typically sell laptops directly to consumers, but the company operates as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and designs and builds models that may be sold by different companies under their own brand names. So you probably won\u2019t ever actually see laptops with those model numbers in stores, but you may see some very similar systems from other companies.\n\nPossibly the most interesting model in the ECS press release is the ECS UP42KP, since it\u2019s powered by a processor that AMD hasn\u2019t officially introduced yet. While there have been a number of leaks giving us an idea of what to expect, I\u2019m inclined to trust the information ECS provides more than leaks from unknown sources.\n\nWith that in mind, ECS says the processor in its new AMD-powered laptop has \u201c8 Zen 5(c) CPU cores, RDNA 3.5 integrated graphics, and NPU capabilities exceeding 40 TOPS.\u201d The processor has a TDP range of 15 to 54 watts, supports DDR5-5600 memory, and 16 PCIe lanes, and ECS says it\u2019s \u201ctargeted at the mainstream mid-range market.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it has similar CPU and graphics architecture to the Ryzen AI 300 series \u201cStrix Point\u201d chips that launched in 2024, but it may have only Zen 5c cores instead of a mix of Zen 5 and Zen 5c, and the NPU may be less powerful than the ones used in Strix Point chips. Rumor has it that AMD Krackan chips will also have fewer GPU compute units, but ECS doesn\u2019t have anything to say about that.\n\nSome other features of this 14 inch notebook include a full HD display, USB4 and HDMI 2.1 ports, an IR camera with support for Windows Hello-compatible face recognition and a privacy shutter, support for WiFi 6, and a backlit keyboard.\n\nThe Qualcomm-powered ECS UP42PW and UP52PW are expected to feature 8-core Snapdragon X Plus chips with 30MB of cache and 45 TOPS NPUs, so they\u2019ll probably be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X1P-42-100 processor.\n\nOther features include FHD IPS LCD displays, LPDDR5 memory, and USB4 ports, among other things. The two laptops are said to have \u201ca unified design,\u201d even though one model has a larger display than the other.\n\nECS plans to show off all three laptops, along with the company\u2019s latest motherboards and mini PCs during CES next week. Of particular interest in the mini PC space is a new ECS Liva One A620 which appears to be an AMD alternative to the Intel-compatible Liva One H610 that\u2019s been available for the past few years.\n\nThe new A620 has an AMD AM5 socket with support for Ryzen 7000/8000/9000 series desktop processors, up to 128GB of DDR5 memory, an M.2 slot for storage, and support for up to three displays thanks to HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA ports.\n\npress release\n\nSupport Liliputing Liliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).

In 2nm test runs, TSMC has had a 60% yield. Still, the rumor mill says that Nvidia and Qualcomm are considering switching to Samsung Foundry from TSMC. High costs and limited capacity are two reasons given for this possible move.\n\n\n\n\n\nTSMC is supposedly hiking prices for advanced chips by 5% to 10% this year. In addition, the foundry is supposedly raising the cost of silicon wafers for 2nm by 50% to $30,000. These higher prices could lead some TSMC clients to switch to Samsung Foundry. On the other hand, using a foundry with low yields like means that it will take more silicon wafers to build the number of chips needed and that could also jack up the cost to Samsung foundry clients significantly.\n\n\n\nReceive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy\n\nMore likely, TSMC's limited 2nm capacity could be the biggest issue as its largest client, Apple, has reportedly reserved most of TSMC's initial 2nm capacity . TSMC, which had a leading 64.9% share in the global semiconductor foundry market as of 2024's third quarter, plans on increasing its 2nm capacity sharply in 2026. The contract foundry, which builds chips for fabless semiconductor designers, plans to increase its 2nm capacity from 10,000 wafers during trial production to 80,000 wafers per month in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite earlier rumors suggesting that Apple would use TSMC's 2nm node for the A19 and A19 Pro chipsets that will power next year's iPhone 17 line, it now seems that the A19 and A19 Pro will be produced using TSMC's third-generation 3nm node (N3P). Higher costs might have convinced Apple to wait for the A20 and A20 Pro before utilizing TSMC's 2nm process node. The A20 and A20 Pro will be powering the iPhone 18 series in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea's Chosun Daily says that attracting new 2nm business might be Samsung Foundry's last chance to continue operations. The foundry is running multi-billion dollar losses, is way behind TSMC in market share, and Samsung might be looking to stem the ocean-sized flow of red ink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade-in Save up to $900 on the Galaxy S25 Ultra! $399 99 $1299 99 $900 off (69%) Get the mighty Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for up to $900 off at the Samsung Store!

Just like previous iterations, the upcoming lineup will also include three models, the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+ and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It is rumoured that Samsung will use Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets across the lineup and in all regions, which could lead to an increased price for the Galaxy S25 series.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhy is Samsung switching to Qualcomm?\n\nThe use of Qualcomm chips isn't new. Samsung has used Snapdragon chipsets in certain regions like the USA, China and South Korea, and has reserved its in-house Exynos chipsets for other regions, including India. However, rumours suggest that Samsung is struggling with its Exynos 2500 chipsets, and the Samsung foundry hasn't been able to achieve successful yields for this 3nm fabrication. Typically, a 70% yield is expected for mass production, but Samsung has only been able to achieve 20-30% yields, which isn't meeting production standards. This is likely prompting Samsung to switch to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is Qualcomm's flagship offering.\n\nWhy will Samsung increase the price of Galaxy S25 series?\n\nAccording to global reports, Qualcomm is charging a heavy premium for its flagship chips. The cost for each Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is reportedly $190 (roughly Rs 16,300). This is Qualcomm's first lot of chips made using TSMC's 3nm fabrication process, which is keeping costs high. Moreover, the new chips come with greater processing prowess, and advanced AI capabilities among other upgrades. All of this could contribute to the pricing of the Galaxy S25 series, resulting in a price hike for buyers.\n\nThis isn't the first time Samsung has found itself in hot water with its pricing strategy. Qualcomm was relying on Samsung for the production of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, but Samsung's fabrication faced low yields, which eventually prompted Qualcomm to switch to TSMC, and later release a revised Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset.\n\nIt is important to note that the use of a Qualcomm chipset on all S25 series devices across all regions is also good news for buyers, especially those wanting parity between Indian and global models in terms of device performance and battery life. As we head closer to the launch, buyers must be prepared to shell out slightly higher to get the upcoming Galaxy S25 series.",

            "content": "Feature RISC-V has been talked up as a challenger to Arm and x86, offering an open royalty-free architecture that promises flexibility and innovation without licensing costs. But for all the noise, you're more likely to find it buried inside IoT gadgets and obscure embedded systems than powering anything that'll typically grab a headline.\n\nArm runs the mobile and embedded world, and x86 still has desktop, laptop, and server markets locked down, but RISC-V? Well, it's still waiting to punch above its weight, but it's gaining traction as a CPU architecture. Whether or not it will make its way into the broader marketplace and power a wider range of devices is the big question.\n\nNvidia has quietly folded RISC-V cores into its GPUs and SoCs, and the GPU-maker expects to ship a billion RISC-V cores across its GPUs, SoCs, and other products by the end of 2024. The most notable of Nvidia's implementations of RISC-V is the GPU System Processor, or GSP, which essentially offloads kernel driver functions and takes care of GPU utilization within the cores.\n\nWhy RISC-V must get its messaging right on open standard vs open source READ MORE\n\nEven Qualcomm is using RISC-V in some of its devices, using RV cores in microcontroller units built within its Snapdragon processors. Qualcomm has shipped devices with around 650 million RISC-V cores to date, so the project's architecture and cores are to be found in everyday devices \u2013 but why isn't RISC-V the headliner?\n\nRisc-y move for Redmond RISC-V International is currently conducting a search to find Calista Redmond's replacement after the foundation's CEO resigned in early December. Stepping down, Redmond noted that during her tenure, membership of the org had grown from 236 to more than 4,600 members in 70 countries, with industry adoption \"accelerat[ing] across automotive, AI, HPC, and embedded systems. With over 2 billion SoCs today and projections of 20 billion by 2031, RISC-V's impact is undeniable.\" She added: \"On the technical front, we've ratified 68 new specifications, expanded work groups to more than 80, and advanced software ecosystems with tools, collaboration, and global OS adoption.\" RISC-V fans have said, somewhat optimistically, they're crossing fingers that recently \"resigned\" ex-Intel Pat Gelsinger might show some interest, but there's no sign yet of any replacement for the former IBM Z/Architecture exec. Redmond spent five years with the foundation and called her \"time with RISC-V ... a remarkable journey, shaped by the collective efforts and passion of an extraordinary community.\"\n\nGoogle pulls back\n\nQualcomm and Nvidia aren't the only companies that are finding use for RISC-V and the architecture. Google had been making moves in this space \u2013 it officially supported RISC-V in the Android-specific, Linux-derived Android Common Kernel (ACK) up until May 2024 when it removed support from the ACK - a significant setback for the architecture.\n\nDespite this, Google said it remains committed to RISC-V, and plans to enhance support in the future. It told Android Authority at the time: \"Android will continue to support RISC-V. Due to the rapid rate of iteration, we are not ready to provide a single supported image for all vendors. This particular series of patches removes RISC-V support from the Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI).\"\n\nPrior to the move, the hope was that manufacturers might look at building Android devices using SoCs based on the RISC-V ISA. Removing RISC-V support from the ACK doesn't mean no Android on RISC-V kit, but rather that any maker planning to go down this road would have to do a significant amount of coding work themselves.\n\nRISC-V CEO seeks 'world domination' by winning over the likes of Intel READ MORE\n\nGoogle's temporary retreat on RISC-V is a good example of the kind of basic stumbling block that a new architecture faces on the road towards mainstream - the lack of a mature and unified ecosystem. Most are familiar with the Arm ecosystem, with Qualcomm doing its thing in the laptop market currently with Windows on Arm devices, and Arm already has a foothold in the mobile ecosystem with companies such as MediaTek using the architecture to full effect within its flagship mobiles. But where does RISC-V potentially fit into the equation?\n\nThe Google retreat from RISC-V on Android is a stark reminder that even an open architecture and the flexibility it gives designers and developers (who don't have to cough up licensing fees) is not enough on its own to make RISC-V a viable front end mainstay in the market.\n\nBut for all of its setbacks, RISC-V continues to attract interest, especially from companies that are looking to reduce their reliance on proprietary solutions to power their devices.\n\nThe China factor\n\nGiven all of the geopolitical issues surrounding China and its push for self-contained and homegrown technology, Beijing has significantly invested in the RISC-V architecture as part of its strategic solution to stave off any reliance on foreign architecture and technologies.\n\nCompanies such as Loongson, which is a Chinese chip designer, have made use of the ISA to create RISC-V-powered systems that are used within Chinese schools. Another key example is Chinese giant Alibaba, which plans to use RISC-V within its cloud servers.\n\nAll of this has garnered the attention of the US government, and since 2023, the US government has been considering lawmakers' requests to make it harder for China to implement RISC-V's ISA in its designs.\n\nRISC-V International spoke out about any potential US government moves to restrict access at the time, with then CEO Calista Redmond saying this might lead to a bifurcation of the standard and \"a world of incompatible solutions.\"\n\nQuite. For RISC-V as an architecture to break into powering mainstream devices, it can't just be about innovation \u2013 it must create an ecosystem capable of attracting chipmakers as well as manufacturers that will feel comfortable building devices using RISC-V cores, knowing apps and support are in place. Both the Arm and the x86 ecosystems have spent decades creating what we have today, building out the tools and the libraries, and enabling developer support to create applications on the architectures themselves. Bottom line: things need to work for end users.\n\nThat's perhaps one of the biggest headaches for RISC-V and the architecture as a whole: software compatibility. While both Arm and the x86 ecosystems are extensively supported, the same can't be said for RISC-V.\n\nYou gotta have standards\n\nIt was certainly a big moment for RISC-V in October this year when the RVA23 profile was ratified. This essentially lays out a consistent set of ISA extensions that software developers can rely on and utilize to create compatible software on RISC-V architecture. Not only does it bring features such as vector operations, floating-point, and atomic instructions, but it gives RISC-V some very much needed support for AI and machine learning workloads.\n\nOverall the ratification of the RVA23 profile brings much needed consistency to an architecture that is looking to make a name for itself, but hasn't been able to get there.\n\nDespite progress, it is just the first step in tackling the broader software compatibility woes the architecture has faced for some time now. What really needs to happen for RISC-V to start gaining momentum in the mainstream is for devs to get coding so that things work on RISC-V as they do on other ecosystems.\n\nConvincing developers (and manufacturers for that matter) to adopt RISC-V as an architecture and build apps and devices is not going to be an easy task.\n\nPhones and PCs\n\nThe other main challenge for RISC-V is the current landscape of the market, especially the mobile market. Arm has a big slice of the smartphone market, and we're not even talking about Apple's dominance in this space. Every flagship smartphone basically runs on Arm cores in some shape or form, and every dev toolchain is optimized for Arm. Breaking into this market is going to be a difficult nut to crack.\n\nThen there's the PC market, which is dominated by x86, with both AMD and Intel holding practically all of the market share; even Qualcomm's recent Windows on Arm push still hasn't taken a foothold, and this is despite Microsoft's backing. For RISC-V to even contemplate entering the PC market, it has not only got to show viable and competitive performance to what's available on x86, it also has to have the developer support that is currently lacking.\n\nThe reality for RISC-V is that, even with government backing and niche use cases, it has a lot of ground to make up on both Arm and x86.\n\nRISC-V breaking into the fold isn't going to happen overnight, and it's not going to happen quickly.\n\nPerhaps the most important question of all is whether or not RISC-V can move quickly enough to close the gap with the competition in the next five years. Companies such as MIPS and SiFive being reliant on the RISC-V ISA within embedded systems, devices, networking, SoCs, etc are a good start.\n\nBut it still feels as if we're waiting for that breakthrough moment for RISC-V to move in on its rivals. For now, it remains an open royalty-free architecture with plenty of promise. The new CEO will need to push to ensure developers and manufacturers pick RISC-V's ISA for devices of the future. \u00ae",

            "content": "> Tech\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 series is just around the corner, with the official unveiling set for January 22nd at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event. Fans are excited for the release of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, but there\u2019s a major shift happening behind the scenes that could affect the pricing of these much-awaited smartphones. Rumors suggest that all three models will come powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, breaking away from Samsung's usual reliance on its own Exynos processors, particularly in markets like India.\n\nWhy the Change to Qualcomm?\n\nTraditionally, Samsung has used Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chipset in certain regions like the US, Canada, and China, while its own Exynos chipsets were reserved for other markets such as India. However, this time, Samsung is facing some challenges with the Exynos 2500 chipset. Sources claim that the company has been struggling to produce enough viable Exynos chips due to low yields, with only 20-30% of the chips meeting production standards. Typically, a yield of 70% is expected for mass production, so this shortfall has led to Samsung opting for Qualcomm's solution instead.\n\nBreaking \u203c\ufe0f\n\n\n\nGalaxy S25 (SM-S931B) just surfaced on Geekbench! \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\nPowered by Snapdragon 8 Elite Processor with 12GB RAM!\n\nSingle-Core: 2986\n\nMulti-Core: 9355\n\n\n\nSnapdragon 8 Elite is officially confirmed for Vanilla model in International markets (India, Europe & more)! \ud83c\udf0d pic.twitter.com/9ySZFnKxRt\u2014 Tarun Vats (@tarunvats33) December 31, 2024\n\nGiven these production difficulties, Samsung is choosing to use the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset across all regions, including India. This decision could lead to a more uniform performance across the board, but there\u2019s a catch: it may push the price of the Galaxy S25 series higher.\n\nHow Will This Affect Prices?\n\nSwitching to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is expected to increase the cost of the Galaxy S25 series. Reports suggest that Qualcomm is charging around $190 (roughly Rs. 16,300) for each Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. The new chipset comes with significant upgrades, including improvements in processing power, AI capabilities, and overall efficiency. Additionally, the Snapdragon 8 Elite will be the first to be produced using TSMC\u2019s advanced 3nm process node, which could further increase production costs.\n\nThis price hike isn\u2019t entirely new for Samsung. Previously, when Samsung faced low yields with its 4nm node for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Qualcomm had to shift production to TSMC, resulting in the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 revision. As of Q3 2024, TSMC dominates the contract foundry market, holding a 64% share, while Samsung Foundry lags behind at just 12%. This reliance on TSMC may be a factor driving up the price of the Snapdragon 8 Elite and, in turn, the final price of the Galaxy S25.\n\nWith the official unveiling of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series fast approaching, the shift to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset could lead to a noticeable price increase. While this change promises better overall performance and more consistent experiences across regions, consumers should prepare for the possibility of higher prices due to the increased production costs of the new chipset. As we head into 2024, the Galaxy S25 series is shaping up to be a highly anticipated launch, but with a higher price tag attached.\n\nSEE ALSO: Flipkart Year End Sale Kicks Off With Major Discounts On iPhone 15, iPhone 16 And More",

            "content": "A Verdict that Resolves Key Issues\n\nThe lawsuit centered on Qualcomm\u2019s use of Oryon cores in its Snapdragon X processors for PCs. These cores, developed from technologies by Nuvia (a company acquired by Qualcomm in 2021), utilize licenses related to Arm. Qualcomm argued that its existing agreement with Arm included these technologies, a stance that the jury upheld. As a result, Qualcomm can continue to market its Snapdragon processors without needing to renegotiate its licenses.\n\nHowever, there remains a pivotal unresolved issue: Did Nuvia violate the terms of its own licensing agreement before being purchased by Qualcomm? On this matter, the jury was unable to reach a decision, leaving the door open for potential further litigation.\n\nImplications for Both Companies\n\nFor Qualcomm, the verdict comes as a relief. It protects their strategy to develop custom processors for the PC market and expand their business beyond smartphones. Qualcomm has even set a target of achieving $4 billion in PC-related revenue by 2029, relying on its new AI-optimized chips.\n\nFor Arm, the outcome disrupts its strategy somewhat. By attempting to enforce higher royalties and exert more control over its technologies, it loses a significant bargaining chip against Qualcomm, one of its largest clients. This setback could also cause concern for other companies using Arm\u2019s licenses, such as Nvidia or AMD, who are closely monitoring the outcomes of any future appeals.\n\nAn Uncertain Future Ahead\n\nWhile Qualcomm currently appears strengthened, the legal battle is far from over. Arm has already expressed intentions to seek a new trial, specifically to address the licensing violation issue with Nuvia mentioned earlier. In the meantime, Qualcomm can proceed with its plans but remains under the threat of possible legal reversals.\n\nFor now, the verdict is clear: Qualcomm retains its right to use Arm\u2019s technologies under its existing agreements. This outcome could also influence how future technology licenses are negotiated within the industry.",

However, the company has reportedly postponed it due to the high pricing of getting 2nm chips made by TSMC . A report claims Nvidia and Qualcomm are now also looking at Samsung for their 2nm chips.\n\nApple was expected to use a 2nm chip (tentatively named A19 Pro) inside the iPhone 17 in late 2025. However, according to a report from Chosun Biz, Apple has postponed its 2nm chip production to 2026 due to TSMC's extremely high costs.\n\nCurrently, Japan's Rapidus, South Korea's Samsung Foundry, and Taiwan's TSMC are trying to start the mass production of semiconductor chips using their 2nm-class process nodes. TSMC is said to be ahead in this race, with yields reaching 60%, and is reportedly conducting process tests with its clients.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm are said to be the first brands to launch chips made using a 2nm process node. However, TSMC's production capacity is extremely limited. The company is investing heavily to expand its production capacity from the current 10,000 wafers per month to 80,000 wafers per month, but that could only happen by 2026.\n\nSo, Nvidia and Qualcomm are reportedly conducting tests using Samsung Foundry's 2nm process. While Samsung has secured orders from fabless chip firms like Preferred Networks (PFN), it needs big clients like AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm to achieve enough orders to become profitable.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia and Qualcomm don't want to rely too much on TSMC, as they won't have the negotiating power and will have to pay TSMC extremely high costs. So, the companies want to diversify their supply chain and get at least some chips made by Samsung Foundry's 2nm process node.\n\nSamsung Foundry received a bad reputation in the past, especially after Samsung's and Qualcomm's 4nm chips faced overheating and performance throttling issues. Since then, it hasn't been able to convert any top client for its 3nm chip process. And it might be the company's last shot at success.\n\nThe South Korean firm's entire semiconductor division is facing a huge risk, as the prices of DRAM and NAND have seen massive drops. Its HBM3E memory chips haven't received Nvidia's certification yet. If the company's 2nm process node fails to attract clients, things could get ugly at Samsung Foundry.",

            "content": "2024 has been a banger year for Qualcomm in the laptop realm, with the Snapdragon X Elite chip helping propel Windows on Arm into actual competition with Apple's macOS.\n\nOne of the first laptops powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, dubbed Copilot+ PCs, was Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7. In our official review of the Surface Laptop 7, we praised the device for its strong performance and MacBook-rivaling battery life \u2014 both of which can be attributed to the Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\nHowever, impressive battery life and smooth performance don't mean as much when you run into the multiple compatibility issues that accompany Snapdragon X-powered laptops. Even a long-time Windows on Arm user notes the difficulty of trying to use unoptimized apps, saying \"It can feel like the Wild West once you leave that bubble\" of optimized Windows on Arm apps.\n\nWindows laptops are finally in a competing space with MacBooks \u2014 despite Apple launching more powerful, efficient models this year \u2014 but they still have a lot of room for improvement. I think 2025 could be the year Snapdragon X-powered machines and other Copilot+ PCs truly get their chance to shine.\n\nWhat I'd like to see with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite Gen 2 chips\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite chips bring a lot to the table, but unfortunately, Qualcomm doesn't have much control over my first request. I'd like to see Snapdragon X Elite-powered laptops, with their strong performance and lengthy battery life promises, graced by even more compatible Windows on Arm apps.\n\nUltimately, that'll come down to changes from Microsoft within Windows itself and individual native updates or versions for existing apps.\n\nThere are definitely a lot of compatible apps right now that make it easy for the average user to upgrade to a Copilot+ PC, including Chrome, Firefox, Zoom, Spotify, and Adobe Photoshop. But there are still a lot of software that don't work natively with Windows on Arm. Take a look at this helpfully compiled list of non-native Windows on Arm apps on Reddit for a full picture.\n\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag Get our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Laptop Mag)\n\nMy first desire leads into my second, in that I'd like to see native support for Steam, and subsequently stronger support for gaming. When we saw an in-person gaming demo on a Snapdragon X Elite-powered laptop, we were impressed by the \"buttery smooth visuals,\" but that's not always the case when gaming on a Copilot+ PC.\n\nOne of Laptop Mag's editors tried gaming on the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7, and it made him want to cry. The Xbox app won't allow you to run any of its games natively on an Arm processor, popular multiplayer game Helldivers 2 has an anti-cheat engine that's not compatible with an Arm processor, and the default Automatic Super Resolution setting made games run real funky.\n\nIf a Copilot+ PC could have great overall performance, long battery life, and decent gaming performance, that'd be a dream.\n\nMy last wish is what we all want in next-gen chips: even better performance and efficiency. I'd like to see Qualcomm come out swinging with a chip that competes well with Apple's newest M4-series chips, and graces Windows users with long-lasting, multitasking-made-easy laptops.\n\nWe're still in the early stages of hearing leaks and rumors on Qualcomm's next-gen chip series, but here's what we know so far about the Snapdragon X Elite 2.",

Just a few months after introducing the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the Snapdragon Summit in October 2024, rumours suggest that its successor could be arriving sooner than expected. The upcoming flagship chipset is expected to bring significant upgrades, and if leaks are to be believed, it could hit the market earlier than Qualcomm\u2019s usual timeline.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to tipster, Digital Chat Station, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2, internally referred to as the SM8850, might debut much earlier than expected. This would be ahead of Qualcomm\u2019s typical schedule, as this year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite was unveiled on October 22. An early launch could give smartphone brands additional time to work with the new chipset, allowing them to integrate it into their devices ahead of key launches later in the year.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 is its expected improvement in GPU performance. Reports suggest the chipset will be built using TSMC\u2019s advanced N3P fabrication process, a step up from the N3E process used for the current Snapdragon 8 Elite. This upgraded fabrication process could deliver better power efficiency and enhanced performance, making it ideal for power users.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPerformance gains are also expected to be substantial. The new chip could offer at least 20 per cent better performance than its predecessor, according to the tipster. Another leaker, Jukanlosreve, also highlighted the possibility of a 20 per cent jump in both single-core and multi-core CPU performance. Considering that the Snapdragon 8 Elite already delivers a 30 per cent improvement in CPU performance compared to last year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 could push the limits of mobile processing even further.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is still in the early stages of making its way to global markets. So far, it has only debuted in the iQOO 13, but that\u2019s set to change soon as brands like Samsung and OnePlus prepare to launch their flagship devices \u2014 Galaxy S24 and OnePlus 13 \u2014 powered by the latest Qualcomm chipset. With the first generation just beginning to roll out, the idea of an accelerated timeline for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 might seem a bit surprising. While the leaks are intriguing, it\u2019s always wise to take such early information with a grain of salt until Qualcomm makes an official announcement.",

The Korean giant\u2019s top-end model for 2025 will be the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and just like on previous occasions, the company is expected to use a chipset with clock speeds operating at higher frequencies. Evidence of this overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite was spotted in the latest benchmark leak, but sadly, the scores do not reflect the increase in clock speeds.\n\nGalaxy S25 Ultra fails to cross the 10,000 points barrier in Geekbench 6\u2019s multi-core results, even with an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite\n\nFor a couple of generations now, Samsung has opted for a better-performing version of Snapdragon chipsets, which are categorized under the \u2018Snapdragon for Galaxy\u2019 banner. While we do not know if a \u2018Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy\u2019 will ever roll out for the Galaxy S25 series, @TECHINFOSOCIALS was kind enough to reveal some benchmarking results of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, with the tests posted on December 30.\n\nLooking at the specifications, it appears that Samsung will not launch a 16GB RAM version of its most premium flagship as standard, as the device has been tested with 12GB RAM. Fortunately, the good news is that Samsung is rumored to introduce 12GB RAM as standard for Galaxy S25 models, with an exclusive 16GB RAM variant for the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nSamsung S25 Ultra Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy clocked at 2x 4.47GHz + 6x 3.53GHz. pic.twitter.com/TlaOhIBveJ \u2014 TECH INFO (@TECHINFOSOCIALS) December 31, 2024\n\nComing to the scores, the default clock speeds of the Snapdragon 8 Elite\u2019s performance cores run at 4.32GHz, but in Geekbench 6, we note that the same performance cores are operating at 4.47GHz, with the efficiency cores clocked in at 3.53GHz. Despite this upgrade, the Galaxy S25 Ultra fails to cross the 10,000 points barrier in the multi-core result, which is disappointing to see because a reference design featuring the same chipset obtained a higher single-core and multi-core result.\n\nHowever, benchmarks are not everything, and oftentimes, smartphone makers will compromise battery life and the overall experience in exchange for securing the highest single-core and multi-core result in Geekbench 6. Given that the Galaxy S25 Ultra has been reported to stick with a 5,000mAh battery as previous-generation models, optimizing its endurance would likely be Samsung\u2019s objective. Then again, with an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite, we hope to see better results in a separate test, so stay tuned.",

FSM and Qualcomm QCOM.\n\nBet On These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks With Rising P/E\n\nInvestors often opt for an approach that focuses on stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This strategy is based on the notion that the lower the P/E ratio, the higher the stock value. The reasoning behind this is straightforward \u2014 when a stock's current market price does not adequately reflect its higher earnings, it suggests potential for growth.\n\nBut there is more to this whole P/E story. Not only stocks with a low P/E, the ones with a rising P/E can also fetch strong returns. In this regard, investors can bet on the likes of Constellation Brands,Stryve Foods,Canoo, Fortuna Mining Corp. and Qualcomm.\n\nRising P/E: A Useful Tool\n\nThe concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of a stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, a stock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.\n\nSuppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30. This means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings as he expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.\n\nSo, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it.\n\nAlso, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.\n\nThese few criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 50.\n\nHere are five out of the 50 stocks:\n\nConstellation Brands: This Zacks Rank #2 company produces and markets beer, wine and spirits. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe average four-quarter earnings surprise of STZ is 5.30%.\n\nStryve Foods: This Zacks Rank #2 company is an emerging healthy snacking company, which manufactures, markets and sells healthy snacking products.\n\nThe average four-quarter earnings surprise of SNAX is 15.71%.\n\nCanoo: This Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in developing breakthrough electric vehicles with a proprietary and highly versatile EV platform for personal and business use.",

            "content": "If you use an Android phone, there's a good chance it's running on a Snapdragon processor. That's not the only place you'll find one, though. This year, Qualcomm, the San Diego-based Snapdragon chipmaker, brought its CPUs to a whole new stage: AI-powered laptops.\n\nOn May 20, 2024, Microsoft unveiled the first laptops in its new Copilot+ PC line, all powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series chips. This was Qualcomm's first significant entry into the laptop market, so the success of the Copilot+ PCs was crucial.\n\nQualcomm had big plans for its laptop processors, particularly the flagship Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\nAs a Qualcomm spokesperson tells Laptop Mag, \"The launch marked a pivotal moment for Qualcomm as we unveiled a new era of AI-enabled PCs. The Copilot+ PC devices powered by Snapdragon X Elite exceeded expectations in providing high performance-per-watt and long battery life \u2014 the top requirements for consumers.\"\n\n#2 in Laptop Mag's Biggest AI Moments of 2024 This article ranks #2 in our round-up of the year's 24 most impactful moments in artificial intelligence. For the full rankings and more articles like this, check out the Biggest AI Moments of 2024 \u2014 a Laptop Mag Special Issue.\n\nHow the Snapdragon X chips supercharged AI PCs this year\n\nAt first glance, you might wonder why Microsoft would risk the launch of a whole new series of laptops by working with a chipmaker that's relatively new to the laptop market. Qualcomm was up to the challenge, though. In fact, Snapdragon-powered laptops had some clear advantages right from launch.\n\nFor one thing, Microsoft's Copilot+ PC line-up was the largest collection of AI PCs ever launched when it debuted in June. The Snapdragon X chips at the heart of these laptops were designed specifically with AI in mind, resulting in stronger overall AI performance compared to older Windows 11 laptops.\n\n\"One of the most transformative user experiences enabled by Snapdragon X Elite processors is their ability to handle generative AI workloads on-device,\" a Qualcomm rep tells Laptop Mag. \"For example, when devices are unplugged, our competitors\u2019 performance falls between 30 to 45%, and there's no drop on Snapdragon.\"\n\nThat balance of processing power and battery efficiency also resulted in some seriously impressive battery life scores for Snapdragon-powered laptops. While there are a few outliers, most of the Copilot+ PCs Laptop Mag tested this year lasted 13 hours or more in our battery life test.\n\nFor instance, the Dell XPS 13 lasted a staggering 19 hours! Even more impressive, the Qualcomm-powered Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 broke our battery life record, outlasting any other laptop we've reviewed to date with a battery life of 21 hours and 3 minutes.\n\nThose battery life results handily prove that Qualcomm's claims about power efficiency on its Snapdragon chips are the real deal. Even if you're not so interested in the AI features on Snapdragon-powered laptops, this level of battery life alone could seal the deal for prospective laptop buyers. It's enough to potentially win over people who might not have otherwise decided to try an AI PC.\n\nAnd if you are an AI enthusiast or want to run AI apps on your laptop, Snapdragon may be the best platform for that, too. \"Unlike other processors, Snapdragon X Elite features an integrated AI Engine capable of over 45 trillion operations a second (TOPS), allowing them to handle demanding AI tasks seamlessly,\" a Qualcomm spokesperson tells Laptop Mag,\n\nWith top-notch performance for running virtually any consumer AI app you want and battery life bordering on 24 hours, this first generation of Snapdragon-powered laptops set a high bar. Can the next generation take things even further?\n\nCan Qualcomm stay ahead of its rivals in 2025?\n\nGiven the overall success of the Copilot+ PC line-up this year, many are intrigued to see what Qualcomm delivers next. On one hand, it will probably aim to continue the innovation achieved in 2024. However, Qualcomm will also need to connect with a larger pool of users, many of whom are still unclear about what exactly an \"AI PC\" is or why they need one.\n\nA Qualcomm spokesperson tried to clear this u, telling told Laptop Mag, \"'AI PC' refers to the integration of generative AI tools that function as real-time assistants to enhance productivity, creativity, and efficiency. Devices with Copilot+ capabilities go beyond traditional computing, enabling smarter and more personalized experiences that can keep up with AI.\"\n\nThey also added that \"No matter how each user embraces and uses AI for their day-to-day, we believe AI PCs mark the future of computing, where AI becomes an intuitive and essential part of everyday workflows.\"\n\nThe message is clear: AI PCs aren't just for AI enthusiasts and developers. Regardless of what you use your laptop for, there's potential for AI to help and soon every new Windows 11 laptop will be an AI PC.\n\nQualcomm is aiming high as the AI PC market grows, a necessary outlook if it wants to stay ahead of Intel and AMD. That competition is good for users, too, because it will help move the needle on innovation.\n\nA Qualcomm spokesperson gave us some hints about what they have coming up in 2025 and beyond, telling Laptop Mag, \"You can expect high performance, deeper integration with edge computing, and continued innovations in battery efficiency and connectivity. Upcoming AI tools will elevate productivity with advanced search functions, enhanced photo resolution, smarter conference call features, and cutting-edge graphic design capabilities.\"\n\nThose new features and tools sound great, but Intel and AMD are working on AI innovations of their own. We'll just have to wait and see if Qualcomm has what it takes to rule the AI PC market or if it was just the rookie of the year.\n\n#2 in our round-up of the year's 24 most impactful moments in artificial intelligence.

            "content": "Qualcomm\u2019s 2024 debut of new Arm processors for Windows laptops was arguably the most important PC hardware announcement since the introduction of Intel\u2019s 486 processors in 1989. Just as that CPU line heralded an age of Intel-driven x86 dominance, Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite chips have now taken us into a new era of competition.\n\nBut 2024 was only the preview. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon debut was limited, targeting a specific subset of premium, thin-and-light Windows laptops that don\u2019t require discrete graphics. 2025 will be the year that shows us the true extent of Arm innovation in PCs.\n\nI spoke with two expert analysts in the hardware space for insights on how Arm PCs will continue to grow going forward.\n\nQualcomm chips will expand their reach\n\nThe launch of Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite was bumpy, to say the least. Microsoft branded those new Qualcomm-powered laptops as \u201cCopilot+ PCs\u201d and touted their AI performance, only to recall their headline feature at launch due to public backlash. After multiple delays, it\u2019s just now trickling out to Windows Insiders.\n\n\u201cI think the messaging fell apart largely due to Microsoft having the snafu with Recall,\u201d says Leonard Lee, executive analyst and founder at Next Curve, who has decades of experience in technology and business strategy, business and product innovation, and market intelligence.\n\nWhen it comes to the hardware, though, Snapdragon X Elite has proven its worth with reviewers, analysts, and enthusiasts. Lee says Snapdragon improved the performance-per-watt for Windows laptops, regardless of AI workloads. If you want a laptop with high performance and ample battery life, those Snapdragon PCs are modern trailblazers.\n\nMatthew Smith / IDG\n\nAnshel Sag, vice president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agreed with Lee and had special praise for the less expensive Snapdragon X Plus chips that are now available in $800 laptops like the Lenovo IdeaPad 5x 2-in-1. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to kill it with that eight-core chip,\u201d says Sag. \u201cIt\u2019s performant and delivers an experience that wasn\u2019t possible at that price point.\u201d\n\nThough we\u2019re already seeing these less expensive Snapdragon chips in laptops, CES 2025 (which takes place in January) is likely to become the platform from which laptop makers launch a new salvo of competitively priced Snapdragon-powered machines.\n\nThe one thing that\u2019s still missing, though, is a \u201chalo product.\u201d Qualcomm is rumored to be working on an upscaled Snapdragon X Elite chip, with up to 18 processor cores (current chips have up to 12). Whether we\u2019ll see such a chip in 2025 is hard to say, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s current hardware also lacks support for discrete GPUs, which excludes them from most workstation and gaming laptops. Adding support for discrete graphics could expand Snapdragon to new areas.\n\nNvidia and MediaTek will enter the ring\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt that more Qualcomm Snapdragon X hardware will show up in 2025. If there\u2019s any question, it\u2019s this: Will more companies enter the Arm PC market?\n\nMediaTek and Nvidia are obvious candidates. MediaTek already produces Arm chips for a wide variety of devices, including ChromeOS laptops. Nvidia also has experience producing Arm SoCs (such as Tegra) and uses Arm cores in its datacenter CPUs. Rumors suggest they\u2019ve partnered together to make new Arm chips starting next year.\n\nSag says this partnership, if it happens, could be complex. \u201cI think the only way MediaTek could do it is if they work with Nvidia, so they don\u2019t have to worry about graphics drivers.\u201d He predicts that MediaTek could partner with Nvidia by licensing an RTX GPU, something they\u2019ve done previously for their Dimensity Auto SoC (for self-driving vehicles).\n\nLee also felt this prospective partnership will be tricky to navigate. \u201cJust because you\u2019re Nvidia and you\u2019re the king of GPUs doesn\u2019t mean you have an automatic win,\u201d says Lee. \u201cYou need the CPU, the GPU, and now the NPU. I don\u2019t think MediaTek or Nvidia have any inherent advantage here versus Qualcomm.\u201d\n\nMatthew Smith / IDG\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about Windows PCs. Sag thinks MediaTek\u2019s play in laptops is still strongest with ChromeOS. \u201cI believe that Google is basically going to make ChromeOS run as Android. And I think MediaTek is going to go after that,\u201d he says. He might be right on the money there, with sources indicating that Google is indeed turning ChromeOS into Android and making Android into a unified desktop OS.\n\nThe threat of such a move from Google shouldn\u2019t be discounted. Though Google\u2019s efforts to bring AI features into Chrome have gained less public attention than Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC push, they aren\u2019t insubstantial. Many users on the latest version of ChromeOS already have access to AI features like Gemini, Google\u2019s own AI large language model, which can be used for summarization, translation, and other tasks.\n\nPersonally, I think a renovated ChromeOS powered by MediaTek chips (which tend to allow lower pricing) and infused with AI features already found in Pixel smartphones could outflank Microsoft\u2019s blundering attempt to add AI to Windows PCs.\n\nHow will x86 PCs defend their turf?\n\n2025 will likely see a surge in Arm-powered Windows and ChromeOS laptops, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to put x86 out to pasture.\n\nOn the contrary, x86\u2019s continued relevance is precisely what makes the new era of Windows different from the last three decades. PC hardware will no longer be dominated by one company or one instruction set, but instead span multiple instruction sets and chip makers.\n\nMark Hachman / IDG\n\n\u201cIntel and AMD have demonstrated they can put a competitive offering out there that\u2019s x86-based,\u201d says Lee. He points out that Intel\u2019s new Lunar Lake chips and AMD\u2019s new Ryzen AI line are highly competitive with Qualcomm on performance and battery life. Laptops like the Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro, which we reviewed with Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 7 258V CPU inside, can exceed 20 hours of battery life just like their Qualcomm-powered counterparts.\n\nThis competition will benefit you, the laptop shopper and enthusiast. It means more options and lower prices. Sag says it should also benefit the OEMs, such as Asus, Lenovo, and Dell.\n\n\u201cThe complexity is challenging, but OEMs are optimistic about how it works out for them,\u201d says Sag. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a level of silicon that\u2019s never existed in the industry. And it\u2019s cool because I\u2019m hearing about prototypes and concepts \u2014 things that I never would\u2019ve thought of happening \u2014 from OEMs I never would\u2019ve expected it from.\u201d",

By setting up its own supply chain for baseband chips, Apple will no longer have to pay Qualcomm a hefty premium, which only means that it will have the flexibility to price the iPhone SE 4 competitively. Now, according to the latest information provided through a Japanese telecommunications channel, the upcoming handset is said to be priced under $500, making it ooze exceptional value compared to the iPhone 16 series, which starts from $799 in the U.S.\n\nThe iPhone SE 4 will be one of the most affordable handsets to support Apple Intelligence, making its price point even more attractive to the masses\n\nThe pricing update comes from yeux1122\u2019s blog on Naver, with the tipster mentioning that the retail price of the iPhone SE 4 in Japan will be under $500. In terms of value, the figure is exceptional, and while it is more expensive than the $429 launch price of the iPhone SE 3, customers are said to experience a bevy of changes, both internal and external. Previously, we reported the entire specifications sheet of the iPhone SE 4, which also included its estimated price in the $499 to $549 range, which would likely be for the different storage tiers.\n\nFor that amount, customers should expect the iPhone SE 4\u2019s internals to include an A18 SoC, 8GB RAM, a large 6.06-inch OLED screen that will lack ProMotion support, but overall, the configuration is highly compelling. The base iPhone 16, which is available for $799 in the U.S., also ships with an A18 chipset and 8GB RAM, so to see that Apple is going down the somewhat affordable route should make its competitors extremely nervous.\n\nAlso, thanks to the improved Neural Engine of the A18 and the increased RAM count, the iPhone SE 4 is slated to be Apple\u2019s most affordable model to support generative AI features. Given that Apple\u2019s path to becoming a $4 trillion company will be aided by the firm\u2019s expansion of generative AI features, the iPhone SE 4 should easily add fuel to that fire.\n\nWhile we estimate that the launch will happen in the first quarter, Apple is expected to kick off 2025 with the release of the M4 MacBook Air family, so we will have to be just a little patient for the official unveiling.\n\nNews Source: Naver",

            "content": "There are currently numerous gaming handhelds on the global market, including well-known models such as those from Asus, MSI and Valve. Now the company ONE-NETBOOK has announced its new ONEXSUGAR dual-screen handheld, which has been teased on its official YouTube channel.\n\nThe short teaser already gives some insights into the new gaming handheld from ONE-NETBOOK. According to the teaser, a Snapdragon Qualcomm processor will be used, although the exact model has not yet been announced. The handheld\u2019s operating system is based on Android OS. The interesting controller design shown in the ONE-NETBOOK teaser is particularly striking. The controllers can be rotated 180 degrees so that either the dual-screen mode can be activated or the device can be folded up compactly to make it easier to transport. Perhaps the aim is to bring something nostalgic from the past into the modern age. The design, which you can barely make out from the teaser, is reminiscent of an old Nintendo DS that made a huge range of people happy. This would probably bring some people back to nostalgia and they want to bring something old back into the present day.\n\nThe teaser lasts around 40 seconds, but was deliberately kept in dark tones so as not to give away too many details about the new model. For this reason, the design has not yet been fully presented, and further information is also being deliberately withheld at present. Technical specifications and price details are also not yet known and will only be published at a later date. Those interested in the ONEXSUGAR handheld will therefore have to be patient until the company communicates further details to the public.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the teaser from ONE-NETBOOK yet or need a refresher, you can of course watch the whole thing here to get an idea of the whole thing for yourself:\n\nSource: ONE-NETBOOK via YouTube",
