            "content": "On Thursday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond briefly fell below 4%, reaching its lowest level since October last year (when Trump was elected).\n\nThe trigger was undoubtedly the heavy tariff plan announced by Trump on Wednesday, which imposes a minimum 10% tariff on all products exported to the U.S. and additional rates on countries with trade deficits. This unprecedented aggressive action quickly ignited market concerns about escalating global trade conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. March ISM Services PMI index was 50.8, significantly below expectations, unexpectedly hitting a nine-month low, with employment severely impacted and the price index remaining high. Market worries about the U.S. economic outlook intensified, further accelerating the influx of funds into safe havens.\n\nIn this context, investors began to reassess the U.S. economic outlook and policy path.\n\nCurrent market pricing shows that the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates four times this year, each by 25 basis points, has surged to 50%, whereas just a day earlier, this scenario was hardly considered. The timing for the first rate cut has also been moved up to June, whereas the market previously expected the Fed to act in July.\n\nBrandywine portfolio manager Jack McIntyre stated:\n\n\"Currently, neither fiscal nor monetary policy supports growth; the stock market is declining, tariffs are taking effect, and tax policies remain unchanged, all of which combine to increase the risk of the economy falling into recession.\"\n\nStagflation Risks Emerge, Fed in a Dilemma\n\nNot only in the U.S., but the European Central Bank has also joined the rate cut preparation team. Yields on European and UK government bonds have also fallen sharply, with the market betting that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England each have three more rate cuts this year. The global bond market is singing the same tune: slowing growth and a policy shift.\n\nAlthough increased tariffs theoretically push up the prices of imported goods and exacerbate inflationary pressures, the market is clearly more concerned about the worst-case stagflation scenario of \"prices rising while the economy collapses.\"\n\nThe inflation risks in the U.S. triggered by tariffs have led economists at Morgan Stanley to no longer believe that the Fed will initiate rate cuts this year. They have pushed back the expectation for the first rate cut to early 2026 and expect the terminal rate to drop to a range of 2.50% to 2.75%, well below the current 4.5%.\n\nAnalysts point out that the reason for delaying rate cuts is that the imported inflation risks brought about by Trump's new tariff policy will once again trouble the Fed's decision-makers. This judgment also reflects a key logical shift: although inflation has not completely dissipated, the risks to economic growth are becoming more complicated.\n\nNot only has Morgan Stanley turned conservative, but Citigroup has also upgraded the rating of U.S. Treasuries to overweight. They believe that Trump's more aggressive trade policies than the market expected will significantly suppress U.S. economic growth and force investors to reallocate to safe-haven assets Bob Michele, Global Head of Fixed Income at JP Morgan Asset Management, stated:\n\n\"If nothing changes, we can almost say we are heading towards an economic recession. The current inflation is completely different from the post-pandemic period; this is not a sustainable inflation rebound, and the Federal Reserve can significantly lower interest rates. The Fed's terminal rate could even drop from the current 4.5% all the way down to 2.5%.\"\n\nBloomberg strategist Sebastian Boyd pointed out that investors are betting on future rate declines, despite high inflation expectations. This is not good news. Stagflation is the most challenging environment for central bank governors to navigate, but the message conveyed by the interest rate market on Thursday is that the employment aspect of the Fed's dual mandate will outweigh the inflation aspect.\n\nGoldman Sachs, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have all lowered their year-end forecasts for the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. The reasoning behind this is very consistent: the economic outlook is uncertain.\n\nAndrzej Skiba, Head of U.S. Fixed Income at BlueBay, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada, reminded that in the coming weeks, negative headlines surrounding trade will continue to refresh market sentiment, while investors will keep a close eye on hard data to verify whether the economy is indeed cooling rapidly.\n\nRisk Warning and Disclaimer\n\nMarkets are risky, and investments should be made cautiously.

            "content": "Net zero is an accounting term. It represents a goal that, if reached, would stabilize the Earth\u2019s climate. The equation is simple, even for those of us who are math-challenged: for every ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere, another one must be removed.\n\nThe methods to achieve a net zero balance, however, are anything but simple.\n\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019ve accrued more than 250 years of burning carbon, and it\u2019s created what Joppa and Willmott in Nature call \u201ca carbon-emitting economic and technological paradigm.\u201d Now, under the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has just 25 years \u2014 or a few business cycles \u2014 to replace the carbon-dependent parts with net-zero components. The net zero \u201cjourney requires unprecedented coordination, innovation, investment, and speed,\u201d they argue, \u201cto avoid the catastrophic consequences of failure \u2014 including increasingly severe natural disasters, from rapidly rising sea levels and floods to heatwaves and wildfires.\u201d\n\nYet the goal of net zero is fraught with issues, according to Joppa and Willmott, including:\n\na premature desire for perfection\n\noverly precise guidelines for implementation\n\ninsufficient flexibility in carbon accounting\n\nunhelpful constraints on collaboration\n\na disproportionate focus on the actions of others\n\nHow can markets be compelled to calculate carbon costs for all of their products and services? In the era of net zero thinking, won\u2019t the cost of removing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere need to be factored in? Mechanisms to remove carbon and provide low-carbon alternatives must become less expensive and, hopefully, excel in performance relative to higher carbon competitors.\n\nBut such a market shift is possible. After all, it happened after decades of advances in solar and wind energy, which ultimately saw the costs of these renewables plummet by more than 70%. Technologies competed, and winners emerged for different applications depending on the locale. A market-driven approach introduces the most effective solutions to materialize organically over time.\n\nBank-led and UN-convened, the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) is a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. NZBA\u2019s framework, guidance, and learning opportunities support members to design, set, and achieve credible science-based net zero targets for 2030 or sooner that deliver value for their investors and clients.\n\nNZBA signatories agree to align their portfolios so that net zero emissions levels are reached by 2050. Such a level keeps the average global temperature rise at the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. With progress that that goal quite uneven, most scientists now conclude those next 20 years will see the Earth breach 1.5 C. In fact, the UN points to a much higher warming trend \u2014 twice that much warming.\n\nBillions of people could not survive such warming.\n\nEarly movers and adopters offer hopeful signals that change to net zero alternatives is possible, but, for mainstream businesses, such rapid shifts are often difficult due to regulations that are convoluted and confusing. Wall Street has signaled it\u2019s not happy with the rigor of the NZBA, which is seen as adhering to \u201ca scenario that\u2019s becoming increasingly improbable,\u201d Royal Bank of Canada CEO David McKay told Bloomberg.\n\nBy October 2024 the NZBA had already pointed to areas in need of additional attention and support. Setting decarbonization targets for banks remained a challenging exercise, they admitted, due to the quality of client greenhouse gas emissions data, unclear decarbonization pathways, and a lack of a supportive policy environment. Of the one-fifth of banks that had not met the milestone to set targets covering all or a substantial majority of carbon-intensive sectors, almost all were from emerging markets, where these challenges are particularly acute.\n\nAt this moment of authoritarian support for fossil capitalism, CEOs are reluctant to divest from the Big Oil sector, as their profitability would suffer, at least in the short term. That being so, more work needs to be done to develop a regulatory framework that would enforce positive change, RBC CEO McKay outlined.\n\nThe logic is that, to achieve net zero by 2030, investments in excess of $4 trillion annually must take place. A loop borne of capitalism is stagnating net zero progress, though. Governments don\u2019t want to require net zero regulations until the markets agree, yet markets have trouble anticipating price structures without government guidance.\n\nRecognizing these obstacles, the Joppa and Willmott suggest some remedies:\n\npursue progress over perfection\n\nprioritize direct over indirect emissions\n\nfocus on demand over delivery\n\nallow flexibility between emissions reduction and removal\n\nRhian-Mari Thomas, a former Barclays banker who now runs the Green Finance Institute, sees a long term business interest for financial sectors to acknowledge the risks posed by a warming planet. \u201cThe need for financial institutions to meet their fiduciary duties is often cited as a reason not to pursue opportunities that are aligned with net-zero pathways,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely another consideration, based on science, is to ensure market integrity: Deals that may seem rational in the short term could ultimately threaten the resilience of the markets.\u201d\n\nAre Autocrats Actually Secure As They Deny Net Zero & Other Systemic Issues?\n\nBy last September, the Biden\u2013Harris administration had more than 60,000 projects to rebuild deteriorating bridges, make roadways safer, upgrade ports to be more efficient, modernize airport terminals, and expand public transit and passenger rail services, including delivering the first high-speed rail systems in the country. Together, these projects were strengthening the US economy by fortifying supply chains, lowering costs, improving America\u2019s global competitiveness, creating good-paying jobs, and unlocking economic opportunity for communities of all sizes, including rural and tribal communities.\n\nUS President Donald J. Trump is a strong proponent of additional fossil fuel development. He has, again, removed the US from the Paris Agreement and is doing everything he can to eliminate climate action funding with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\u201cJust because you have a President that\u2019s trying to ignore the science and economics of climate change, it\u2019s bizarre to think you can avoid the massive climate-related or climate-accelerated physical disasters that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d says Catherine McKenna, Canada\u2019s former minister of environment and climate change and chair of the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s expert group on private-sector net zero targets.\n\nAs an editorial in The Contrarian posits this morning, autocrats who incur quick defeats after taking office \u201close the aura of invincibility, undermine morale among supporters, and fuel more enthusiasm among opponents.\u201d Perhaps financial institutions\u2019 malaise about net zero could change again if citizens stand up in support of a livable planet.",

            "content": "Tax season is prime time for scams and cybercrime. As Canadians send employment and income details to accountants, log into tax preparation sites and check their emails for refund updates \u2013 often using unsecured technology \u2013 criminals are more than ready to take advantage. Adding to the risk, many people feel stressed about filing mistakes or owing money to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), making them more vulnerable to scams.\n\n\n\nKnowing the tactics scammers use during tax season can help you stay one step ahead. Here are some of the most common scams and how to protect yourself.\n\n1. CRA phone scams\n\nCRA phone scams have been around for years. And while awareness of these scams has grown, thanks in large part to CRA\u2019s education campaigns, they remain persistent. In these scams, criminals will call you (often using a spoofed phone number), claiming to be from the CRA.\n\nUsing aggressive language, they will say you owe money \u2013 and that you will face legal consequences if you don\u2019t pay immediately. Payments are often requested via cryptocurrency, gift cards or wire transfers, as these methods are difficult to trace.\n\n2. Phishing emails and texts\n\nAs phone scams have become more recognizable, scammers have shifted to email and text-based scams. In these scams, you receive a fraudulent message that appears to be from the CRA saying you\u2019re eligible for a refund or need to verify your account information. These messages typically contain malicious links that lead to fake websites with a request to enter your Social Insurance Number (SIN), bank account details or online banking credentials.\n\nSince you may be expecting a text or email about your taxes at this time of year, a communication from someone who claims to be from the CRA doesn\u2019t seem out of place, making these scams hard to spot.\n\n3. Social media scams\n\nSocial media is another platform through which scammers attempt to reach Canadians. They may send direct messages claiming to be the CRA, your financial institution or a tax preparer offering inflated refunds.\n\n4. Fake CRA websites\n\nThe advancement of AI has helped scammers create convincing fake websites. AI-powered platforms allow them to create professional-looking sites in minutes, mimicking official branding, logos, colours and layouts so fake sites look nearly identical to the real thing.\n\n5. Fraudulent tax companies\n\nMany Canadians turn to tax companies to prepare and file their taxes. Some scammers will offer fast and cheap services, taking advantage of people who may be filing at the last minute or looking for a budget friendly option. They may also promise instant or large refunds. What happens, however, is that they file a fraudulent return in your name, steal your refund and/or your personal information.\n\nHow to protect yourself from tax scams\n\nWhile tax scams may be tough to spot, here are some things you can do to protect yourself against them:\n\nValidate any communication from the CRA : If you receive a suspicious call or message, call the CRA at 1-800-959-8281 to see if they are indeed trying to reach you. Note that the CRA only sends emails to notify you that there is a secure message in your CRA mailbox.\n\nCheck in with your CRA account: Sign in to your CRA My Account to track your filing status, assessment and refunds. If you notice anything unexpected, contact the CRA immediately.\n\nDon\u2019t share your personal information: Do not provide your SIN, banking details or personal information over email, text or phone unless you know the person on the other end is legitimate.\n\nWatch out for urgent or threatening language: The CRA will never threaten arrest, deportation or other legal action in a call or message.\n\nUse trusted tax services: Make sure the company or individual you\u2019re using is a registered professional. Be wary of anyone who promises an unrealistically high refund or requests payment in cash, gift cards or cryptocurrency.\n\nDon\u2019t click on links in unsolicited texts or emails: They are likely a gateway to a fake website designed to steal data.\n\nLook closely at all website addresses: Ensure they start with https://. Note that the official CRA website is canada.ca \u2013 variations such as \u201ccra-tax-refund.com\u201d are fake.\n\nFiling your taxes is already stressful without the added threat of scams. To make tax season smoother, consider filing early \u2013 this reduces last-minute panic and lowers the risk of falling for fraudulent \u201cquick-fix\u201d services. Enrolling in direct deposit through the CRA can also ensure any refund goes directly to your bank account, bypassing potential scams.\n\nStaying informed is key. The CRA regularly updates its website with the latest scam alerts, so check their resources to keep yourself protected.",

            "content": "TLDR The way a business responds to either external and internal pressure \u2013 rather than the pressure itself \u2013 is often the difference between thriving and failing. Successfully managing cash flow and debt are crucial to the ongoing viability of your business. Expanding your customer base can help hedge against market trends and challenges.\n\nLeveraging free business tools and the advice of an expert can help you stay ahead of issues and remain financially resilient.\n\nEver wondered why some businesses get off the ground easily, moving from start-up to thriving within a couple of years \u2013 while others fail? Business insolvencies surged in 2024, rising 28.6% over the year before, with the construction, transportation, warehousing and hospitality sectors experiencing the biggest increase. In a mid-year study conducted by the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals, 386 Canadian businesses filed for insolvency each day in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWhile a variety of external pressures can affect the solvency of a business \u2013 from high interest rates to inflation to tariffs \u2013 the way a business responds to these headwinds is often the difference as to whether it remains stable or runs into financial trouble.\n\nWith 2025 bringing its own set of economic hurdles for Canadian businesses, recognizing the common mistakes that lead to insolvency can help you stay in the black and maintain a financially healthy operation. Keep in mind, being proactive is key. Taking the below steps today will be far more effective than waiting until you find yourself in a more vulnerable, or even desperate, position.\n\nHere are six common pitfalls that can lead to insolvency \u2013 and how to help avoid them:\n\n1. Losing control of your business cash flow\n\nCash flow is the lifeblood of any business \u2013 so it stands to reason that losing a grip on it could lead to some financial distress. For instance, mismanaging cash flow could make it hard to cover expenses \u2013 from paying rent to covering payroll to making payments to suppliers \u2013 which could lead to penalties and interest, costing the business more.\n\nPoor cash flow management can also stunt the growth of the business. Little to no cash on hand can hold you back from acting on opportunities as they arise. And in tougher economic times, a lack of cash reserves could leave you without the safety net you need.\n\nSolution:\n\nMaking your cash flow a priority is crucial. This involves continuously monitoring and forecasting what\u2019s coming in and what\u2019s going out \u2013 and reacting accordingly. Here are some tips to consider:\n\nStay on top of payments from your clients: Slow receivables can put your cash flow at risk. If you have clients who consistently pay late, it may be time to implement some early payment incentives (or late payment penalties)\n\nMonitor your inventory: Take note of what\u2019s sitting and what\u2019s selling and shift your product mix as demand changes. It can also be worth setting prices with cash flow in mind\u2014higher for fast movers, lower for slow movers\n\nAsk for deposits: If your selling cycle is long, putting you in frequent cash flow crunches, a deposit can help bridge you until the final product or service is delivered\n\nUse online and mobile banking: These tools can enable you to collect your payments quickly without scheduling a trip to the bank, giving you access to cash sooner\n\nUse forecasting tools: Our Cash Flow Forecast tool to help you avoid cash flow shortfalls and generate a surplus\n\n2. Not understanding your financial position\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between understanding that your business is facing financial challenges and understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the numbers. Are you lacking competitiveness when bidding for jobs? Have your sales decreased? Perhaps your expenses have gone up and you\u2019re absorbing these increases rather than passing them along to your customers.\n\nGetting to the bottom of any issues with your financials is the key to fixing them.\n\nSolution:\n\nDo a financial deep dive. This involves gathering your financial statements, such as your income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet to get some clarity on your financial position.\n\nGraph your sales or business income in the last six months. What do you forecast for the next year? If the numbers are decreasing where is the bleed happening? For example, if you see slow turning inventory in a specific product, explore ways to unload it faster with discounts.\n\nCalculate your expenses on a rolling monthly average. If expenses are rising, look at ways you can trim them or run scenarios where your price is increased to offset inflationary pressure on your margins and consider increasing your prices.

Ask Yourself 3 Questions \u2013 My Money Matters\n\nIt\u2019s also worth using ratios to calculate some key financial indicators, such as your profit margin, ability to service debt and whether your business has enough cash flow to meet your short-term obligations.\n\nHere are some ratios you can use to get to the root of your financial position:\n\n+/- Current Ratio\n\nAlso called Working Capital Ratio, this calculation indicates whether your business has enough cash flow to meet your short-term obligations, act on opportunities and look good in the eyes of potential lenders. It can also help you avoid cash flow problems before they surface.\n\nHow to calculate Current Ratio\n\nDivide your current assets by your current liabilities. Ideally, your Current Ratio should fall between 1.5 and 2 \u2014 a ratio of 1 means you may not have enough money to last the year, while a ratio of more than 2 could mean you\u2019re not investing enough into your business for the future.\n\n+/-Debt Ratio\n\nYour Debt Ratio shows the percentage of your business\u2019 assets financed by creditors. It\u2019s a ratio a lender will look at before lending money to your business, so it\u2019s wise to know this number before planning the year ahead.\n\nHow to calculate Debt Ratio\n\nDivide your total debt by your total assets. A good Debt Ratio largely depends on your industry, but anything below 0.3 is considered fair. With anything above 0.6, it may be difficult to obtain additional loans.\n\n+/- Gross Profit Margin\n\nThis calculation shows you what percentage of your income is profit after paying for the cost of doing business. These costs include labour, materials and other production costs. While it can help you assess your company\u2019s financial health, it\u2019s best used to track your company\u2019s performance over time or benchmark your business against companies in the same industry.\n\nHow to calculate Gross Profit Margin\n\nSubtract your expenses/ cost of goods sold from your net sales (gross revenues minus returns, allowances and discounts). Then, divide that number by your net revenues and multiply by 100% to calculate the gross profit margin ratio.\n\n+/- Debt Service Coverage Ratio\n\nThe Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) is a key measure of a company\u2019s ability to repay its loans, take on new financing and make dividend payments. Different debt providers may have different numbers they like to see; however, the greater the value over 1.25 (125% coverage), the better. The key value in calculating DSCR is identifying your company\u2019s net income. If your business has a growth plan requiring investor/lender assistance, it is important to maintain a strong DSCR.\n\nHow to calculate Debt Service Ratio\n\nTo calculate DSCR, divide net operating income by debt service, which is the sum of all current debts, including principal and interest.\n\n3. Focusing too much on the details \u2013 not the future\n\nAs a business owner, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of working \u2018in\u2019 the business rather than \u2018on\u2019 the business \u2013 that is, you get caught up in the day-to-day operations without taking the time to look up and see where you\u2019re headed.\n\nSolution:\n\nWhile running your business is of course vital to your success today, taking a step back is crucial for your success tomorrow and down the road. Understanding your financial position, forecasting future sales and updating your financial statements are all essential steps to steering your business out of the path of trouble.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget your business plan! Consider this as a living, breathing framework rather than a document you create once and file away. A good rule of thumb is to update it at least once a year to ensure the plan is relevant and considers new market shifts, challenges or opportunities, and remains relevant to your business\u2019 core mission.\n\nOnline tools can help make the idea of tackling your business plan less daunting. Use the RBC Business Plan Builder to create or update your plan using an easy template and intuitive questions.\n\n4. Taking on too much debt\n\nWhile credit can help cover financial gaps at times, relying too much on credit can lead to mounting debt that is difficult to pay back. Interest costs can add up and businesses may find all their revenue is being funneled into debt repayments.\n\nToo much debt can also lead to reputational damage \u2013 suppliers, banks and investors could lose confidence, making it harder to secure financing when it\u2019s needed most.\n\nSolution:\n\nIncurring debt is inevitable for business owners \u2013 the trick is to limit and structure it so that it\u2019s manageable \u2013 even when times are tight. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\nRestructure existing debt: Consolidating multiple, higher-interest rate debts (i.e., credit card balances) into a single, lower-interest rate solution (i.e., line of credit) can reduce your interest costs and simplify your debt repayment\n\nConsider other funding sources: Non-repayable government grants and incentives can provide funding for businesses looking to expand, create jobs, advance innovation, launch environmental initiatives and more. Take a look at our article 5 Ways Grants Can Help Grow Your Business in 2025 for more information about using grants to advance your business.\n\nTalk to your bank: An advisor can help you work through your debt, present financing solutions and identify ways to relieve current pressure.\n\n5 min read: Should You Borrow to Help Grow your Business? 6 Questions to Ask\n\n5. Patchwork business financing\n\nAre you taking from Peter to pay Paul? Shuffling money around to cover shortfalls in various areas can lead to a vicious \u2013 and unsustainable \u2013 cycle. Eventually, the money can run out and leave you unable to meet your obligations.\n\nSolution:\n\nConsolidating debt and considering other financing methods can again help in this instance \u2013 as can drawing on your established business relationships.\n\nWork with your suppliers: You may be able to work out modified payment plans that can help you get over a crunch\n\nExamine your personal situation: Can you reduce the amount of money you pay yourself from your business in the short-term?\n\nKeep your business and personal finances separate: As you review your personal situation, evaluate whether you have good separation between your business and personal accounts and assets. If you need to return business assets due to financial difficulties, you want to ensure your personal property is protected.\n\nReach out to an advisor: They may have other ideas that can help you shore up your balance sheet and plug any holes that are threatening your business. It\u2019s important to be transparent here \u2013 your advisor can only help with solutions if they know there is a problem. To that end, be sure to have your financials on hand to make the most of your discussion. Even mid-year numbers will be able to help your advisor guide you.\n\n6. Revenue dependence on a narrow client base\n\nIf you\u2019re dependent on a single market or customer base, you\u2019re opening yourself up to risk. What if that market falls through? If they find an alternate supplier or their needs change, you may find yourself low on buyers.\n\nSolution:\n\nEven if your market seems strong now, it\u2019s important to diversify to spread out your risk. It\u2019s also important to stay informed about market trends and adapt your business model to respond to industry-specific challenges.\n\nTurning Point: Real Entrepreneurs Share Their Marketing Secrets for Growing a Customer Base.\n\nIf doing business internationally is an option for you, you can leverage tools and insights to help you identify global markets. If you have been relying on the U.S. market, now may be the time to explore opportunities in other countries. The Trade Hub, a new digital platform, aims to highlight opportunities for Canada in this new economic order.\n\nIn challenging economic conditions, it\u2019s important to improve your financial resilience to reduce the risk of insolvency. Understanding the common pitfalls \u2013 and the solutions that exist \u2013 can help your business stay healthy.",

Giving a friend your debit card to pay for some snacks?\n\nWhatever the case, experts say you should never share your banking information with anyone but your partner. But it's more common than you might think.\n\n\"Sharing passwords at this point tends to be the best option for people, because banks haven't offered a better option,\" Celine Latulipe, a computer science professor at the University of Manitoba, told the Cost Of Living.\n\n\"You really shouldn't be sharing your password, but it's completely understandable that people do.\"\n\nAccording to a report published by the University of Manitoba in December 2024, many older adults rely on someone to help them with online banking. The university surveyed and performed interview studies with older adults and their caregivers about their banking practices.\n\nAnd while most often that person \u2014 usually a close family member, such as a child \u2014 is well meaning, experts say it can still be dangerous to share access to that money, and the private information that comes along with it.\n\nNot so simple\n\nWhen banking shifted online, Pricilla Buchanan's husband took care of paying the couple's bills. He was always the one who handled any banking anyway.\n\nBut when he passed away, Buchanan had to take on the responsibility, despite being much more comfortable with a sewing machine than a computer.\n\nSusan Goldstein, left, and Adriel Lumampao participate in a Toronto Public Library digital literacy course at the North York Central branch on July 19, 2024. Some seniors struggle to keep up with online banking, and look for help. (Tess Ha/CBC)\n\n\"It's very challenging sometimes just trying to get through to your institution to make arrangements or to check up on something,\" said Buchanan, a senior living in Sackville, N.S.\n\nMost of the tasks aren't too difficult. She can pay the bills and check her balance. But sometimes, she shares her password with her son and daughter, who help her out.\n\n\"I trust them,\" said Buchanan. \"You have to have somebody to fall back on because you just don't know what happens in your life.\"\n\nAnd Buchanan isn't alone. According to a Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) survey from 2020 , 55 per cent of Canadians have shared their bank card pins or online passwords.\n\nSecurity risks\n\nGeoff Morton, senior director of fraud strategy at RBC, says there are no circumstances where people should share their banking password or pin.\n\n\"People need to take better care of this really sensitive information and ensure that they're protecting it, like they would protect any other key into a very important building,\" said Morton.\n\nThat's because sharing your password doesn't just give people access to your money. If someone with ill intent gets into your account, they have access to personal information such as your name, address, phone numbers and email addresses.\n\n\"And that information can be leveraged in a number of different ways for very negative purposes,\" said Morton.\n\nA 2020 survey from the Royal Bank of Canada found 55 per cent of people have shared their bank pin or password. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nAnd in many cases, sharing your password violates your service agreement, which can negate the protection that banks will provide.\n\n\"You are now liable for those fraud transactions and are no longer guaranteed reimbursement from the bank,\" said Morton.\n\nThat's because once that information has been shared, it's harder for the bank to tell what could be fraudulent activity.\n\nWhen a bank finds out a customer has shared a password or pin, they're encouraged to change their information and refrain from sharing it again. In extreme cases, like with significant fraud, the bank may decide to close the account.\n\nBanking alternatives\n\nLatulipe says the options for providing shared access to bank accounts are limited in Canada. People can set up a joint account, but that's typically reserved for people in committed relationships who share financial assets. Plus, a joint account means the people sharing the account also share financial debts.\n\nShe says one possible solution is what are called proxy accounts. In India and the U.K., people can give others limited access to their accounts with their own individual passwords.\n\nDuring their study, the research team built a fake bank service that allowed for proxy accounts.\n\nWhen they tested the service, the proxy accounts allowed the older adults to decide what they wanted help, and it made the personal helping feel more legitimate. Proxy accounts also allowed people to choose how much access they want to give.\n\n\"That really sets a limit on how much damage could be done if the person who's been given access decides to act nefariously,\" said Latulipe\n\nComputer science professor Celine Latulipe suggests proxy accounts, like in the U.K. and India, could help make a difference in Canada. (hedgehog94/Shutterstock)\n\nThe account holder could limit things like if the person could send e-transfers or add any new payees. But she says banks may not be in a hurry to do this because of potential liability issues.\n\nMorton suggests that if anyone is having trouble with their online banking, and needs some extra help, they should call their bank.\n\n\"The key there is that you, as the account holder, are the one who are logging in to that session with your password and not sharing that with the other individual,\" said Morton.",

A few months ago, the situation escalated into significant protests and strike action by employees of the 1st National Bank.\n\nDr Albert-Poyotte, who facilitated the mediation, emphasised that this was a complex process requiring both parties to reach a mutually agreeable solution regarding specific terms and work conditions.\n\n\u201cThe National Workers Union has formally communicated its acceptance of my determination, as has the 1st National Bank,\u201d the Labour Minister stated at a media briefing on Monday.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\nThe dispute originated from the 1st National Bank\u2019s acquisition of the Royal Bank of Canada, which resulted in employees facing \u201cadditional responsibilities\u201d in the transition to the new entity.\n\nDr. Albert-Poyotte acknowledged employee concerns about pay disparities between 1st National Bank and former Royal Bank of Canada employees. The union demanded an additional $600.00 per month for each employee.\n\nHowever, the bank claimed this was financially unfeasible given its limited resources. The Labour Commissioner intervened, suggesting an increase of $400, but the bank still deemed that amount \u201cnot affordable\u201d due to its narrow profit margins.\n\nDr. Albert-Poyotte took charge of the situation and emphasized that productivity would not improve without resolving the underlying issues that led to the dispute. The union insisted on a job evaluation to ensure that their members receive equitable remuneration compared to other bank employees.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\nAfter negotiations were stalled, the Labour Minister insisted on a resumption of discussions. She pressed the bank to expedite the job evaluation process and set a deadline for resolution.\n\nFollowing a thorough review, Dr. Albert-Poyotte reported that the bank has made progress in addressing these concerns, and has personnel dedicated to the job evaluation, and is back at the negotiating table. She announced a $250.00 compensation award for affected employees, effective from January 2024 to the present date. Ultimately, the bank recognized the necessity of meeting these requests, considering it a manageable agreement. Dr. Albert-Poyotte concluded, \u201cThe workers emerge positively from this process, standing firmly in their right to a job evaluation. Those who qualify will be re-classified and may also see a pay increase as part of the negotiations that have been agreed upon by both the bank and the union.\u201d She commended the collaboration of both parties, highlighting that their cooperation is vital for creating a constructive working environment for all.",

            "content": "For the week of March 31st, 2025\n\nEye on U.S. reciprocal tariffs ahead of key job market reports\n\nThe United States\u2019 administration\u2019s announcement on reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday threatens to overshadow normally key job market reports for February in Canada and the U.S. on Friday.\n\nThe start and stop of trade threats and actions from the U.S. have been dizzying, but as much as the uncertainty has intensified, U.S. tariffs implemented so far have not been large enough to cause a recession in Canada. By our count, the effective average U.S. tariff on imports from Canada has increased to about 2.5% from essentially zero in January.\n\nThe vast majority of U.S. imports from Canada that are USMCA/CUSMA compliant were quickly exempted from the more severe blanket 25% tariff imposed in early March. The additional steel and aluminium tariffs implemented on March 12 are large, but products impacted account for a relatively small share (about 4%) of Canadian exports to the U.S.\n\nU.S. tariffs on finished motor vehicle exports announced this week are scheduled to kick in on April 3, and would add roughly another percentage point to that Canadian rate by our count. Still, most motor vehicle parts are (critically) not included in the initial auto tariff announcement and the value of U.S. intermediate products embodied in those finished vehicles, accounting for roughly half of the total value in Canada\u2019s case, are set to be excluded.\n\nCanada has seen the second largest increase in the effective tariff rate applied by the U.S. to-date, but most (about 80%) of the doubling in the total U.S. tariff rate on all countries has still come from the additional 20% blanket tariffs imposed on China.\n\nActivity hasn\u2019t softened as much as sentiment suggests but unemployment to tick higher\n\nMeasures of business and consumer confidence have already pulled back significantly in Canada. Consumer confidence hit all-time lows in March. But, early reports on actual spending and hiring decisions have held up better than softening sentiment alone suggests.\n\nOur tracking of consumer purchases showed a mild pullback in retail spending in February, coinciding with the end of the federal tax holiday and a severe snowstorm in parts of Ontario. Hiring demand has showed some signs of slowing, but remains relatively resilient. Job openings posted on indeed.com have declined, but remain 11% above lows in October last year. We expect February\u2019s pause in Canadian employment growth extended to a 10,000 decline in March and the unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from February\u2019s 6.6%, but it still remains below November\u2019s 6.9% peak.\n\nWatch out for Canada\u2019s rank as well as rate in reciprocal tariffs\n\nBackward looking economic data in Canada still looks relatively resilient, but international trade risks are clouding the outlook. We know the U.S. reciprocal tariffs announcement is meant to represent a catch-all trade response to tariffs charged by trading partners, as well as a broad range of other policies the U.S. administration views as unfairly disadvantaging them (e.g., perceived currency manipulation, digital services taxes, value added taxes like Canada\u2019s GST\u2014see the Issue in focus here for more).\n\nWhat exactly those measures look like remains highly uncertain, but targeting a broader swath of U.S. trade partners would mark a shift from measures announced so far that have been focused on the U.S.\u2019s largest trade partners, namely China, Canada, and Mexico. We expect that where Canada ranks on the list of potential tariff increases next week compared to other regions will be as important as the rate itself. Canada was the U.S.\u2019s second largest trade partner in 2024 in total export and import flows, but ranked as just the 9th largest source of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit (the deficit coming entirely from oil and gas products).\n\nWe have argued before that tariffs are unlikely to shrink the total U.S. trade deficit in the near-term (beyond potential distortions like the front-running of imports ahead of expected tariff hikes). But one of the major concerns from tariff measures to-date has been the narrow focus on a handful of countries including Canada, which provides a strong incentive for U.S. buyers to shift purchases away to other exporters. There are no absolute winners in a trade war, and the threat also remains that blanket tariffs briefly imposed on Canadian exports in early March could be re-imposed. But, a smaller tariff rate gap between Canada and other countries/regions could also arguably be a less damaging scenario for Canada than the current status quo.\n\nWeek ahead data watch:\n\nWe expect Canadian employment edged down 10,000 in March after slowing to just 1,000 in February. It retraces only a fraction of the 76,000 jobs jump in January. Job openings from indeed.com into the second half of March are pointing to relatively resilient, but still softening hiring demand. Growth in the available labour supply will increasingly be restricted by slower population growth.\n\nedged down 10,000 in March after slowing to just 1,000 in February. It retraces only a fraction of the 76,000 jobs jump in January. Job openings from indeed.com into the second half of March are pointing to relatively resilient, but still softening hiring demand. Growth in the available labour supply will increasingly be restricted by slower population growth. We expect the Canadian trade balance to come in at $3.4 billion in February, slightly down from the $4 billion in the prior month, but still elevated at least in part due to inventory building ahead of threatened U.S. import tariffs. We expect both exports and imports declined during that month given a 5% decline in oil prices lowering the energy trade balance. Rail carloading activities were also lower in February.\n\nto come in at $3.4 billion in February, slightly down from the $4 billion in the prior month, but still elevated at least in part due to inventory building ahead of threatened U.S. import tariffs. We expect both exports and imports declined during that month given a 5% decline in oil prices lowering the energy trade balance. Rail carloading activities were also lower in February. We expect U.S. payroll employment rose by 138,000 in March\u2014roughly in line with the average increase over the prior two months. Hiring is expected to continue to slow in the public sector. We expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nrose by 138,000 in March\u2014roughly in line with the average increase over the prior two months.

The advance estimate of the U.S. goods trade deficit edged lower, but remained wide after spiking higher in January.

            "content": "Eighteen months after a string of hefty losses led to a management shakeup at a key U.S. subsidiary, Royal Bank of Canada executives pulled back the curtain Thursday on the company's revised U.S. strategy.\n\nThe revamp involves cross-selling more products to clients, expanding in the mortgage business and continuing to concentrate on certain longstanding niches. Those historical focuses include lending to middle-market companies, providing banking services to the entertainment industry and serving high-net-worth customers.\n\nBut as the Canadian company seeks to build on what worked for decades at City National Bank \u2014 the Los Angeles-based subsidiary that ran into trouble in 2023 \u2014 it may eventually do so without the City National name.\n\n\"We plan to start the process of migrating the one brand in the U.S. When you think about our brand in the U.S., you should think RBC,\" Greg Carmichael, executive chair of RBC's U.S. operations, said in prepared remarks.\n\nCarmichael, a former Fifth Third Bancorp CEO who joined RBC in October 2023 , was one of several top executives who spoke Thursday at the Toronto-based bank's investor day . He's in charge of engineering a turnaround of City National, which reported a $38 million quarterly loss shortly before Carmichael came aboard.\n\nIn his latest role, Carmichael is leaning into his experience at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third, where he served as chief executive for seven years. He has hired numerous former Fifth Third colleagues, including City National CEO Howard Hammond . This week, City National announced the appointment of Joe Yurosek, another former Fifth Third executive, as its president of commercial banking.\n\nGreg Carmichael, executive chair of RBC's U.S. operations\n\nAt the investor day on Thursday, RBC CEO Dave McKay said Carmichael brought from Fifth Third the idea of adding the capacity to originate mortgages with the intent to sell them.\n\n\"We didn't have that,\" McKay said. \"We were originating mortgages and putting them on our balance sheet \u2026 and took obviously the interest-rate risk that came with that. And that limited how much we could take.\"\n\nOnce the expanded mortgage business is up and running, which RBC expects to happen later this year, the bank should be able to originate more jumbo mortgages, which will open up a larger cross-selling opportunity with wealth-management clients.\n\n\"We've never had that. It generates a whole new vertical as fee-based income,\" McKay said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Carmichael spoke about breaking through silos within RBC to achieve more cross-selling. That message ties into a larger company-wide goal of achieving more integration across segments, which executives summarized Thursday as \"One RBC.\"\n\n\"Core middle-market clients need strong cash management and capital market services,\" Carmichael said. \"Our entertainment clients need access to stronger wealth advisory services. We have all the products and services, but what we need to do is offer them consistently and holistically to our clients.\"\n\nRBC executives also alluded to an effort to expand the company's U.S. credit card offerings, though details were scarce. And they described plans to add 600 new financial advisors in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, Carmichael spoke about shoring up areas where City National long focused. City National was long known as Hollywood's \"Bank to the Stars,\" and it's now looking to expand its entertainment banking franchise in the sports business.\n\nEarlier this month, City National announced the addition of Anthony Di Santi , who previously led Citigroup's sports investment banking unit, as its head of corporate sports banking. \"The bank's sports vertical is capitalizing on the explosive growth in the economics of professional and collegiate sports,\" Carmichael said Thursday.\n\nOne part of RBC's U.S. business that seems unlikely to expand much is its branch footprint. The company is looking to achieve stronger deposit-gathering capabilities and a better funding mix, Carmichael said, before adding this caveat: \"Very branch-light.\"",

It also injected more than $3 billion to save its U.S. subsidiary City National, a California-based lender that caters to Hollywood clientele.\n\nMcKay has also sought to make RBC \"simpler, faster and more innovative\" by adding scale, reducing complexity and investing in talent, according to memos to employees seen by Reuters.\n\nThe messages come after McKay carried out RBC's landmark $10 billion purchase of HSBC's Canadian operations, shook up senior leadership and divided the company's personal and commercial banking segments in Canada.\n\nThe HSBC acquisition expanded RBC's size and market share, giving it a more than C$80 billion advantage in market capitalization over Canada's next biggest lender, TD Bank.\n\n\"How do they level up?\" Veritas Investment Research analyst Shalabh Garg asked, noting that RBC has managed to avoid \"major landmines\" that has plagued other Canadian banks including slower earnings growth and regulatory woes. \"On a global basis, I think they can do lots more.\"\n\nRBC has $2.1 trillion in assets, putting it into a category of major North American lenders alongside JPMorgan Chase, which has more than $4 trillion, Garg said.\n\nRBC trades 12.02 times its forward earnings, beating TD's 10.82 times, Bank of Montreal's 11.48 times, Bank of Nova Scotia's 9.46 times and CIBC's 10.01 times, according to LSEG data.\n\nSince RBC's last investor day in June 2018, the stock has gained 66%. Shares of the other top five Canadian banks have had mixed performances in that time, ranging from a loss of 8% to a gain of 43%.\n\nAll five banks have invested in the United States. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has questioned the lack of U.S. banks in Canada, gutted a consumer banking watchdog and changed some immigration policies for Canadians.",

            "content": "By Alexander Jones, International Banker\n\nOn January 7, JPMorgan Chase announced that it would leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). In so doing, it became one of the latest in a growing line of major lenders\u2014mainly from the United States and Canada\u2014to vacate their positions in the global banking sector\u2019s biggest climate coalition, just as the new US presidential administration has taken office. As such, it delivers a clear signal to the world that North American banking\u2019s collective commitment towards climate action and sustainability will decisively fade during the Trump 2.0 era.\n\nLaunched in April 2021 by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the NZBA is a bank-led, UN-convened alliance of leading global banks that are committed to aligning their lending, investment and capital-markets activities with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. At present, UNEP FI records 135 banks from 44 countries as members of the NZBA, with a combined $56 trillion of total assets.\n\n\u201cNZBA\u2019s framework, guidance, and learning opportunities support members to design, set, and achieve credible science-based net-zero targets for 2030 or sooner that deliver value for their investors and clients,\u201d according to the UN agency, which has been connecting the UN with financial institutions worldwide to shape the sustainable-finance agenda for more than 30 years. \u201cMembers are making important progress. Well over 100 NZBA banks have now set individual and independent science-based sectoral 2030 targets for their financed emissions using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.\u201d\n\nHowever, with the commencement of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term, times are now dramatically changing. Indeed, JPMorgan\u2019s withdrawal from the NZBA comes hot on the heels of the exits of fellow banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America (BofA), Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs\u2014all in the space of less than one month. The six banks collectively account for around $15 trillion in assets\u2014or 62 percent of the US banking industry\u2014underlining the scale of the loss that the NZBA has experienced.\n\nAnd despite the coalition managing to gather a serious head of steam throughout the previous administration of US President Joe Biden\u2014during which membership numbers ballooned from 43 banks at its founding in April 2021 to more than 140 banks at its peak last year\u2014the changing of the guard in the White House has prompted a major exodus among the US\u2019 biggest banks, a trend reversal that is almost entirely reflective of the Trump Administration\u2019s pro-fossil-fuel, pro-business agenda.\n\nIndeed, Republican politicians have escalated their condemnations of the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement over recent years, with US banks often on the receiving end. In his first week in office, moreover, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that could have profoundly adverse consequences for the environment and the battle against the climate crisis. Once again, Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement, as he did during his first term, with Biden later reinstating the US\u2019 membership.\n\nMoreover, the US president has also declared a \u201cnational energy emergency\u201d and promoted oil and gas expansion through eminent domain\u2014whereby the government can acquire private property for public use\u2014and the Defense Production Act, which enables the government to use private land for production that is deemed a national necessity. Trump also infamously applied the \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d slogan to characterise his energy policy during his election campaign, clearly indicating that fossil-fuel production is high on the Trump agenda and that the US\u2019 commitment to sustainability is likely to fall by the wayside.\n\nWith lending restrictions on the world\u2019s biggest industrial polluters likely to be lifted as a result of their departures from the NZBA, banks are only too happy to oblige. \u201cThe sudden exodus of these big US banks out of the NZBA is a lily-livered effort to avoid criticism from Trump and his climate denialist cronies,\u201d Paddy (Patrick) McCully, a senior analyst at the campaign group Reclaim Finance, told The Guardian shortly after JPMorgan\u2019s exit announcement. \u201cA few years ago, when climate change was at the front of the political agenda, the banks were keen to boast of their commitments to act on climate. Now that the political pendulum has swung in the other direction, suddenly acting on climate does not seem so important for the Wall Street lenders.\u201d\n\nThat pendulum swing certainly appears to be a decisive one, with a slew of financial institutions retreating from their environmental commitments in recent weeks amid the increasingly hostile environment for climate advocacy, with the NZBA suffering perhaps the most acutely from this sea change. Indeed, the departures of banks have not just been confined to the United States. On January 17, four Canadian lenders also confirmed their withdrawals from the banking alliance, just four days prior to Trump\u2019s official inauguration as the US president.\n\nTD Canada Trust Bank, Bank of Montreal (BMO), National Bank of Canada (NBC) and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) explained in separate statements that they were equipped to work outside the Alliance and develop their own climate strategies. \u201cThe NZBA was formed at a time when the global industry was scaling up efforts to take action on climate and served a valuable role in galvanizing these efforts and establishing momentum,\u201d CIBC asserted in a statement. \u201cAs this space has evolved and matured, and having made significant progress alongside our clients in these areas, we are now well-positioned to further this work outside of the formal structure of the NZBA.\u201d\n\nThese exits were then followed by the significant departure of Canada\u2019s biggest bank, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), on January 31. \u201cWe have informed the NZBA that we will be departing the organization, as we now have the tools and capabilities to help implement our climate strategy and measure our performance,\u201d an RBC spokesman confirmed. \u201cWe will continue to focus our efforts on supporting our clients to help them address climate change and succeed in the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.\u201d RBC\u2019s chief executive, David McKay, has since contended that the withdrawal does not necessarily indicate a non-commitment to net-zero goals. \u201cIt just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can\u2019t do and how you report, is maybe not the right mechanism to do it,\u201d McKay insisted.\n\nThe \u201cbuy side\u201d of the industry, meanwhile, has seen asset managers previously bound to similar climate initiatives also heading for the exits. Early January saw BlackRock confirm that it would leave the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. Launched in December 2020, NZAM \u201caims to support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximise [the] long-term value of assets\u201d and is a formal partner of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s (UNFCCC\u2019s) Race to Zero campaign. However, according to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, membership in the initiative \u201ccaused confusion regarding BlackRock\u2019s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials\u201d.\n\nAs for US participation in the NZBA today, just three American banks remain part of the 135-member strong coalition\u2014Amalgamated Bank, Areti Bank and Climate First Bank\u2014none of which have anywhere near the financial clout or global influence commanded by the six recently departed banks. \u201cThese exits reveal the inadequacy of voluntary commitments and underscore the urgent need for state-level leadership and regulation to protect state and national climate progress and economic stability,\u201d Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, recently explained to sustainability-focused publication ESG Dive.\n\nNonetheless, those remaining few US banks stand defiant amid the departures. \u201cClimate change is real, and we will continue to work closely with Net Zero Banking Alliance as well as other banks, businesses, communities and individuals to finance a more resilient, renewable future,\u201d Climate First Bank\u2019s chief executive officer, Ken LaRoe, recently confirmed to climate-focused digital media outlet Trellis. \u201cSimply put, siloed action without accountability\u2014even if real\u2014isn\u2019t enough. This is nothing more than GOP political games that will cost investors, public pensioners, taxpayers\u2014and the world\u2014dearly.\u201d\n\nToby Kwan, a senior manager at the UK-based business-decarbonisation consultancy Carbon Trust, meanwhile, insists that the US banks\u2019 exits from the NZBA will not prove fatal for the Alliance. \u201cWhile these major financial institutions leaving the alliance raises a question mark on the future of climate action in the financial sector, the remaining NZBA members represent a significant portion of the global banking sector, controlling approximately 40% of global banking assets, or $64 trillion,\u201d Kwan told The Guardian. \u201cThis substantial influence cannot be understated, and NZBA members can drive the transition to a net zero economy.\u201d",

            "content": "\u201cFraud fatigue\u201d seems to be settling into the Canadian psyche with two thirds of Canadians feeling tired of being on constant alert according to RBC\u2019s annual Fraud Prevention Month poll. One-third also admit to letting their guard down which is easy to understand.\n\nAn overwhelming 98% of respondents believe scams are getting more targeted and sophisticated and nearly nine out of 10 (89%) report they have seen a rise in scam attempts more than ever before (up from 77% in 2023). What\u2019s more, most believe it\u2019s getting harder and harder to recognize scams.\n\nThe importance of staying proactive\n\nIf you\u2019re suffering from fraud fatigue, you\u2019re not alone. But it\u2019s just as important as ever to protect yourself.\n\nAlthough dealing with scam attempts can feel frustrating, failing to protect yourself can result in significant losses, including money, personal data, or both.\n\nThe good news is that defending yourself from fraud doesn\u2019t have to be difficult or time-consuming.\n\nThree tips to help protect yourself from fraud\n\n1. Pause before acting.\n\nImagine you have received a message that is pressuring you to act on something urgently. Perhaps a package you\u2019re waiting for is held up in customs and you need to provide payment to release it; or suspicious activity has been reported your bank account and you\u2019re asked to share your PIN in order to protect your money.\n\nThis is the time to pause and ask yourself a few key questions:\n\nDo you feel fearful or rushed to click on a link or take an action?\n\nDoes the message include a reasonable request or does something feel off about it?\n\nWith advanced technology, criminals can easily impersonate your family, friends and trusted sources, like your bank, and persuade you to share account or personal information. Keep in mind, if something looks fishy, it probably is!\n\n2. Set up protection features.\n\nMore good news is that tools to protect yourself and add extra layers of security have continued to evolve in order to stay a step ahead of fraudsters. Consider these essential features to keep your information secure:\n\nAlerts : There are several types of alerts that send a notification if there is out-of-the-ordinary activity on an account. Signing up for alerts is an excellent way to stay on top of your money and activity within your accounts. A fraud alert will notify by text message if there\u2019s an unusual Interac e-Transfer transaction made or if a credit card transaction appears out of place. A transaction alert will send a notification if, for instance, an account balance drops before a certain set threshold, or a large purchase is made on a credit card.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also known as 2-Step Verification or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), makes it harder for criminals to steal information because it uses two separate factors for identification: One is typically a username and password, while the other could be a cellphone, fingerprint, or other biometric data. While some apps and websites use MFA automatically, some leave the decision up to the user.\n\nFace ID and fingerprint features : Like with MFA, these biometric features add an extra layer of security that help keep data secure.\n\nStrong passwords: Passwords are the first line of defense against fraudsters, but many people have less-than-ideal password behaviour. From having simple passwords (such as \u201cpassword\u201d) to using the same passwords for every site, many online users leave themselves open to hacking. Strong passwords are important \u2013 and while they can feel like a pain to set up \u2013 they are invaluable in keeping information safe. Take a look at Why Strong Passwords Matter and How to Create Them for extra tips.\n\nAutodeposit: Autodeposit for Interac e-Transfers service eliminates the need for a security question and answer in every transaction, reducing the risk that someone unintended could intercept the funds.\n\n3. Stay informed.\n\nBeing aware of the latest scams can help you spot a fraud attempt when it pops up in your inbox or on your phone. The RBC Scam Alert page is dedicated to keeping you up to date on the latest scams \u2013 how they work, what they look like and how to protect yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to understand what legitimate companies will and will not ask you for. Here are some things legitimate companies will NEVER ask you to do (but fraudsters frequently attempt):\n\nProvide your username, login ID, PIN, password or one-time code through text, email or voicemail\n\nGive an old debit or credit card (i.e., one that you\u2019ve destroyed after it was compromised) to the bank or a third-party in order to secure your accounts.\n\nMake a transaction in order to secure your account\n\nShare a link from an Interac e-Transfer transaction\n\nDemand payment using gift cards, prepaid credit cards, cryptocurrency or wire transfer\n\nThreaten you with arrest, fines or immediate account closure\n\nCall or email to fix a computer problem you didn\u2019t report\n\n\u201cAccidentally\u201d overpay and request you return excess money",

We expect tariffs to be implemented on April 2 but we do not know with certainty or at what level they may be set. How would tariffs affect Canadian bank earnings, what else is happening with bank stocks and what is that doing to bank valuations?\n\nThe screen\n\nWe used StockCalc\u2019s screener to select the top listed Schedule 1 bank stocks by market capitalization on the TSX. (Schedule 1 means it\u2019s a wholly domestic institution regulated by the Federal Bank Act and licensed to operate across Canada.) We then used StockCalc\u2019s valuation tools to calculate fundamental, or intrinsic, valuation for each stock to see if it is undervalued or overvalued compared with its price.\n\nOverview of the techniques used:\n\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF value) is a valuation technique in which cash-flow projections are discounted back to the present to calculate value per share. For banks we use a modified DCF;\n\nA price comparables (price comps) technique values the company on the basis of ratios from selected comparable companies;\n\nAn adjusted book value (ABV) is calculated by multiplying book value per share by a stock\u2019s 10-year average price-to-book ratio.\n\nIf a stock has analyst coverage, we may look at the consensus target price.\n\nMore about StockCalc\n\nStockCalc is a fundamental valuation platform with tools to calculate and report on value per share for thousands of public companies listed on major North American stock exchanges.

Economic uncertainty leads to a slowdown in activity, which results in fewer loans. That environment results in lower net interest income, higher provision for credit losses and reduced fees for the banks. In the short term, Daniel Da Silva at S&P Global Ratings sees their strong balance sheets able to withstand tariffs but under a prolonged tariff scenario the banks would need to increase their provisions for credit losses, leading to a hit on earnings.\n\nWith reduced economic activity we would expect The Bank of Canada to lower interest rates. During periods of falling interest rates, banks will make less on their interest margin (the difference between interest income and interest expense), but that is usually offset by more loans, lower loan default rates, a shift to spending and an improved housing market. The tariffs put this scenario reversal at risk with economists now forecasting a 1-per-cent to 1.5-per-cent reduction in Canadian gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 12 months.\n\nWe look at net interest margin, price-to-book (P/B) and return on equity (ROE) ratios for the banks as part of the valuation. All of the stocks on this list pay a dividend and all have seen their stock prices rise over the last 12 months. Let\u2019s look at a couple of companies:\n\nBank of Nova Scotia BNS-T has five business segments: Canadian banking, international banking, global wealth management, global banking and markets, and other. In their document A New Way Forward published late in 2023, they noted the bank\u2019s relative underperformance and announced they were focusing on growth in Canada, United States and Mexico. In looking at fiscal 2024 financials compared with 2023 results, we are starting to see improvement in net interest income and other metrics. All of our valuation data points for BNS-T are above Friday\u2019s close price (we currently show 14 per cent upside over the next 12 months), but with April 2 looming and 78 per cent of its earnings from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, we may need to adjust after we get tariff clarity.\n\nOn Feb. 3, National Bank of Canada NA-T completed its acquisition of Canadian Western Bank CWB-T. National Bank of Canada is the sixth-largest bank in Canada (CWB was ninth-largest) with diversified financial services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management and capital markets services. The bank is concentrated in the province of Quebec but now will have 40 per cent of its personal and commercial business outside of Quebec with the CWB acquisition. Again, all of our valuation data points for NA-T are above Friday\u2019s close price with an expectation of 8-per-cent upside over the next 12 months.\n\nYou can see in the accompanying table the percentage difference between each stocks recent closing price and its intrinsic value.

            "content": "The banking business has been impacted by higher interest rates, new technology and consolidation within the industry, but the wildfires that scorched Southern California in January have had an unprecedented impact on the lives of residents, employees and clients. Many banks and other financial institutions responded by creating funds or donating to local organizations that support fire relief in the midst of ongoing commercial banking operations.\n\nCity National Bank, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada, is the largest bank headquartered in Southern California. It committed $3 million to nonprofits and foundations supporting wildfire relief, including the American Red Cross, Entertainment Industry Foundation and United Way Los Angeles, among others.\n\n\u201cAs the largest bank headquartered in Los Angeles, this tragedy is deeply personal for us. Our clients, colleagues and communities are suffering unimaginable devastation,\u201d said Howard Hammond, chief executive and president of City National Bank, in a statement. \u201cWe know we have an important role to play in helping address both the immediate needs in the wake of these fires as well as in the long-term work to rebuild.\u201d\n\nCity National Bank has also expanded its local presence recently by opening a new branch in Whittier in one of a collection of buildings that has been redeveloped at the former site of the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility. The facility shuttered in 2004 and was acquired by Brookfield Residential in 2019, which repositioned it into a mixed-use project. It is adjacent to 500 new homes and 200 apartments, along with restaurants and other retail spanning 16 acres.\n\nBanc of California, which completed a merger with PacWest Bancorp in 2023, created a charitable fund and committed $1 million to local communities affected by the wildfires. The bank will establish an advisory board comprised of business and civic leaders to ensure that funds are directed to those impacted by the fires. \u201cWe are creating this fund in part because of our unique position in the community and because of the significant outpouring of inquiries we have received from those across our country wanting to help Los Angeles,\u201d said Jared Wolff, chief executive of Banc of California, in a statement.\n\nPasadena-based East West Bank contributed $250,000 through its East West Bank Foundation to the Pasadena Community Foundation\u2019s Eaton Fire Fund. It reported minimal direct losses from the fires and has made support of the small number of customers and employees who were affected a priority. For customers, it activated a \u201cSkip-a-Pay\u201d program, which has been used in past disasters that allows homeowners to delay mortgage payments. Employees created a relief fund, and the bank matched their contributions to help them through this difficult time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a long-time resident, I\u2019ve witnessed the resilience and spirit of our Pasadena community in the face of challenges,\u201d said Dominic Ng, chairman and chief executive of East West Bank, in a statement.\n\nEast West Bank contributed an additional $100,000 to the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles. It has ties to the arts community and reached out to museums, foundations and arts supporters to help establish the LA Arts Community Fire Relief Fund, which received pledges of $12 million.\n\nOther regional banks that announced contributions include CBTC Bank, which contributed $300,000 to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.\u2019s small business recovery efforts. Preferred Bank donated $250,000 split among Tzu Chi USA, Pasadena Community Foundation, Alliance for a Better Community and the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation. It also matched employee donations for wildfire relief above its corporate contribution. Bank of Hope contributed $100,000 to United Way of Greater Los Angeles Wildfire Relief Fund, California Bank & Trust spread a $100,000 donation across several organizations and Western Alliance Bancorp made a $100,000 contribution to the American Red Cross.\n\nCredit unions, which typically have membership requirements that closely align to a geographic region or a large local employer, have also made significant contributions towards wildfire relief.\n\nTustin-based SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union headquartered in Southern California with $31.9 billion in assets, announced donations of more than $220,000 to local organizations. The credit union identified more than 20,000 members who may have been impacted by the fires. It has provided goodwill funds, emergency relief personal loans, skips or deferments on loan and credit card payments, waived fees and other lending assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have been with our members through these types of devastating situations too many times. Through these experiences, we have learned that the best way to be there for them is by working with each member one-on-one to offer support tailored to their unique needs,\u201d said Bill Cheney, chief executive officer of SchoolsFirst FCU, in a statement.\n\nExecutive Moves\n\nLos Angeles-based RBB Bancorp, the parent company of Royal Business Bank, announced a change in the company\u2019s leadership, effective May 22. Johnny Lee, who previously served as president and chief banking officer, will become chief executive when current chief executive David Morris retires. He previously worked at Pasadena-based East West Bank from 2021 to 2023 before joining Royal Business Bank and has more than 35 years of banking experience. Royal Business Bank operates locations in Southern California, New York City, Chicago and Honolulu.\n\nFarmers Insurance Federal Credit Union, a $1.4-billion credit union headquartered in Burbank, named Mirella Reznic as chief executive and president, effective February 3. Prior chief executive Laura Campbell retired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMirella\u2019s selection comes after a rigorous and thoughtful process of assessing and interviewing numerous, highly qualified and impressive internal and external candidates,\u201d said Rudy Trevino, Farmers Insurance FCU board chairman, in a statement.\n\n",

            "content": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Impact on 10-Year Bond Yields\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent's relentless focus on reducing 10-year bond yields is reshaping Wall Street's expectations. In a recent report, it was highlighted how Bessent's strategies have led major financial institutions like Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, and Societe Generale to revise their yield forecasts downward for 2025. Bessent's approach includes limiting the size of 10-year debt auctions and advocating for looser bank regulations to increase bond demand.\n\nAccording to data from the IndexBox platform, the current economic environment, influenced by President Donald Trump's trade policies, has also contributed to a shift in investor behavior, driving them towards the safety of bonds. This has resulted in a significant decrease in yields, with the 10-year yield dropping by half a percentage point over the past two months.\n\nGuneet Dhingra, head of US interest rates strategy at BNP Paribas SA, noted that the bond market's traditional stance of \"don't fight the Fed\" is evolving into \"don't fight the Treasury.\" This sentiment is echoed by Subadra Rajappa of Societe Generale, who adjusted her year-end forecast for the 10-year yield to 3.75%, citing the administration's focus on debt and deficit reduction.\n\nBessent's actions, including maintaining the current levels of long-term debt sales and reviewing the Federal Reserve's supplementary leverage ratio, have reinforced his commitment to keeping yields low. Blake Gwinn of RBC Capital Markets also adjusted his forecast, acknowledging the dual impact of Trump's tariffs and Bessent's yield-lowering efforts.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Public Bank East Bay Co-Chair Jennifer Esteen and CEO Scott Waite posed for photos with the Richmond City Council in September 2023.\n\nAs Richmond pursues legal action against JPMorgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Canada over allegedly predatory financial deals, city officials appear to be doubling down on their support for Public Bank East Bay, a locally controlled financial institution they say will empower communities and prevent future exploitation.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed last week, accuses the banks and former financial advisors of engaging in illegal derivative contracts that cost the city tens of millions of dollars. City leaders argue that the alleged misconduct underscores the need for public banking as an alternative to Wall Street institutions.\n\nIn a statement about the lawsuit, Councilmember Claudia Jimenez said Richmond must have its own financial institutions and not depend on big banks that take advantage of small cities.\n\n\u201cI am committed to holding large entities like corporations and banks accountable so that we have the resources to invest in services that our community needs and deserves,\" Jimenez said.\n\nJimenez said she was proud to have led the charge during her first term in 2021 to analyze the city\u2019s budget, identify costly swap agreements implemented by previous city councils, and get the city out of these contracts.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, we saved Richmond an estimated $84 million over the next 12 years. We\u2019ve also turned things around by refinancing some of the city\u2019s debt, which has saved us millions and even improved our credit rating,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nAccording to a press release from the mayor's office, Richmond is projected to save $84 million through 2034.\n\nHowever, according to the Estimated Citywide Impact from the POB table, the city will face higher payments totaling $119 million from 2035 to 2044 due to the restructured debt schedule.\n\nThe city\u2019s municipal advisors indicate the city\u2019s recent pension debt restructuring is projected to generate significant short-term savings while shifting some costs into the future. The plan eliminates interest rate swaps tied to the 2005 Pension Obligation Bonds and restructures the debt to align with Richmond\u2019s existing pension liabilities. As part of the agreement, the city made a one-time $22 million payment to terminate the swap contract with the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nFinancial projections estimate $84 million in savings through 2034, offset by higher payments totaling $119 million from 2035 to 2044. However, advisors say a discounted cash flow analysis \u2014 which accounts for the time value of money \u2014suggests a positive present value impact of over $10 million, making the restructuring financially beneficial for the city in the long run.\n\nCity officials say the restructuring is part of a broader effort to strengthen the city\u2019s long-term financial health while maintaining flexibility for future investments. One such initiative is Public Bank East Bay, a nonprofit municipal bank backed by Richmond, Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda County, which aims to support local economic development.\n\nPublic Bank East Bay, a nonprofit municipal bank founded by Richmond, Oakland, and Berkeley, aims to invest in local affordable housing, small businesses, and renewable energy initiatives. Unlike traditional banks, it will not take consumer deposits but instead work with community credit unions and financial institutions to distribute funds.\n\nThe initiative gained momentum when the California Public Banking Act, signed into law in 2019, allowed cities and counties to establish their own financial institutions. Richmond\u2019s commitment to the effort was reinforced when city officials welcomed Public Bank East Bay\u2019s newly appointed CEO, Scott Waite, a Richmond native with three decades of credit union experience.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous vision behind this initiative,\u201d Waite told the council in 2023. \u201cWe are now on the cusp of finalizing key regulatory steps to make it a reality.\u201d\n\nJimenez posted a photo on social media with Oscar Perry Abello, author of The Banks We Deserve \u2013 Reclaiming Community Banks for a Just Economy.\n\n\u201cWe had an inspiring discussion about the critical role of public banks in fostering resilient economies,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cPublic banks can support small businesses, drive local economic growth, and keep wealth circulating within our communities. It\u2019s time for our city to rethink how we finance our futures and create sustainable systems that work for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn January, Mayor Eduardo Martinez joined representatives from Public Bank East Bay in Oakland to strategize to fund the bank\u2019s launch and ensure its long-term sustainability.\n\nImage/ Public Bank East Bay\n\nThe event focused on strategies to fund the bank\u2019s launch and ensure its long-term sustainability. Discussions emphasized the need for local, resilient institutions that protect communities and uphold shared values. Public Bank East Bay said attendees explored partnerships with housing advocates, labor unions, and economic justice groups to align efforts and strengthen support.\n\nIf you are not a subscriber, please consider supporting local journalism with a Grandview Independent subscription.

To help themselves get there, 49% of all respondents invested during 2024, including 49% of Gen X and 46% of Millennials.\n\nAt the same time, almost half (48%) of all respondents agreed their key investing concern is market volatility and investment performance \u2013 with 54% of Millennials and 46% of Gen X sharing these same worries.\n\n\"We're having conversations with investors who have a lot of questions amidst all the uncertainty right now. While it can be difficult to provide clear answers, our advisors have experienced decades of supporting clients during market ups and downs and one thing remains constant: the value of having \u2013 and sticking to \u2013 a good financial plan with a long-term approach, to help get through any periods of turmoil,\" advised Craig Bannon, Director, Regional Financial Planning Support, RBC.\n\nThe poll findings also indicated that just over half (51%) of Canadians now have a financial plan (formal or informal). This includes 50% of Millennials and 44% of Gen X, who responded that having this plan made them feel 'confident' (42% and 38% respectively) and 'reassured' (30% and 35%).\n\n\"It's hard to put a value on the confidence and reassurance that financial plans are bringing to Canadians right now \u2013 especially when those plans are supported by the expertise of an advisor,\" noted Bannon. \"A good financial plan maps out an investment strategy for you to follow. An advisor can help you stay true to your strategy, muting market noise and discussing any financial worries you may have, so you can remain focused on what truly matters: the financial goals you ultimately want your investments to achieve.\"\n\nA conversation with an advisor can also be helpful for anyone who has available funds they have not yet invested \u2013 including any cash deposits they made to meet contribution deadlines for RRSP and TFSA accounts.\n\n\"If you have money that is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the ideal moment to invest, you could be missing out on opportunities to get the growth you're hoping for,\" added Bannon. \"This is where time in the market, rather than timing the market, is important. The sooner you can invest and the longer you can be invested, the greater the opportunities to benefit from the gradual growth that markets and economies can experience over the long term.\"\n\nRBC advice and resources: Anyone can freely access RBC's comprehensive My Money Matters online advice and resources hub.

Data was collected between October 4 to 11, 2024. Quota sampling and weighting was employed in order to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the actual population of Canadians, according to Census data. The precision of online polls is measured using credibility interval. In this case, the results are accurate to within \u00b1 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of adults in Canada been surveyed. Credibility intervals will be wider for smaller subsets of the population. Where appropriate, attitudes and opinions are tracked back to previous years' polls. Angus Reid Forum. For comparison purposes only, a sample of this size would yield a margin of error of \u00b1 2.5 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.\n\nAbout RBC and our unique MyAdvisor personalized planning support\n\nMyAdvisor \u2013 a digital advice platform only available at RBC \u2013 has now connected 4.7 million Canadians to their personalized plan and the ability to adjust those plans in real time.

            "content": "TLDR Market volatility can cause investors stress, and understandably so, as the markets make dramatic moves in response to current events. However, in many cases, the best reaction is no reaction\u2014research shows that investors who stick to their long-term plans tend to fare better. Maintaining discipline, diversifying and rebalancing your portfolio, using time to your advantage and continuing to invest can all help mitigate the impact of a volatile market. Understanding more about your reactions to market moves can also help.\n\nWhile market volatility is an expected part of investing, dramatic market shifts can certainly lead to some sleepless nights. Geopolitical events, inflationary pressures, and economic news can all cause financial markets to swing, sometimes significantly.\n\nFor investors, the urge to react is strong\u2014and understandably so. Yet, history shows time and again that you\u2019re more likely to achieve your long-term investment goals if you have a plan and stick with it. This means weathering market fluctuations and playing the long game, even during uncertain times.\n\nThough it can be challenging, staying the course is critical. Veering from a carefully thought-out plan can negatively impact your portfolio\u2019s long-term performance and progress toward your financial goals.\n\nWhat is volatility?\n\nVolatility is defined as the price movement of an investment. The more the price changes, the greater the volatility. All investments include some level of volatility, though it varies by asset class. For instance, cash is typically less volatile than equities, which experience more frequent and wide-ranging swings. Some of the most volatile asset classes include cryptocurrency, commodities and real estate.\n\nWhat does a highly volatile market look like?\n\nAs previously noted, markets may go through periods of volatility in response to geopolitical, economic or other events. A highly volatile market is characterized by:\n\nErratic market movements. Equity markets may be hitting record highs and lows within short time periods.\n\nHard-to-predict price changes. Individual equities may also reach new highs and lows, and stocks may be trading far outside their typical price range.\n\nA high volume of trading activity. In volatile markets, investors buy and sell at high rates, and there\u2019s often an imbalance of trade orders, ultimately impacting prices.\n\nHow can market volatility impact your investments?\n\nGenerally, the more volatile the market conditions, the more risk investors face. A volatile market can increase the potential of portfolio losses, especially if you\u2019re heavily invested in impacted equities or sectors. It can also increase your downside risk as portfolio allocations shift with the swinging market. That said, some investors can find opportunities in volatile markets, such as buying equities at lower prices.\n\nStrategies to manage your investments in a volatile market\n\nHere are five strategies to help you mitigate the effects of a volatile market and feel more confident about reaching your long-term goals.\n\n1. Maintain discipline\n\nMaking significant portfolio changes, such as moving in and out of the markets in response to global or economic events, can have a negative impact on achieving your financial goals. The old investment adage: Time in the market is more important than timing the market is especially applicable in periods of high volatility. Because it\u2019s impossible to \u201ctime the market\u201d (know the best time to buy or sell an investment), staying invested can help smooth the impact of a rough market. Learn more about why it\u2019s best to stay invested.\n\n2. Diversify your portfolio\n\nDiversification, where you hold a mix of investments, has long been considered the golden rule of investing. It remains key to helping you navigate market swings and reduce your overall risk. Learn why it\u2019s essential to spread your investments across different asset classes and even regions.\n\n3. Regularly rebalance\n\nMarket swings \u2013 even smaller ones \u2013 can often cause a shift in the mix of investments you hold in your portfolio (also known as portfolio drift). This can lead to a different mix of investments than you originally intended. For example, if 40 per cent of your portfolio is invested in equities that grow by 10 per cent each year, that changes the overall mix of your portfolio. It will a higher proportion invested in equities, which may not align with your broader approach.\n\nIf you are a self-directed investor, at RBC Direct Investing, for example, you probably keep an eye on drift within your portfolio. At RBC InvestEase, portfolios are automatically rebalanced. Learn more about the impact of portfolio drift or book an appointment with MyAdvisor or RBC Online Banking to discuss the rebalancing process.\n\n4. Use time to your advantage\n\nOne investing rule of thumb is to start as early as possible. That\u2019s because time is one of the most powerful elements in your investment plan.\n\nThe above example is for illustrative purposes only and not indicative of any investment. Account value in this example assumes a 4% annual return. Source: RBC Global Asset Management Inc.\n\nLearn about the power of compounding and how regular savings can really add up.\n\n5. Invest regularly\n\nInvesting a fixed amount on a regular basis helps keep your investment plan on track through all types of market conditions. See the example below to get a sense of how regular investments can add up over time.\n\nAssumes a 5% Annualized rate of return. Source: RBC Global Asset Management Inc. The rate of return is used only to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and is not intended to reflect future values of the mutual fund or returns on investment in the mutual fund.\n\nLearn more about how dollar-cost averaging works and why it\u2019s important to pay yourself first.\n\nHow to keep emotions in check during market volatility\n\nA volatile market can lead to heightened emotions. But you don\u2019t want to let fear\u2014or, conversely, excitement\u2014drive short-term decisions that are misaligned with your long-term goals. To ensure that your feelings don\u2019t impact your investments, consider:\n\nSticking to your long-term plan. Stay the course, even when the waters get choppy, and trust that the plan you decided on is still the right path.\n\nChecking how often you look at your portfolio. If frequent updates are causing you stress, consider reducing how frequently you check your portfolio so you\u2019re not caught up in short-term market moves.\n\nUnderstand feelings about losses. The concept of loss aversion states that experiencing losses hurts more than experiencing gains of an equal value. Remember this context as you navigate near-term uncertainty.\n\nMarket volatility can make for a bumpy ride in the short term. But by keeping your long-term strategy in mind, you can avoid reactive decisions and stay focused on your future. Have additional questions about market volatility?

            "content": "RICHMOND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On March 17, 2025, the City of Richmond filed a lawsuit against two major investment banks, JP Morgan Chase and Royal Bank of Canada, as well as against the city\u2019s former financial advisors, Public Resources Advisory Group and The Majors Group. The lawsuit seeks to recover at least $60 million in payments made on derivative contracts that did not comply with California law. The derivatives provided no benefit to the public and diverted critical city resources away from essential services.\n\n\"For the banks, the tens of millions of dollars that Richmond paid on these derivatives amounted to money for nothing,\" said Vice Mayor and City Councilperson Claudia Jimenez. \"Meanwhile, our residents have had to endure higher taxes and reduced public services.\" Mayor Eduardo Martinez said, \u201cWe want JP Morgan Chase and RBC to make the City whole by paying back the money they took from the City in illegal payments.\u201d\n\nThe City asserts that the banks promoted complex, arcane financial products under the guise of saving money. In fact, the transactions were costly and illegal under California law.\n\nCalifornia law strictly limits the conditions under which cities may enter derivatives. The law only allows derivatives for specific purposes and requires the derivatives be connected to highly rated bonds. The derivatives did not meet those requirements. The City seeks to enforce California\u2019s clear legal requirements governing municipal contracts.\n\nGary Gotto of Keller Rohrback, attorney for the City, said, \"California law is clear: a city's contract is void if it did not comply with statutory requirements. The recipient of money paid under a void contract is obligated to return the payments.\u201d\n\nIn its suit, the City notes that the legal requirements at issue exist to protect public funds\u2014not the parties to government contracts. Brad Miller, another of the City\u2019s attorneys, said, \u201cThe laws are there to protect the public interest. The legal requirements are designed to prevent waste and the improper use of public funds, and to ensure transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\nThe City asserts that the payments made under on the derivatives greatly worsened its already challenging financial condition and led credit rating agencies to downgrade the City\u2019s credit. The credit downgrades made additional funding even more difficult and expensive.\n\nThe City of Richmond remains committed to protecting taxpayer dollars and ensuring financial accountability.\n\nThe attorneys for the City of Richmond are Gary Gotto and Matt Melamed of Keller Rohrback L.L.P., and R. Bradley Miller of R. Bradley Miller Law. The City is also represented by the City Attorney Dave Aleshire and Floy Andrews of Aleshire & Wynder, L.L.P.\n\nAbout Keller Rohrback L.L.P.\n\nKeller Rohrback\u2019s Complex Litigation Group has a national reputation as the go-to plaintiffs\u2019 firm for large-scale, complex individual and class action cases.

Through shareholder resolutions and an open letter, these investors are calling on banks to hang tight to their emission targets and plans, increase their energy transparency, improve board governance and discontinue anti-climate lobbying.\n\nThe three groups are the Shareholder Association for Research and Education (SHARE), Investors for Paris Compliance (I4PC) and the Trottier Family Foundation. They are part of an increasingly vocal portion of shareholders who believe that the Trump administration in the United States is worsening an already calamitous state of global warming, a situation that will \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 dictate a massive transition in how energy systems around the world are financed.\n\nCanadian banks are poised to play a big role in this transition. With their deep ties to the oil and gas industry, the country\u2019s banks are among the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel funders through loans, investments and financial dealmaking. In a report last year, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) was ranked the seventh-largest bank on fossil fuel financing between 2016 and 2023, while Scotiabank ranked 11th.\n\n\u201cBanks have tremendous power to either maintain the status quo or actively and intentionally steward our country towards the new economy,\u201d says \u00c9ric St-Pierre, executive director of the Trottier Family Foundation. \u201cThe power is in their hands, and they could really embrace funding the new economy that is moving toward renewables and the cleantech sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternationally, we see an energy transition that is happening regardless of politics,\u201d says Amanda Carr, associate director of SHARE. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic transition that is in play and very exciting. We want to understand how the banks that we invest in are seizing those opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs banks backslide, shareholders band together\n\nThe campaigns come only weeks after two major global banks \u2013 Wells Fargo and HSBC \u2013 rolled back their net-zero emission targets. In February, Wells Fargo became the first major bank to abandon its goal to bring financed emissions to net-zero by 2050. HSBC, which had previously committed to a very ambitious goal of reaching net-zero in all its business by 2030, announced it would push back its net-zero target to 2050.\n\nThe rollbacks follow a move over the last few months by all major U.S. and Canadian banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the global net-zero banking coalition.\n\nThe banking sector should be identifying those new opportunities that bring us toward the transition to a cleaner economy. The Canadian banks could really set the bar here. \u2013 \u00c9ric St-Pierre, Executive Director, Trottier Family Foundation\n\nIn February, the Trottier Family Foundation published an open letter to the banks signed by 34 pension funds, endowments, family offices and foundations representing more than $53 billion in assets. The signatories call on the banks to uphold their 2050 net-zero commitments, adopt short-term science-based targets and ensure transparent annual reporting on climate targets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite concerned that a lot of the Canadian banks have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance,\u201d St-Pierre says in an interview. He hopes the letter \u201csends a signal that the 34 of us are bank clients and we have significant assets, so we would ask to be taken seriously by the banks.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the letter, a spokesperson for the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) issued a statement that the sector \u201cunderstands the important role it can play in facilitating an orderly transition to a lower-carbon economy, supporting collaborative approaches between the public and private sectors.\u201d Notably, the issue of climate commitments or 2030 targets is absent from the CBA statement. \u201cCanadian banks remain committed to strategically supporting clients in their transition efforts. They will continue to implement and report on their own climate strategies and plans, integrating internal capabilities to adhere to relevant international standards.\u201d\n\nA crucial metric for bank accountability\n\nIn a separate campaign, SHARE, PFA Pension \u2013 the largest pension fund in Denmark \u2013 and other investors have filed shareholder proposals with four of Canada\u2019s biggest banks: Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal, CIBC and Toronto-Dominion, urging them to adopt a key metric recognized as a crucial indicator of net-zero progress in the financial industry.\n\nCalled the energy finance (or energy supply) ratio, the metric compares the volume of low-carbon and fossil fuel financing. Developed by the new energy finance division at Bloomberg (BloombergNEF), the ratio illustrates an institution\u2019s level of low-carbon energy financing compared with its fossil fuel financing. Bloomberg has established that the ratio can include some financing of oil and gas but needs to be at least 4:1 low-carbon to fossil fuel worldwide by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting to note is that the [target] ratio is four to one, not four to zero,\u201d SHARE\u2019s Carr says. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing something that is extreme from the BloombergNEF team.\u201d\n\nIn a recent report, Bloomberg estimates that the energy finance ratio in the global banking sector stood at 0.89:1 in 2023, less than a quarter of what it needs to be to maintain 1.5\u00b0C of global warming.\n\nShareholder advocates gain ground\n\nShareholder pressure has generated some success. RBC is one of three banks (the others are Citi and JP Morgan) that are expected to start reporting their energy financing ratios in 2025 as a result of investor proposals last year. As well, this year\u2019s proposal from SHARE has prompted Scotiabank to start reporting the ratio in 2026.\n\nCarr says that the ratio helps investors understand how well individual banks are performing on energy finance and provides a good management tool on the climate transition. \u201cWhat the ratio allows us to do is to compare banks, regardless of size, and it also allows a bank to determine its own destiny.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nMost Canadian pension funds recognize the urgency of climate change. Some really don\u2019t.\n\nCanadian investors stand firm on ESG despite \u2018greenhushing\u2019 trend, report finds\n\nFinance leader warns that Canada is losing the race for a sustainable economy\n\nShareholder advocacy group I4PC is using investor resolutions to push TD Bank to embed net-zero governance at the bank\u2019s board of directors and Bank of Montreal (BMO) to disclose its support for industry associations lobbying against pro-climate policy.\n\nAs a result of I4PC pressure, TD has agreed to review board governance policies and director selection criteria to ensure that the board is accountable and competent on key risks and priorities, including net-zero issues. I4PC has also filed a resolution with BMO calling on the bank to disclose its support for associations such as the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which is lobbying against policies such as a cap on carbon emissions.\n\nA shift toward renewables at National Bank\n\nThe banking sector has pushed back in recent years on the idea that it can lead the energy and climate transition, arguing that it also needs to continue financing fossil fuel energy. Julian Wentzel, chief sustainability officer at HSBC, recently said it\u2019s time to end the \u201cnegative bias\u201d toward fossil fuels.\n\nBut St-Pierre points to National Bank as an example of a relatively small institution that is showing leadership on at least one important climate measure, the commitment to renewable energy financing. In its most recent climate report, National Bank says it has tripled its renewable-energy lending to $15 billion from $5 billion in 2019 and is aiming to bring this to $20 billion by 2030.\n\nNational\u2019s renewable-energy commitment is larger than that of RBC ($15 billion by 2030), a bank that is more than four times bigger (although RBC is expected to publish its annual climate report shortly that may update this commitment).\n\nSt-Pierre says there could be a push by banks to expand fossil fuel financing as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have raised interest in a new national energy pipeline. But that would ignore other energy opportunities such as expansion of the national electricity grids and government clean energy procurement, he says. \u201cThe banking sector should be identifying those new opportunities that bring us toward the transition to a cleaner economy. The Canadian banks could really set the bar here.\u201d\n\nEugene Ellmen writes on sustainable business and finance.

            "content": "TLDR Given the complexities of many supply chains, measuring Scope 3 emissions could be one of the biggest disclosure requirements for corporate emissions reporting. One way suppliers can start to collect data on their emissions is by using a carbon management tool, which can help to manage data collection and track the impact of business operations. Automating emissions data collection can save hours of reaching out to energy suppliers, following up on incorrect data, and entering data manually into spreadsheets.\n\nProviding your team with tools and resources can upskill your employees and build competence around carbon management.\n\nWith a complete view of your company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, it could be easier to pinpoint high-intensity areas and opportunities for \u201cquick wins\u201d to reduce your emissions profile.\n\nSupply chain regulation is becoming a major data challenge for corporations and the companies that supply them. According to proprietary analysis by Carbonhound and MaRS Discovery District, by 2028, almost 100,000 companies worldwide will be required to provide detailed disclosures on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns of their global supply chains.\n\nSupply chain emissions fall under a company\u2019s Scope 3 emissions. Given the complexities of many supply chains, it could be one of the biggest, and perhaps most challenging, disclosure requirements for corporate emissions reporting.\n\nThe challenge of data management across the supply chain\n\nWhether or not your company is directly or indirectly required to report on its emissions impact depends on several factors, which could include the locations of your operations, supply chain, or commercial markets. For example, companies that export goods to the European Union must be ready to report on their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be compliant with the EU\u2019s incoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism tax structure. Beyond regulatory compliance, a company may wish to voluntarily disclose its emissions data as part of its environmental sustainability strategy, risk management process, or operations management.\n\nA lot of the time, companies don\u2019t have direct access to their supply chain data. Instead, this data lies with suppliers\u2014and it is to these suppliers that companies will start to turn. One way suppliers can start to collect data on their GHG emissions is by using a carbon management tool, which can help to automate data collection and track the impact of business operations.\n\nCarbonhound is a Toronto-based climate action platform that helps companies to do just this. We spoke to Sanders Lazier, Carbonhound\u2019s co-founder and CEO, about how they help suppliers meet customer data requests, and work towards environmental sustainability goals by measuring, reporting and acting on their carbon emissions.\n\nAutomate emissions data collection and upskill employees\n\n\u201cWhen companies first approach us, we want to understand their why,\u201d says Lazier. Knowing the underlying driver for a company\u2019s focus on carbon data can help shape a data collection and reporting process that leads to a measurable commercial outcome.\n\nCarbonhound estimates that there are approximately 4 million suppliers serving larger companies, and they can often struggle with emissions data requests. These suppliers, ranging in size from 30 to 5,000 employees, typically lack the budget for external consultants or a dedicated ESG team. Instead, team members in non-sustainability roles are often enlisted to handle the task.\n\nAutomating emissions data collection is a critical step that can save hours of reaching out to energy suppliers; following up on incorrect, missing or confusing data; and entering data manually into spreadsheets.\n\nCarbon management tools can provide customized dashboards to help verify your data collection: \u201cAutomation also improves the integrity of your final calculation because all work undergoes quality assurance by the platform,\u201d Lazier explains.\n\n\u201cData integrity requires transparency,\u201d says Lazier. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust the data you\u2019re getting about your own [emissions] footprint, your customers can\u2019t trust it either.\u201d\n\nProviding your team with tools and resources to help them measure and manage your company\u2019s emissions can make them key players in the process, too. By developing in-house expertise, you can upskill your employees and build competence around carbon management, enabling them to make educated decisions and recommendations to improve efficiencies and reduce your company\u2019s emissions profile.\n\nOpportunities to optimize your business\u2019s operations\n\nLazier says that while Carbonhound finds most customers start with an immediate need to measure their carbon emissions to comply with customer reporting demands, companies can use their data to inform and drive efficiencies. With a complete view of your company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, it could be easier to pinpoint high-intensity areas and opportunities for \u201cquick wins\u201d to reduce your energy usage.\n\nFor example, one of Carbonhound\u2019s customers learned that its electricity and natural gas use was a major contributor to its environmental impact. The company cut electricity and natural gas use by 10%, which generated significant cost savings. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be complicated,\u201d says Lazier. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen companies save money and emissions just by turning off machines at the end of every shift.\u201d\n\nSeeing environmental sustainability efforts generate a financial return relatively quickly could also be an effective way to bring leadership teams on board.\n\nAnother way to tap more value from your reduced carbon emissions is to integrate carbon data into sales, marketing and customer relationships. For example, one of Carbonhound\u2019s customers includes carbon emissions data in every report it sends to customers, letting them know the quantity of emissions reduced on a customer\u2019s behalf.\n\nIdentify climate-related risks to your business\n\nAlthough it can be a single customer with a data request that kickstarts carbon management for many suppliers, climate change is also a growing business risk. In addition to using your company\u2019s emissions data to decarbonize your operations, these insights could help to identify potential physical risk drivers\u2014such as extreme weather events and chronic changes to the climate\u2014or transitional changes that may have industry-wide impacts, such as changes to government policies, technology, pricing, and investor preferences.\n\nCollaborating to help collect carbon emissions data\n\nIf you\u2019re facing requests for carbon data, with the assistance of carbon management tools, you don\u2019t need to navigate the journey alone. \u201cOur customers appreciate that they no longer feel as if they\u2019re on an island,\u201d Lazier says.\n\nTo support clients on their journey to a low-carbon economy, RBC has collaborated with Carbonhound.

            "content": "Most residents in the Prairies are finding it harder than ever to spot fraud, according to a new poll by the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nThe financial institution found 92 per cent of Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents reported increased scam attempts and found it hard to protect themselves.\n\nThe poll further revealed that for 93 per cent, it has become harder to recognize and prevent fraud. That\u2019s seven percentage points above the national average.\n\nRBC fraud strategy senior director Davide Manzo says fraud not only results in monetary losses but also causes emotional distress, embarrassment and lasting financial consequences. (Submitted)\n\nIt also found fraud attempts in the region frequently involve phishing, smishing (fraudulent text messages) and spear phishing, which specifically targets employees with financial authority. The poll also indicated a rise in scams aimed at seniors, as well as deepfake scams.\n\nThose polled stated fraudsters commonly impersonate trusted organizations or individuals, create a sense of urgency and pressure victims into revealing confidential information or transferring money.\n\nNationally, virtually all respondents (98 per cent) have seen more targeted and sophisticated scams, with nearly nine out of 10 (89 per cent) noting a rise in scam attempts more than ever before (up from 77 per cent in 2023).\n\nIn addition, the majority (86 per cent) of respondents believe it is getting harder to recognize scams and protect themselves, two-thirds are feeling tired of always having to be on the alert and one-third admit to letting their guard down.\n\nIn times of financial uncertainty, individuals may be more vulnerable to investment scams and other fraudulent schemes as they search for financial security, RBC fraud strategy senior director Davide Manzo told the Sun.\n\n\u201cFraud not only results in monetary losses but also causes emotional distress, embarrassment and lasting financial consequences,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cFor seniors, losing savings to fraud can disrupt financial plans for retirement and inheritance, while younger victims may struggle to recover, setting them back financially for years.\u201d\n\nHe explained it is critical for everyone to always be on guard, adding one can only identify red flags when they take the time to think.\n\n\u201cDouble-check the source of a message before acting. If it\u2019s an unexpected offer that sounds too good to be true, it\u2019s likely a scam.\u201d\n\nWith the increase in volume and sophistication of scams, it\u2019s understandable that Canadians are finding it challenging to always have their guard up when it comes to fraud, RBC fraud management vice-president Vanja Gorazi said.\n\n\u201cCriminals are using the latest technology to gather information, build trust, create urgency and prey on people\u2019s needs and fears,\u201d Gorazi said. \u201cThis has led to a wave of investment, romance, senior and other scams. It has never been more important to stay alert.\u201d\n\nRegarding fraud prevention measures, he said for the most part, multi-factor authentication and other security features are offered by many institutions.\n\n\u201cWhile it may seem like a nuisance, it is there for your protection. I encourage everyone to make use of those protections as they are available.\u201d\n\nManzo emphasizes the importance of awareness and caution, adding banks will never request personal information through unsolicited messages or ask clients to transfer money for security purposes.\n\nThe financial impact of fraud remains significant. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, Canadians lost $638 million to fraud in 2024, although experts believe the actual figure is much higher due to underreporting. On a global scale, the Global Anti-Scam Alliance estimates losses exceeding $1 trillion. Fraud continues to be a major concern for Canadians, with many struggling to keep pace with increasingly complex scams.\n\nManzo explained the poll, conducted annually as part of Fraud Prevention Month in March, reflects ongoing concerns about fraud and its evolving nature. According to him, last year\u2019s survey focused on fears surrounding AI-generated fraud, whereas this year\u2019s findings highlight the increasing difficulty Canadians face in spotting scams.\n\n\u201cAs fraudsters refine their tactics, vigilance and education remain key to reducing financial and emotional losses,\u201d he said.\n\nThe online poll was conducted by RBC from Jan. 17-22, with a total of 1,500 Canadians aged 18 years or older taking part.\n\nIt is deemed accurate within a margin of plus or minus 4.4 per cent. RBC stated the poll was balanced and weighted on age, gender, region and education, according to the latest census data, adding all respondents were members of the online Angus Reid Forum.\n\nRCMP spokesperson Sgt. Paul Manaigre did not respond to the Sun\u2019s email.\n\n\u00bb aodutola@brandonsun.com\n\n\u00bb X: @AbiolaOdutola",

Here\u2019s what\u2019s got us thinking this week.\n\nCanada is in for some rough economic waters ahead. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) now projects that Canadian real GDP will only grow by 1.5 percent in 2025 and 1.3 percent in 2026. The growth trajectory looks even worse for Ontario, where real GDP growth is projected to be a paltry 1.2 percent this year and next.\n\nThis is a sharp deterioration from what RBC was projecting last March. Just a year ago, the bank estimated that Canada\u2019s real GDP growth would be 2.2 percent, and Ontario\u2019s would be more than a full percentage point higher at 2.3 percent.\n\nWhile President Trump\u2019s trade war is certainly depressing Canada\u2019s economic growth outlook, the reality is that Canadians have been on economically shaky ground for several years. GDP per capita, a measure of average living standards, has been in decline for the past few quarters, our business investment has been low relative to our peers, and much of the country has been gripped by an affordability crisis.\n\nCanada can\u2019t control the actions of the U.S. president, but we can put our own economic house in order.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CEO Victor Dodig will retire Oct. 31, the bank announced Thursday .\n\n. Harry Culham, the bank\u2019s head of capital markets, asset management and enterprise strategy, will become CIBC\u2019s chief operating officer, effective April 1, and succeed Dodig as CEO on Nov. 1, the bank said .\n\n. Dodig will serve as a special adviser to Culham and CIBC\u2019s board from November until April 2026. His departure will leave Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Dave McKay as the longest-serving CEO at a Big Six Canadian bank. Dodig ascended to the top role in September 2014 ; McKay began leading RBC a month earlier .\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement caps the rise of Culham, who began at CIBC as a Vancouver-based intern in foreign exchange in 1989. He left CIBC at one point and rejoined in 2008, serving in Europe- and Asia-based roles before being named to lead the bank\u2019s capital-markets operation in 2015.\n\nCulham was seen as one of three candidates vying to succeed Dodig. The other two \u2013 U.S. CEO Shawn Beber and Hratch Panossian, who leads CIBC\u2019s Canadian retail banking \u2013 are expected to stay at the bank, according to The Globe and Mail.\n\nCIBC may have indicated Culham\u2019s front-runner status last year, when the bank added asset management and strategy responsibilities to his title. Culham also became head of CIBC\u2019s Caribbean division.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s approach to creating shareholder value through disciplined execution, prudent and risk-controlled growth, and a focus on clients are ideally suited to furthering CIBC\u2019s momentum,\u201d Kate Stevenson, the bank\u2019s board chair, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nAmong the most pressing challenges for CIBC\u2019s near term are geopolitical tensions between Canada and the U.S. The bank generates about 20% of its profit in the U.S. \u2013 up from less than 2% when Dodig began as CEO, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"People don't quite know how to plan,\" CIBC CFO Robert Sedran said last week, referencing clients and the potential threat of tariffs.\n\n\"Nobody's making plans for two, three, four weeks,\u201d Sedran said, according to American Banker. \u201cIt's a difficult environment in which they are trying to do that.\"\n\nIn terms of strategy, Culham emphasized \u201cconnectivity across the bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy around helping clients achieve their ambitions, and when you look out five or 10 years, the strategy won\u2019t be a whole lot different,\u201d Culham told The Globe and Mail.\n\nDodig on Thursday said \u201cthe time is right to hand the baton to Harry.\u201d\n\nDodig noted that he will turn 60 this year \u2013 a factor in the timing of his decision, he said.\n\n\u201cAt a personal level, by the end of this, it\u2019ll be more than 11 years,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the seat here as captain for over a decade, you don\u2019t cling on to the role.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really coming into our own in terms of what\u2019s been achieved,\u201d Dodig added.\n\nUnder Dodig, CIBC \u2013 Canada\u2019s fifth-largest bank \u2013 boosted its presence in U.S. commercial banking and wealth management with a $3.8 billion acquisition of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp in 2016.\n\nThe bank expanded its services to the masses, too \u2013 launching the Simplii Financial digital-banking platform in 2017 and acquiring Costco\u2019s Canadian credit-card business in 2021.\n\nThough CIBC\u2019s stock saw stumbles in 2023 over exposure to U.S. commercial real estate loans, the bank\u2019s share price jumped more than 50% in the 12 months preceding January, according to Bloomberg. Shares have dropped 12% since.\n\nLike Culham, Dodig had early-career experience with CIBC. While a student in 1985, Dodig worked at the bank as a teller in Toronto. Before returning to CIBC for good, Dodig worked as a management consultant for McKinsey, and served in managing director roles at Merrill Lynch and UBS, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nAnalysts at both RBC and Jefferies expressed surprise at the timing of CIBC\u2019s leadership transition.\n\nJefferies analyst John Aiken wrote he thought Dodig would \u201cstay in the role for a couple of more years in order to see his strategy through.\n\n\u201cWe see little risk in the transfer of control,\" Aiken wrote, calling Culham \u201can excellent fit.\"\n\nDodig\u2019s transition will be the second CEO changeover among Big Six Canadian banks this year. Raymond Chun became CEO at TD in February, when his predecessor Bharat Masrani\u2019s departure was accelerated after the bank took more than $3 billion in penalties last year as regulators found anti-money laundering deficiencies. TD also agreed to an asset cap of $434 billion on its U.S. retail operations.\n\nDodig received C$13.1 million ($9.1 million) in 2024, representing a 22.4% compensation bump over the previous year, CIBC disclosed last week. He\u2019ll retire from CIBC with a holding in the bank valued at C$50.7 million, according to The Globe and Mail.\n\nCIBC, by comparison, paid Culham C$10.3 million last year, up from C$8.4 million in 2023.",

            "content": "TD Bank stock\u2019s earnings and reputation have been hit. Yet, it trades at higher multiples than Royal Bank.\n\nThe resiliency of the Canadian banks continues to be tested. Most recently, tariff threats and posturing continue. This is threatening the economy and, of course, Canadian banks. Not surprisingly, Canada\u2019s two biggest banks, Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD) and Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY), have seen their stock prices suffer recently. So, which is the better buy today, TD Bank or Royal Bank stock?\n\nLet\u2019s explore.\n\nRoyal Bank stock: Coming off of all-time highs\n\nAs Canada\u2019s biggest bank, Royal Bank is outperforming on the heels of its 2024 acquisition of HSBC. In fact, in the bank\u2019s first quarter 2025 report, we got a glimpse of the strength of the business.\n\nNet income of $5.1 billion increased 43% versus last year, driven by the acquisition of HSBC as well as strength across all business segments. Adjusted net income of $5.3 billion increased 29% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.62 increased 27%.\n\nRising provisions for capital losses (PCLs) continued in the quarter, with the Royal Bank reporting PCLs of $1 billion, up 29% versus last year. Rising PCLs have been a concern for the whole banking system for quite some time, but the banks have been managing this well. Unfortunately, the new tariff wars might create pretty serious economic turmoil. This would pressure borrowers and send PCLs skyrocketing.\n\nSince the start of tariff threats, Royal Bank stock has been hit. In fact, the stock is down 10% since the end of January. This follows a very strong 2024 that saw Royal Bank stock hit new highs. In terms of valuation, the stock is trading at 13 times earnings, which is only slightly higher than its peer group.\n\nTD Bank stock: Money laundering scandal hit hard\n\nOn the other side of the coin, we have TD Bank. TD was long known as one of the top two Canadian banks, by size as well as by operational and financial performance. But last year, all of that changed.\n\nOn October 10th, U.S. regulators ordered TD Bank to pay a total of $3.1 billion in fines after the bank pled guilty in the money-laundering case that was brought against it. The bank\u2019s reputation was hit, and certain restrictions will impact future business.\n\nWhat followed was a fourth quarter in which earnings fell below analyst expectations. Also, TD\u2019s most recent quarter saw lacklustre EPS growth of a mere 1% to $2.02. Naturally, TD Bank stock has taken a hit from all of this. In fact, it\u2019s currently well below its 2022 highs.\n\nDespite this, TD Bank stock is trading at 18 times earnings, which is far above its peer group, which trades at 13.8 times. As I noted earlier, Royal Bank trades at 13 times. If we compare the results of the two banks, it\u2019s clear to see that Royal Bank is actually deserving of a higher multiple than TD.\n\nThe key thing to note here is that Royal Bank\u2019s stock has been hit due to macro factors, such as the tariff threat and the economic fallout. By contrast, TD Bank\u2019s troubles are company-specific, and that\u2019s a lot more concerning.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe risk in TD Bank remains high in my view. Essentially, the fallout from the money laundering scandal will likely affect TD\u2019s growth in the US. This is because the bank faces certain punitive regulatory restrictions.\n\nRoyal Bank on the other hand is excelling, and it\u2019s attractively valued. Therefore, I think that Royal Bank is the better stock to buy right now.",

            "content": "TLDR On March 12th, 2025, the Bank of Canada announced its seventh straight interest rate cut, reducing its policy interest rate by 25 bps to 2.75% A lower interest rate, combined with recent changes to mortgage rules, may bring more first-time home buyers to the spring market A First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is designed to help first-time home buyers invest towards a first home\n\nBank of Canada cuts its policy rate again\n\nIn the latest interest rate announcement, the Bank of Canada reduced its benchmark rate by 25 bps, marking its seventh straight rate reduction since June of 2024. Bringing the rate down to 2.75%, the cut is welcome news for Canadians looking to enter the housing market during the historically popular spring season \u2013 especially when combined with the new mortgage rules that took effect in December.\n\nHomeownership more accessible for first-time home buyers?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that many first-time homebuyers in Canada have felt shut out of the housing market for some time. But recent interest rate cuts and changes in mortgage rules have opened the door a little wider. Here\u2019s a quick recap of how these changes could make homes more affordable for new buyers:\n\n30-year amortizations on insured mortgages:\n\nThis change, now available to all first-time homebuyers, increases the mortgage term from 25 to 30 years, lowering the monthly mortgage payment amount.\n\nReduced down payment requirements for homes up to $1.5 million:\n\nThis change makes it easier for buyers to enter high-priced markets by allowing lower down payments on higher-priced homes.\n\nReduced interest rates:\n\nAt this time last year, the Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate was 5.00% \u2014 2.25 basis points higher than it is today. As a result, fixed and variable mortgage rates have also fallen, lowering borrowing costs for buyers.\n\nGetting serious about saving? How a First Home Savings Account can help\n\nA First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is a registered plan designed to help first-time homebuyers invest towards their first home. Contributions to the plan are tax deductible, while investment income earned within the plan is generally tax-free, which can help lower your tax bill. Plus, withdrawals made to purchase a first home are not taxable. The tax-efficient nature of the FHSA helps first-time buyers maximize their buying power.\n\nFHSA holders can contribute up to $8,000 per year over 15 years, up to a lifetime contribution limit of $40,000 towards their first down payment.\n\nWho can open an FHSA? A First Home Savings Account is available to Canadians at least 18 years of age (and no less than the age of majority in the province where you live). You must also be a resident of Canada and have a valid Social Insurance Number. And as the name suggests, you also need to be a first-time homebuyer. This means neither you nor your spouse or common-law partner can have owned a home (that you lived in) during the year you open the account or any of the previous four years. How to open an FHSA Many banks, credit unions, investment firms and online brokerages in Canada offer FHSAs. With RBC, you can open an FHSA online through RBC Direct Investing or RBC InvestEase1. You\u2019ll be asked to provide your ID, Social Insurance Number and other details about yourself to open the account. Investing in an FHSA Because the First Home Savings Account is a type of registered plan, you can hold investments in it \u2013 the same way you can invest in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). You can hold stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, options and certain GICs in your FHSA.\n\nThinking of withdrawing from your FHSA?\n\nReady to buy a home? You can withdraw from your TFSA at any time. For your withdrawal to be tax-free, there are some criteria to meet:\n\nBe a first-time homebuyer : You (and your spouse/partner) haven\u2019t owned a home (where you lived) during the year you withdraw or the previous four calendar years\n\nHave a written agreement : You need a signed agreement to buy or build your first home in Canada by October 1 of the year following the withdrawal\n\nIntend to move in within a year : The home must be your principal residence\n\nBe a resident of Canada: Throughout the period from the withdrawal to the acquisition of the house\n\nDreaming of buying your first home? With lower interest rates, improved mortgage rules, and new ways to invest \u2013 like the FHSA \u2013 that dream might be closer than ever.\n\nBuying your first home can be exciting, but it\u2019s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed. An RBC Mortgage Specialist can help you understand today\u2019s housing market and provide personalized advice that matches your goals and timeline. Get in touch and take the first step toward that dream home today.\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

            "content": "Written by Team Colitco\u2022 9:42 pm\u2022 Home Top Stories, Homepage, Top Stories, Top Story, Trending News, Uncategorized\n\nThe Royal Bank of Canada (TSX: RY) has initiated a wave of employee layoffs as part of a broader reorganization of its business units, marking a significant development in the aftermath of its $13.5-billion acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada.\n\nLayoffs Across Key Business Divisions\n\nSources familiar with the matter revealed that job cuts have affected several segments within RBC, including technology, operations, and personal and commercial banking. The restructuring move, though anticipated following the major acquisition, comes at a time when the bank is sharpening its focus on growth and integration, ahead of its upcoming Investor Day scheduled later this month.\n\nAlthough the exact number of affected employees has not been disclosed, the layoffs are understood to span multiple levels of the organization. Several roles at the vice-president, senior director, and director levels were reportedly impacted in what insiders describe as the final phase of the bank\u2019s internal restructuring efforts.\n\nPositioning for Future Growth\n\n\u201cThis is a necessary step in preparing RBC for its next phase of growth,\u201d said bank spokesperson Jeff Lanthier in a written statement. \u201cWe have expanded responsibilities, promoted key individuals, and created deeper connections across our platforms. However, we recognize that these changes have also resulted in some difficult decisions, which have led to certain colleagues leaving the bank.\u201d\n\nThe reshaping of roles began months ago, gradually cascading from senior executive tiers down to middle management. The integration of HSBC Canada, which was finalized in April 2024, has resulted in a degree of role redundancy and overlapping responsibilities. Several former HSBC employees, according to internal sources, are still navigating uncertainties around their job scopes within the merged entity.\n\nAlso Read: Massive Attack on X! Elon Musk\u2019s Chilling Message Leaves Experts Skeptical\n\nStructural Adjustments Already Underway\n\nIn August, RBC had already begun redefining its structure by separating its personal and commercial banking units \u2014 a decision aimed at bringing more clarity and strategic focus to each business line. The reorganization was seen as a precursor to broader structural adjustments and workforce alignment in preparation for a refreshed growth strategy.\n\nAs RBC prepares to unveil its updated strategic roadmap later this month, the layoffs have become a key point of discussion in the financial community. Analysts suggest that the bank\u2019s internal reshuffling reflects a broader industry trend, as financial institutions increasingly prioritize digital transformation, operational efficiency, and post-merger integration.\n\nExecutive Compensation Under Spotlight\n\nAdding to the attention surrounding the bank\u2019s internal changes, RBC recently published its annual proxy circular, revealing a substantial pay increase for its top executive. Chief Executive Officer Dave McKay received total compensation of $26 million in 2024, marking a 60 per cent jump from the previous year\u2019s $16.13 million. Notably, the package included a special stock grant valued at $4 million in recognition of the HSBC Canada acquisition and integration effort.\n\nSolid Financial Results Amid Restructuring\n\nRBC\u2019s financial results for 2024 have been strong, with net income rising 11 per cent year-over-year to $16.2 billion, bolstered by earnings contributions from the newly acquired HSBC operations and strength in capital markets. The bank\u2019s performance has largely met or exceeded analyst expectations, and investors are keen to see how the integration of HSBC Canada will continue to influence profitability in the coming quarters.\n\nNavigating Merger-Driven Challenges\n\nStill, the latest workforce reductions highlight the complex and often challenging nature of large-scale mergers, especially in highly regulated sectors such as banking. As RBC moves forward with its strategy, further adjustments across divisions may not be ruled out, although the current round of layoffs is widely believed to be the final major phase in the restructuring process.\n\nIndustry observers note that workforce transitions following large mergers are not uncommon and can often be accompanied by increased scrutiny of executive pay and internal communication practices. With RBC\u2019s Investor Day on the horizon, stakeholders will be closely watching how the bank positions itself for long-term growth, innovation, and shareholder value in an increasingly competitive financial landscape.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs the dust settles from the latest round of changes, RBC\u2019s leadership will be under pressure to demonstrate that the restructuring decisions \u2014 however painful \u2014 are pivotal to delivering sustainable growth and value in the post-HSBC acquisition era.\n\nVisited 508 times, 5 visit(s) today",

            "content": "It\u2019s too early to blame tariffs or any presumed Mark Carney bump.\n\nCompensation increases for CEOs at Canada\u2019s Big Six banks largely outpaced their peers in the U.S. for 2024.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay, for example, saw a 60.9% jump in compensation last year, compared with 2023. Much of that can be credited to a C$4 million special equity award connected to closing the bank\u2019s acquisition of HSBC\u2019s Canadian footprint last spring.\n\nAll in all, McKay received C$24,493,000 ($17 million) in 2024, according to RBC\u2019s proxy circular, published Thursday. That compares with C$15,221,000 ($10.5 million) a year earlier.\n\nBroken down, McKay saw a base salary of C$2 million \u2013 itself a raise over C$1.5 million in 2023; a short-term incentive of C$6,668,000; mid- and long-term incentives of C$11,825,000. The short-term figure was 67% higher than McKay\u2019s C$4 million target for 2024 because the bank\u2019s adjusted net income for the year exceeded its own target by C$700 million, RBC said.\n\nMcKay\u2019s special equity award is set to vest in December 2027 and is linked to strategic cost and earnings objectives throughout a three-year span. But the 60.9% compensation bump is nearly double, percentage-wise, the highest comparable increase by a CEO at a U.S.-based systemically important bank. Citi CEO Jane Fraser saw her compensation spike 33% to $34.5 million in 2024.\n\nIt could be argued that Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick\u2019s 2024 compensation jumped 41.7% over what he saw in 2023, minus the $20 million one-time incentive he and the bank\u2019s other two CEO candidates received that year. But if McKay\u2019s C$4 million incentive counts here, so does Pick\u2019s. (Counting that $20 million incentive, Pick\u2019s 2023 compensation jumps to more than $44 million, meaning his 2024 pay represents a 22.8% decrease.)\n\nCanada\u2019s largest bank isn\u2019t the only one giving a monster raise to its CEO. The smallest of Canada\u2019s Big Six \u2013 National Bank of Canada \u2013 gave its top executive, Laurent Ferreira, a 34.6% year-over-year compensation boost in 2024. Ferreira received C$11,425,050 ($7.9 million) last year, compared with C$8,490,036 in 2023, according to its proxy circular. National Bank\u2019s acquisition of Calgary-based Canadian Western Bank, announced last June and completed in February, played heavily in the compensation decision, along with Ferreira\u2019s \u201cindividual performance,\u201d the bank said.\n\nThe lesson, then \u2013 with an eye toward the RBC-HSBC transaction, too \u2013 might be: Want a big raise? Acquire a bank. So it stands to reason that Scotiabank, which acquired a 14.99% share of Cleveland-based KeyBank in 2024, also would have given its CEO, Scott Thomson, a heftier haul for the year.\n\nThomson received C$9,760,000 ($6.8 million) for 2024, according to the bank\u2019s proxy circular, released Friday. That marks a 26.6% jump over the C$7,707,808 he saw in 2023. He stands to receive a comparable bump in compensation in 2025 \u2013 nearly 21%, to C$11.5 million \u2013 if he hits the targets Scotia has set for him.\n\n\"Under Thomson's leadership, Scotiabank has successfully laid the groundwork necessary to execute our vision to deliver profitable and sustainable growth,\" the bank said in its circular.\n\nBut Scotia\u2019s strategy is not just one of growth \u2013 it\u2019s of optimization. While the KeyBank transaction may represent massive potential, Scotia also saw an impairment loss when taking a 20% stake in another bank \u2013 Colombia\u2019s Davivienda. The strategy \u2013 partial acquisitions \u2013 is at least consistent. Time will tell if the Key deal suffers from souring Canada-U.S. relations.\n\nBy the numbers, while McKay and Ferreira saw larger raises by percentage than Fraser, Thomson\u2019s raise outpaced the second-biggest gainer among U.S. big-bank CEOs, David Solomon. The Goldman Sachs chief executive received a 25.8% pay boost in 2024 ($80 million retention bonus notwithstanding).\n\nOne Canadian bank that didn\u2019t execute a business-transforming transaction still gave its CEO a 22.4% compensation bump in 2024. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CEO Victor Dodig received C$13.1 million ($9.1 million) for the year, the bank said in its circular. That\u2019s 19% above the C$11 million the bank set for him. For reference, the bank gave Dodig the same target in 2023, but he came in under, at C$10.7 million.\n\nAgain, by comparison, Dodig\u2019s 22.4% year-over-year gain outstrips the third-largest raise among U.S. big-bank CEOs. Brian Moynihan\u2019s compensation as the top executive at Bank of America increased 21% in 2024.\n\nNotably, apart from the $20 million anomaly at Morgan Stanley, none of the CEOs at the U.S.\u2019s six largest systemically important banks saw a decrease in compensation. (JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s pay rose 8.3% to $39 million in 2024, while Wells Fargo\u2019s Charlie Scharf saw a 7.6% uptick to $31.2 million.)\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for big-bank CEOs in Canada. BMO gave its CEO, Darryl White, C$9.62 million ($6.7 million) for 2024 \u2013 down 14.2% from C$11,218,000 in 2023, according to the bank\u2019s proxy circular. BMO said White \u201cdelivered exceptional leadership\u201d but that the compensation committee set its funding level for top executives\u2019 variable pay at 80% of target, noting that the bank \u201crespond[ed] effectively to unplanned challenges.\u201d\n\nJust as U.S. big-bank CEOs have an outlier in Pick, Canadians have theirs in now-former TD CEO Bharat Masrani.\n\nMasrani, who stepped down in February, received no cash incentive award or equity compensation in 2024, bringing his total pay for the year to $1.5 million -- an 89% dip from the $13.3 million he received in 2023. The precipitous drop came after the bank took more than $3 billion in penalties from a spate of U.S. regulators after investigations found deficiencies in its anti-money laundering practices.\n\nTD isn\u2019t the only bank to have clawed back compensation from members of its C-suite. Among the executives for whom RBC published compensation information last week is former CFO Nadine Ahn.\n\nThe bank dismissed Ahn last April, alleging she had an undisclosed relationship with another RBC executive. Ahn denied the allegations, and both executives sued RBC. The bank has filed counterclaims against each.\n\nAhn received C$312,603 for 2024, down from C$4.2 million a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe board determined that certain incentive compensation payments be reimbursed by Ms. Ahn to the bank,\u201d RBC said in its proxy, adding that the \u201cfinal determination of amounts to be paid relating to Ms. Ahn\u2019s termination (if any) remain unresolved.\u201d",

The bank\u2019s spokesperson, Jeff Lanthier, emphasized the importance of these changes, remarking, \"With these changes, some difficult decisions have been made and as a result some colleagues were impacted and left the bank.\" Although he did not disclose the exact number of positions eliminated, he affirmed the cuts were necessary to position RBC for its \"next phase of growth.\"\n\nSignificantly, RBC's layoffs come amid broader economic challenges, with numerous companies, including high-profile names like Disney and JPMorgan, also trimming their workforces. This unsettling trend reflects difficulties many organizations are grappling with as they navigate complex market conditions.\n\nAlongside its cuts, RBC noted it has promoted several employees and expanded responsibilities within its ranks. Lanthier highlighted this effort by stating, \"We have promoted a number of colleagues, expanded responsibilities, and made stronger connections across our platforms.\" These changes reflect the bank's commitment to fostering internal talent even amid layoffs, attempting to balance downsizing with growth opportunities for the remaining staff.\n\nThis announcement is all the more poignant considering RBC's financial performance. The bank reported impressive results, showcasing a profit of $5.13 billion for the first quarter of 2025, driven by increased trading revenue. This strong financial backdrop raises questions about the necessity of workforce reductions under such favorable economic conditions.\n\nThe layoffs at RBC follow the bank\u2019s $13.5 billion acquisition of HSBC Canada, completed last year. Regulatory conditions attached to this acquisition prevent the termination of any HSBC employees within six months of the merger, which could also complicate RBC's current staffing strategy. Lanthier clarified, stating the layoffs are unrelated to this acquisition and the conditions set forth.\n\nFor affected employees, the legal framework around severance pay could provide some measure of relief. Non-unionized employees within the Canadian banking sector are entitled to severance packages, which often range up to 24 months\u2019 pay, depending on factors such as tenure and role within the organization. Legal experts advise those laid off to understand their rights and the terms of their severance packages and to seek counsel if necessary.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the current trend of workforce reductions extends beyond RBC. Organizations across various sectors are implementing similar measures as fear of economic downturn pushes companies to reassess their operational costs. Reports indicate companies like Autodesk, and even retail giants like Amazon and Hudson\u2019s Bay, are also cutting jobs to adapt to challenging conditions.\n\nThis string of layoffs raises pertinent questions for both employees and the corporate sector, especially if it hints at broader economic malaise. Survivors of these reductions may now face increased responsibilities alongside uncertainty about the company\u2019s long-term vision and their roles within it.\n\nIt is said during periods of turbulence, companies often reassess their workforce to align more closely with their strategic goals. This trend seen at RBC reminds us how fluid and sometimes tenuous employment can be, even among industry-leading firms.\n\nFor employees left behind, the immediate future may feel precarious. The bridges built through firings and restructuring can be challenging to navigate, yet they also hold potential for new beginnings and opportunities, should RBC successfully pivot and leverage its enhanced operational model.\n\nRBC's decision to make these cuts, juxtaposed against its strong financial performance, is part of what many analysts see as the larger narrative of corporate responsibility. Striking the right balance between operational efficiency and employee welfare seems more important than ever as companies like RBC move forward during uncertain times.\n\nWhile the financial world is buzzing about RBC's profitability, the human stories behind job cuts deserve recognition. Employees who lose their jobs, particularly during prosperous times, confront economic realities and personal challenges\u2014an aspect often overshadowed by the corporate headlines.\n\nLooking toward the future, both RBC and its employees must embrace resilience and adaptability. The success of its growth strategy will largely depend on how well the bank manages its human capital and whether it can build pathways for those affected during these transformational changes.",

            "content": "Bank Of Canada Prepares For Key Interest Rate Decision Amid Economic Uncertainty Job growth stagnation and U.S. tariffs raise expectations for rate cuts by Bank of Canada.\n\nCanada\u2019s economy is poised for significant shifts as the Bank of Canada prepares to announce its monetary policy decision on March 12, 2025. With rising fears of economic slowdown fueled by U.S. trade tensions and disappointing employment figures, market analysts are betting on potential interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to announce its latest policy decision on March 12, with market participants increasingly pricing in changes. Money markets now reflect a 76% chance of the benchmark interest rate being reduced to 2.75%, which marks a change from 69% prior to the release of the latest jobs report. Economists have ramped up their predictions, with the probability of another cut in April now exceeding 90%.\n\nThe urgency for action stems from Statistics Canada\u2019s report, which revealed the economy added just 1,100 jobs during February, far below the 20,000 jobs economists had anticipated. Despite this drastic miss, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate held steady at 6.6%. The weak job creation data marks a notable slowdown, contradicting the prior months of stronger gains, and has already started raising expectations for monetary easing.\n\nDavid Rosenberg, president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, emphasized the significance of these findings. \u201cThis report reinforces the case for monetary easing,\u201d he stated, reflecting the sentiment among analysts who see the current economic environment as ripe for rate adjustments.\n\nWithin the sectors analyzed, retail and wholesale trades led job gains with 51,000 new positions, and finance, insurance, and real estate added another 16,000 jobs. Conversely, losses were pronounced, with professional, scientific, and technical services contracting by 1.6%, and transportation and warehousing suffering from a more substantial 2.1% drop. Notably, this latter industry has witnessed a 2.6% decline in employment since February 2024.\n\nMany economists believe this slowdown is closely linked to the increasing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. Nathan Janzen, assistant chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, pointed out the cautious nature of businesses as they brace for potential economic disruptions: \u201cThere are early indications showing the heightened uncertainty from U.S. tariff policies and declining business confidence are impacting hiring decisions, particularly in goods-producing industries.\u201d\n\nNotably, the situation is not merely limited to job numbers. The Central Bank also faces pressures from recent U.S. trade policies, including the announcement of 25% blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which have only recently begun to be rolled back with exemptions granted for USMCA-compliant trade. Currently, about 38% of Canadian exports to the U.S. utilized the CUSMA framework last year, but projections indicate the bulk of trade could comply with new requirements rapidly\u2014potentially as much as 90%.\n\nGovernor Tiff Macklem has acknowledged the limitations of monetary policy. With the overnight rate currently at 3%, at the top of the Bank of Canada\u2019s established neutral range of 2.25% to 3.25%, Macklem must navigate these turbulent judicial waters with caution. Raising rates too quickly could exacerbate inflation, and with the economy showing signs of softening, maintaining stability will be key.\n\nWhile the BoC has room to maneuver, it remains cautious. The bank also needs to contemplate fiscal policy responses, which are more effectively equipped to provide timely support than interest rate adjustments, which can take longer to influence the economy. The economic situation is compounded by public fears over high interest rates, which affect consumer confidence and mortgage rates heavily.\n\nWith inflation hovering around the central target of 2%, it\u2019s clear to many analysts, including those at RBC Financial Group, there is considerable risk involved with both maintaining and changing interest rates. The current inflation would likely be significantly higher if not for the temporary federal sales tax holiday, which had been implemented to lower prices for everyday items like dining out.\n\nThe upcoming BoC decision is not just pivotal for Canadian markets but aligns closely with broader trends seen across North American economies. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also signaled caution, mindful of inflation concerns and uncertainties surrounding trade and employment figures as it faces its own monetary policy realignment.\n\nDespite job growth maintaining stability across other sectors, economic analysts caution against the sustained risks presented by the current trade environment. There\u2019s tension between necessitating monetary easing as economic indicators slow, yet also needing to tackle potential inflationary pressures. The Canadian economy\u2019s performance over the coming weeks will be critically evaluated not only by stakeholders domestically but also globally as trade policies continue to shift.\n\nAll eyes will be on the Bank of Canada's action on March 12, as the path forward remains unclear amid fluctuative economic signals. Investors and businesses are acutely aware of the importance of this decision, as its consequences will undoubtedly resonate through various sectors of the economy. Prospects of interest rate cuts are high, but what remains uncertain is how rapidly the BoC may choose to act.\n\nWith all these elements at play, Canada\u2019s economic future may hinge on the decisions made by the Bank of Canada, as the interplay of job growth, trade relations, and policy decisions continue to set the stage for 2025 and beyond.",

National Bank's acquisition of CWB gave it room for its coast-to-coast expansion and growing its commercial banking business.\n\nMcKay's 2025 compensation target remains unchanged at C$17 million. The C$4 million stock award is linked to \"strategic cost and earnings objectives\" related to the integration of the HSBC Canada acquisition.\n\nCanadian banks that have traditionally expanded south of the border have been looking for opportunities to grow at home, betting on lower risk, better margins and cost of doing business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Montreal CEO Darryl White was handed his third pay cut after a challenging 2024. He was awarded C$9.6 million in total direct compensation for 2024, down 14.2% from a year earlier.\n\nThe bank struggled with credit issues last year, weighed by an uncertain economy and some bad loan books in the United States. BMO's stock rose 6.4% in 2024, underperforming the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index gain of 18%, while shares of RBC and National Bank rose to nearly 30% each.\n\n\"Over the past year, the global economy continued to experience challenges \u2014 although in recent months, there has been reason for more optimism... Still, there is much uncertainty in the world, which will require careful and deliberate management,\" board chair George Cope and White said.\n\n($1 = 1.4291 Canadian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil in Bengaluru and Nivedita Balu in Toronto; Editing by Alan Barona)",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against other cheap Canadian stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nCanadian Market Outlook 2025\n\nIn January, RBC Global Asset Management released its Market Outlook for Canada. Scott Lysakowski, the Managing Director & Senior Portfolio Manager, Head of Canadian Equities reflected on the Canadian market\u2019s performance in 2024. He noted that the Canadian equity market, particularly the S&P/TSX Composite Index, experienced a notable year. The TSX achieved a total return of approximately 21%, which Lysakowski thinks is commendable, especially considering the broader economic context. However, this performance was somewhat overshadowed by the US market, where mega-cap stocks led the charge. The TSX\u2019s gains, while substantial, were not as robust as those in the US, which Lysakowski attributed to the dominance of large-cap stocks in the latter part of the year.\n\nLysakowski noted that one interesting observation from 2024 was the brief increase in market breadth following significant events, such as elections. During these periods, mid-cap and small-cap stocks temporarily outperformed, suggesting a potential shift towards broader market participation. However, this trend was short-lived, and the year concluded with mega-cap stocks once again driving the majority of returns. The top ten stocks in the market contributed significantly to the overall performance, highlighting the persistent dominance of these large players.\n\nMoreover, in analyzing the composition of returns for the TSX, Lysakowski suggests that it\u2019s clear that the 21% total return consisted of a 3% dividend yield, with the remaining 18% split between earnings growth and valuation changes. Specifically, earnings growth accounted for about 9%, and multiple expansions contributed around 7%. In contrast, the US market, particularly mega-cap stocks, saw more pronounced earnings growth and multiple expansions, which explains their superior performance.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Lysakowski noted that the outlook remains uncertain, partly due to macroeconomic factors such as the weakness in the Canadian dollar. This currency volatility is a significant concern for Canadian equities, as it impacts both investor sentiment and the macroeconomic outlook. Furthermore, the divergence in earnings growth between mega-cap and small-cap stocks suggests that until smaller companies demonstrate stronger earnings growth, the dominance of large-cap stocks will likely continue. This dynamic will be crucial to monitor in the coming year, as broader market participation could have a positive impact on Canadian equities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, and CNN as our sources. Using the screener we aggregated a list of Canadian stocks that are trading below a Forward P/E of 15, with earnings growth expectations this year, and an upside potential of more than 10%. Next, we cross-checked the FWD P/E for each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the average upside potential. Please note that the data was recorded on March 3rd, 2025.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 12.71\n\nEarnings Growth This Year: 11.22%\n\nAnalyst Upside Potential: 14.29%\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) is a large Canadian financial institution that offers a variety of services to individuals, businesses, and governments. It provides everyday banking services like checking accounts, loans, and investments to individuals and businesses in Canada, the Caribbean, and the US.

Additionally, the bank is engaged in Capital Markets and Insurance.\n\nOn February 26, Analyst Matthew Lee from Canaccord Genuity maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of C$191. The analyst noted that the bank\u2019s adjusted cash earnings per share exceeded both consensus and internal estimates, indicating robust earnings growth.

Moreover, the revenue and expense ratio also outperformed expectations, demonstrating effective cost management and operational efficiency.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) reported strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2025.

            "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nRoyal Bank (RY) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this bank is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Royal Bank is 7.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 6.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nRight now, Royal Bank has an S/TA ratio of 0.06, which means that the company gets $0.06 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.05, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Royal Bank is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 6.7% this year versus the industry average of 0%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Royal Bank. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRoyal Bank has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Royal Bank is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\n\nIt's only 1/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\n\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nHow Will Tariffs Affect the Market?\n\nOn March 5th, BBC reported that the US stock market had fallen after the tariffs sparked trade war fear. The recent imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China has sparked significant concerns about a potential trade war. The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on most imports from these countries, with Canadian energy products facing a 10% tariff. On the other hand, tariffs on Chinese imports have been increased from 10% to 20%. As a result, Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau announced immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of US goods, with plans for additional tariffs on $125 billion in goods over the next three weeks. Moreover, China imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 15% on various US agricultural imports, such as chicken, pork, and soybeans. The tariffs have raised fears of inflation and a broader trade conflict, leading to a decline in US and global stock markets. As a result, the S&P 500 experienced a significant drop, and European markets also closed lower.\n\nToday, Richard Fisher, former Dallas Fed president, appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the recent tariffs and their impact on the market. Fisher stated that a tariff is a cost factor that goes into producing and distributing a product, making it a form of tax. Business operators of all sizes have to figure out a way to protect their margins against the impact. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has to gauge the amount of revenue it would generate from these tariffs considering it is slowing down the economy and can cause inflation as the companies will have to raise prices to maintain their margins. Moreover, Richard Fisher noted that such tariffs take a long to be digested, as businesses don\u2019t change something overnight. The only way for companies to maintain their margins without increasing prices is by increasing productivity, which again does not happen overnight and takes time.\n\nWhile talking about how the Fed might react to the tariffs, Fisher mentioned that it is a little too early to guess. The Fed is bringing inflation down and we are getting closer to the 2% target, however, at the same time tariff increases the cost of doing business, which might slow down the economy and tickle up inflation. To conclude Fisher noted that tariffs won\u2019t be digested quickly and will take time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we aggregated a list of stocks trading below the forward P/E of 15 and earnings growth expectations this year. Next, we cross-checked the Forward P/E from Seeking Alpha and Earnings growth from Yahoo Finance.

            "content": "\"The integration of artificial intelligence into banking security isn't just an upgrade\u2014it's a complete paradigm shift in how we approach threat detection and prevention,\" says Kayode Ayinoluwa, a cybersecurity expert who has worked at renowned institutions like Deloitte, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and Ada. \"We're moving from reactive defense to predictive protection, and that's transforming the entire financial sector.\"\n\nWith digital banking becoming the norm, it has never been more critical to secure financial institutions against cyber threats. Recent data from the World Economic Forum suggests that cyberattacks on financial institutions increased by 238% from early 2020 to late 2023. Experts project losses to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.\n\nConsidering this, financial institutions must adopt inventive methods for banking cybersecurity to survive in the digital age.\n\nThe AI Revolution in Banking Security\n\nAI-driven cybersecurity solutions are at the heart of Kayode Ayinoluwa's work. During his tenure at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the AI expert spearheaded the development of a sophisticated cyber analytics platform that reduced incident response times and significantly enhanced threat detection capabilities.\n\n\"Traditional security measures are like looking through a rear-view mirror,\" Kayode Ayinoluwa explains. \"AI-driven systems, however, offer a different perspective. They allow us to look forward and anticipate threats before they materialize.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone in the industry shares Kayode Ayinoluwa's enthusiasm for AI-driven solutions. While AI presents tremendous opportunities, some assert that we must still acknowledge its limitations. Over-reliance on automated systems could create blind spots that sophisticated attackers might exploit.\n\nThe Human Element in Digital Security\n\nDespite this critique, Kayode Ayinoluwa remains determined to drive AI-led projects, such as his multi-layered technique that combines AI capabilities with human proficiency. Major institutions worldwide have adopted his methods, which involve aggregating data from hundreds of sources to create a comprehensive security framework. \"The key is balance,\" he asserts. \"AI augments human capability. It doesn't replace it.\"\n\nOne of Kayode Ayinoluwa's most notable projects has been the development of a centralized client consent data model. This project increased client engagement by 25%. At the same time, it strengthened security through micro-segmentation. This demonstrates how security measures can enhance rather than impede user experience. It is a crucial consideration as banks strive to maintain customer satisfaction in an increasingly digital environment.\n\n\"Security isn't just about building walls,\" Kayode Ayinoluwa notes. \"It's about creating an ecosystem where protection and accessibility coexist. The future of banking security lies in privacy-first solutions that are both robust and user-friendly.\"\n\nThe Future of Cybersecurity: Bridging Security and Innovation\n\nExperts predict that a majority of banking security systems will incorporate some form of AI or machine learning by 2030. Kayode Ayinoluwa's work in developing AI assurance frameworks and enhancing AI safety positions him prominently within this transformation.\n\nThe implementation of his methodologies at institutions like RBC and Ada AI has already demonstrated promising results. These include improvements in their cloud security and threat management posture. These successes have led to the adoption of his frameworks by major institutions across North America.\n\nAs financial institutions continue to evolve, the challenge of maintaining security while fostering innovation remains vital. Kayode Ayinoluwa's latest venture focuses on establishing specialized cybersecurity consultancy services. These services target healthcare, legal technology, and MedTech sectors. These areas are where data sensitivity and regulatory compliance intersect with technological advancement.\n\n\"The next frontier in banking security isn't just about protecting assets,\" Kayode Ayinoluwa concludes. \"It's about creating adaptive systems that evolve with threats while enabling innovation. The financial institutions that thrive will be those that embrace this dual mandate of security and progress.\"",

They are permitted to take deposits, extend mortgages and advise corporate clients \u2014 all the core activities for banks. And Canadian customers disproportionately still prefer to do their banking in person, as opposed to online, meaning it would require a major physical presence for any entrant to attempt to enter the market.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. banks are restricted in what they can do in Canada.\n\nForeign banks, including American ones, must either work with a Canadian middleman, establish a Canadian subsidiary or receive special government permission to do business. Unless they agree to follow Canada\u2019s stringent banking rules that include holding a hefty sum of cash-like assets in reserve at all times, they cannot operate retail branches that take deposits under around $100,000.\n\nGiven how dominant Canada\u2019s homegrown banks are, any international bank that tries to compete faces \u201can additional regulatory burden for what would begin as a small prize,\u201d said James R. Thompson, associate professor of finance at the University of Waterloo.\n\nThe upshot is that U.S. banks have minimal operations in Canada. The largest American lender, JPMorgan Chase, says it has roughly 600 employees in Canada, out of more than 300,000 worldwide. Many international banks limit themselves to areas that don\u2019t involve lending, such as offering investment advice to wealthy Canadians or local companies.\n\nSo Mr. Trump is incorrect in asserting that American banks cannot do any business in Canada, but it is true that they are hamstrung in their activities.",

These accounts can make it easier to achieve specific savings goals, such as buying a new car, paying for a wedding, or building an emergency fund.\n\nTypes of savings accounts\n\nCanadians can choose from a number of different types of savings accounts. Most are fairly standard, while others have additional features designed to meet specific needs. Types of savings account options include:\n\nHow savings accounts work\n\nWhen you deposit your money in a savings account at a bank or credit union, you\u2019re lending your funds to the institution. In return, they pay you interest.\n\nWhile you typically can access your money whenever you need it, some savings accounts place limits on the number of monthly withdrawals. In most cases, however, you can transfer funds and make deposits without restrictions.\n\nSavings accounts don\u2019t tend to come with debit cards or cheques like you\u2019d get with chequing accounts. However, if you have chequing and savings accounts at the same institution, you may be able to link them both to your debit card. Note that some banks may charge a fee if you use your debit card to withdraw money from your savings account.\n\nHow does interest work on a savings account?\n\nInterest rates on savings accounts vary by the financial institution. Some banks or credit unions pay interest on the total account balance, while others pay interest on the amount above a minimum required balance.\n\nTypically, savings account interest is compounded, meaning you can earn interest on both your original deposit and any previously earned interest.\n\nBe sure to read the account\u2019s terms and conditions carefully to determine whether the interest is compounded annually, monthly or daily. The more frequently your interest compounds, the faster your money can grow.\n\nDo savings account interest rates change?\n\nYes, interest rates on savings accounts are usually variable. That means the interest offered on your savings account is influenced by your bank\u2019s prime rate. It rises and falls based on changes in the Bank of Canada\u2019s policy rate and prevailing market conditions, which reflect the cost of borrowing for banks.\n\nFor example, if the Bank of Canada increases the policy rate on one of the eight scheduled review days in a year, banks may raise their prime rate. This, in turn, will translate into higher rates of returns on its savings and investment products. Conversely, a policy rate decrease may lead to lower interest rates on these products.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Savings account interest rates in Canada, though variable, tend to be stable for months. Banks may adjust interest rates depending on market trends or competition. This page is updated monthly to keep you informed about the best savings account options.\n\nWhat savings accounts should you have?\n\nChoosing the type of savings account depends on your savings goals, personal preferences and life situations. If you have different objectives over various timelines, it might make sense to have multiple accounts to better organize and plan your finances.\n\nFor example, you could choose a government-registered, tax-advantaged RRSP to save for retirement. At the same time, you might tuck away a small amount of money into a non-registered HISA for penalty-free withdrawals when emergencies arise.\n\nHere are some features and benefits of both non-registered and registered savings accounts to consider.\n\nComparing HISAs, TFSAs and RRSPs\n\nHow to choose a savings account\n\nSavings accounts are offered by many different banking institutions across Canada, including the Big Six banks, traditional banks and credit unions as well as online banks.\n\nEach financial institution provides unique banking and account features, so be sure to shop around to find the best option to suit your needs. Here are some factors to consider:\n\nInterest rate\n\nHow much interest will you earn on the money in your savings account? Many banks offer promotional interest rates that may seem enticing at first, but drop down to a much lower rate after a few months. Depending on your savings goals, this type of introductory rate might work for you.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s often better to look at the best regular interest rate instead of focusing solely on the promotional offers. This way, you can accurately anticipate how much interest you will earn over a year.\n\nMinimum balance\n\nSome savings accounts require you keep a minimum balance, such as $1,000, if you want to earn interest. If you can easily meet this daily or monthly requirement, it may work well for you.\n\nThough, you might want to consider an account without such requirements, ensuring that you earn interest no matter your balance.\n\nFees\n\nMost financial institutions do not charge monthly fees for savings accounts, but may have fees for certain transactions or limit your free monthly transactions. Pay attention to the fine print to know how many monthly withdrawals you\u2019re allowed, whether there are additional service fees, and if you can make free e-transfers as needed.\n\nCDIC Insurance\n\nMany Canadian financial institutions are covered by a provincial or federal deposit insurer, such as the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC). The insurance protects your money \u2014 up to $100,000 per type of account \u2014 if the bank fails. Before opening an account, check the financial institution\u2019s website to confirm if it has deposit insurance protection.\n\nConvenience\n\nConsider your banking preferences and ensure you can conveniently withdraw your money from your savings account whenever you need it.. For example, you might choose the RBC savings account if you prefer a big bank that has a large branch network to facilitate your in-person banking.\n\nMany people like to keep their savings and chequing accounts at the same financial institution. If you already have a chequing account at a particular bank or credit union, opening a savings account there can make it easier to transfer money between accounts.\n\nWhen considering an online-only savings account, make sure you know how to access your money. Can you use a debit card at an ATM, or will you need to transfer the funds to a chequing account with another bank? Also, evaluate whether the mobile app or online banking meet your needs. Is the digital interface easy to use? Can you call a customer service representative for questions?\n\nHow to open a savings account\n\nOpening a savings account is generally a straightforward process and can be done in person or online depending on your financial institution. The application should only take a few minutes, provided you meet the criteria and share some personal information.

Make sure you\u2019re looking at the right rates for you.\n\nSpecial rates: RBC only posts special rates for a handful of mortgage types, including five-year fixed and five-year variable.\n\nAPR: There\u2019s an APR for each posted and special rate on RBC\u2019s website.\n\nOther RBC mortgage details\n\nIncrease your payments: You can increase your standard payment by up to 100% without penalty.\n\nMake lump-sum payments: You can pay down up to 10% of your original loan on fixed-rate closed mortgages up to once per year.\n\nPrepayment penalties: If you pay off your fixed-rate mortgage beyond the set limits, you\u2019ll pay a prepayment penalty. These vary by lender; at RBC, you\u2019ll pay the greater of three months interest on the prepayment amount (based on your mortgage interest rate) or the interest rate differential on your prepayment amount. For variable-rate mortgages, the penalty is three months of interest based on RBC\u2019s prime rate.\n\nFlexible payment frequencies: In addition to paying your mortgage on a monthly basis, RBC gives you the option to pay: semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, accelerated bi-weekly and accelerated weekly. You won\u2019t find this many options at most lenders. Making more frequent payments can reduce the total amount of interest you pay over the life of your mortgage.\n\nRange of terms: Six-month convertible mortgage to 25-year fixed \u2014 one of the longest terms you\u2019ll find.\n\nRate hold: RBC will hold rates for 120 days, which is standard in the mortgage industry.\n\nPortability: If your current home is financed by RBC, you may be able to port it if you move.\n\nPrograms for newcomers: Newcomers to Canada with limited or no credit history may be able to get a mortgage with RBC.\n\nCustomer satisfaction ratings It\u2019s difficult to gauge how satisfied Canadians are with RBC as a mortgage provider. Customer review websites can be helpful, but keep in mind that the reviews aren\u2019t verified and may not accurately reflect the average opinion of RBC customers; for example, unhappy customers may be overrepresented or their experience may not be mortgage-related. Nevertheless, these sites are one way to learn about possible downsides to consider. RBC had a Trustpilot rating of 1.4 out of 5 possible stars based on almost 1,400 customer reviews, at the time of this writing.\n\nRBC\u2019s Client Care Centre had a rating of 1.25 out of a possible 5 stars, according to more than 110 customer reviews on the Better Business Bureau website, at the time of this writing. RBC is not accredited by the BBB itself.\n\nRBC had a rating of 1.4 out of 5 possible stars, according to more than 530 customer reviews on the Consumer Affairs website, at the time of this writing.\n\nEligibility requirements\n\nTo qualify for a prime mortgage with the Royal Bank of Canada, as with any lender or brokerage, you\u2019ll need to meet certain eligibility requirements. These include:\n\nMinimum credit score: Typically 680, but lower-score options exist.\n\nCredit history: Established accounts in good standing, no recent negative marks.\n\nIncome: Amount of income needed will vary depending on how much you want to borrow.\n\nDown payment amount: At least 5% for a home under $500,000. For homes between $500,000 and $999,999, you need 5% of the first $500,000 and 10% of the amount above $500,000.\n\nDebt service ratios: Your gross debt service ratio must not exceed 39%; your total debt service ratio must not exceed 44%.\n\nType of employment and employment history: You must be able to demonstrate at least two years of consistent employment.\n\nRBC encourages potential borrowers to use its online tools to get a clearer idea of their qualification potential.\n\nRBC\u2019s True House Affordability Tool can be used to estimate how much you might be able to borrow, and the bank\u2019s pre-approval tool can be used to connect with a mortgage specialist to discuss any concerns.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, RBC presents itself as willing to work with borrowers who may have a harder time getting approved by a traditional mortgage lender. The bank also has a mortgage specially designed for self-employed people, for whom it\u2019s often more difficult to secure a home loan.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Use a mortgage affordability calculator to determine how much you can afford to pay for a home. If you have a unique situation or need additional information about the eligibility requirements, it\u2019s best to speak directly with a mortgage specialist.\n\nHow to apply for a mortgage with RBC\n\nYou can apply for a mortgage pre-qualification and pre-approval on RBC\u2019s website. Both forms take just a few minutes and don\u2019t require you to dig up any supporting documentation.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer, you can request an RBC agent to walk you through these processes. If you decide to formally apply for a mortgage with RBC, you\u2019ll learn about how to do that directly rom them; there\u2019s no publicly accessible application form online.\n\nGet started Get pre-qualified online Pre-apply for a mortgage Scroll to the bottom of RBC\u2019s mortgage home page, and you\u2019ll find quick links to start the online pre-approval and pre-qualification forms. From here, you can also contact an RBC mortgage specialist in your area if you\u2019d prefer assistance with these tasks, or if you\u2019d like to get more information. Pre-qualificaiton is a quick way to estimate how large a loan you may be approved for. It\u2019s less comprehensive than getting pre-approved. You\u2019ll want to get pre-approved before you start putting offers on homes. Filling out the pre-qualification form is a simple process. After providing your contact information, you\u2019ll be asked to give RBC permission to access your credit score. Doing this won\u2019t affect your credit score. You\u2019ll be prompted to enter a potential home value as well as the amount of money you have saved up for a down payment. If you haven\u2019t made an offer on a home yet, you won\u2019t know what to enter for \u201cPurchase Price\u201d. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to fill out that field to continue. It\u2019s a good idea to enter your total down payment savings into the \u201cProposed Down Payment\u201d space, though. It\u2019s not necessary, but it\u2019s useful information for your RBC mortgage specialist to have. You\u2019ll then choose a nearby mortgage specialist to help you with the rest of your pre-approval. Click on the card icon next to each name to learn a little bit more about each specialist. RBC provides a modest amount of information about nearby agents, including the languages they speak and their areas of specialization, such as investment properties or first-time home buyers. Who you choose to work with shouldn\u2019t be a make-or-break decision \u2014 they\u2019ll all be offering the same products and using the same qualification guidelines.\n\nAlternatives to RBC Mortgage\n\nIf you decide RBC Mortgage is not for you, other Canadian lenders and brokers will likely offer competitive mortgage rate options for your needs.\n\nTangerine CIBC Mortgage Lender type Online-only bank Big Bank lender Service area National National In-person service?

            "content": "The Canadian banking sector is under pressure to balance financial growth with sustainability. The Big Five banks of the country \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Bank of Montreal (BMO), Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), TD Bank, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) \u2013 have all reported their latest earnings while advancing their climate commitments.\n\nThe Big Five banks\u2019 financial results reflect the strength of the Canadian economy, while their sustainability and net-zero initiatives show how committed they\u2019re to reducing carbon emissions.\n\nBut how do these Canadian banks compare? Let\u2019s dive into their latest earnings and see who is leading the charge toward a greener future.\n\nFinancial Performance: A Competitive Landscape\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RBC): Record Earnings with Strong Performance\n\nRBC reported a net income of CAD 5.13 billion in Q1 2025, up from CAD 3.52 billion in Q1 2024. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stood at CAD 3.62, surpassing analyst expectations of CAD 3.24.\n\nRevenue: CAD 16.74 billion (up from 13.49 billion year-over-year)\n\nProvision for Credit Losses (PCL): CAD 1.05 billion (up from 815 million)\n\nRBC\u2019s financial performance was bolstered by a strong wealth management division, which saw a 48% increase in income, and robust capital markets earnings. The acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada contributed an additional CAD 214 million to net income.\n\nBank of Montreal (BMO): Solid Growth Amid Economic Challenges\n\nBMO reported a net income of CAD 2.14 billion in Q1 2025, up from CAD 1.29 billion in Q1 2024. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stood at CAD 3.04, surpassing analyst expectations of CAD 2.41.\n\nRevenue: CAD 7.28 billion (up from 6.22 billion year-over-year)\n\nProvision for Credit Losses (PCL): CAD 573 million (slightly down from 585 million a year ago)\n\nBMO\u2019s financial performance was strong despite higher credit provisions. Its capital markets division contributed significantly, with a 45% increase in adjusted net income, reaching CAD 591 million.\n\nBank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank): Facing Margin Pressure\n\nScotiabank\u2019s Q1 2025 net income stood at CAD 2.02 billion, slightly lower than CAD 2.12 billion in Q1 2024. Adjusted EPS was CAD 1.68, missing expectations of CAD 1.70.\n\nRevenue: CAD 8.16 billion (down slightly from 8.23 billion)\n\nProvision for Credit Losses: CAD 955 million (up from 910 million)\n\nWhile Scotiabank saw modest revenue growth, higher loan loss provisions and lower NIMs affected profitability. The bank\u2019s Latin American operations performed well, helping offset domestic weakness.\n\nTD Bank: Strong Performance Despite Loan Losses\n\nTD Bank announced a net income of CAD 2.79 billion in Q1 2025, a slight decline from CAD 2.82 billion in Q1 2024. Adjusted EPS was CAD 1.55, remaining flat year-over-year.\n\nRevenue: CAD 14.05 billion (up from 13.71 billion)\n\nProvision for Credit Losses: CAD 1.21 billion (up from 1.02 billion)\n\nTD\u2019s performance was driven by strong deposit growth and capital markets revenue. However, increased provisions for credit losses reflect potential economic headwinds.\n\nCIBC: Higher Earnings But Growing Risks\n\nCIBC posted a Q1 2025 net income of CAD 2.18 billion, up from CAD 1.73 billion in Q1 2024. Adjusted EPS was CAD 2.20, above the consensus estimate of CAD 1.81.\n\nRevenue: CAD 7.3 billion (up from 6.14 billion)\n\nProvision for Credit Losses (PCL): CAD 573 million (down from 585 million)\n\nCIBC\u2019s earnings growth was supported by strong loan and deposit growth. Its capital markets unit saw a 19% increase in net income, reaching CAD 619 million. However, rising provisions for bad loans signal caution.\n\nCarbon Emission Reductions and Sustainability Race: Who\u2019s Leading?\n\nAs these Big Five Canadian banks are going after profits, they, too, are under pressure to go after their sustainable and net-zero goals. Let\u2019s see what they\u2019re doing to hit their climate goals.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RBC): Advancing Towards Net Zero\n\nRBC has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations and financed emissions by 2050. The bank is aligning its lending and investment activities with global climate targets, focusing on energy efficiency, sustainable finance, and emissions reductions.\n\nRBC\u2019s GHG emissions totaled 119,802 metric tons of CO\u2082e in 2023, reflecting a steady decline from previous years. The bank has committed CAD 500 billion in sustainable finance by 2025.\n\nAs of 2023, RBC has allocated CAD 393 billion in sustainable finance, making progress toward its CAD 500 billion target by 2025.\n\nThe most valuable bank in Canada also used carbon offsets as part of its strategy to neutralize its operational footprint.\n\nKey emission reduction initiatives are:\n\nExpanding financing for renewable energy and clean technology projects.\n\nrenewable energy and clean technology projects.

The bank continues to refine its financed emissions tracking and collaborates with businesses to meet shared net-zero goals.\n\nBank of Montreal (BMO): Charging its Net-Zero Ambitions\n\nBMO has committed to achieving net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. The bank has been carbon-neutral in its operations since 2010 and aims to cut its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline). The bank has achieved this by:\n\nUpgrading heating and cooling infrastructure across its buildings.\n\nPurchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) to match 100% of its global electricity consumption.\n\nOffsetting residual emissions through high-quality carbon credits, including projects like the Great Bear Rainforest conservation initiative..\n\nIn 2023, the bank\u2019s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stood at 101,960 metric tons CO\u2082e, down 12% from 2022 levels. The bank retired 45,918 tCO\u2082e of carbon credits in the same year as part of its emission reduction strategies.\n\nMajor climate actions include:\n\nIssued CAD 10 billion in sustainability bonds.\n\nFinanced CAD 70 billion in sustainable lending projects.\n\nPledged to provide CAD 150 billion in green financing by 2025.\n\nBMO\u2019s Asset Management division offers multiple sustainable investment options, focusing on ESG-oriented portfolios.\n\nBMO has pledged CAD 300 billion in sustainable financing and has surpassed this with CAD 330 billion issued as of 2023.\n\nThe giant financier aims to support businesses transitioning to a low-carbon economy.

In 2023, its operational carbon emissions were 110,000 metric tons CO\u2082e, down 9% year-over-year.\n\nThe Canadian bank has reduced energy consumption in branches and offices by 25% as part of its net-zero efforts. It has also financed low-carbon initiatives in Latin America\n\nScotiabank has set a target of providing CAD 350 billion in climate-related financing by 2030. In 2023, the bank provided CAD 36 billion toward this goal, bringing its cumulative total to CAD 132 billion since 2018.\n\nKey climate initiatives include:\n\nDeveloping an internal net-zero scoring system to assess client transition plans.\n\nSetting interim emissions intensity reduction targets for the automotive manufacturing sector.\n\nIntending to increase internal carbon price to further emission reductions.\n\nExpanding financing solutions for renewable energy projects and electric vehicle adoption.\n\nThe bank also continues to reduce its own operational emissions by securing emissions-free electricity, implementing energy efficiency programs, and integrating climate risk assessments into its lending strategy.\n\nTD Bank: Leading in Sustainable Finance and Decarbonization\n\nTD Bank has the most aggressive green finance strategy among the four banks. It has pledged CAD 500 billion in sustainable and decarbonization finance by 2030, with nearly CAD 70 billion allocated in 2023 alone.\n\nTD has emitted a total of 117,317 metric tons of CO\u2082e in 2023, down 14% from 2022. The bank has already achieved a 28% reduction in operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions, surpassing its 2025 target of 25%.\n\nThe bank has retired 85,176 verified carbon reduction and removal credits, equal to the bank\u2019s market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 category 6 (business travel) emissions.\n\nMore notably, the bank has one of the largest direct air capture (DAC) carbon credit purchases in the financial sector. It agreed to buy 27,500 metric tons of carbon removal credits over four years.\n\nAlso, TD Bank has expanded its financial emissions tracking across nine high-emission sectors, including energy, automotive, and agriculture. The financier has also improved climate risk assessment tools and developed a central data repository to track emissions reduction progress across its operations and client portfolio.\n\nOther Sustainability Highlights:\n\nLaunched the first net-zero branch in Canada,\n\nInvested CAD 20 million in community-based climate projects, and\n\n60% of power is sourced from renewable energy.\n\nCIBC: Balancing Growth and Sustainability\n\nCIBC is committed to reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and achieving net zero. In 2023, its operational emissions stood at 71,031 metric tons CO\u2082e, a 5% increase from 2022.\n\nPer CIBC\u2019s sustainability report, the bank has set a 30% operational GHG reduction target by 2028 (compared to 2018 levels). It also aims to achieve carbon neutrality in operations by 2024. The bank is on track to meet this target through:\n\nIncreasing investments in renewable energy\n\nExpanding sustainable finance offerings, including carbon capture, hydrogen , and e-mobility financing.\n\nImplementing energy-efficient technologies in offices.\n\nPartnering with carbon capture firms for carbon offset projects.\n\nEnhancing transparency in climate risk reporting and engaging with industry groups\n\nThe bank has issued over CAD 157 billion in sustainable finance investments as of 2023. It has a target of 300 billion by 2030.\n\nCIBC helped finance sustainable infrastructure projects. This includes battery energy storage systems in the UK and big renewable energy deals.\n\nWho\u2019s Winning the Net Zero Race?\n\nWith all the sustainability initiatives and financing solutions provided by each bank, who wins the net-zero race? The chart below shows the comparison of the banks\u2019 GHG emissions and sustainable finance progress as of 2023.\n\nOverall, TD Bank and RBC lead with the highest sustainable finance commitment, while BMO has surpassed its financing goal. RBC is also making significant strides in sustainable finance and net-zero initiatives, leveraging its market leadership.\n\nCIBC has made strong progress in both emissions reductions and sustainable investments. Meanwhile, Scotiabank continues expanding its climate financing but has the third-highest operational emissions among the five banks.\n\nConclusion: Balancing Profitability with Climate Commitments\n\nThe five major Canadian banks continue to navigate economic headwinds while strengthening their sustainability and net-zero initiatives. While financial results varied, all banks have made progress in decarbonization efforts, sustainable finance, and emissions reductions.\n\nRBC leads in net income and is expanding climate finance and net-zero initiatives.\n\nBMO remains a leader in carbon-neutral operations and financed emissions tracking.\n\nScotiabank is aggressively expanding climate-related finance and client net-zero assessments.\n\nTD Bank is surpassing emissions reduction targets and making innovative carbon credit investments.\n\nCIBC is strengthening its renewable energy financing and operational net-zero transition.\n\nAs regulatory pressure and investor expectations increase, these Big Five Canadian banks will need to accelerate their climate and net-zero strategies while maintaining profitability. Future progress will depend on expanding sustainable finance, improving emissions tracking, and supporting client transitions to a low-carbon economy.",

Preqin\u2019s platform covers 210,000 funds and has over 220,000 users, including asset managers, insurers, pensions, wealth managers, banks, and other service providers.\n\nOver time, BlackRock will integrate Preqin\u2019s proprietary data and research tools with Aladdin, its technology platform, and eFront, its end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider it acquired in 2019.\n\nSudhir Nair, BlackRock\n\nSudhir Nair, global head of Aladdin, said in a statement: \u201cWe are on a journey to make private markets more accessible and transparent for clients through data and technology. This ambition takes another leap forward with the addition of Preqin\u2019s data, benchmarks, and analytics capabilities.\u201d\n\nBetter transparency will create better liquidity, according to Fink, which will allow BlackRock to provide more private market products for retail and wealth advisors.\n\n\u201cThat could be a transformational change for the industry, and our ultimate hope would be to create private market indexes and ETFs,\u201d said Fink.\n\nHe also argued that by providing the entire industry with data and analytics, and working with regulators, they could be more open to opening private markets to the mass market.\n\n\u201cThis is probably is the most significant thing we have done in terms of expanding the profile of private markets for the mass affluent and other platforms, so we are really excited,\u201d added Fink.\n\nPorts acquisition\n\nBlackRock also completed the acquisition of infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in November 2024 and added approximately $170bn in assets under management.\n\nOn 4 March 2025 Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings said in a statement it had reached agreements in principle to sell some of the ports it operates to BlackRock, GIP, Terminal Investment and shipping company MSC (the BlackRock-TiL consortium). The sales include CK Hutchison\u2019s 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which requires confirmation by the government of Panama of the proposed terms of the purchase and sale.\n\nThe transaction also includes the $22.8bn sale of CK Hutchison\u2019s 80% effective and controlling interest in 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, excluding Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.\n\nFrank Sixt, CK Hutchison\n\nFrank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction is the result of a competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received and that it is \u201cclearly\u201d in the best interest of the firm\u2019s shareholders.\n\nFink described the agreement in a statement as a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP\u2019s combined platform. He has described infrastructure as a \u201cgenerational investment opportunity\u201d and said BlackRock and GIP are well positioned to capitalize on the long-term structural trends that will continue to drive the growth of infrastructure and deliver superior investment opportunities for clients globally.\n\nMacro environment\n\nThe US stock market has fallen after President Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and China. Fink said: \u201cThe world is fine. There is a lot of noise and we\u2019ll get by this. For long-term investors, if there is a big dip, it is a good time to buy and I truly believe that.\u201d\n\nHe also believes there will a big economic boom related to new technologies and science, which will present new opportunities and that these trends are going to be net positive in the long run for the United States\n\n\u201cThe next six months are going to have a lot of volatility but I think we\u2019ll find ways to navigate, mitigate and move forward,\u201d Fink added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have limited inflation and I think the ten-year rate is getting it wrong because we are going to have a steeper yield curve.\u201d\n\nFink added that in two to three years, technology is going to be very deflationary, especially generative AI. and that there will be a lot of trade agreements after the chaos. BlackRock expects short term volatility, elevated and moderation of the economy but a \u201cpretty good trajectory\u201d over the course of three or four quarters.\n\n\u201cI truly believe the American capital markets have transcended politics and we are benefiting beyond any other country because we have an incredibly strong banking system, the law and the most robust capital markets,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has become more optimistic in the short run on Europe as leaders are taking more responsibility for defense and trying to create growth agendas. For example, President Macron in France and Prime Minister Meloni in Italy have both announced new AI data centers.\n\nHowever, he highlighted that the US has to wake up to the fact that deficits matter, and focusing on more public-private type of investment is important. \u201cThat is why we have to start focusing on infrastructure,\u201d said Fink.",

Choose the right one for your spending habits and financial goals.\n\nNerdWallet's picks for the best cash-back credit cards in Canada include top contenders across numerous categories. Choose the right one for your spending habits and financial goals.\n\nWhen it comes to the complex world of credit card rewards, there are few words as simple \u2014 or as sweet \u2014 as \u201ccash back.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for a cash-back credit card in Canada, you have plenty of choices.\n\nMethodology BACK TO TOP NerdWallet Canada selects the best credit cards based on overall consumer value as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow cash-back credit cards work in Canada\n\nBefore deciding which cash-back credit card is right for you, it\u2019s helpful to understand how the cash-back redemption process works, the many categories cash-back rewards can fall into, and how cash-back cards compare to other types of credit cards.\n\nWhat is a cash-back credit card?\n\nCash-back credit cards are pretty straightforward: you use them as you would any other credit card, and in exchange for making eligible purchases, you get a certain percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a cash-back credit card?\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimplicity \u2014 cash-back cards make it easy to earn valuable rewards.\n\nWelcome bonuses and introductory offers can be quite generous.\n\nAccumulated rewards can help pay down your card balance.\n\nHigh earn rates for items you buy regularly can yield big rewards.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nYou may not typically buy items that yield above-average earn rates.\n\nAmassing rewards can be slow depending on how much you spend each month, and whether you pay your bill in full.\n\nBonus and introductory offers tend to come with conditions, including spending minimums, which may be challenging to meet.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nTypes of cash-back credit cards\n\nAll cash-back credit cards work similarly, but even minor differences are worth noting as they can affect your earn rate.\n\nFlat-rate\n\nThis type of cash-back credit card earns cash-back at the same rate for all purchases made.\n\nBonus rewards categories\n\nSome cash-back credit cards offer an increased earn rate for rewards on select spending categories, such as groceries and restaurants.\n\nFlexible bonus cash-back cards\n\nSome cards allow you to choose the spending categories to earn your bonus rewards. By selecting categories that align with the types of items you buy frequently, you can maximize your cash-back rewards.\n\nHow to earn cash-back\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make purchases to earn cash-back rewards with a credit card. For example, let\u2019s say you have a card that offers 2% cash back on groceries. If tomorrow\u2019s weekly run to the supermarket winds up costing you $100 and you pay with your card, you\u2019ll earn $2 in cash-back rewards.\n\nCash-back rewards will accumulate as you continue using your cash-back credit card. The running total of how much cash you\u2019ve earned should be easy to find on your monthly statement or via your online account.\n\nMake sure to stay within your credit limit, keep your account in good standing, and look closely at your cash-back credit card\u2019s details to find out how much you can earn on your purchases. Earn rates can vary based on time, such as when an introductory offer provides a higher rate of rewards and what kinds of products you purchase.\n\nHow to redeem cash-back\n\nOnce you have accumulated enough cash-back rewards, you can redeem them for statement credits, bank deposits, gift cards, or other rewards. Make sure to understand the redemption options and requirements of your card. Some may require you to meet a minimum threshold of cash-back rewards before redemption. If you don\u2019t have enough points available, you\u2019ll have to sit on them until you do.\n\nRedemption requirements by issuers\n\nEvery credit card provider has different rules when it comes to redeeming your cash back. Some allow monthly redemption, while others pay out annually. Other providers allow redemption only after you\u2019ve hit a certain threshold. The following are the payout requirements for the major cash-back credit card issuers:\n\nAmerican Express. All cash back earned is paid out annually on your September statement.\n\nBMO. Redeem as little as $1 in cash back as a statement credit. You can also set up automatic direct deposits to your BMO chequing or savings account starting at $25.\n\nCIBC. Cash-back redemptions start at $25. Any unredeemed cash back will appear on your January statement annually.\n\nRBC . Once you earn $25 in cash back, you can have the balance credited to your account at any time by calling in. Alternatively, all accumulated cash back will be credited to your account every January.\n\nScotiabank. All cash back earned appears as a credit on your November statement.\n\nTangerine. Paid monthly to your savings account or applied to your credit card balance.\n\nTD. You can redeem your cash back when you have a minimum amount of $25. Another option is to take your cash back annually every January where there is no minimum amount required.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Read our in-depth TD Cash Back Visa Infinite* Card review\n\nWhen is a good time to redeem my cash-back rewards?\n\nMany cash-back credit cards will allow you to redeem your rewards as soon as they reach a minimum threshold. But you can also save them up over time and cash them in for a more significant, single-shot pay-down of your credit card balance, for example.\n\nChoosing to redeem cash rewards on a regular basis is certainly satisfying. But it could mean dipping below your minimum threshold. The next time you want \u2014 or need \u2014 to use your rewards, you may not have enough at your disposal. Saving your cash back rewards to generate more impact \u2014 to ease the blow of a particularly big purchase \u2014 is a worthy strategy, too. But know that if you fail to keep your account in good standing or decide to close it suddenly, you could lose out on accumulated rewards.\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories refer to the specific spending categories or types of purchases that earn higher cash-back rewards on a credit card.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your credit card gives you 4% cash back on gas. If the card has a flat rate of 1%, this means you\u2019ll earn cash back on gas with a bonus rate of 3%, making it so all your gas purchases would give you 4% cash back. Since many gas stations sell other things, such as snacks and gift cards, you\u2019d also earn 4% cash back on any of those items.\n\nGenerally speaking, Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards offer multiple bonus categories. Getting a cash-back card that aligns with your spending patterns can be pretty lucrative. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, getting a cash-back credit card with an increased earn rate on groceries can significantly benefit you.\n\nYou\u2019ll earn cash back at an increased rate when making purchases in specific spending categories, but you\u2019ll still earn the base earn rate when you make purchases that don\u2019t fall under a bonus category or after you have reached the bonus category cash-back limit. The base earn rate differs for each cash-back credit card but typically ranges between 0.5% and 2%.\n\nCommon rewards categories\n\nCash-back categories can vary depending on the credit card and issuer, but here are some common categories in Canada:\n\nGrocery. Any purchase made at grocery stores, such as Loblaws, No Frills and Metro.\n\nGas. Includes any purchase made at a gas station or service station, like Shell, PetroCanada and Esso.\n\nRestaurants and dining. This usually includes takeout and food delivery services like Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes.\n\nTravel spending. Airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, etc.\n\nTransit and transportation. This may include taking an Uber, a taxi, or paying for public transportation.\n\nStreaming services. Monthly subscriptions to products like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.\n\nDrug stores and pharmacies. This may include purchases made at a drug store, like Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nEntertainment. This may include money you spend on tickets to the movies, theater, or a live music concert.\n\nBills and recurring payments. Including wireless phone, internet, and utility bills paid with a credit card.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that each credit card defines its categories differently and employs its own merchant category codes. For example, some cards may group gas and transportation. Some cards lump groceries and restaurants into a \u201cfood and drink\u201d category. To further complicate things, some merchants don\u2019t fall into the categories you would think they would. For example, Costco is not considered a grocery store. As far as credit card processors are concerned, Costco is a wholesale store.\n\nCredit card companies do not typically reveal all of the stores associated with a merchant category publicly. Still, you should be able to contact your credit card provider\u2019s customer service to ask about a specific store. Overall, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out what category your purchases will fall under, but you may need some trial and error.\n\nHow to choose a cash-back card\n\nBefore applying for a cash-back credit card, select the right one for you and ensure you\u2019re eligible.\n\nCompare cash-back credit card options\n\nWith dozens of cash-back credit cards available, comparing them all can be time-consuming. That said, there are a few things you should look at when considering any cash-back card.\n\nInterest rates . It\u2019s important to look closely at the interest rates associated with any cash-back credit cards you\u2019re considering; many start out in the 19.99% range. Zero interest is charged on balances paid in full every month, but if you don\u2019t, it can significantly add to your debt and erode the benefit of any cash-back rewards you earn.\n\nAnnual fee . Decide if you want to pay an annual fee or not. In most cases, paying a yearly fee means earning more cash back and getting better benefits. On the other hand, no-fee cash-back cards may have a lower earn rate, but if you don\u2019t charge much to your card, you could come out ahead compared to a card with a fee.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer . Cash-back credit cards in Canada commonly offer a sign-up bonus for new applicants. The welcome bonus usually comes as a higher cash-back rate for a set period. For example, you might get 10% cash back on all purchases up to $3,000 in spending. If the earn rates are similar with two cards, but one has an excellent welcome bonus, then you might as well take advantage of the promotion. Credit card bonus offers nearly always come with terms and conditions to be met, but be sure you read over the offer thoroughly and understand how much you may need to spend to qualify.\n\nBonus rewards categories . The increased earn rate on bonus categories is arguably the most critical factor when comparing cash-back cards. It\u2019s ideal to choose a card that gives you the most cash-back in the categories where you do the most spending. Remember that the amount you spend in bonus categories every year could earn you more than any welcome bonus offered.\n\nCredit card insurance and additional perks. Many cash-back credit cards offer various forms of insurance and additional benefits that may appeal to you. Some perks to look out for include: Travel insurance. Roadside assistance. Mobile device insurance. Credit card concierge services. Extended warranties. Purchase protection.\n\n\n\nMake sure you qualify\n\nEven though the benefits of a cash-back credit card are relatively simple to understand, you\u2019ll still have to reckon with a few eligibility requirements to consider before applying.\n\nAge and residency status . Most cash-back credit cards require you to be both a Canadian resident and the legal age of majority in the province where you live to apply for your own card. The age of majority is 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan. It\u2019s 19 everywhere in all other provinces.\n\nCredit score . A good credit score is required in most cases to qualify for a cash-back credit card. In Canada, a credit score that ranges between 660 and 724 is considered good. If you do not have a good credit score, consider a credit card designed for bad or no credit, a prepaid card, or a secured credit card instead of a cash-back credit card.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements. Some cash-back credit cards come with relatively lower income requirements, but if you want a higher-tier cash-back credit card, you\u2019ll likely need a higher income.\n\nHow to maximize your cash-back rewards\n\nThere are plenty of tricks to help you get the most out of your cash-back credit cards. The more tips you adopt, the more cash back you\u2019ll earn. That said, it\u2019s best only to follow the advice that you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nApply for a new card ahead of major expenses . Since many of Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards have a generous welcome bonus, it\u2019s often worth your trouble to apply for a new card before you make a major purchase. For example, let\u2019s say you need to renew your home and auto insurance, which will cost you about $2,000. You could apply for a cash-back credit card offering 10% cash back as the welcome bonus. Then, when you charge your insurance to your card, you\u2019d get $200 back.\n\nKeep your eye out for attractive intro offers and sign-up bonuses . Welcome offers are constantly changing, so watch for any current promotions. Getting 10% cash back for a set period is generous, but if the card also waives the annual fee for the first year, they\u2019re practically paying you to sign up. When you get close to 12 months of card membership, you might cancel the card before your annual fee posts. You could then apply for a new cash-back credit card with a strong bonus.\n\nPay attention to intro offer limits. Keep in mind that many cash-back credit cards have a limit on their sign-up offer. If you have a substantial purchase, you could apply for more than one card and split up your purchase to maximize your cash back. However, if you need to pay an annual fee for the new card, it may negate the cash back you earn, so pay attention to the details.\n\nCarry multiple cards . Many people focus on a single cash-back credit card, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having multiple credit cards. In fact, having more than one card is the easiest way to maximize your cash back. Start with a primary card that gives you an increased earn rate where you spend most of your spending. You could then complement that card with a no-fee card that gives you bonus categories where your primary card doesn\u2019t. Just use the credit card that gives you the most cash back whenever you shop.\n\nBuy gift cards in bonus categories . Groceries and gas are two of the most popular merchant categories where you\u2019ll earn additional cash back. Here\u2019s the thing: grocery stores and gas stations sell gift cards that can be used at many retailers. That essentially allows you to earn extra cash back.\n\nAdd supplementary users . Most credit cards allow you to add supplementary users. The advantage is that all authorized cardholders earn cash back on their purchases, including any bonus. Best of all, the cash back gets combined into a single pool, so you\u2019ll be racking up that cash back in no time.\n\nUse cash-back websites. Various online sites allow you to earn additional cash whenever you shop online. First, you need to create an account. Afterwards, you would select the partner retailers through their online portal. When you do your shopping, eligible purchases will earn you cash back. You\u2019ll earn cash back twice if you pay with your cash-back credit card.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nAnswering this question depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of your credit card.\n\nCash-back rewards may be the route to take if you\u2019re hoping for a little help paying your credit card bills, or want to earn rewards that are typically easy to calculate, collect and apply toward your balance.\n\nRewards points, however, can generally be redeemed in a wider variety of ways, including discounts on travel or merchandise. That flexibility can be very attractive to some consumers. However, the value of the points you collect can fluctuate, making tracking your points a more complicated endeavour than cash-back rewards.\n\nAre cash-back credit cards worth it?\n\nThere are two situations where a cash-back card might not be the right choice:\n\nIf you\u2019ll pay more in annual fees than you\u2019d earn in cash-back. If you can get a better return with a points-based rewards card. For example, let\u2019s say you got a travel rewards credit card and did the same spending. Would the points you earn be worth more than the cash back you could potentially earn? If so, it makes more sense to get a travel credit card.",

This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on a page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own.\n\nThe right business credit card can help companies earn rewards, discounts and other benefits that reduce overall operational costs. Used wisely, they can help keep a business\u2019s expenses organized and improve owners\u2019 credit scores, too.\n\nThe right business credit card can help companies earn rewards, discounts and other benefits that reduce overall operational costs. Used wisely, they can help keep a business\u2019s expenses organized and improve owners\u2019 credit scores, too.\n\nChoosing the right business credit card can mean earning valuable rewards, simplifying your bookkeeping, and potentially saving on overall operating costs. We analyzed dozens of Canadian business credit cards to find the best for a variety of businesses, whether you\u2019re a frequent flyer, a solo freelancer, or running a growing start-up.\n\nBest Credit Cards from Our Partners\n\nMethodology BACK TO TOP NerdWallet Canada selects the best credit cards based on overall consumer value as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nWhat to know about business credit cards in Canada\n\nBusiness credit cards can help simplify accounting, earn bigger rewards, and offer higher credit limits than many personal cards. As with other types of credit cards, they do come with unique rules, plus different perks, benefits, and features to consider.\n\nBusiness cards vs. personal cards\n\nCompared to personal cards, business credit cards generally have:\n\nHigher credit limits to cover bigger business purchases.\n\nTailored rewards on office supplies, internet services, cell phone bills and other business essentials.\n\nPotential for multiple employee cards with liability protection.\n\nWho can get a business credit card?\n\nSole proprietors, freelancers, side-hustlers.\n\nSmall-to-medium businesses.\n\nLarger corporations with high revenues.\n\nA formal business structure isn\u2019t always required. Usually, you just need to prove you have a legitimate income-generating activity. That means if you just started a small business and it is not yet turning a profit, a business credit card should still be within reach.\n\nReasons to use a business credit card\n\nTo separate expenses and simplify accounting. A clear line between personal and business spending makes tax deductions (like credit card interest and most fees) much simpler.\n\nTo earn valuable perks. A business credit card can also give you access to benefits \u2014 like expense tracking tools, higher earn rates on business-related purchases, and discounts on essentials like gas \u2014 that are not not commonly offered on personal cards.\n\nTo build business credit. Establishing a business credit history could help your business access future loans and higher levels of financing. Even if you have low or no income, certain secured or no-fee cards can jump-start your business credit.\n\nTypes of business credit cards\n\nSmall business credit cards Operate like personal cards but with business-oriented rewards and features. Sole proprietors and small business owners may rely on personal credit scores to qualify. Ideal for sole proprietors, small or mid-sized business owners with multiple employees, or brand-new ventures in Canada. Small business credit card options with no annual fees or lower interest rates can help reduce a new company\u2019s credit burden.\n\nCorporate cards Generally charge cards for larger companies with significant revenues. (American Express, for example, recommends its corporate credit cards to Canadian businesses with annual revenues of $10 million or more). May be distributed to employees. Fees and charges are the responsibility of the corporation, not individuals.\n\n\n\nPros and cons of business credit cards\n\nPros\n\nSimplifies accounting and budgets by separating personal and business expenses.\n\nEarns rewards, often at higher rates than most personal cards.\n\nPerks like travel insurance, airport lounge access, expense tracking, and other offerings that provide tangible business benefits.\n\nCan help build business credit for future financing, when used responsibly.\n\nTax deductions on fees and interest.\n\nCons\n\nPersonal creditworthiness can be negatively impacted if you fail to manage your credit card\u2019s balance.\n\nHigher interest rates than traditional loans or lines of credit.\n\nAnnual fees can add up, especially if a business uses multiple cards.\n\nRisk of misuse if multiple people have cards.\n\nHow to get a business credit card\n\nCompare your options\n\nWhen shopping around, look at:\n\nInterest rates on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances.\n\nAnnual fees for primary and additional cards.\n\nCredit limit offered.\n\nRewards programs \u2014 cash back and travel points are common \u2014 and earn rates.\n\nWelcome offers and enrollment bonuses (if you can meet spending thresholds).\n\nPerks like travel insurance, access to exclusive deals and business discounts.\n\nExpense management and tracking tools.\n\nMake sure you qualify\n\nQualifying means convincing credit card providers that they should do business with you. Typically, they assess:\n\nPersonal credit score. A \u201cgood\u201d credit score \u2014 660+ \u2014 is often required, especially if your business has limited credit history.\n\nIncome and revenue. Some business cards require a minimum annual revenue or personal income level.\n\nProof of business. Even freelancers and side-hustlers can qualify, but you may need to show documentation that proves your business generates income.\n\nSubmit your application\n\nApplying for a business credit card is similar to applying for a personal card, but you\u2019ll need to provide business documentation in addition to your personal information. Most applications can be completed online or in person.\n\nWhat you may need to apply: Personal identification \u2014 such as a valid driver\u2019s license, passport or other form of government-issued ID. Proof of business \u2014 for example, a Master Business License, Articles of Incorporation, or a trade name registration certificate \u2014 may be required. Financial statements \u2014 like, a personal Notice of Assessment, business activity statements, or recent bank statements \u2014 could be requested. New businesses \u2014 those less than two years old \u2014 are commonly subject to additional criteria and may need to provide a business plan, balance sheet, or cash flow statement to show financial viability.\n\n\n\nOnce you submit your application, approval times vary. Some credit card companies provide instant decisions, while others may take a few days to verify your documents.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip If you\u2019re building or repairing credit and fall short of income requirements \u2014 or you've been outright rejected \u2014 consider a secured business credit card. This option is generally easier to qualify for, and can help your business establish a positive credit profile over time.\n\nHow to get the most out of your business credit card\n\nThere are several ways you can maximize the value of your business credit card.\n\nPick relevant rewards. Earn in categories tailored to your business\u2019s actual spending.\n\nUse multiple cards to earn different kinds of rewards \u2014 one for airport perks, another for cash back, for example \u2014 but only if you can handle the payments\n\nPlan around promotional offers: Time your welcome bonuses and apply before heavy spending periods to hit spending thresholds. Use 0% intro APR periods strategically to save money on big purchases \u2014 so long as you pay the balances off before the offer expires.\n\nPay more than the minimum each month to limit interest charges.\n\nTake advantage of discounts on gas, car rentals and other business-related expenses.\n\nTrack costs \u2014 your spending, interest and fees paid \u2014 for potential tax deductions.",

Reported EPS is $2.52, expectations were $2.28.\n\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the RBC\u2019s 2025 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Asim Imran, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAsim Imran: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Also joining us today for your questions, Erica Nielsen, Group Head, Personal Banking; Sean Amato-Gauci, Group Head, Commercial Banking; Neil McLaughlin, Group Head, Wealth Management; Derek Neldner, Group Head, Capital Markets; and Jennifer Publicover, Group Head, Insurance. As noted on Slide 1, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. I would also remind listeners that the bank assesses its performance on a reported and adjusted basis and considers both to be useful in assessing underlying business performance.\n\nTo give everyone a chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit your questions and then re-queue. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDave McKay: Thanks, Asim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to mention our thoughts are with the families that have been impacted by the devastating fires in Southern California. RBC, together with City National Bank, has donated $3 million to support victims in the impacted areas. Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $5.1 billion, a record result that reflects RBC\u2019s financial and strategic strength amidst an evolving operating environment to start the fiscal year. Adjusted earnings of $5.3 billion were up 29% year-over-year or up 23% excluding adjusted earnings of $267 million from the acquisition of HSBC Canada. We reported a return on equity of 16.8% on the foundation of a strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.2%.\n\nOur premium ROE continues to create value for shareholders, with gross internal capital generation of 76 basis points, underpinning robust book value growth of 13% year-over-year. Strong revenue growth was driven by a well-diversified base, comprised of a balanced mix of net interest income and fee-based revenue. Net interest income was up 26% this quarter, results benefited from strong deposit growth in Personal Banking, strong loan growth in Commercial Banking and higher spreads. We also saw robust fee-based revenue growth with strong results across Wealth Management, Global Markets and Investment Banking, as we benefited from constructive markets and strong client activity. This quarter, we generated operating leverage of 13% or 8% on adjusted basis as we saw the benefits of our scale and the realization of cost synergies related to the acquisition of HSBC Canada.\n\nWe remain well positioned to achieve the full cost synergies of $740 million by early 2026, having achieved an annualized run rate savings of over $500 million or approximately 70% of our stated target. We expect to drive further efficiencies as our clients benefit from the investments we continue to make in our digital capabilities. Earlier this year, we made the mortgage renewal process easier and faster for clients through our streamlined option in the RBC mobile app, which was nearly \u2014 which has nearly 8 million active users. Clients who choose to renew through this option will be able to secure mortgage terms and virtual sign documents in a matter of minutes. RBC Direct Investing is now the only bank-owned brokerage in Canada to offer self-directed investors online international trading through leading global exchanges.\n\nWhile our PCL and impaired loans increased this quarter, they were largely within expectations given the point of the economic cycle. Going forward, we are maintaining our PCL guidance for the year, which Graeme will speak to shortly. Turning to the macro environment. We started the year operating amidst the backdrop of constructive markets and affirming of Canadian economic data, including moderating headline inflation levels and improving employment trends. Furthermore, we expect the Bank of Canada continue to take a more dovish stance, which should help consumer sentiment and growth. The widening gap between US and Canadian interest rates has resulted in a weaker Canadian dollar, which could partly buffer any tariff shock for American users of Canadian goods and services.\n\nAs Canada\u2019s largest financial institution, we have an important role to play in delivering advice, insights and value to our clients amidst the uncertainty, while also supporting our communities. Many of our clients continue to come to us for deeper advice in navigating the evolving environment, which has contributed to strong deposit flows and increased transactional activity in our market-related businesses. Having said that, rising uncertainty around trade policy and geopolitics, combined with immigration restrictions, may already be moderating client activity in certain parts of the Canadian economy. We are seeing signs of lower business confidence with some of our Commercial Banking clients opting to delay certain investment decisions.\n\nFurthermore, Canadian housing activity remains modest despite tailwinds from lower interest rates and changing mortgage rules. Moving forward, while we hope this uncertainty is short-term in nature, we are focused on the preparedness as opposed to the predictions. We have run several scenarios with respect to the depth, breadth and duration of potential tariffs. We believe we are in a strong position to navigate the uncertainty given the strength of our capital, our diversified funding, our brand, and our diversified business and geographic model. Similarly, Canada also has a strong foundation. We have the natural and human resources that the world is looking for. We have the capability to improve our access to major markets. The existing CUSMA trade agreement is a solid foundation.\n\nWhile it can always be improved, we are encouraged by the ongoing dialogue and believe there is a path forward that can drive prosperity for all across these economies. Importantly, this is a chance for Canada to make structural improvements to the country\u2019s economic productivity and competitiveness, including removing inter-provincial trade barriers and approving high-impact energy and infrastructure projects \u2014 products. This can drive future growth opportunities with significant benefits to Canadians. Amidst this uncertainty, ensuring we continue to operate with sufficient buffers takes on increased importance. Our stress testing suggests that even under a more severe scenario of lower revenue and higher credit losses, our capital levels would remain above regulatory minimums.\n\nWe are deeply committed to supporting our clients\u2019 growing financial needs through our award-winning advice and value propositions. We have also been repurchasing our stock this quarter and continue to see buybacks as a tactical lever to generate shareholder value. With this context, I will now speak to our key growth drivers, starting with our acquisition of HSBC Canada. Since the close-and-convert acquisition almost a year ago, we have generated cumulative adjusted pre-provision pre-tax earnings of over $950 million on a standalone basis, excluding the benefits of the cost synergies highlighting earnings generating power of this acquisition. Moving to Personal Banking, where we continue to leverage our client value proposition and foundational distribution advantage across our physical and digital channels.\n\nThis quarter, we saw outsized growth in our core banking accounts, which underpinned 18% deposit growth or 8% excluding the acquisition of HSBC. The acquisition of core deposits remains a focus as they provide us with data insights that allow us to better understand client needs, while also improving our risk management capabilities. Furthermore, they\u2019re an important source of lower-cost funding to support our clients\u2019 financing needs. As client need shift amidst an uncertain environment, we expect flows to shift between RBC savings and investment offerings. Mortgage growth remained modest, as we maintained our pricing discipline with respect to originations, while remaining focused on retaining client relationships as mortgages renew over the coming quarters.\n\nIn contrast, credit card balances grew due to the increased purchase volumes and seasonally higher revolve rates following the holidays. Turning to our Commercial Banking franchise, where we have leading market positions across small business and commercial clients. Loans and acceptances were up 35% year-over-year or up 10% excluding HSBC Canada. The majority of our growth has been with clients where we have long relationships. Deposit growth also remained strong, up 19% year-over-year or 8% excluding HSBC Canada. In the near term, Commercial Banking loan growth may moderate as clients hold back plans and investments amidst the tariff-driven uncertainty. However, absent more severe and sustained tariffs, we expect loan growth in the high-single-digit range through this year, including the benefits from our expanded client and specialist coverage related to HSBC Canada\u2019s acquisition.\n\nTurning to Capital Markets, which reported very strong results this quarter, generating record pre-provision pre-tax earnings of $1.7 billion. Global Markets reported over $2 billion in revenue this quarter, driven by strong performance in both equities and foreign exchange trading revenue, benefiting from increased client activity amidst an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Corporate Investment Banking was up 24% from last year, with our Investment Banking business benefiting from constructive market conditions and expanded scale across client and product verticals and supported by solid growth in Corporate Banking. Going forward, the uncertainty around trade policy could impact deal activity in the near-term, however, the resulting levels of volatility could be beneficial to our sales and trading businesses.\n\nFurthermore, we have robust client dialogue and a strong client engagement and remain well positioned to support our clients and take advantage of market opportunities as policy uncertainty moderates. Moving to our Wealth Management segment, where we look to leverage our growing advisor base, holistic advisory and banking solutions, and technology investments to serve client needs and enhance advisor productivity. Wealth Management revenue surpassed $5.5 billion for the first time, while generating nearly $1 billion in net income for the quarter. Assets under administration in US Wealth Management, including City National, increased to nearly US$700 billion. US net new assets represented an annualized 3% of opening AUA, excluding the reinvestment of interest and dividend income.\n\nIn addition to the uptick in client assets, we saw an increase in sweep deposits and securities-based lending as we look to enhance our offerings for US clients. In Canadian Wealth Management, where we have sector-leading advisor productivity, assets under administration increased 22% from last year, benefiting from higher markets and net new assets. And RBC Global Asset Management\u2019s assets under management increased 23% from last year, surpassing $700 billion for the first time. RBC GAM generated net sales of $11 billion this quarter, including nearly $4 billion of Canadian retail net sales as our clients continue to choose us as their trusted advisor amidst a volatile environment. To close, we\u2019ve had a strong start to fiscal 2025 amidst an evolving operating environment.\n\nWhile change is constant, so is our commitment to our clients and communities. Our strategies also continue to deliver leading risk-adjusted returns and long-term value to our shareholders. We look forward to our upcoming Investor Day on March 27, where we will discuss key strategic initiatives designed to accelerate our ambitions across our businesses and core geographies. With that, Katherine, over to you.\n\nKatherine Gibson: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 8, we reported record results this quarter, with diluted earnings per share coming in at $3.54. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.62, up 27% from last year, benefiting in part from the acquisition of HSBC Canada and FX translation impacts. Our record results were underpinned by double-digit revenue and earnings growth across each of our segments and reflected robust adjusted all-bank operating leverage of 7.7%. Turning to capital on Slide 9, our CET1 ratio remained strong at 13.2%, stable to last quarter. The solid growth in internal capital generation, net of dividends, was mostly deployed into organic businesses, particularly in Capital Markets and Personal Banking, and easily allowed the bank to earn through the net credit migration in the quarter.\n\nAs part of our capital deployment strategy, we also repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares this quarter for $338 million. Despite the macro uncertainty, our strategy of prioritizing capital allocation towards client-driven organic growth and increasing dividends in-line with earnings remains unchanged. We will also continue to be opportunistic in our use of buybacks while operating with a strong CET1 ratio above 12.5%. Should downside scenarios associated with rising trade tensions materialize, our experience during the pandemic serves as a good reminder of the benefit of our strong recurring and diversified earnings streams, which will continue to act as the primary absorber of any deterioration. Furthermore, our capital buffer, which sits well above the regulatory minimum, provides a strong second line of defense.\n\nMoving to Slide 10, all-bank net interest income was up 26% year-over-year, or up 27% excluding trading revenue. These results benefited from the addition of HSBC Canada, solid volume growth in both Personal Banking and Commercial Banking, as well as higher spreads in Personal Banking and the impact of foreign exchange translation. All-bank net interest margin, excluding trading revenue, was down 1 basis point from last quarter as the impact of higher securities balances in Capital Markets was mostly offset by favorable product mix in Personal Banking and Commercial Banking. Canadian Banking NIM was up 7 basis points from last quarter, mainly driven by strong growth in non-maturity deposits, which were up approximately 3% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nUnderpinning this strong growth has been positive flows from GICs and external sources into non-maturity deposits. NIM also continued to benefit from our tractored deposit strategy. These benefits were partly offset by ongoing competition for term deposits, which we expect to persist throughout the year. Looking forward, we are increasing our 2025 all-bank net interest income growth guidance. We expect high-single-digit to low-double-digit net interest income ex trading revenue growth in 2025, up from the mid- to high-single-digit range guidance provided last quarter. The increase in our guidance reflects stronger-than-expected growth in non-maturity deposits this quarter, as well as better-than-expected spreads on both mortgages and GICs. While our guidance has increased, the wide range reflects the evolving operating environment.\n\nMoving to Slide 11, reported non-interest expenses were up 11% from last year. Core expense growth as guided to last quarter was elevated, coming in at 13% year-over-year, impacted in part by the contribution of run rate expenses associated with the acquisition of HSBC Canada. The main driver of growth, however, was higher variable compensation, which was commensurate with strong results in Wealth Management and Capital Markets. Other staff-related costs associated with increased FTE and severance also contributed to the increase. Looking ahead, we will remain diligent in managing our cost base. We expect all-bank core expense growth, which is off a base of reported 2024 expenses, to be at the upper end of our mid-single-digit guidance range for 2025.\n\nWe continue to expect positive operating leverage for the year. The move to the upper end of our core expense growth guidance reflects higher-than-expected variable compensation in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect a faster pace of core expense growth in the first half of the year, reflecting the inclusion of HSBC Canada results and, to a lesser extent, investments for our next phase of growth. As a reminder, core expense growth includes run rate costs associated with the HSBC Canada acquisition, but excludes the impact of FX and share-based compensation. Turning to taxes. The adjusted non-TEB effective tax rate was 20.4% this quarter, up from 19.5% last quarter. The increase reflects the impact of Pillar II tax legislation, which was embedded in our guidance provided last quarter, as well as changes in earnings mix.\n\nTurning to our Q1 segment results that begin on Slide 12, Personal Banking reported earnings of $1.7 billion. Focusing on Personal Banking Canada, net income was up 26% year-over-year. Excluding $91 million of NIAT from HSBC Canada, Personal Banking Canada net income rose a strong 19% year-over-year, benefiting from close to 4% operating leverage. Organic net interest income was up 15% from last year, reflecting higher spreads and a robust 8% growth in deposits. Organic non-interest income was up 7% year-over-year, underpinned by higher mutual fund distribution fees, mainly from capital appreciation and the benefit of branch net sales. Turning to Slide 13, Commercial Banking NIAT of $777 million rose 20% from a year ago, including $73 million from HSBC Canada.\n\nNet income growth was impacted in part by higher credit provisions across a few sectors, which Graeme will touch on shortly. On a pre-provision pretax basis, earnings were up 32%, or 9% year-over-year, excluding HSBC Canada, driven by solid volume growth and higher service charges. Loan and deposit growth were solid at 10% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Importantly, the loan book we acquired through the acquisition of HSBC Canada is starting to show momentum and is up over recent months in-line with the growth of the Commercial Banking back book. Commercial Banking\u2019s efficiency ratio improved to 33%, reflecting positive operating leverage of 1%. Turning to Wealth Management on Slide 14, NIAT of $980 million rose 48% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in fee-based client assets across our businesses.\n\nWe added over $20 billion in net new assets across our North American Wealth Advisory and Global Asset Management businesses as momentum built in long-term retail mutual fund net sales. Higher revenue was partly offset by higher variable compensation. City National generated US$60 million in adjusted earnings this quarter, impacted in part by US$31 million taken on performing loans related to the California wildfires. We are seeing good momentum in enhancing City National\u2019s profitability, and we remain committed to these efforts. Turning to Capital Markets results on Slide 15, record net income of $1.4 billion increased 24% from last year, benefiting from broad-based revenue growth and FX translation impacts. Pre-tax pre-provision earnings surpassed $1.7 billion in the quarter, up 31% from last year.\n\nCorporate and Investment Banking revenue was up 24% from last year. Excluding the impact of loan underwriting markdowns in the prior year, revenue was up 18%, reflecting higher loan syndication revenue in North America, the impact of increased lending balances and spreads, as well as higher debt origination, primarily in the US. Global Markets revenue was up 24% as robust client engagement and a constructive market backdrop drove higher equity trading across most regions and increased FX trading in Canada. Q1 is Capital Markets\u2019 seasonally strongest quarter. And while we expect business momentum to remain strong, we anticipate typical seasonal declines in pre-tax pre-provision earnings through the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 16, Insurance net income of $272 million was up 24% from last year, mainly due to higher insurance service results, driven by the $65 million impact of reinsurance contract recaptures and improved claims experience across the majority of our products.\n\nThis was partially offset by lower insurance investment results, primarily reflecting higher favorable investment-related experience in the prior period on the transition to IFRS 17. To conclude, we are very pleased with the strong momentum across our core businesses to start the year, which underpinned a robust adjusted ROE of 17.2% on a strong [CE1] (ph) base of 13.2%. Looking ahead, our financial and strategic strength, including our diversified businesses and revenue streams, positions us well to navigate uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. With that, I will turn it over to Graeme.\n\nGraeme Hepworth: Thank you, Katherine, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll now discuss our allowances in the context of the current macroeconomic environment and the path ahead as we navigate uncertainty from the evolving geopolitical risks that Dave noted earlier. The underlying performance of the US and Canadian economies have been largely positive over the quarter, although the Canadian economy is still underperforming. We expect the Bank of Canada to continue gradually cutting rates into the middle of 2025, providing further relief for borrowers, while the US Federal Reserve is now expected to hold rates steady throughout 2025. Notwithstanding these factors, it remains highly uncertain how the prospect of tariffs will impact the broader economy.\n\nThe impact will vary based on the extent and duration of tariffs, retaliatory measures, progress in removing barriers to domestic trade and the availability of fiscal support measures. To provide some context on how the tariff uncertainties reflected in our provisions, recall that under IFRS 9, our performing allowances reflect not only our baseline expectations, but the potential for weaker economic conductions reflected through a series of pessimistic scenarios. These scenarios have been highlighted on Slide 36. While broad and sustained tariffs could create recessionary conditions, the range of outcomes are well within the pessimistic scenarios we currently consider. And despite the positive US and Canadian economic signs noted earlier, we kept our downside risk weights at an elevated level this quarter to account for this new uncertainty.\n\nGoing forward, as the tariff situation evolves, we will continue to reflect known outcomes through our baseline scenario and any of the ongoing uncertainty through potentially new or amended downside scenarios. Turning to Slide 18, we took a total of $68 million of provisions on performing loans this quarter, mainly reflecting unfavorable changes in portfolio composition, including a $45 million provision related to the California wildfires. This was partially offset by a favorable impact from our macroeconomic forecast and the migration of one large Capital Markets account in the other services sector from performing to impaired. I\u2019ll expand upon this in a moment. Excluding the impact of the wildfires and the transfer of this one Capital Markets account, provisions on performing loans is similar with recent history.\n\nMany of our CMB clients were directly impacted by the California wildfires. RBC\u2019s related credit exposure consists primarily of residential mortgages and loans in the fire zone that amount to just under $1 billion. The absolute nature of the client base, low loan-to-value ratios, and effective insurance coverage substantially mitigate the credit risk of this tragic event. Additionally, we have established a prudent allowance that provides coverage for residual uncertainty, reflecting the potential for lengthy recovery efforts and the possible depreciation of land values. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter where we added reserves on performing loans, resulting in a total ACL of $6.9 billion. We remain confident these allowances provide strong coverage relative to current and anticipated PCL on impaired loans.\n\nMoving to Slide 19, gross impaired loans of $7.9 billion were up $2 billion or 19 basis points this quarter, primarily driven by Capital Markets and Commercial Banking. As a reminder, last quarter, we highlighted that our strong credit performance in our Capital Markets portfolio over the last two quarters was unlikely to continue. Outcomes this quarter are reflective of the ongoing challenges in the current credit environment and the uneven timing of losses that can occur within our wholesale portfolio. In Capital Markets, a $1.5 billion new formation relates to the impairment of the previously mentioned account in the other services sector. This former investment-grade utility borrower was originated with a strong capital structure and has operated in a heavily regulated environment.\n\nMost recently, the borrower has been impacted by changes to regulatory and environmental expectations that require significant investment to address. We have been provisioning for this outcome and, relative to the size of this exposure, losses are expected to be manageable. In Commercial Banking, new formations remain elevated driven by a few large impairments in the real estate-related, consumer discretionary and agriculture sectors. However, several of the largest new formations in the real estate and related sector have recently returned to performing status. Turning to Slide 20, PCL on impaired loans of 39 basis points was up 13 basis points quarter-over-quarter or $345 million, with provisions higher across all segments. In Personal Banking, provisions were up $66 million, with our unsecured portfolios continuing to be the main drivers of losses.\n\nIn our mortgage portfolio, impairments and provisions are increasing in line with our expectations. Clients are showing resilience as they face higher refinancing costs, supported by stable home prices and lower rates. In our Commercial Banking portfolio, provisions came in higher this quarter. These outcomes are not unexpected given where we are in the economic cycle. Most notably this quarter, we took additional provisions on previously impaired loans in the forest products and automotive sectors, and new provisions in the consumer discretionary and industrial product sectors. With respect to the performance of the Commercial Banking portfolio acquired from HSBC Canada, it is driving a disproportionate share of Commercial Banking PCL on impaired loan, predominantly driven by a few larger accounts in economically sensitive sectors, an area where HSBC was more concentrated.\n\nGiven the HSBC portfolio also indexes to larger client sizes, provisions can be uneven. Since [legal day one] (ph), two HSBC names accounted for 54% of the cumulative HSBC PCL on impaired loans. Given the mix of the HSBC portfolio, we do expect PCL for this portfolio to remain elevated for the next few quarters, but not at the levels we experienced in Q1. With nearly a full year of experience with the HSBC portfolio, we have conducted our standard credit reviews for the majority of HSBC borrowers. On that basis, we remain confident in the overall credit quality of the loans we acquired and believe the combined portfolio will continue to benefit from greater diversification that will support strong through-the-cycle performance. In Capital Markets, provisions were up $191 million, mainly due to the large account noted earlier in the other services sector.\n\nTo conclude, despite being impacted by several unique factors and areas of weakness this quarter, we are seeing offsetting strength in other segments of the portfolio. All this reflects the breadth, scale and diversification of our combined franchise. We still expect full year 2025 provisions on impaired loans to remain within the guidance previously provided. We remain prudent in building reserves on performing loans as we navigate uncertainties across multiple fronts. Moving forward, while we remain confident in our Stage 3 PCL guidance for 2025, the uncertainty in the policy environment, specifically related to tariffs, could impact the likelihood and timing of allowance releases and peak PCL. Credit outcomes will continue to be dependent on the magnitude of change in unemployment rates, the direction of magnitude of changes in interest rates and commercial and residential real estate prices.\n\nAs always, we continue to proactively manage risk through the cycle, and we remain well capitalized to withstand possible yet more severe macroeconomic and geopolitical outcomes. With that, operator, let\u2019s open the lines for Q&A.\n\nQ&A Session\n\nFollow Royal Bank Canada Montreal Que (NYSE:RY) Follow Royal Bank Canada Montreal Que (NYSE:RY) or Subscribe with Google We may use your email to send marketing emails about our services. Click here to read our privacy policy.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take questions from the telephone line. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from John Aiken from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Aiken: Good morning. I was hoping that you could expand upon the performance of City National in the quarter. If we take into account the incremental provisions that you indicated for the California wildfires, performance seems to be quite solid. Can you talk to where you stand in terms of the ongoing operational improvement and profitability increases that you\u2019ve been looking for? And what we may be able to expect for the rest of the year?\n\nDave McKay: Yeah. Thanks, John, it\u2019s Dave, for that question. We continue, to your point, to make very good progress in our City National franchise. I was actually out there last week with the team, and remain really encouraged about the client franchise, the momentum that we\u2019re starting to build across a number of fronts. It\u2019s still a heavy lift on the overall re-platforming from a number of fronts, but we\u2019ll get a lot of that work done this year. So, I think from that perspective, we continue to work through it on the schedule that we\u2019ve told you. When you look at volume growth, we continue to run off single-service clients in the commercial space, bringing on multi-product clients. I had a chance to meet with a number of clients last week, and the ability to cross-sell, I think, more importantly, is critical.\n\nThe group, as we\u2019ll show you in the Investor Day, continues to build out platforms to sell into the Wealth Management space, and we\u2019re launching that as we speak. So, we feel good. Commercial loan growth, as you probably noted, is a little muted given the run-off/run-on, but the pipelines are building really nicely. And as the runoff starts to slow as we de-market, you\u2019ll start to see better growth there. And again, we have to finish the job on the re-platforming and the regulatory remediation, and we\u2019re doing well on that front also. So, net-net, we feel good about the franchise, and you\u2019ll hear more about it in a few weeks.\n\nJohn Aiken: Great. Thanks for the color, Dave. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca, TD Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMario Mendonca: Good morning. So, at first blush, that big increase in formations seems disconcerting, but on closer review, like Page 22 or something, I could see that the majority or like a meaningful amount of it relates to that one credit and other services. So, maybe help me understand what\u2019s going on there. What happened in the quarter that would \u2014 because you knew something was up with this credit because you built up a meaningful performing. Something happened in the quarter that caused you to impair it. If you could just speak to what that was? And then, how do you get confidence that the collateral is good that you don\u2019t need to build more provisions against this?\n\nGraeme Hepworth: Hi, Mario, it\u2019s Graeme. Thanks for that question. You, obviously, noted right that this quarter, a significant tick-up in gross impaired loans was hugely driven by this one account in utility sector. That accounted for about $1.5 billion of the new formations. And if you set that aside, I would say, new formations have kind of largely been in-line with where we\u2019ve been traveling for the last few quarters. This account, we\u2019ve seen it facing some headwinds and some struggles for the past year, and we\u2019ve been downgrading that along the way. That\u2019s why those downgrades and some of the kind of management overlays we take on top of that have been the drivers for why we built up the Stage 2 loan loss reserves against that in prior quarters.\n\nBut as many of these accounts go, it progressed to a more kind of formal situation in its restructuring, and that kind of triggered us moving it into impaired status this quarter. And with the information that we gleaned through that restructuring process is then how we firm up our reserves to where we are. There still is a degree of uncertainty around this account, but I think the range of scenarios we\u2019ve considered in that workout process, our teams are very close to the restructuring that\u2019s going on there, I think we feel pretty good about that we\u2019re pretty meaningfully in the range of where we think this lands in the coming quarters.\n\nMario Mendonca: And Graeme, is it common for Royal to have like $1.5 billion hold on a single credit? Is that \u2014 my impression, that seemed a lot high to me. But perhaps that\u2019s normal, maybe Royal is really that big and can absorb that sort of thing.\n\nGraeme Hepworth: I think that\u2019s also a very good question, Mario. Let me just start with a couple of comments, but then I\u2019ll turn to Derek on that too to give you a bit of context for the client situation here. But you are right, like, this is an investment-grade utility so, naturally, we will have higher holds for those type of situations. But this is certainly beyond what I would say is a natural hold size for us on the larger end. And when we get into larger holds, it\u2019s typically associated with kind of a transactional situation where it might be more temporal in nature. Unfortunately, things have deteriorated during that period. So maybe Derek can provide a little bit more context on the background here.\n\nDerek Neldner: Sure. Thanks for the question, Mario. Building on what Graeme said, I think he\u2019s bang-on that, traditionally, if you look at an investment-grade name, we would have meaningful holds, but this would certainly be a larger exposure than what we would have across the rest of the book. This specific client has been a very long-standing client of the firm, going back multiple decades. We would typically support them through a revolver hold. There would be meaningful size, but much smaller than the exposure we had here. As Graeme said, at various points in time over that historical relationship, we\u2019ve had different transactions or just moments in time where the client needed a shorter-term or more temporal increase. That was the situation here where we had some bilateral exposure for a period of time.\n\nAnd unfortunately, given the way the situation deteriorated following our origination of that, we ended up with an outsized exposure, obviously, at a time when it went into a more difficult scenario in restructuring.\n\nMario Mendonca: One quick thing on US margin. I was a little surprised to see that come down considering what we\u2019ve seen from the US regionals in their Q4 and all the chatter about better deposit dynamics, rates higher for longer. The US regionals were talking of margins in a big way. We didn\u2019t see it at Royal. Can you speak to that?\n\nKatherine Gibson: Yes, Mario, it\u2019s Katherine. I\u2019ll take your question. So, City National, as we\u2019ve talked about before, is asset sensitive. And so, what you\u2019re seeing as it flows through the book is basically the straight impact of the reduction in the Fed rate. And so that\u2019s what you would have seen on the deposit side as well as the loan side. We\u2019ve got hedging in place. So, we have secured through that downside environment in the rate. And so, as we go forward, we actually expect to see stability in that margin slightly increase as we go forward.\n\nDave McKay: I would just add, it\u2019s Dave, we have a slightly higher beta clients, obviously, with affluent, high-net-worth clients, interest-bearing accounts. So, whereas the regionals would have, like we do in Canada, a greater share in non-interest-bearing accounts.\n\nMario Mendonca: Makes sense. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe just sticking with the margin, Katherine, if I heard you right, you talked about when you gave your NII guidance, that mortgage and GIC spreads were better. Just talk to us in terms of, is that margin expansion in Canada driven by just balance sheet dynamics, hedging, et cetera, or is there also a reflection that competitive environment is well-behaved at the moment?\n\nKatherine Gibson: Thank you for the question, Ebrahim. So, speaking to the margins that you would have seen play out this quarter for Canadian Banking, you\u2019re bang on, basically, the dynamics that we saw at play with increasing spreads in mortgages. And on the GIC front, it was \u2014 it came in better than what we expected, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a driver in increasing our guidance. For the product mix shift, again, you would have heard me in my comments, we\u2019re seeing a positive shift with GICs basically being largely flat quarter-over-quarter, but the non-maturity deposits being up 3% quarter-over-quarter. And with that shift, it\u2019s definitely accretive to our margins. On the competitive front, I think that is still something that\u2019s definitely at play. And as, again, I noted in my comments, we\u2019re seeing the competitive pressure, but not to the same degree as what we had forecasted.\n\nErica Nielsen: Yeah. Maybe just a couple \u2014 Ebrahim, it\u2019s Erica. Just a couple of sentiments on the competitive dynamic. I would say that in both of those markets, we \u2014 it remains very competitive. I would say that we think about how we\u2019re going to ensure that we serve the needs of the Canadian or the RBC customer and how we win. And so, what you\u2019re seeing in the dynamics in this last quarter is our ability to really do a good job of managing that price to the end-state while winning the volume that we want in the marketplace. And we expect that intensity and the competitive nature of that. I mean, in the mortgage business, we\u2019re heading into the spring market, we always see the dynamics of the spring market play out differently than other times in the year. And so, we\u2019re ready and prepared for the intensity to continue.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Dave, a quick one for you. How do you manage the business right now? Is the marching orders to the troops play offense, play defense, or are there different orders depending on the market? Just give us a sense, even during the call, there were new headlines on tariffs. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re going about putting \u2014 running the bank right now in terms of growth versus managing for sort of a downside scenario. Thanks.\n\nDave McKay: It\u2019s a great question. I think we come off constructive markets. We have these possible scenarios going forward, but we remain hopeful that we find outcomes here that don\u2019t do damage to both economies. So, we are still helping our clients grow \u2014 not every client is pulling back. Some clients are pulling back, but there are many clients that are still moving forward with confidence as they have business models that aren\u2019t affected by the overall scenario. You\u2019ve got to believe that when \u2014 if that much damage is done on both sides with across-the-board tariffs that, hopefully, we find a better solution than that, and we can move these issues forward without doing severe damage to both economies, particularly the US economy.\n\nSo, I think we\u2019re in a \u2014 our clients are being more cautious obviously, and we will take their cue, but you\u2019re going to see, I think, pretty strong opportunities across a number of areas as well. So, we are balanced in our approach. And if things deteriorate, we\u2019ll review that, but right now, we\u2019re \u2014 we have a lot of momentum and we\u2019re going to continue to serve our clients as they need.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Meny Grauman from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\n\nMeny Grauman: Hi, good morning. Dave, as we think through the worst-case scenario for tariffs, I\u2019m just curious your perspective in terms of what\u2019s a bigger challenge, tariffs or COVID, both from the overall economic perspective and RBC specifically?\n\nDave McKay: I think it depends on \u2014 COVID was really difficult at the beginning as this could be in that there was enormous uncertainty and managing uncertainty is where the challenge lies. So, when we entered COVID, in March, and we started shutting the economy down, and we didn\u2019t understand the nature of support programs and how people would get through that, it was incredibly uncertain and stressful. If there are across-the-board tariffs, then we\u2019ll have a similar kind of trajectory, that we\u2019ll have to figure out what\u2019s the impact, what the nature of support programs coming out, how \u2014 what\u2019s the duration. All of that was uncertain in the pandemic. And hopefully, we could clarify that uncertainty. So, managing the uncertainty is what we do.\n\nWe plan for scenarios. So, I can\u2019t say one\u2019s harder than the other. They both have a lot of similarities in that the impacts will range, as Graeme said, and time the tariffs are in, the nature of the tariffs, whether they\u2019re broad-based or not, or more and more specific, which is a more likely scenario, you\u2019ll go through a period of uncertainty where you work though. The world is not going to collapse overnight. So, it\u2019s very different. So, this should be more manageable at the end of the day. We\u2019re not shutting the whole economy down like we had to during COVID. So, I would expect, whatever the scenario is, this should be more manageable.\n\nMeny Grauman: Got it. So, you\u2019re saying like a longer \u2014 it will take longer to play out, this tariffs scenario.\n\nDave McKay: Yeah.\n\nMeny Grauman: Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine, National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\n\nGabriel Dechaine: Hey, good morning. Just a couple on the performing provision. So, the actual performing piece that was low, but that\u2019s because you released some Stage 2 to book into Stage 3 for that one loan. Can you give me the number of Stage 2 releases associated with that account? And then, the \u2014 you gave some, Slide 36 I think it is, where you\u2019re kind of \u2014 you\u2019re giving us some sense of the economic scenarios underperforming or performing ACL. And if I look at the pessimistic one with 7% GDP contraction, 10% unemployment, that does line up to the worst-case scenario as if we get the more severe tariff situation. Are you able to tell me, if you were to \u2014 if that becomes your base case, what\u2019s the uptick in performing ACL? Because it\u2019s not your basic case now.\n\nGraeme Hepworth: Yeah. Gabe, thanks, it\u2019s Graeme. Good couple of questions there. On your first question, the utility account we\u2019ve been talking about, so we had built up about $110 million of allowances on that name over prior quarters, most of that coming in Q4. So that would have been released out of performing. And then, we added $165 million in Stage 3. So, net-net, from P&L perspective, that\u2019s $55 million, but from a [performing loan] (ph) perspective, that reduced performing to $110 million. So that\u2019s why we indicated, absent that, we would have been building in roughly the same range where we have for the last few quarters. In terms of the scenarios, it\u2019s good a question. Going back to my comments in my speech, we\u2019ve looked at a whole range of scenarios here, ranging from kind of very severe across-the-board tariffs, global impact through to \u2014 we looked at the different Bank of Canada scenarios that they\u2019ve been articulating, through to more targeted scenarios and kind of the impacts of things like the steel and aluminum.\n\nAnd so, the range of outcomes there is very, very broad. We provided this slide just to highlight to you that none of those scenarios we\u2019ve looked at are outside what we already include in our IFRS 9 provisioning, right? And so, for context, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever provided this data point before, we already attribute about 35% weighting to those three pessimistic scenarios in our IFRS 9 construct, right? So, we already attribute a fairly significant weighting to these pessimistic outcomes. In tariffs, we might just have what could be the driver of them. I guess the other \u2014 to your other question and just to give you a context, we take the pessimistic, the general pessimistic of those three scenarios, the one we attach the most weight to, and it\u2019s kind of in the middle of the pack of the three scenarios, but would be in line with kind of the higher end of the tariff considerations we read about.\n\nIf we shifted 100% to that, you\u2019d be looking at an ACL \u2014 performing ACL increase of about 30%. And so that gives you a marker on the high end of what possibly could play out. I\u2019ll just add on to the question earlier about comparing it to COVID, like, again, I don\u2019t see any of this having the same day one impact as COVID did. As Dave said, that was complete shutdown of the economy. This is much more targeted. That\u2019s assuming it plays out kind of in that worst-case scenario, let alone kind of government actions, et cetera, coming into play on it. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of context, Gabe, and a marker there that helps a little bit.\n\nGabriel Dechaine: No, that\u2019s great. Very, very clear. I mean, I have to re-read the Graeme Hepworth section within the transcript again, but very helpful.\n\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Paul Holden from CIBC. Please go ahead.\n\nPaul Holden: Thank you. Good morning. And just to be very clear, sorry, just to follow up on that topic, Graeme, just to be very clear, you didn\u2019t increase performing PCLs for potential tariff risk because you believe your pessimistic scenario is plus, the way you\u2019ve put towards those pessimistic scenarios are already adequate enough?\n\nGraeme Hepworth: Well, for where we\u2019re at, yes. I would say, I mean, again, other factors came into play this quarter, if we set tariffs aside and we look at kind of everything else that\u2019s playing, as Dave commented, we\u2019ve seen some better-than-expected strength in Canada this past quarter, the inflation situation seems to be now contained. And so, all of that probably would have led us to a spot that we would have reduced our weights on the pessimistic this quarter. Because of the tariffs, we did not do that. And so, in that sense, we didn\u2019t build for it, but we certainly kind of held back on some releases. I think likewise, as we looked at it, our baseline expectations are certainly on the more conservative end of the spectrum of what you see in the market.\n\nAnd so, all of those are kind of the factors that we considered this quarter. But I think the key to going forward, we\u2019ll continue to monitor this. And as we learn more, we\u2019ll impound that in our base case. We\u2019ll continue to reflect on the uncertainty and whether we think we need to build more for that or again, likewise, push off potential releases, but we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that as we learn more through the quarter.\n\nPaul Holden: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And that kind of leads to my second question. So, no change in the impaired PCL guidance for the year despite obviously a high start to the year, you\u2019ve highlighted why. Your previous guidance, I think, incorporated an expectation that impaired PCLs would peak second half of the year. So maybe let\u2019s attribute that to sort of Canadian retail. Is that still your expectation or maybe that has improved or changed just because of the point you highlighted, Canadian economy ex tariffs has actually started to do better than previously expected?\n\nGraeme Hepworth: Right, that\u2019s good question. And maybe just to kind of break down the guidance a little bit. In terms of where we\u2019re going to peak for the year, well, given what transpired in Q1, primarily driven by that one account, we don\u2019t expect the rest of the year to be above that. But if we normalize for the kind of the utility account that added about 7 basis points to Stage 3 this quarter, we still feel good about the trajectory for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re holding the overall forecast that we guided to in Q4 in the same. The component parts there, I would say retail is still consistent with where we were in Q4. We continue to expect both unsecured and secured products to accrete up throughout the year.\n\nAnd so, we would anticipate we\u2019ll peak out towards the end of the year. Wholesale, again, harder to trend quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to expect wholesale to be at elevated levels. It differs business by business. CMB is probably seeing a more balanced scorecard, Capital Markets, the same, Commercial being impacted more by the conditions in Canada. And so, that\u2019s probably more overall neutral throughout the rest of the year. But when we put all that together, I think we still feel good about the range we\u2019re in. And it\u2019s somewhat supported by the strength of the economy to date. How do tariffs play into all that? I wouldn\u2019t expect the tariffs to have a huge impact on Stage 3 in 2025. I think the impact of that really will play its way through into 2026.\n\nI think 2025 will be more what we do with our Stage 1 and 2 in terms of tariffs.\n\nPaul Holden: That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll leave it there for interest of time. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The last question is from Lemar Persaud, Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nLemar Persaud: Yeah, thanks. Maybe for Katherine, just wondering if you could just double-click on what gives you the confidence to take the NII guidance higher. I guess, just given the uncertain outlook of the impact of these tariffs on volume growth, increased macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential implications on competition, that could impact like mortgage spreads. Is there some element of revenue synergies on HSBC incorporated in there or maybe FX benefits that you didn\u2019t mention? Or is it really \u2014 or is it just down to the benefits of these non-maturity deposits and spreads in mortgages and GIC is just that great? Thanks.\n\nKatherine Gibson: Hi, Lemar, thank you for the question. You basically hit all the key parts for driving our guidance up for the quarter. The one item that I would add is FX that did \u2014 was a positive tailwind for us. So, just going back to the key drivers, it was the positive results we saw in Q1 from the spreads as well as the product mix, the FX. And to your question, HSBC has always been included in our guidance. And so, no change in our assumption there going forward.\n\nLemar Persaud: But you\u2019re not adding in like revenue synergies expectations on HSBC that you haven\u2019t quantified yet. Is that part of it? Is that a piece of it or no?\n\nKatherine Gibson: That\u2019s not part of why we changed. Back to the reasons that I articulated, it is what we\u2019re seeing in our results for Q1, and we felt it was appropriate to take up our guidance given the strong results.\n\nLemar Persaud: Okay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions [with us] (ph) at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Dave McKay.\n\nDave McKay: I want to thank everybody for their questions. Great questions. Obviously, we understand the focus on the credit side. But I do want to bring the messaging back to just Canadian economy performed through most of the quarter better than we thought. Client activity was strong across all our businesses. And I think you saw the benefit of that, whether it\u2019s Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Consumer Bank had an outstanding quarter, Commercial Bank. Lots of client activity. Our compete level was very high. We gained market share. That drove really strong revenue performance across the board with some margin expansion. Margin expansion was really benefited from our strategic focus on deposits. You\u2019ve heard us talk for deposits for a decade, but it\u2019s consumer deposits, commercial deposits, continue to build out RBC Clear, as you\u2019ll hear more about at the end of March.\n\nAnd therefore, that it provides us with a nice tailwind coming out into the rest of the year. There is uncertainty, obviously. A lot of your questions are around the uncertainty. We face that uncertainty knowing that we have plans, we have stability, we\u2019re working with our clients. We\u2019re hoping for the best, preparing for the worst. And we\u2019re really in a great position to help our clients. Volatility does help the business, a number of the businesses as well, and we\u2019ve capitalized that on the Capital Markets side. So, feeling very good about how we started the year. You heard from Graeme, great questions around where we came on the credit side, a few lumpy issues there. But overall, we feel good about our book and how it\u2019s going to perform and continue to build the business and drive really strong shareholder returns.\n\nSo, thank you for your questions, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.\n\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s economy was heating up heading into 2025, but the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to the White House threatens to snuff out those burgeoning flames.\n\nStatistics Canada reported Friday that real gross domestic product rose 2.6 per cent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s well above calls from the consensus of economists polled by Reuters ahead of the release, as well as the Bank of Canada, both of which expected real GDP to rise 1.8 per cent annualized.\n\nThe agency said household spending in the quarter rose at its fastest pace in more than two years. The surge was driven by purchases of new trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles.\n\nTD Bank director of economics James Orlando said in an interview that interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada through 2024 gave a boost to consumer confidence heading into the end of the year.\n\nCheaper borrowing costs helped convince consumers they could afford a new auto loan or their mortgage renewal wouldn\u2019t bite as hard, spurring some to loosen their purse strings.\n\n\u201cYou go to shopping malls, you go to auto dealerships, you go to restaurants and they\u2019re full,\u201d Orlando said.\n\n\u201cCanadians are roaring back right now and they\u2019re out spending. So that\u2019s what\u2019s spawning this rise in GDP.\u201d\n\nStatCan said real GDP rose 0.2 per cent in December and its early estimate calls for growth to slightly accelerate to 0.3 per cent in January.\n\nRetail activity was particularly strong in the final month of the year. StatCan said December\u2019s 2.6 per cent growth in retail trade was the biggest jump since June 2021, when in-person shopping restrictions tied to the COVID-19 pandemic began to loosen.\n\nDespite disruptions from the Canada Post strike, the transportation sector bumped higher in December, thanks to a surge in business for couriers and the end of rail and port strikes in November leading to a rebound in growth.\n\nFriday\u2019s release also showed the Canadian economy grew 2.2 per cent annualized in the third quarter of 2024, revised up from initial estimates for one per cent growth.\n\nBut all of this momentum was before Trump returned to office and began his threats to impose tariffs on Canada.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s economy showed some evident sparks of life in the final quarter of 2024 as it responded to lower interest rates and a sales tax holiday, but that flame could still be extinguished in 2025 if the country faces a tariff wall,\u201d Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.\n\nHe said capital spending will likely be restrained in the first quarter because of the uncertainty and a trade war with broad and significant tariffs could \u201ceasily snuff out growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat risk could dull market reactions to what was otherwise a better than expected report, and will have the central bank still mulling over a March rate cut if the tariff news goes the wrong way,\u201d he said.\n\nWith signs of inflation reheating and the economy accelerating, Orlando said that would be enough in ordinary circumstances for the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts at its next meeting on March 12.\n\nBut with the economy \u201cstaring down the barrel of tariffs,\u201d he said another quarter-point cut to bring the benchmark rate down to 2.75 per cent is warranted as \u201cinsurance.\u201d\n\nFinancial markets have the odds of a seventh consecutive interest rate cut versus a hold in March roughly split after Friday\u2019s GDP release, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.\n\nResidential construction also rose at its fastest rate in more than three years in the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said, while drawdowns on business inventories offset growth.\n\nStatCan said real GDP per capita grew 0.2 per cent last quarter. On a per-person basis, the Canadian economy had contracted in five of the last seven quarters, though the agency revised results in the second quarter of 2024 up into positive territory.\n\nOrlando said that the strong fourth-quarter results are still important, even as Trump threatens to upend the Canadian economy.\n\n\u201cI think that matters hugely to figure out, if you\u2019re going to take some punches, how strong are you before you take those?\u201d\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 28, 2025.\n\nCraig Lord, The Canadian Press",

Royal Bank said the profit amounted to C$3.54 per share for the quarter ended on Jan. 31, up from a profit of C$2.50 a year earlier.\n\nThe bank\u2019s profit topped the consensus estimate among analysts that had called for earnings per share (EPS) of C$3.26. Revenue in the latest quarter totaled C$16.74 billion, up 24% from C$13.49 billion the previous year.\n\nBig Acquisition\n\nManagement at Royal Bank of Canada largely attributed the strong results to the completion of its C$13.50 billion takeover of HSBC Bank Canada. The purchase of HSBC Bank Canada provided Royal Bank with 130 additional branches and about 750,000 retail and commercial customers nationwide.\n\nAdditionally, Royal Bank of Canada reported that the provisions it set aside for credit losses during its Fiscal Q1 totaled $1.05 billion, up from $813 million a year earlier. Canada\u2019s commercial banks have been putting aside more money to cover potentially bad loans as mortgage interest rates reset at higher levels and the U.S. continues to threaten trade tariffs of up to 25%.\n\nRoyal Bank\u2019s stock has risen 33% over the past 12 months.\n\nIs RY Stock a Buy?\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada\u2019s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 11 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on nine Buy and two Hold recommendations issued in the past three months. The average RY price target of $204.67 implies 22.23% upside from current levels. These ratings are likely to change after the bank\u2019s latest financial results.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on TSE:RY stock",

            "content": "Here\u2019s why I expect Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) stock to continue delivering strong returns to patient investors in the next five years.\n\nAs the largest Canadian bank, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) has long been considered a strong long-term investment known for delivering consistent earnings growth and steady dividend payouts. After surging 29.3% in 2024, RY stock has pulled back slightly in 2025, trading 1.5% lower year to date, even as the TSX Composite Index has gained 1.9%. With this, the stock is currently priced at $170.69 per share and has a market cap exceeding $241 billion.\n\nDespite the recent pause in its rally, long-term investors know that temporary fluctuations don\u2019t define a stock\u2019s future. In fact, what truly matters is where it\u2019s headed over the next five or 10 years. In this article, let\u2019s take a closer look at Royal Bank\u2019s recent financials, growth potential, and expected performance in the next five years.\n\nWhy did Royal Bank stock surge in 2024?\n\nRoyal Bank\u2019s last year\u2019s surge could be attributed to a combination of positive factors, including strong earnings growth, higher interest rates boosting its net interest income, and the successful acquisition of HSBC Canada. The bank benefited from robust demand across its personal and commercial banking segments and solid loan and deposit growth. Its wealth management business continued to boom, posting a 27% YoY (year-over-year) jump in earnings in its fiscal year 2024 (ended October 2024).\n\nOn top of that, RBC\u2019s ability to control costs while maintaining revenue growth helped drive profit margins higher, leading to an 11% YoY rise in its net income for the fiscal year to $16.2 billion.\n\nWhat could be behind the recent dip?\n\nRY stock has taken a slight breather in early 2025. However, it might not be about the company itself but about the broader market. Macroeconomic uncertainties, growing global trade tensions, and speculation around more interest rate cuts might have weighed on investor sentiment of late.\n\nWhile lower interest rates could benefit Royal Bank in the long run by increasing loan demand, in the short term, banks tend to face some pressure as their net interest margins initially tighten before stabilizing. These expectations might have led to some profit-taking, causing RY stock to pull back slightly from its highs in 2025.\n\nWhy does RY stock look like a winner for the next five years?\n\nDespite the recent market volatility, Royal Bank\u2019s financials remain rock solid. In the October 2024 quarter, the bank\u2019s net income rose 7% YoY to $4.2 billion, with its earnings rising 5% to $2.91 per share. Its recent acquisition of HSBC Canada played a big role in this performance, as it contributed about $265 million to the bank\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWith its expanding digital banking platform, growing wealth management division, and the HSBC Canada acquisition boosting earnings, Royal Bank\u2019s long-term growth outlook remains strong. Moreover, its strong capital position provides it with financial flexibility for further acquisitions or growth opportunities.\n\nGiven these strong fundamentals, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if RY stock continues to deliver strong returns for patient investors in the next five years. Also, its current dividend yield of 3.5% makes it even more attractive to consider.",

They settled the allegations.\n\nAccording to the court\u2019s decision, the lawsuit now alleges that the OSC was pushed to take that action back in 2001 as part of a campaign against him by executives at RBC DS. It seeks damages for \u201ccivil conspiracy, defamation, injurious falsehood, and interference with economic relations based on allegedly secret conduct that he says the defendants engaged in between 1995 and 2002,\u201d the court said.\n\nThe defendants sought to strike the claim on several grounds, including that it \u201camounts to a collateral attack on the OSC order and settlement agreement, is an abuse of process, [and] is time-barred\u201d as it relates to events that took place more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe court sided largely with the defendants, agreeing to strike out the claim, but also granted leave to amend it.\n\nWhile the court ruled that the claim doesn\u2019t represent an attack on the OSC proceedings since it doesn\u2019t seek to set aside the regulator\u2019s order or the settlement agreements that were reached in the case, the court said the claim does \u201camount to an abuse of process because it implicitly challenges the factual findings\u201d that the OSC order is based on.\n\nIn particular, the court found that the action amounts to an abuse of process for three reasons \u2014 it questions the integrity of the OSC\u2019s process, it seeks to re-litigate the facts underlying the settlements with the regulator, and it seeks to transfer the financial consequences of the regulatory resolution onto the defendants.\n\n\u201cThe overall thrust of the claim is to suggest that the OSC was the pawn of the defendants. It alleges that only the defendants\u2019 improper pressure led to an investigation and a proceeding against Paterson,\u201d the court said. \u201cThis attacks the integrity of the OSC process. It would require the court to investigate the OSC process to determine whether the OSC made decisions on its own or whether it was subject to improper pressure from the defendants.\u201d\n\nWhile this type of claim could be made, the court said this would usually be in a case seeking a judicial review of a regulatory proceeding, which would make the regulator a party in the case, with a right to make submissions of its own. \u201cThat is not the case here,\u201d the court said.\n\n\u201cAssessing Paterson\u2019s allegations about the OSC process requires an assessment of conduct that occurred 24 years ago and a determination of whether that conduct justified the OSC\u2019s exercise of its public interest jurisdiction,\u201d the court said, adding that this is difficult, given that the events occurred long ago, the defendants are in their 80s, other potential witnesses will have moved on or died, and documents will likely have been lost or destroyed.\n\n\u201cOn the present constitution of the action, the court would be required to embark on this inquiry without giving the OSC the chance to defend itself because it is not a party. All, at the end of the day, to impugn the validity of a settlement agreement that Paterson consented to and in respect of which he agreed not to make any inconsistent public statement,\u201d the court said, adding, \u201cbalancing the interests of finality against the interests of justice in the individual case comes down decidedly in favour of finality.\u201d\n\nIt also found that the claim violates the 15-year ultimate limitation period on civil litigation, rejecting the argument that the alleged harm only came to light when the anonymous tip was received in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe statement of claim pleads many facts of which the plaintiff was aware at the time they occurred which gave him a cause of action,\u201d it said. The court added that the claim \u201ccontains no allegations of conduct by the defendants after 2002\u201d \u2014 implying that the ultimate limitation period expired in 2017, five years before the suit was filed.\n\nWhile the court struck out the claim as an abuse of process, and as being time-barred, it also left the door open to a possible revision of the claim that would allow it proceed.\n\n\u201cAlthough I do not believe that those flaws can be corrected by an amendment, the strong inclination of courts is to grant leave to amend when striking a statement of claim even if the court is doubtful about the ability of amendments to remediate the defects,\u201d it said in striking out the claim, but with leave to amend.\n\nThe court also said that each side should bear its own costs in the case.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have found that the statement of claim amounts to an abuse of process with respect to the OSC proceeding and have found that Paterson knew he had a cause of action in the early 2000s, at the same time, the [anonymous tip] suggests that there was a level of animus towards Paterson that should not be rewarded with costs,\u201d it concluded.",

The report revealed that nearly two-thirds of global institutional investors (63%) expect annual returns of 10% or higher from fixed income hedge funds.\n\nHowever, in contrast to investors' expectations looking forward, fewer than half (47%) of fixed income hedge fund investors surveyed reported having earned double-digit returns. Fifty-two percent of investors said their annual fixed income hedge fund performance ranged between 5-9%.\n\nFixed income hedge funds have become mainstream among global institutional investors as they seek higher yields without liquidity. Of those who responded to the survey report, 60% are currently invested in hedge funds, and of these, 84% are allocated specifically to fixed-income strategies.\n\nComprising responses from 450 senior investment decision-makers from asset owners across the US, Europe, and Asia managing assets of between US$5 billion and more than US$100 billion, the report found several factors underpinning the demand for fixed income hedge fund strategies. These include historically strong financial performance (65%) \u2013 rising to 84% in Asia and 70% in the US \u2013 evolving fee structures (48%) and greater levels of market liquidity (45%).\n\nIn November 2024, the inaugural report entitled 'Shifting Strategies: How institutions are embracing fixed income hedge funds' surveyed institutional investors' perceptions and intentions regarding alternative investment strategies including private credit, total return, and multi-strategy credit.\n\nIn the case of hedge funds, 55% reported that their opinion of these strategies has become more positive. When asked about plans for their hedge fund allocation in the year ahead, more than a third (36%) stated that they plan to fund this through new inflows while a quarter (25%) plan to decrease their allocations to other alternative strategies.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Polina Kurdyavko, a hedge fund manager and head of BlueBay Emerging Market Debt, at RBC Global Asset Management, said:\n\n\"We believe we are in the golden age for fixed income hedge funds. Geopolitical tensions and interest rate policies continue to be top of mind for investors, and the resulting uncertainty is likely to create volatility in the markets. We believe funds that can play the markets from both the long and short side are particularly well placed to capitalise on the mis-pricings and inefficiencies created by this volatility to deliver positive returns, regardless of the market direction.\"\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nGeopolitical tensions (60%), interest rate policies (58%) and highly volatile equity markets (48%) were identified by investors as the three main factors they think will impact fixed income in the next 3-5 years.\n\nAsset class (69%) and predictability/volatility of returns (59%) are the two priority factors for investors when assessing potential allocations investments into fixed income hedge funds.\n\n42% of investors plan to consider higher yielding assets because of macroeconomic expectations for the year ahead, with 48% expecting target returns of between 10%-19% from their managers.\n\n61% of institutional investors plan to evolve their exposure to hedge funds and 59% to private credit (e.g. specialist situations, securitised credit, distressed debt) over the next 12 months.\n\nFor more detail about the survey findings, please follow this link: http://institutional.rbcgam.com/alts-survey.\n\nAbout RBC\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

That could add $44 billion a to agriculture and agri-food\u2019s export value by 2035.\n\nA clear plan is critical: To regain market share, Canada needs to focus on innovation, investment, export-oriented infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and overseas agri-food promotion.\n\nCanada has become overly reliant on the US for agri-food exports\n\nSteel, autos, lumber and oil: The growing trade conflict between the United States and Canada has focused on the backbone of our blue-collar economy. But check any border crossing, and you\u2019re just as likely to see food and agriculture products\u2014be they lobsters trucked from Nova Scotia to Maine, or muffins from Toronto to Chicago, or cattle from Alberta to Montana.\n\nMore than $100 billion worth of agriculture and agri-food products cross the border every year, with the U.S. importing nearly 60% of this trade. And thanks to a surge in agri-food processing investment over the last 20 years, that trade gap is growing. The value of Canadian exports to the U.S. has quadrupled since 2000, and Canada is now the source of 20% of U.S. agriculture and agri-food imports.2\n\nThis quiet transformation has helped the Canadian agri-food sector become the country\u2019s largest source of manufacturing revenue. No longer just a bulk commodity producer, we are now a dominant foreign supplier to America\u2019s grocery aisles and dining tables, as Canadian farmers and processors have become more advanced in developing new products and marketing them to Americans.\n\nTake canola, for instance, used for cooking and biofuels and meal for animal feed. Thanks to large crushing facilities, roughly 96% of Canada\u2019s canola oil and 65% of canola meal export volumes went to the U.S. in 2024.4 And then there\u2019s potash, which is key to American fertilizers. Canada supplies 85% of U.S. needs, which could go higher if it pulls back from Russia and Belarus, its only other major suppliers.5\n\nBoth countries have benefitted. The U.S. has had priority access to Canada\u2019s production and processing that has a comparative advantage for products including prepared cereals and vegetable oils. Canada\u2019s large production base in the Prairies, as well as the scale and proximity of manufacturing and processing hubs in Ontario and Quebec, have been key to the large inflows of investment capital in recent years. In addition, consistent, high volumes and a lower dollar have propped up Canada\u2019s ability to be a preferred importer. Historical growth in the efficiency of Canadian farms and food processors has further strengthened Canada\u2019s position as a reliable and efficient place to source agriculture and agri-food products from. The result: Canadian food manufacturing has increased its value-add ratio\u2014its production minus its consumption\u2014by 71% between 2014 and 2023.7\n\nThese advantages are now in question with the threat of large-scale tariffs. If they\u2019re applied to agriculture and agri-food products, they will make Canada a less desirable trade partner to the U.S., as our position as a low-cost exporter of agriculture and agri-food products relative to others, including China and the Netherlands, will suffer. Agri-food manufacturing may also struggle to maintain investment levels, as one of its biggest selling features has been its preferential access to the world\u2019s largest market.\n\nSuch challenges will force Canadian producers to make a choice: accept the cost of tariffs to access the U.S. market, or search for more demand abroad.\n\nMeanwhile, our global competitiveness has slipped\n\nFor generations, Canada has been a global leader in agriculture\u2014wheat shipments to China during that country\u2019s post-revolutionary struggles, pork to Japan as its economy took off, lentils to India as it looked to feed its rapidly growing cities, and maple syrup to Europe as it opened its markets. Canadian potash, fertilizer and seeds have also been critical to the ability of the world\u2019s farmers to grow more for their own markets. Thanks to decades of export growth\u2014ahead of most of Canada\u2019s economic sectors\u2014our agriculture and agri-food sector entered the 21st century as a productivity leader. But with so much focus on the U.S. market, many Canadians didn\u2019t realize that the rest of the world was catching up, and in some categories, overtaking us.\n\nHere\u2019s where we stand today on the global leaderboard: over the first quarter of this century, we\u2019ve slipped from 5th to 7th place, bumped by China and Brazil.8 And under a business-as-usual scenario, we could drop to 9th place over the next decade. A global model developed by the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s Centre for Canada\u2019s Future and RBC shows Canada\u2019s market share since 2000 has declined, relatively, by 12%. Our exports are still growing\u2014they\u2019ve quadrupled during that time. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re not keeping pace with the rest of the world, which saw agriculture and agri-food exports grow five-fold over the same period.c d\n\nThis relative decline could be an early-warning signal that our agriculture and agri-food exports are not only overly dependent on the U.S., they\u2019re likely to face even greater competition abroad in the decades ahead. Other countries such as Brazil and Chile have taken big bites of markets including meat and fish, where Canada has been competitive in the past.\n\nEcuador is another case worth studying. It has a highly concentrated inland aquaculture industry, outside the city of Guayaquil, where advancements in shrimp genetics have led to production volume increases of 18-fold since 2000.9 Today, shrimp accounts for roughly 24% of Ecuador\u2019s total exports and 25% of the global crustacean export market, including shrimp and lobster.10 Similar trends can be seen in blueberries from Peru, pasta from T\u00fcrkiye and soybeans from Paraguay. Such focused, aggressive growth from our competitors has contributed to Canada losing market share in two-thirds of the sectors that make up agriculture and agri-food trade\u2014including meat (-2%), live animals (-5%) and beverages and spirits (-2%). The result for Canada, according to our model: $23 billion in forgone export value in 2023 as a result of market share loss from 2000, which is worth more than the steel and iron Canada exported to the U.S. in 2024.\n\nAn important battleground to watch is Southeast and South Asia. India and Southeast Asia\u2018s global agriculture and food consumption is expected to grow to over 31% of global consumption within the next decade.11 Much of the region has also been a long-time reliable market for Canadian producers, be it soybeans to Vietnam or wheat to Indonesia or peas to India. But the region is increasingly turning to other suppliers. A free trade agreement between Australia, New Zealand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) eliminated tariffs on 99% of New Zealand exports to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Through this agreement, Australia has steadily built up its exports to ASEAN, now accounting for 23% of its agriculture and agri-food export value.12 13 Brazil is another competitor to watch. Its enhanced trade promotion has not only made it a bigger supplier to ASEAN; it\u2019s accelerating its presence in Africa and the Middle East\u2014the world\u2019s fastest growing regions\u2014where its export values jumped by 24.4% and 20.4%, respectively, from 2023 to 2024.14\n\nThat re-ordering of global food trade occurred largely during a period of liberalized global trade\u2014but that era may now be fading. If tariff and non-tariff barriers become normalized, and trade becomes more politicized, Canada\u2019s ability to compete internationally may be challenged anew, including by growing exporters like Kazakhstan that are seeking to gain market share, especially in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nLast year set a record US$45 trillion in global merchandise trade value, yet year-over-year growth in volumese have been on a downward trend since 2000.15 Average annual growth in trade volume was 2% between 2016 and 2025, slower than 3.45% in the previous decade.16 A key factor driving the slowdown is a deviation from a rules-based system, making way for protectionist-like policies.\n\nFor example, harmful trade interventions for cereals have increased by 2.5 times relative to liberalizing interventions since 2009, driven by financial grants, state loans, and import tariffs.17 Agriculture and agri-food often bear the brunt of such policies, given the political importance of food prices and also the political power in many countries of food producers. Average tariffs by a World Trade Organization member charged on an agriculture product is 14.8%, compared to 8% for non-agriculture products.18 A slowing appetite for trade, fewer new trade agreement opportunities, and disruptions to Canada\u2019s North America-first export strategy are among the biggest challenges we may need to consider in the years ahead.\n\nHow to diversify: Play to our strengths, grow with new allies, invest in old markets\n\nThe opportunity is clear. Our model estimates that Canada\u2019s share of the global export pie could grow by 30% by 2035f, adding $44 billion to total exports, if we pursue three main trade objectives: grow where Canada has market access, expand in the world\u2019s best growth markets, and maintain existing relationships through strengthened \u201cfood diplomacy.\u201c\n\nThe first challenge is straightforward, which is taking advantage of what we have. Canada has 15 free trade agreements providing access to over two-thirds of the global economy. Through these agreements, there is room to make better use of Canada\u2019s market access in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. For example, the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is gradually phasing out most tariffs on seafood. Before CETA, EU tariffs for fish and seafood averaged 11%, with highs of 25%. These will be fully phased out within the next five years.19\n\nTaking on new growth markets, with more ambition, is our next challenge. That can start in the Asian markets mentioned in the previous section. Consumers in Southeast and South Asia are expected to have more to spend on higher value products over the next decade, thanks in part to expectations for economic growth that will be among the best in the world, with GDP per capita forecast to rise 3.9%, annually, between 2024 and 2033, up from 2.6% in the previous decade.20 India is one of the clearest opportunities \u2014 a market of 1.5 billion people whose economy and standard of living are growing rapidly. This market will increasingly be an opportunity for Canada\u2019s agri-food processing industries, especially plant-based proteins driven by Canada\u2019s production of legumes \u2013 peas, lentils, and soybeans.\n\nCanada\u2019s oilseed and agriculture waste processing can also help meet expected growth in biofuel demand in Southeast Asia, where blending rates of biofuels with fossil fuels in markets such as Indonesia are expected to stay above 30%. That would raise biodiesel demand by 56% over the next decade in that country.21 Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America are also expected to see large GDP expansions. For these regions, we can expect to see total and per capita consumption not only rise, but shift towards more nutrient-dense foods, including animal protein, vegetables, and legumes. One way to help: Canada can contribute to linking global marine transportation to local supply chains by helping to build up food corridors and port infrastructure in T\u00fcrkiye, United Arab Emirates, and Saudia Arabia as key points of entry to growth markets.\n\nThirdly, Canada can strengthen and grow current partnerships. These markets include the U.S., Japan, China, and Mexico\u2014the first three of which are projected to have food trade deficits over the next decade that surplus producers like Canada will compete for. Our advantage is established business networks and consumer confidence in our products. In particular, the U.S. is expected to expand its imports of fresh produce, fish, and vegetable oil over the next decade.22 Driving production and processing in these domains will help position Canada as a strategic as well as a reliable partner, if we can make some of the investments we\u2019ll outline in the following sections.\n\nCountries to watch\n\nBrazil Australia Spain Kazakhstan Brazil \u2013 The Investor Now the second largest exporter of agriculture and agri-food products, Brazil is taking exceptionally large bites out of global oilseed and meat exports, with an approximate 20% and 11% rise in value shares, respectively. 23\n\nRow cropping in Brazil nearly doubled between 2000 and 2014, primarily from pasture conversion (80%), but forested land as well (20%). 24 Brazil is also improving yields per inputs such as land, fertilizer use, and labour, with agriculture total factor productivity growing by 53% between 2000 and 2022. For comparison, Canada\u2019s productivity grew by 27%. An industrial policy regime took a pro-business support model during the early and mid-2000s that attracted investment from multinational agri-businesses and life science companies, and helped finance growth in domestic storage, transportation infrastructure, and processing capacity. 26\n\nBrazil is also improving yields per inputs such as land, fertilizer use, and labour, with agriculture total factor productivity growing by 53% between 2000 and 2022.

Brazil has taken an aggressive approach to marketing and promotion in growth markets and in expanding its market share in China. On the other hand, the European Union, Brazil\u2019s second largest market, is set to enforce a zero-deforestation regulation by the end of 2025, prohibiting select imports, including soy, beef, and coffee products associated with deforestation post-2020. 27 The regulation and other similar environmental policies tied to trade could present compliance challenges for Brazil even as domestic deforestation rates fall.\n\nThe regulation and other similar environmental policies tied to trade could present compliance challenges for Brazil even as domestic deforestation rates fall. For the next decade, Brazil\u2019s industrial policy playbook, Nova Industry Brazil, will drive innovation and sustainability with agri-food supply chains as a top priority for growth. Australia \u2013 The Trader Australia has used its 18 free-trade agreements with 30 countries to diversify, expand and adapt its agri-food export flows. The value of Australia\u2019s agri-food exports to India increased +106% between 2022 and 2023 after the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) entered into force in December 2022. In 2023, Australia took advantage of lower tariffs for meat in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, raising sheep and goat sales by ~50% in value relative to 2022. 28\n\nIt\u2019s diversifying its production to align with growth in export markets such as canola, and support that with trade promotion. Its new cross-sector agribusiness expansion initiative is a $85-million-dollar fund aimed at expanding and diversifying agri-food exports. 29\n\nAn active participant in the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which is a collection of internationally adopted food standards. Alignment on food standards between trading partners is essential to avoid non-tariff barriers. Spain \u2013 The Scaler The country positioned itself as the go-to market for fruit, vegetables, and pork in the European Union, by focusing on production scale, quality, and regionalized production.\n\nPropelled itself as a leader in agri-food reaching its EU and international customers via its 46 ports. 30\n\nSpain scaled production to meet export volume demands through growing productivity and a shift towards farm commercialization. This is evident through its centralized greenhouse production, optimized for regional market access and trade. However, this production cluster is primarily reliant on road transportation, creating vulnerabilities in logistics.\n\nSpain will remain one of Canada\u2019s top competitors in expanding in the European market, if it were to optimize its use of CETA. Kazakhstan \u2013 The Grower While not yet cracking the top 50 list of exporters, Kazakhstan\u2019s agriculture and agri-food export value has grown by nine-fold since 2000. 31\n\nOver the next decade, if Kazakhstan\u2019s agriculture land use trends mirror other agriculture powerhouses such as Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., we can expect to see its pastureland, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of all agricultural land to, in part, be transformed into cropland, strengthening their place in global cereal and oilseed markets. 32\n\nUnder the Ministry of Agriculture 2021-2030 agricultural development plans, Kazakhstan plans to boost productivity in meat and dairy production, increasing carcass weights and milk outputs per animal, with sights on increasing their exports. 33\n\nIts agriculture sector has significant potential for growth, but is underdeveloped and underfinanced. With meaningful investments scaled through state-owned financial institutions such as KazAgroFinance, Kazakhstan will be one to watch for cereals, oilseeds, beef and sheep.34\n\nBr\u00e9sil Br\u00e9sil : l\u2019investisseur Devenu le deuxi\u00e8me plus grand exportateur de produits agricoles et agroalimentaires, le Br\u00e9sil prend une part exceptionnellement importante dans les exportations mondiales d\u2019ol\u00e9agineux et de viande, avec des augmentations respectives d\u2019environ 20 % et 11 % en valeur.\n\nLes cultures en rangs ont presque doubl\u00e9 entre 2000 et 2014 au Br\u00e9sil, principalement en raison de la conversion des p\u00e2turages (80 %), mais aussi des terres foresti\u00e8res (20 %).

Toutefois, ce centre de production d\u00e9pend principalement du transport routier, ce qui cr\u00e9e des vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9s logistiques.\n\nL\u2019Espagne restera l\u2019un des principaux concurrents du Canada pour ce qui est de l\u2019expansion sur le march\u00e9 europ\u00e9en si le pays d\u00e9cide d\u2019optimiser son utilisation de l\u2019AECG. Kazakhstan Kazakhstan : la croissance Bien qu\u2019il ne figure pas encore parmi les 50 premiers exportateurs, le Kazakhstan a multipli\u00e9 par neuf la valeur de ses exportations agricoles et agroalimentaires depuis 2000.\n\nAu cours de la prochaine d\u00e9cennie, si les tendances d\u2019utilisation des terres agricoles du Kazakhstan refl\u00e8tent celles d\u2019autres puissances agricoles telles que le Br\u00e9sil, le Canada et les \u00c9tats-Unis, on peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que ses p\u00e2turages, qui repr\u00e9sentent environ les trois quarts de toutes les terres agricoles, soient transform\u00e9s en march\u00e9s de cultures.\n\nDans le cadre des plans de d\u00e9veloppement agricole 2021-2030 du minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Agriculture, le Kazakhstan pr\u00e9voit stimuler la productivit\u00e9 de sa production de viande et de produits laitiers en augmentant le poids des carcasses et la production de lait par animal en vue d\u2019accro\u00eetre ses exportations.\n\nLe secteur agricole du Kazakhstan pr\u00e9sente un potentiel de croissance important, mais il est sous-d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 et sous-financ\u00e9. \u00c0 la suite des investissements significatifs r\u00e9alis\u00e9s par les institutions financi\u00e8res d\u2019\u00c9tat telles que KazAgroFinance, le Kazakhstan deviendra un pays \u00e0 surveiller pour les c\u00e9r\u00e9ales, les ol\u00e9agineux, le b\u0153uf et le mouton.\n\nLeveraging global strengths to ensure food security at home\n\nCanada\u2019s agriculture and agri-food sector is not just an exporter; it\u2019s a source of high quality, affordable, and nutritious food for a growing domestic population. We produce more than we need, positioning ourselves as a net exporter of agriculture and agri-food products by $32 billion in 2023.35 However, the production mix of an export-oriented sector may not round out a healthy diet for all Canadians.36 A balanced approach is needed.\n\nCanada has formed trade relationships with countries that specialize in producing foods such as fruit at a more competitive and productive rate. As a result, Canada runs a production deficit in fruits and vegetables, as well as sugar and confectionary products. Technology can help, in this case through the rise of modern, controlled environment agriculture. Pockets of production in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia have led to greenhouse fruit and vegetable production volumes increasing by roughly five times since 2000.37 This growing industry can play a critical role in closing the production gap, where vegetable production would need to double and fruit production would need to grow by five times to feed domestic demand.38\n\nCanada will need to enable this growth through sufficient utilities, especially water, energy, and waste management. Expanding and decarbonizing Canada\u2019s electricity grids will be essential, and could require provinces to invest nearly $160 billion to double their electricity supply with clean energy. Such investments create ripple effects in decarbonizing Canada\u2019s food system by reducing the carbon intensity of energy used in storage, processing facilities and transportation.\n\nOther areas for growth to meet domestic demand and regain global market share can be found in meat processing as well as fish and seafood production and processing. Meat production nearly doubles Canada\u2019s average consumption rate, while fish and seafood production are just above consumption averages.40,41\n\nThese industries have been challenged by high operation costs, volatile commodity prices, labour shortages, and a challenging policy environment for aquaculture. Yet, there is a growing domestic and international demand for sustainable, Canadian-made proteins, which means the efficiencies created through global operations in Canada can help improve the cost and availability for domestic consumers.\n\nBetting on Canada to feed the future may prove to be a safe environmental bet, too. While no country is immune from the negative impact of climate change on crops and animals, yield growth scenarios that account for increasing effects of climate change suggest Canada is projected to increase its role as a global breadbasket of staple crops such as wheat, soybeans, and corn.42 Canada is also well endowed with natural resources, and home to efficient production systems that responsibly use them. Canada\u2019s agriculture water use for agriculture remains low at 11% of total freshwater withdrawal, compared to 67% in Australia and 40% in the United States. 43\n\nCanada\u2019s land use for agriculture also pales in comparison to the United States and Australia, which represents over half of their total land masses, while Canada\u2019s agricultural land covers 6% of the country, underlying the limitations that other agriculture powerhouses face in meeting competing land demands for housing, energy, and food.44,45,46\n\nFive keys to unlocking Canada\u2019s export potential\n\n1. Innovation We\u2019re a production leader and an innovation commercialization laggard. However, Canada is now also facing a productivity slowdown in agriculture production. Creating room for innovation in efficiency is the next reboot in productivity. Adoption is one area for improvement. Take automated steering for tractors and variable rate technology for fertilizers and seeds, as examples. Adoption rates for both remain low at 27% and 16%, respectively.46 We also need greater connectivity among researchers, start-ups, funders, and companies, preferably within agri-food innovation hubs like the ones grown in the U.S. Mid-West and Netherlands. That will require us to address the widening gap between private and public resourcing, which threatens Canada\u2019s ability to develop partnerships in IP and commercialization. Government spending on agri-food research and development has declined by 9% on average, annually over the past decade. .47 2. Capital Canada is in the top 10 countries for investments in agri-food technology and innovation.48 We could be in the top five, if annual investments in Canadian-based startups doubled. That could be tougher in a tariff world, which is inherently risky to foreign capital, but the returns on overseas exports could be enough to offset those North American challenges. Further expanding Canada\u2019s agri-food processing sectors will also require upfront investments. Protein Industries Canada estimates we could own 10% of the global market share of plant-based foods by 2035, which would add $25 billion to annual sales. To achieve this ambition, Canada will need 10 to 15 new plant-based food processing facilities and $6 to $9 billion of capital investment for ingredient manufacturing alone.49 Scaling capital in Canada will also require us to beef up the business case, with more competitive approaches to tax and regulation. We can also do more to tell our story and reposition ourselves as a value-add producer, competing on price, quality, and volume. Developing company, region, and industry case studies (see box) that explicitly showcase what in Canada is ripe for growth, can contribute to attracting a new wave of investors. 3. Digital access Canada needs to fix our 5G gaps. The use of precision agriculture tools highlights the importance of strong wireless connections in rural Canada. These tools rely on app or web-based platforms to improve use of feed, seed, fertilizer, and pesticide, so we can produce more with less. That requires high-speed internet and strong 5G cell reception, which rural Canada is lagging in. Deetken Insights estimates that if all Canadian farmers had access to 5G, it could add between $2.7 billion and $3.5 billion to Canada\u2019s GDP by 2030, through input efficiencies and enhanced automation on farm.50 Canada\u2019s Connectivity Strategy, a national vision for IT infrastructure, has propelled projects across Canada to expand access. Yet, two key agriculture producing provinces, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, have only 50% and 30% rural coverage, respectively, when it comes to 5G.51 Redeploying Canada\u2019s rural connectivity funds to focus on rural and remote 5G access could be the initiative needed to unlock the digital economy for Canadian farmers. 4. Export infrastructure Turnaround times at Canada\u2019s ports are slower than many large competitors, averaging 2.7 days in 2022 while the United States, Brazil, and Australia, had average turnaround times of 2.1, 1 and 2 days, respectively.52 The Port of Vancouver, Canada\u2019s largest port, has had longstanding infrastructure bottlenecks from the Second Narrows Bridge to the Thornton tunnel, which mechanisms such as the National Trade Corridors Fund or Canada Infrastructure Bank could help transform\u2014if they have transformational funding. Currently, Canada\u2019s roughly $20-billion a year investment on transportation infrastructure lags agriculture competitors such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Keeping up with these economies would require additional investments of between $13-20 billion.53 While ports are our main connection to global markets beyond the U.S., Canada\u2019s rail system is a major domestic connector, and it is challenged with limited routes and rising labour disputes, that too require a rethink for growth. There are smaller opportunities, too, such as container logistics and inland terminals, as simple problems like container storage can clog our ports and rails. 5. Global marketing Canada is suffering from a dilution effect in its market development and access approach\u2014with limited resources to boot. The U.S. spends close to 20% of its agriculture support services budget on marketing and promotion, or triple Canada\u2019s share of 6%.54 In a similar vein, gaining market share requires robust inspection and control services that ensure food safety and agriculture production\u2019s protection against new diseases and pests. Canada has a strong reputation, but also must come to grips with a dilemma: even though we allocate 40% of that agriculture support services budget to inspection and control, we still face market access issues and duplicative inspections.55 One approach would be to pick the top five products for export potential and develop priority market assessments, such as Europe for seafood. Pooling public-private resources, the federal government could work with industry associations, companies, and provinces in region-specific, agile taskforces to promote exports and inform regulatory bodies on what\u2019s needed to support growth. A complementary option: position regulatory bodies such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to proactively develop standards recognition and harmonization in the identified growth markets.\n\nCanada in 2035\n\nIn just 10 years, the world will need to feed close to nine billion people, and many of them will have more income, and appetite, for higher quality foods like the kind Canada is known for. To meet this demand, the world will need to produce 14% more food, feed, and biofuels than we\u2019re delivering today, and do it in a more disruptive trade environment.56\n\nTo feed this future, agriculture must also compete with climate change, urban sprawl and rising land use needs from energy production. Moving from short-term reactionary tactics to strategic growth, Canada can use the U.S. tariff threats as a wake-up call to leverage agriculture and agri-food as a driving force for trade diversification while building Canadian self-sufficiency.\n\nUnder a high growth scenario, we estimate Canada could return to our position as the world\u2019s 5th largest exporter, regaining our international clout from the early 2000s. In such a scenario, Canada in 2035 would need to expand value added agri-food exports by 50% and grow agriculture commodity exports by 10%.h\n\nIf we achieve this growth, we can imagine a Canada in which:\n\nThe Atlantic aquaculture industry doubles in production and processing, feeding our European neighbours and the ones just next door;\n\nAlberta, home to 80% of the country\u2019s beef output, advances the resilience of its feedlots and supply chains, contributing to Canada becoming the second largest source of meat in Japan, just behind the U.S., from fourth place today. 57,58\n\nOur greenhouse sector, with aspirations of doubling its acres over the next decade, moves Canadians closer to their fresh produce at an affordable price.\n\nFinally, all these products are delivered to consumers via transportation systems with fewer bottlenecks from rail to port and fewer constraints, from on-farm internet to non-tariff trade barriers.\n\nAgriculture is often left off the plate in Canada\u2019s economic strategy discussions. This needs to change if we are to build resilience at home and regain our presence abroad. By acting on these ideas, and others, with precision and speed, the next decade can see a boom in productivity, an unprecedented scale of manufacturing, and a new path for growth through diversified markets. For every part of the country, the opportunity is ripe for growth.\n\nHow to be a global champion\n\nAGT Food and Ingredients\u2014The value of processing clusters Pulses and plant-based product supplier exports to more than 100 countries.\n\nPrimary markets: T\u00fcrkiye, Algeria, Iraq and the U.S.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye, Algeria, Iraq and the U.S. Growth markets: India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.\n\nIndia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Export strategy: Its ability to handle and process high volumes of pulses grown in close proximity to processing facilities in western Canada has boosted its export ambitions. AGT has an integrated supply chain from farm gate to global distribution, and has expanded its ownership into export-oriented packaged foods and value-added processing infrastructure and bulk and containerized freight handling and transportation. International business has also been driven by expanding offices and processing capacity in T\u00fcrkiye, Kazakhstan, United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, U.S., South Africa, and India.\n\nGrowth strategy: Acquisitions and new capacity to expand processing within production clusters have enabled AGT to become a global exporter of value-added pulse and durum wheat food products. It has also positioned AGT to go from a buyer and exporter of commodities to retail products with over 21 facilities across Western Canada. AGT is investing and engaged in research and development to create novel products and processing systems.\n\nMaple Leaf Food\u2014The value of efficiency Protein company with products sold in roughly 20 countries.\n\nPrimary markets: U.S., China, and Japan.\n\nU.S., China, and Japan. Growth markets: Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.\n\nPhilippines, Singapore, and Vietnam. Export strategy: Advanced market and supply chain integration with the U.S extends its geographical reach. Market access and development between Canada and U.S. has also been strengthened through mutual standard recognition on animal welfare, biosecurity, and quality. The quality of Canadian pork has been well established and enjoys a strong reputation in existing Asian markets. Setting up offices have helped support market development in Asia. It has enabled MLF to work closely with trade commissioners in Asia for market access and development, and resolving local market issues.\n\nGrowth approach: Recognized portfolio of brands and strong leadership, especially within North American and Asian markets. Vertically integrated supply chains with a prioritization of reinvesting in the business to expand capacity and improve operational and supply chain efficiencies. Over the years, MLF has used acquisitions to achieve greater scale but also to acquire major competing or complementary brands. Highly focused on production efficiencies through automation and developing centres of excellence where processing plants specialize on particular product lines, taking advantage of scale.\n\nMcCain\u2014The value of networks Products are sold in over 160 countries.\n\nExport strengths and approach: Developed local sales offices in Tokyo and Osaka, and distribution centers throughout Japan to ensure on-time delivery Close relations between international office and processing facilities to ensure reliable and consistent supply that responds to international customer needs. In the event of a product shortage due to a force majeure event, such as transportation delays or crop-related issues, they are able to propose an alternative product in a timely manner, since they have production bases in various countries.\n\nGrowth approach: Developed strong, long term relationships with farmers through direct contracts, allowing McCain to be nimble in responding to production and supply chain disruptions and build business resilience. Invested in regional-specific agriculture resilience to help key supply sheds mitigate and adapt to climate change and other disruptions. Expanded processing facilities and logistics to existing and emerging agriculture production hotspots. This approach is demonstrated through their recent investment in processing facilities in southern Alberta.\n\n\n\nFor more, go to rbc.com/thetradehub.\n\nDownload the Report Download\n\nContributors: RBC Thought Leadership Lisa Ashton, Agriculture Policy Lead John Stackhouse, Senior Vice-President, Office of the CEO, RBC Myha Truong-Regan, Head of Research, RBC Climate Action Institute Yadullah Hussain, Managing Editor, RBC Climate Action Institute Farhad Panahov, Economist, RBC Climate Action Institute Caprice Biasoni, Graphic Design Specialist Shiplu Talukder, Digital Publishing Specialist Boston Consulting Group Terence Smith, BCG Centre for Canada\u2019s Future Keith Halliday, Partner and Associate Director, BCG Global Advantage Practice Area Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph Evan Fraser, Professor and Director\n\nAcknowledgements Amy Standish Assistant Deputy Minister, Policy and Programs, Government of Saskatchewan\n\nBrian Innes, Executive Director, Soy Canada\n\nBrodie Berrigan, Senior Director of Government Relations and Farm Policy, Canadian Federation of Agriculture\n\nCharlie Angelakos, Vice President, Global External Affairs and Sustainability, McCain Foods Limited\n\nCraig Klemmer, Manager of Thought Leadership, Farm Credit Canada\n\nCyr Couturier, Marine Biologist & Aquaculture Scientist, Marine Institute of Memorial University\n\nDana Dickerson, Director of Market Development and Sustainability, Grain Farmers of Ontario\n\nDarlene McBain, Director of Industry Relations, Farm Credit Canada\n\nDave Carey, Vice-President, Government & Industry Relations, Canadian Canola Growers Association\n\nDavid McInnes Principal, DMci Strategies\n\nDeb Stark, Former Deputy Minister, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\n\nErin Gowriluk, President, Canadian Grains Council\n\nGreg Northey, Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Pulse Canada\n\nGuillaume Lhermie, Professor and Director, The Simpson Centre for Food and Agricultural Policy\n\nIan Ross, President and CEO, Grand Valley Fortifiers\n\nJanelle Whitley, Senior Director, Market Access & Trade Policy, Pulse Canada\n\nJanice Tranberg, President and CEO, Alberta Cattle Feeders Association\n\nJean-Marc Ruest, Senior Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and General Counsel, Richardson International Limited\n\nJeff Vassart, President, Cargill Limited Canada\n\nJohn Cranfield, Dean and Professor, Ontario Agricultural College at the University of Guelph\n\nKendra Donnelly, Chief Financial Officer, Korova Feeders\n\nKim McConnell, Industry Advocate\n\nKristjan Hebert, President, Hebert Group\n\nKinga Nolan, Policy and Regulatory Affairs, Grain Growers of Canada\n\nKyle Jeworski, President and CEO, Viterra\n\nKyle Scott, Managing Partner, Emmertech\n\nLeif Carlson, Director of Market Intelligence and Trade Policy, Cereals Canada\n\nLenore Newman, Professor and Director, Food and Agriculture Institute Simon Fraser University\n\nLorne Hepworth, Board Member, Agricultural Research and Innovation Ontario\n\nMichael Harvey, Executive Director, Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance\n\nMargaret Hudson, President and CEO, Burnbrae Farms Limited\n\nMargaret Hughes, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Avena Foods\n\nMark Walker, Vice President, Markets and Trade, Cereals Canada\n\nMartin Scanlon, Dean and Professor, Faculty of Agricultural & Food Sciences, University of Manitoba\n\nMatt Korpan, Executive Director of Research and Development, Center for Horticultural Innovation\n\nPeter Dhillon, Chairman, Ocean Spray\n\nRandall Huffman, Chief Food Safety and Sustainability Officer, Maple Leaf Foods\n\nRay Price, President, Sunterra\n\nRichard Lee, Executive Director, Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers\n\nRickey Yada, Dean and Professor, Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta\n\nRyder Lee, General Manager, Canadian Cattle Association\n\nSylvanus Afesorgbor, Associate professor, University of Guelph\n\nTed Bilyea, Distinguished Fellow, Canadian Agri-Food Policy Institute\n\nTim Kennedy, Executive Director, Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance\n\nTom Rosser, Assistant Deputy Minister, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada\n\nTrevor Tombe, Professor, University of Calgary\n\nWilliam Gould, Director of Business Operations, The Progressive Group of Companies\n\nYves Ruel, Associate Executive Director, Chicken Farmers of Canada\n\nReferences UN Comtrade.

            "content": "MINNEAPOLIS , Feb. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Global institutional investors are feeling bullish about the return potential from fixed income hedge funds, according to research commissioned by RBC Global Asset Management. The report revealed that nearly two-thirds of global institutional investors ( 63% ) expect annual returns of 10% or higher from fixed income hedge funds.\n\nHowever, in contrast to investors' expectations looking forward, fewer than half ( 47% ) of fixed income hedge fund investors surveyed reported having earned double-digit returns. Fifty-two percent of investors said their annual fixed income hedge fund performance ranged between 5 -9% .\n\nFixed income hedge funds have become mainstream among global institutional investors as they seek higher yields without liquidity. Of those who responded to the survey report, 60% are currently invested in hedge funds, and of these, 84% are allocated specifically to fixed-income strategies.\n\nComprising responses from 450 senior investment decision-makers from asset owners across the US, Europe , and Asia managing assets of between US $5 billion and more than US $100 billion , the report found several factors underpinning the demand for fixed income hedge fund strategies. These include historically strong financial performance ( 65% ) \u2013 rising to 84% in Asia and 70% in the US \u2013 evolving fee structures ( 48% ) and greater levels of market liquidity ( 45% ).\n\nIn November 2024, the inaugural report entitled 'Shifting Strategies: How institutions are embracing fixed income hedge funds' surveyed institutional investors' perceptions and intentions regarding alternative investment strategies including private credit, total return, and multi-strategy credit.\n\nIn the case of hedge funds, 55% reported that their opinion of these strategies has become more positive. When asked about plans for their hedge fund allocation in the year ahead, more than a third ( 36% ) stated that they plan to fund this through new inflows while a quarter ( 25% ) plan to decrease their allocations to other alternative strategies.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Polina Kurdyavko, a hedge fund manager and head of BlueBay Emerging Market Debt, at RBC Global Asset Management, said:\n\n\"We believe we are in the golden age for fixed income hedge funds. Geopolitical tensions and interest rate policies continue to be top of mind for investors, and the resulting uncertainty is likely to create volatility in the markets. We believe funds that can play the markets from both the long and short side are particularly well placed to capitalise on the mis-pricings and inefficiencies created by this volatility to deliver positive returns, regardless of the market direction.\"\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nGeopolitical tensions ( 60% ), interest rate policies ( 58% ) and highly volatile equity markets ( 48% ) were identified by investors as the three main factors they think will impact fixed income in the next 3-5 years.\n\n), interest rate policies ( ) and highly volatile equity markets ( ) were identified by investors as the three main factors they think will impact fixed income in the next 3-5 years. Asset class ( 69% ) and predictability/volatility of returns ( 59% ) are the two priority factors for investors when assessing potential allocations investments into fixed income hedge funds.\n\n) and predictability/volatility of returns ( ) are the two priority factors for investors when assessing potential allocations investments into fixed income hedge funds. 42% of investors plan to consider higher yielding assets because of macroeconomic expectations for the year ahead, with 48% expecting target returns of between 10% - 19% from their managers.\n\nof investors plan to consider higher yielding assets because of macroeconomic expectations for the year ahead, with expecting target returns of between - from their managers. 61% of institutional investors plan to evolve their exposure to hedge funds and 59% to private credit (e.g. specialist situations, securitised credit, distressed debt) over the next 12 months.\n\nFor more detail about the survey findings, please follow this link: http://institutional.rbcgam.com/alts-survey.\n\nAbout RBC\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

            "content": "March is Fraud Prevention Month, offering the perfect opportunity to catch up on the latest in fraud trends, tactics and prevention tips that can help keep businesses safe.\n\nTLDR Today\u2019s fraud trends are a mix of tried-and-true tactics and technology-enabled attacks. Canadian business owners have made strong progress in fraud prevention \u2013 but as the threat landscape evolves, so too must prevention measures. Verification processes are essential, but they must be consistent to be effective. A documentation system can add the necessary rigor. Foundational fraud prevention doesn\u2019t need to cost a great deal for Canadian small and medium-sized businesses. What\u2019s most important is to maintain awareness, training and effective processes.\n\nIn a recent conversation, Michael Argast, co-founder and CEO of Kobalt.io offers a snapshot of the current fraud landscape, a review of how Canadian businesses are faring and easy-to-implement measures that can go a long way toward protecting your business from today\u2019s biggest threats.\n\nToday\u2019s trends in business fraud\n\nThe most common fraud attacks in play today are largely not new. Rather, fraud tactics have evolved in step with technology and in response to business\u2019 enhanced vigilance and prevention processes. Here are the top trends in business fraud:\n\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC): Business Email Compromise is when a fraudster attempts to trick a financial decision-maker into transferring funds or revealing sensitive data that can in turn lead to financial losses. \u201cBEC is no longer new, but it definitely continues to be one of the underlying trends over the last 12 months,\u201d Argast explains. He adds that losses tend to fall within the $100,000 \u2013 $250,000 range, representing a major hit to a SME\u2019s bottom line. Commercialization of AI : There have been a few high-profile incidents in the news this past year, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) was used to impersonate a senior executive, resulting in significant financial losses. Perhaps most notably was when an employee of a Hong Kong company received a request from their Chief Financial Officer to make a confidential transaction. During a follow-up video call, an AI-generated deepfake of the CFO validated the transaction, which resulted in the firm losing more than $25 million USD. While small and medium-sized business owners may think they\u2019re not targets for sophisticated attacks, AI tools have made it easier for fraudsters to go after more businesses, including smaller ones. \u201cSophisticated mechanisms are cheap enough and available enough that it has become easy for cyber criminals to impersonate executives. There is definitely a rise in the use of these more sophisticated tools by intermediate-level fraud actors,\u201d says Argast. Insider fraud: While insider fraud is nothing new, Argast explains that during challenging financial times, there tends to be an uptick in financial misconduct. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any slowdown in insider fraud \u2013 things that have always been an issue continue to be an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in tough financial periods, we tend to see more of it. And, many organizations don\u2019t always followed best practices because as they get busier, it\u2019s easier to rely on one or two key individuals to handle their financial transactions \u2013 this creates an environment where fraud is more likely to occur.\u201d MFA phishing : Here\u2019s the good news: Argast has noted that roughly 80 percent of Canadian organizations are using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) \u2013 a security process that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access an account or system. Now for the bad news: While MFA is a strong security control, it is not the silver bullet many businesses may believe it to be. \u201cIt is important for employees and users to understand that Multi-Factor Authentication can be phished. While it reduces the risk of being compromised, attackers can phish those credentials at the same time as they collect your username and password, which allows them to get in through the back door,\u201d cautions Argast.\n\n\n\nCheque fraud continues to be a risk Not all fraud is digital! While electronic and card payments make up the bulk of business transactions, many businesses still use cheques \u2013 and cheque fraud remains pervasive in Canada. Be sure to do your due diligence when accepting cheques \u2013 question any that arrive earlier or for a larger amount than expected \u2013 and keep your business cheques in a secure location. Tip! Cheque mitigation services such as RBC Payee Match can act as a reliable line of defense. With Payee Match, organizations meeting certain criteria provide RBC with the details of the cheques they intend to use. Any cheques that do not match those details will be flagged as exceptions, which allows businesses the option to pay or return the cheque. 5 min Read: Top 3 Fraud Scams: Keeping Your Business Safe When Making or Accepting Payments\n\nHow businesses are handling today\u2019s fraud risks\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Canadian business owners are making fraud prevention a priority. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) conducted a recent survey that found that half of Canadian businesses are implementing stricter payment verification processes, 36 percent have increased their investment in cybersecurity, and more than a third have enhanced employee training.\n\nThis increased vigilance matches what Argast is seeing firsthand in his discussions with business owners. In addition to the widespread adoption of MFA, Argast has found that businesses are more diligent in creating backups of their data, which is reducing the instances of ransomware.\n\nArgast has also seen a change in behaviour across businesses, where more and more often employees are conducting outbound verification after receiving a message to change a payment process or account. \u201cThree years ago, people did not have the habit of picking up the phone when they received an email. We do see that behaviour now being enacted by most businesses.\u201d\n\nDespite this progress, common gaps in fraud prevention practices continue to make businesses vulnerable. Below are suggestions on how to bolster your business\u2019 defenses.\n\nSix low-cost ways to protect your business against fraud\n\nBuild pre-established verification processes One fundamental way to protect your business is to set up reverse-direction verification processes and policies \u2013 this is when an employee receives a request on one channel (i.e., through email) and they verify it through another (i.e., a Slack message or phone call). Argast believes businesses should take it one step farther and have pre-established outbound verification channels. \u201cDon\u2019t make the employee figure out the best way to verify a message \u2013 instead, have a pre-defined communication channel so it\u2019s easy.\u201d Be consistent with verification practices \u2013 and document them Argast explains that a lack of consistency in verification practices is the downfall of many businesses. \u201cEven if you have a policy in place to do reverse direction verification, it\u2019s important to go beyond that policy and document what\u2019s been done \u2013 that is critical to driving consistency. Because when there is inconsistency, fraudsters can usually find a way to take advantage of human behaviours.\u201d FREE TEMPLATE: Download this verification template to use for your business. Push back on out-of-the-ordinary requests The advancement of AI has made it harder to validate virtual requests, as fraudsters have been able to successfully achieve video and voice impersonation. Argast therefore emphasizes the need to assess whether the request seems reasonable. \u201cYou want your employees to have the confidence to push back and use their reason to question something that feels out of the ordinary.\u201d Focus on training your financial staff While fraud training and education should apply to all staff, it\u2019s crucial to ensure those team members who handle financial transactions and decisions are up to date on the latest fraud trends and tactics \u2013 and are well-versed in anti-fraud policies. Consider enrolling critical staff in awareness and prevention training programs with industry professionals like Kobalt. Don\u2019t forget about your suppliers and outsourced financial support If you outsource sensitive tasks (such as accounting or data management) to a third party, be sure that they have sufficient training and adequate policies in place to defend against fraud attacks. \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing with a bookkeeper who has the authority to make payments on your behalf, you should ask them about their verification practices. If they don\u2019t have a good answer for that, then you might want to select a different bookkeeper,\u201d says Argast. Consider a monitoring service Round-the-clock monitoring of your IT ecosystem can help prevent cyberattacks. \u201cThe sooner you spot a cybersecurity threat, the faster you can respond and recover,\u201d says Argast.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the many business owners who has boosted their fraud prevention strategies and tactics, you\u2019re on the right track to defending your company from fraudsters. By staying up to date on the latest fraud trends and tactics, you can be in a better position to keep your business safe.",

Deutsche Bank is exempt from the fine for reporting its conduct.\n\n\u201cThe fines imposed today reflect the CMA\u2019s commitment to dealing with competition law breaches and deterring anti-competitive conduct,\u201d Juliette Enser, the CMA\u2019s executive director of competition enforcement, said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe fines would have been substantially higher had the banks not already taken unusually extensive steps to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nDive Insight:\n\nGilts are U.K. government bonds. Investors in gilts lend money to the U.K. government and receive steady cash interest payments in return.\n\nEnser emphasized it is important for competitors to decide their prices and strategies independently to ensure healthy competition in the market.\n\n\u201cOnly through healthy and competitive markets can we ensure businesses and investors have confidence to invest and grow \u2013 for the benefit of all in the UK,\u201d she said.\n\nThe information exchanges that took place in separate bilateral online Bloomberg chatrooms between individuals at two banks involved one or more of the following: the sale of gilts by the UK Management Office via auctions on behalf of HM Treasury, the subsequent buying and selling such as trading gilts and gilt asset swaps, and the selling of gilts to the Bank of England, known as \u201cbuy back.\u201d However, the CMA noted that not all banks were involved in \u201cunlawful\u201d exchanges in these contexts.\n\nThe last exchange for HSBC occurred in 2010, for Morgan Stanley in 2012, and for Citi, Deutsche Bank and RBC in 2013.\n\nDeutsche Bank has immunity from the fine since it reported on its involvement in the chats via the CMA\u2019s leniency policy. Citi, for its part, applied for leniency during the agency\u2019s probe and received a reduced fine.\n\nAccording to the CMA\u2019s leniency policy, any business involved in \u201ccartel activity\u201d may be granted immunity or a reduced penalty if it reports the activity and assists the agency with its investigation.\n\nCiti will pay \u00a317.20 million, including a 35% leniency discount and a 20% reduction for settling before the CMA issued its Statement of Objections.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to resolve this longstanding matter with the CMA from over a decade ago. We cooperated fully with the CMA and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance,\u201d a Citi spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nHSBC will pay \u00a323.4 million. Morgan Stanley \u00a329.7 million. And RBC must pay \u00a334.2 million. Each include a 10% reduction for settling after the CMA issued its Statement of Objections.\n\nThe information exchange for Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Morgan Stanley involved a single trader based in the U.K. For RBC, the exchange occurred on two events by two traders based in the U.K. None of the traders are still with the bank they worked for at the time, the agency said.\n\nThe fines were based on the significant amount of time since the violations occurred and the banks' implementation of extensive compliance measures since then.\n\nHSBC and RBC said they were pleased to resolve the matter.\n\n\u201cThe conduct in question was historic and our compliance environment has significantly enhanced over the last decade since it occurred,\u201d an RBC spokesperson told Banking Dive in an emailed statement. \u201cWe do not tolerate misconduct of any kind and are committed to treating employee misconduct very seriously and meeting all regulatory requirements. The two employees who engaged in the conduct in question are no longer with the bank.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for HSBC said the CMA\u2019s concerns revolved around \u201ca small number of historic communications between HSBC and Deutsche Bank\u201d that happened 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cSince that period, we have transformed our controls and the CMA itself has acknowledged we now have a robust compliance programme,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nMorgan Stanley did not reply to the request for a comment by press time.\n\nThe lenders must pay the fines by April 22.",

Higher provisions will eat into earnings for this quarter.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 1, President Donald Trump enacted a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% tariff on Canadian energy, but later placed a 30-day pause on the levy.\n\nAccording to a Monday report from CNBC, Trump said he intends to resume the tariffs once the deadline expires next week.\n\nWhen the tariffs were first announced, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs that will impact U.S. beer, wine, bourbon, fruit, fruit juices, perfume, clothing, shoes, household appliances, sports equipment, lumber and plastics.\n\nAs PYMNTS noted at the time, industries reliant on cross-border trade are likely to be the worst affected by a trade war.\n\n\u201cThe most immediate impact of tariffs is often felt in supply chains,\u201d PYMNTS wrote. \u201cIndustries that rely on the seamless movement of goods across borders are particularly vulnerable. Tariffs, whether they are imposed on raw materials, intermediate goods or finished products, drive up the cost of production. For manufacturers, this often means higher prices for components, parts and materials sourced from countries involved in trade disputes.\u201d\n\nConsequently, businesses have scrambled to diversify their supply chains, shifting from a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d to a \u201cjust-in-case\u201d model to hedge against geopolitical risks and economic uncertainty.\n\nA potential trade war has also made consumers uneasy, with consumer sentiment down nearly 10% from last month and about 16% lower than a year ago, according to February data from the University of Michigan\u2019s latest Consumer Sentiment Index.",

            "content": "CMA Reaches Settlement with Citi, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada Over Illegal Sharing of Sensitive Information on UK Government Bonds.\n\nIn a landmark resolution, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has successfully reached settlements with four major banks\u2014Citi, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, and the Royal Bank of Canada\u2014after these institutions were found guilty of unlawfully sharing sensitive information about UK government bonds, also known as gilts. The settlement, which results in fines exceeding \u00a3100 million, highlights ongoing efforts by the CMA to uphold competitive practices within the financial services sector.\n\nThe Case: Unlawful Exchange of Gilt Pricing Information\n\nThe investigation, which was initiated by the CMA, found that between 2009 and 2013, traders at the implicated banks participated in illicit one-to-one exchanges through Bloomberg chatrooms, where they shared confidential details about the pricing of gilts and related asset swaps.\n\nThis information sharing is a direct violation of competition law, as it undermines healthy market competition and potentially manipulates bond prices in favor of certain participants.\n\nThese private exchanges, which took place over several years, covered the pricing of UK government bonds\u2014particularly gilts\u2014traded during important market activities such as the sale of gilts by the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) through auctions. The exchanges also involved trading activities that occurred after the auctions and included information on \u2018buybacks\u2019 of gilts by the Bank of England.\n\nThe Financial Impact: Over \u00a3100 Million in Fines\n\nAs part of the settlement, the banks have agreed to pay substantial fines. These fines reflect the severity of the violations, the period over which the conduct occurred, and the fact that extensive compliance measures have since been put in place to prevent future violations. The total fines imposed amount to \u00a3104,460,000.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the penalties:\n\nCiti : \u00a317,160,000 (including a 35% leniency discount for early reporting and 20% reduction for settlement)\n\n: \u00a317,160,000 (including a 35% leniency discount for early reporting and 20% reduction for settlement) HSBC : \u00a323,400,000 (10% reduction for settlement after the CMA issued a Statement of Objections)\n\n: \u00a323,400,000 (10% reduction for settlement after the CMA issued a Statement of Objections) Morgan Stanley : \u00a329,700,000 (10% reduction for settlement after the CMA issued a Statement of Objections)\n\n: \u00a329,700,000 (10% reduction for settlement after the CMA issued a Statement of Objections) Royal Bank of Canada: \u00a334,200,000 (10% reduction for settlement after the CMA issued a Statement of Objections)\n\nInterestingly, Deutsche Bank received immunity from fines due to its cooperation with the CMA during the investigation. Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to voluntarily report its involvement in the illegal exchanges under the CMA's leniency policy allowed it to avoid financial penalties, demonstrating the importance of transparency and compliance.\n\nThe Role of Compliance Measures and Leniency\n\nThe CMA's leniency policy, which grants reduced penalties to firms that report anti-competitive behavior, played a key role in this case. Citi, for example, received a 35% discount on its fine after it voluntarily disclosed its participation in the chats. The penalties imposed on the other banks were slightly reduced due to their cooperation with the CMA after the Statement of Objections was issued.\n\nThis settlement also highlights the importance of the extensive compliance measures that the banks have since implemented. Since the last illegal exchanges occurred in 2013, the banks have taken steps to ensure that similar misconduct does not happen again, which played a crucial role in the CMA's decision to reduce the fines.\n\nWhy Healthy Competition Matters in the Financial Services Industry\n\nThe UK government bond market, including gilts, plays a vital role in the financial landscape. Investors buy gilts to lend money to the UK government in exchange for a stable stream of interest payments. The efficient and transparent pricing of these bonds is critical for the health of the financial markets and the broader economy.\n\nBy ensuring that competition law is upheld, the CMA aims to prevent anti-competitive practices that could distort the pricing of government bonds and undermine market confidence. The settlement serves as a reminder of the importance of independent pricing decisions and how unlawful sharing of sensitive information can lead to market manipulation and unfair advantage.\n\nThe Impact on the Financial Services Sector\n\nThe case highlights ongoing efforts by the CMA to regulate anti-competitive behavior in the financial services sector. With billions of pounds invested in UK government bonds, ensuring that all market participants have access to the same information and opportunities is vital for sustaining investor confidence and ensuring market integrity.\n\nThe fines and regulatory scrutiny faced by the involved banks serve as a deterrent to other institutions that might consider engaging in similar conduct. By making examples of these high-profile institutions, the CMA aims to foster an environment where healthy competition thrives and businesses and investors can operate with confidence.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for the Banks and the Financial Sector?\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, the banks have until April 22, 2025, to pay the fines. In the interim, the financial services sector will continue to monitor how the implementation of stronger compliance protocols and competition enforcement measures evolve across the industry.\n\nThis case also raises important questions about the role of financial institutions in promoting fair practices and transparency in their dealings. While the fines have been significant, the true long-term consequences may lie in how these measures will reshape industry standards going forward.\n\nThe CMA's settlement with Citi, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, and the Royal Bank of Canada over their illegal sharing of sensitive UK government bond information underscores the crucial role of competition in maintaining fair and transparent markets. With penalties totaling over \u00a3100 million, this resolution highlights the importance of compliance in preventing market manipulation and upholding the integrity of the financial sector.",

            "content": "There is more evidence that US banks are now over the worst of the commercial real estate (CRE) crisis, with the net share of domestic banks that have tightened their standards for commercial real estate loans declining markedly in recent months. Banks are also now reporting more positive demand trends for CRE loans, further underscoring the brighter prospects for a sector badly damaged by rising interest rates in recent years.\n\nAccording to the January edition of the quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, only \u201ca modest net share\u201d of banks reported having tightened standards for construction and land-development loans as well as loans secured by nonfarm, non-residential properties, while standards for loans secured by multifamily properties remained \u201cbasically unchanged on net\u201d.\n\nOn the demand side, again, only \u201ca modest net share\u201d of banks reported weaker demand for construction and land-development loans, while it was basically unchanged for other types of CRE loans. What\u2019s more, a modest net share of large banks reported \u201cstronger demand\u201d for loans secured by nonfarm, non-residential and multifamily properties, while it was \u201cbasically unchanged\u201d for construction and land-development loans at large banks. The survey also reported that a \u201csignificant net share\u201d of foreign banks reported stronger demand for CRE loans.\n\nWith President Donald Trump now back in office, improving investor sentiment is prompting US regional banks to raise billions of dollars in equity to pursue deals and strengthen their balance sheets. Since Trump\u2019s election victory in November, banks have raised $1.7 billion through share sales, according to data from financial-data analytics firm LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), almost equal to the $1.8 billion raised between January and October 2024.\n\nBut with investor optimism surging over the likelihood of an easing of the regulatory rules surrounding mergers and acquisitions (M&A) under a Trump administration, banks\u2019 equity volumes have soared in recent months, with the likes of acquisitions by Fulton Financial, UMB Financial and Old National Bank examples of deals being supported by new capital.\n\n\u201cShare prices improved due to the perception of improved growth and an expectation of a more friendly regulatory environment,\u201d according to John Esposito, Morgan Stanley\u2019s global co-head of financial institutions. \u201cMost banks desire to get bigger, and there may be changes in the regulatory approval process and the proposed capital rules,\u201d Esposito told Reuters on February 7, adding that he expected M&A activity to be concentrated among mid-sized lenders, particularly those with less than $50 billion in assets.\n\nOn January 17, four of Canada\u2019s biggest banks\u2014Bank of Montreal (BMO), National Bank of Canada, TD Bank Group and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)\u2014confirmed their exits from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which aims to accelerate climate action among financial institutions. The withdrawals from the coalition followed departures by the United States\u2019 six largest banks since December in anticipation of the pro-fossil-fuel agenda of new US President Donald Trump.\n\nIndeed, North American banks have been heading for the exits following repeated attacks by US Republican politicians regarding various climate-change initiatives, particularly the integration of ESG (environmental, social and governance) considerations into business operations. Despite their departures from the NZBA, the banks insist that their climate work will continue. BMO spokesperson Jeff Roman, for instance, said the bank is fully committed to its climate strategy and supporting its clients in their transitions to net zero. \u201cWe have robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.\u201d\n\nThe likely designation of Mexican cartels as terrorist organisations is putting the Mexican banking industry on edge over fears they could face severe penalties for unknowingly supporting criminal activity. According to officials who spoke to Bloomberg, Mexico\u2019s banking industry will take a more conservative approach to lending and other services, given its role as an intermediary in transactions. Mexican banking is dominated by a handful of foreign firms that could curtail business in areas that may have connections to the drug trade, such as mining, livestock, transportation and agriculture.\n\nThe Mexican banking system has a loan portfolio of 7.5 trillion Mexican pesos (US$363 billion) and moves around 14 million interbank transfers per day. Law-enforcement officials have said that only a small fraction of that amount is directly linked to drug traffickers, but it is more difficult to calculate protection fees, ransoms or other under-the-table dealings being paid by individuals and businesses.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge to the financial system like it has never seen,\u201d Sandro Garcia, a former top money-laundering official at Mexico\u2019s banking regulator and independent consultant, explained to Bloomberg. \u201cThis is going to be \u2018know your customer\u2019 times 10.\u201d Some financial institutions provide correspondent-banking services and enable transactions, including processing funds, trade finance and cash management between two parties, which makes screening for illicit activity a challenging endeavour. Trump\u2019s \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d designation could cripple such businesses and force banks to rewire their risk models, Garcia added.\n\nAlthough the Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) has been reducing interest rates of late, businesses and households are not benefiting, as commercial banks are refusing to adjust their interest rates downwards accordingly. The BoJ cut its monetary policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent in December 2024, continuing its easing cycle that began in August 2024. But commercial-banking rates are still reportedly averaging 10 percent, a modest decline from last year\u2019s 11.5-percent peak.\n\nThe BoJ\u2019s governor, Richard Byles, suggested fixing the problem through legal routes. \u201cThere are things that can be done in law that could help, and that is something that we\u2019re contemplating, and that could be more short term,\u201d Byles told the Parliament\u2019s Economy and Production Committee on January 21. The minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce, Senator Aubyn Hill, meanwhile, has pressed banks to reduce their own rates in response to the BoJ\u2019s rate reductions. \u201cWe need to make sure the banks understand that, and people need to see that. Economic growth is what we have to do, after we put our fiscal house in order,\u201d Senator Hill said on January 29.\n\nLed by digital banks, Brazilian banks\u2019 profitability improved during the first half of 2024, according to the Banco Central do Brasil\u2019s (BCB\u2019s) \u201cFinancial Stability Report\u201d (FSR), published on November 21. The report also noted that the annual return on equity (ROE) for the Brazilian banking system rose to 15.11 percent by June 30, up from 14.23 percent at the end of December 2023. Net interest income (NII) and service revenues are also expected to have registered growth during the second half of the year, the central bank added.\n\nDigital banks were a key driver of this growth, with their combined ROE rising to 19.1 percent by the end of June\u2014the highest among segments\u2014from 11.45 percent at the end of December. The likes of Nubank, Banco Inter and C6 Bank were among the top picks of the digital lenders, with the central bank attributing the sharp increase to \u201cpositive effects of operational leverage through the monetization of customer bases by some institutions and lower pressure from provisioning expenses\u201d.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s director of supervision, Ailton de Aquino, said digital banks have a \u201crobust\u201d credit model, attributing their lower provisioning levels compared with public and private banks to the sector\u2019s level of maturity, as reported by Reuters. Ailton de Aquino also credited the evolution of digital institutions in Brazil to the central bank\u2019s efforts to promote innovation and competition. \u201cThe outlook for profitability in the coming periods is for continued gradual improvement, supported by revenue growth, relatively stable provisioning costs, and controlled operating expenses,\u201d the \u201cFinancial Stability Report\u201d also noted.\n\nEarly January saw Argentina unveil a $1-billion repurchase agreement (repo) with five international banks that will do much to replenish the foreign reserves held at the central bank. As such, the move represents a major triumph for President Javier Milei, who continues to seek stability for the beleaguered economy. The repo deal will remain in place for two years and four months, the monetary authority stated, with Citigroup reportedly among the participants. The central bank also confirmed it had received offers for $2.85 billion and that it would pay the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus a spread of 4.75 percent on the repo line.\n\nAccording to unnamed sources who spoke to Bloomberg, the four other lenders were JPMorgan Chase, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Banco Santander and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The banks\u2019 press offices have not commented on the deal. Nonetheless, reports of the transaction have helped boost Argentina\u2019s sovereign bonds. \u201cThe stars are aligning for Argentina,\u201d Aaron Gifford, an emerging markets sovereign analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhile there\u2019s already been a significant rally, I think there\u2019s probably a bit more room to go.\u201d\n\nThe repo agreement has been developed in tandem with Buenos Aires\u2019s negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new programme to succeed the country\u2019s $44-billion deal. Milei and Minister of Economy Luis Caputo have said that a deal could be finalised within the first four months of this year and that it may include new funds that go beyond the previous programme\u2019s financing. According to Gifford, this all amounts to sustained tailwinds for Milei. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially back to market access; they\u2019ve already secured the funds to pay down near-term maturities, and a new IMF program is in the making.\u201d\n\nIn January, Chile\u2019s interest rates on foreign trade, commercial loans and consumer loans increased considerably to 6.0 percent, 9.0 percent and 24.5 percent, respectively, from December\u2019s levels of 5.9 percent, 8.7 percent and 23.2 percent. Rates on housing loans remained the same at 4.4 percent. The central bank attributed the higher rate on consumer loans to increases in the rates for credit cards and overdrafts. In the case of commercial loans, rates were increased for all sections, while the rate for foreign trade increased for both exports and imports.\n\nIn January, the total loans granted by banks experienced annual growth of 4 percent, lower than December\u2019s 5 percent due to \u201cthe lower dynamism of commercial and foreign trade loans\u201d, which showed variations of 2.3 percent and 10.3 percent (December: 3.1 percent and 20.0 percent), respectively. The appreciation of the peso against the dollar also contributed to the lower growth rates of commercial and foreign-trade loans, the central bank added. Consumer and housing loans, meanwhile, grew by 1.9 and 6.2 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cI have decided, in accordance with my constitutional powers, to appoint economists Laura Moisa and C\u00e9sar Giraldo to the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic [Banrep],\u201d Gustavo Petro posted on X on January 16. In so doing, the Colombian president has appointed two academics to the central bank, which could significantly tilt the balance of monetary power in favour of more dovishness as far as interest-rate cutting is concerned.\n\nThe board has been divided in recent months between those in favour of faster interest-rate cuts to stimulate economic growth and those who prefer more moderate reductions to ensure inflation continues to slow toward its target. At the bank\u2019s December meeting, five of the seven policymakers voted to slow the pace of easing versus two who wanted deeper cuts. As such, the new appointments could tip the balance in favour of faster easing, depending on which board members the pair replace.\n\nMoisa is an economics professor and deputy rector of the National University of Colombia in Medellin, while Giraldo is a Paris-educated economist who serves on the committee charged with overseeing Colombia\u2019s fiscal rules, or budget-balancing act. \u201cThe two members seem in line with policies aimed at reducing interest rates at a faster pace,\u201d said Sergio Olarte, chief economist at Panama-based Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (Bladex). \u201cOne might expect the tone of Banrep to lean more toward the dovish side.\u201d\n\n>>>NORTH AMERICA AWARD WINNERS\n\nBANKING CEO OF THE YEAR\n\nNorth America\n\nMr. Jamie Dimon\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (United States)\n\n**********\n\nBEST CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nPROVIDER OF THE YEAR\n\nNorth America\n\nFrost Bank (United States)\n\n**********\n\nBest Investment Bank Of The Year Canada\n\nRBC Capital Markets\n\nBest Investment Bank Of The Year Mexico\n\nAlfaro, D\u00e1vila & Scherer (ADS)\n\nBest Investment Bank Of The Year United States\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Canada\n\nTD Bank\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Costa Rica\n\nBAC\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Guatemala\n\nBanco Industrial\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Mexico\n\nBBVA M\u00e9xico\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Panama\n\nBanco General\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year United States\n\nWells Fargo\n\nBest Private Bank Of The Year Canada\n\nRBC Wealth Management\n\nBest Private Bank Of The Year Mexico\n\nSantander Private Banking\n\nBest Private Bank Of The Year United States\n\nBank of America\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Grenada\n\nGrenada Co-operative Bank\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Jamaica\n\nNational Commercial Bank Jamaica (NCBJ)\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Mexico\n\nBBVA Mexico\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Panama\n\nBanco General\n\nBest Neobank Of The Year Canada\n\nNeo Financial\n\nBest Neobank Of The Year Mexico\n\nAlbo\n\nBest Neobank Of The Year United States\n\nSoFi\n\nBest Mortgage Lender Canada\n\nRBC Royal Bank\n\nBest Mortgage Lender United States\n\nBank of America\n\nCross-Border Payment Company Of The Year North America\n\nBottomline Technologies Inc.\n\nSustainable Bank Of The Year Canada\n\nBank of Montreal (BMO)\n\nSustainable Bank Of The Year United States\n\nBank of America\n\nDOWNLOAD AWARD WINNERS NORTH AMERICA 2025\n\n>>>SOUTH AMERICA AWARD WINNERS\n\nBANKING CEO OF THE YEAR\n\nSouth America\n\nMr. Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez M\u00fcller\n\nBanco del Pac\u00edfico (Ecuador)\n\n**********\n\nBEST CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nPROVIDER OF THE YEAR\n\nSouth America\n\nBanco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa (BCP)\n\n**********\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Argentina\n\nBanco Naci\u00f3n (BNA)\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Bolivia\n\nBanco Mercantil Santa Cruz\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Chile\n\nBanco Santander Chile\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Colombia\n\nBancolombia\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Peru\n\nInterbank\n\nBest Commercial Bank Of The Year Uruguay\n\nBanco Rep\u00fablica (BROU)\n\nBest Private Bank Of The Year Brazil\n\nIta\u00fa Private Banking\n\nBest Private Bank Of The Year Chile\n\nLarrainVial\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Argentina\n\nBanco Provincia\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Brazil\n\nBanco BRB\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Chile\n\nBanco de Chile\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Colombia\n\nBanco Davivienda\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Guyana\n\nDemerara Bank\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Paraguay\n\nBanco Ita\u00fa\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Peru\n\nBanco de Cr\u00e9dito del Per\u00fa (BCP)\n\nBest Innovation In Retail Banking Uruguay\n\nBanco Rep\u00fablica (BROU)\n\nBest Neobank Of The Year Brazil\n\nNubank (Nu)\n\nBest Mortgage Lender Brazil\n\nBanco BRB\n\nBest Mortgage Lender Guyana\n\nDemerara Bank\n\nBest Mortgage Lender Colombia\n\nBancolombia\n\nCross-Border Payment Company Of The Year South America\n\nBamboo Payment Systems\n\nSustainable Bank Of The Year Chile\n\nBancoEstado\n\nSustainable Bank Of The Year Ecuador\n\nBanco del Pac\u00edfico\n\nSustainable Bank Of The Year Peru\n\nInterbank",

While financial institutions, including banks, contribute the most reports to FINTRAC and generally maintain a history of compliance, gaps remain.\"\n\nThe memo, included in the Director\u2019s Binder, outlined concerns about deficiencies in reporting suspicious transactions and other mandatory disclosures. FINTRAC reviewed 150 financial institutions over the past five years, including 33 banks, and imposed administrative penalties on 32 financial entities, nine of which were banks.\n\n\"Money laundering is not a victimless crime,\" the memo stated. \"Criminal proceeds stem from drug trafficking, fraud, human trafficking, and online child exploitation, among other heinous activities. Addressing these crimes is a moral and social obligation for private industry, government, and law enforcement.\"\n\nIn 2023, FINTRAC issued 12 fines totaling $26.1 million for violations of the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act, which mandates the reporting of all cash transactions exceeding $10,000. The largest fine was issued to Toronto-Dominion Bank on April 9, amounting to $9.2 million for five violations of the Act. Other penalties included:\n\nRoyal Bank: $7.5 million (2023)\n\nExchange Bank: $2.5 million (December 11, 2023)\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce: $1.3 million (2023)\n\nManulife Bank: $1.15 million (2016)\n\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China: $701,250 (2021)\n\nWealth One Bank: $676,500 (2023)\n\nLaurentian Bank: $486,750 (2022)\n\nFINTRAC, which employs 468 staff and costs $78.8 million annually, has proposed that financial institutions cover enforcement costs. A 2024 Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement described this as \"a long-term funding solution\" that would allow the Centre to recover compliance program expenses from the entities it oversees.",

Win by helping America win. Trump believes that Canada has not held its side of the bargain,\u201d Tobi Lutke, who co-founded Shopify, wrote on X.\n\nShopify CEO Tobi Lutke ripped into Canada\u2019s retaliation effort. Getty Images\n\n\u201cThese are things that every Canadian wants its government to do, too. These are not crazy demands, even if they came from an unpopular source. These tariffs are going to be devastating to so many people\u2019s lives and small businesses.\u201d\n\nLutke\u2019s withering critique came in response to a clip of Trudeau announcing 25% retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion worth of US goods and pushing for policies targeting red states.\n\nShopify, the e-commerce giant that Lutke co-founded in 2006 is worth about $150 billion. It\u2019s Canada\u2019s biggest tech company and biggest ever startup \u2014 and second only to the Royal Bank of Canada in size.\n\nLutke is worth an estimated $10 billion \u2014 and is one of Canada\u2019s richest people.\n\n\u201cLeadership is about doing what\u2019s right, not what is popular. And hitting back will not lead to anything good. America will shrug it off. Canada will decline,\u201d Lutke added about Trudeau\u2019s planned retaliation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply the wrong choice in a possibility space where much better options would have been available.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has warned Canadians that tough times are ahead amid the simmering trade war with the US.\n\nCanada was the America\u2019s biggest overall trading partner in 2023, with more than $900 billion in goods and services exchanged by the two countries.\n\nLast year, the US imported some $377 billion worth of goods from Canada while exporting $322 billion, according to data from the US Census Bureau.\n\nThe latest on President Trump\u2019s tariffs\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau argued that his country has taken steps to help the US with the fentanyl and border crises. AP\n\nThe tariffs are poised to hit Canada especially hard because roughly 75% of its exports go to the US while only about 13% of American exports go to Canada.\n\nTrump\u2019s massive tariff against Canada also includes a lower 10% tariff rate on energy resources. For context, in 2023, Canadian crude oil exports accounted for about 24% of US refinery production, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrudeau, 53, who is poised to remain PM until his Liberal Party elects a new leader in March, had jetted down to Mar-a-Lago last November to meet with Trump after the then-president-elect first issued the threat.\n\nAt the time, the outgoing Canadian leader attempted to make nice with Trump and dissuade him from following through on the tariff threat, which could wreak havoc on Canada\u2019s economy.\n\nPresident Trump has called the term \u201ctariff\u201d one of the most beautiful words in the English language. AP\n\nThe visit also riled Canadian critics who felt that Trudeau looked weak.\n\nOn Sunday Trump acknowledged that the tariffs will \u201cmaybe (and maybe not!)\u201d cause \u201csome pain\u201d but argued that the move will be \u201cworth the price that must be paid.\u201d\n\nThe 47th president also vented about the US helping Canada via its trade policies.\n\n\u201cWe pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don\u2019t need anything they have,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social. \u201cCanada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection\u2026AND NO TARIFFS.\u201d\n\nTrudeau and other Canadian leaders have adamantly rejected Trump\u2019s musings of making its neighbor a state.\n\nCanada is poised to hold elections in October.",

            "content": "When Oorbee Roy picked up a skateboard at 43, she had no idea it would change her life. What started as a fun way to spend more time with her kids quickly turned into something bigger. She began sharing her journey on TikTok during the pandemic, hoping to spread some joy during a difficult time. \u201cEveryone was depressed, and I just wanted to make people smile,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso known as \u201cAunty Skates\u201d on social media \u2014 Oorbee\u2019s videos went viral, amassing over 100,000 followers in just four months. \u201cI wasn\u2019t working at the time, so I just kept going,\u201d she says. But behind the viral success, Oorbee\u2019s financial journey has been shaped by her upbringing, her family, and a series of hard-earned lessons about money and investing.\n\nBalancing Family, Finances, and Investing\n\nAs a mother, Oorbee is focused on making sure her kids have a strong financial future. \u201cKids are king,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to invest for their future and make sure they have money for their education.\u201d She learned the importance of long-term investing early on, thanks to a lesson from her parents that stuck with her for life.\n\n\u201cWhen I graduated from university and was still living at home, my parents started charging me rent,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut what I didn\u2019t know was that they were actually investing that money for me. Later, they gave it back to me for a down payment on a house.\u201d At the time, she admits she would have spent that money frivolously had they not saved it for her. \u201cIt was one of the best financial lessons they could have given me.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s passing down financial lessons to her own children. Her kids have Mydoh cards, a financial tool that allows them to manage their own allowance and learn about budgeting early on. She also makes it a point to have open conversations about money at home, something she believes many parents struggle with. \u201cMost parents want to teach financial literacy, but we don\u2019t always know how. We end up learning it ourselves in our thirties after messing up a few times.\u201d\n\nFinding the Right Financial Support\n\nDespite those early lessons, Oorbee didn\u2019t always feel confident about investing. She worked on Wall Street in her early career and was eager to take risks\u2014until a financial advisor shut her down. \u201cI once had an advisor tell me, \u2018You don\u2019t make enough money to take risks,\u2019 and that completely turned me off from investing,\u201d she says.\n\nFor years, she avoided the market, feeling like investing wasn\u2019t for her. It wasn\u2019t until she got married that she revisited the idea, but even then, she struggled to find an advisor she trusted. \u201cThe first advisor we met made us feel stupid, and I was turned off again,\u201d she admits. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vibe well with your advisor, it can really throw you off.\u201d\n\nEventually, she and her husband found an RBC advisor who understood their goals and made them feel comfortable. \u201cNow, our advisor is great\u2014he never talks down to us, and he was actually the first person to jump at the idea of turning my TikTok skateboarding account into a business.\u201d\n\nFor Oorbee, the key to a good advisor is trust, transparency, and a willingness to listen. She also reminds people that it\u2019s okay to change advisors if the relationship isn\u2019t working. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give them all your money right away. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, you can always switch.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurship and Financial Freedom\n\nBecoming a full-time content creator brought a new level of financial uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s a hustle to be an influencer,\u201d Oorbee says. Unlike a traditional job, her income fluctuates, with most brand deals coming in the summer when skateboarding is in season. \u201cThere are months where I know I have to be lean. I have to tell my kids, \u2018No, you\u2019re not getting an expensive jacket and boots this year.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat unpredictability has forced her to be strategic with her money. She prioritizes investing in her RRSPand TFSA, knowing that they can offer tax benefits while helping her plan for the future.\n\nBut her financial goals go beyond just saving. \u201cThis year, my goal is to build more passive, regular income so I don\u2019t have to rely so much on brand deals. That way, it\u2019s more consistent and less stressful,\u201d she says.\n\nLessons from an Immigrant Upbringing\n\nGrowing up in an immigrant household, Oorbee saw her parents struggle, and it shaped her mindset about money. \u201cOur understanding of a dollar is so different from our kids\u2019 experience today,\u201d she says. That\u2019s why she makes a point to include her children in financial conversations.\n\n\u201cI celebrated with my daughter how much I made last year,\u201d she says. \u201cI want them to see the hustle, to understand that making money takes effort.\u201d\n\nDespite her success, she still believes in living below her means. \u201cI\u2019m 50, and I\u2019ve been driving the same Subaru for 12 years,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to spend more just because you earn more.\u201d\n\nLooking Back: What She\u2019d Tell Her Younger Self\n\nIf she could go back in time, Oorbee\u2019s advice to her younger self would be simple: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to start investing.\u201d She knows that her ability to take risks today\u2014whether in business or in life\u2014comes from having a financial cushion.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. Just start, take small steps, and keep going,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s the same advice she gives to those learning to skateboard\u2014and to anyone looking to build a more secure financial future.",

Deutsche Bank, which along with Citi had admitted to anti-competitive activity, was given immunity from the fine after it alerted the CMA to what had happened.\n\nBritish government debt issuance rose sharply after the crisis and the Bank of England shored up the UK economy and markets by buying government debt through regular auctions.\n\nIndividual traders began exchanging market-sensitive information on auctions by the UK's Debt Management Office, the subsequent buying and selling of gilts and gilt asset swaps and on BoE auctions, the CMA found.\n\nA Citi statement said the bank was pleased to resolve the matter. \"We cooperated fully with the CMA and remain committed to ensuring full regulatory compliance,\" a spokesperson added.\n\nMorgan Stanley said the CMA's investigation centred on the actions of a former employee and that the bank and the industry had since \"undergone significant changes, including enhanced supervision and compliance controls\".\n\nHSBC said the investigation related to a small number of communications between it and Deutsche Bank in 2009-2010. The bank said it had transformed its controls and that the CMA acknowledged it had a \"robust compliance programme\" in place.\n\nDeutsche Bank said it had \"proactively reported the issue\" and cooperated fully with a subsequent investigation.\n\nRBC said that it had \"significantly enhanced\" its compliance over the past decade. The two employees involved are no longer with the bank, it added.\n\n\"The fines imposed today reflect the CMA\u2019s commitment to dealing with competition law breaches and deterring anti-competitive conduct,\" said Juliette Enser, executive director of competition enforcement at the CMA.",

Investors in gilts lend money to the UK government and in return receive a steady and stable stream of cash interest payments.\n\nHealthy competition drives investment, innovation and growth, and it is important that competitors decide their price and strategies independently in order to ensure effective competition in a market.\n\nFollowing an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the banks have agreed to pay fines for specific instances in which traders shared competitively sensitive information about aspects of the pricing of UK bonds. The sharing of information occurred in one-to-one exchanges between traders about the buying and selling of gilts and gilt asset swaps.\n\nThis conduct took place on various dates between 2009-2013, with the last exchanges occurring in 2010 for HSBC, 2012 for Morgan Stanley, and 2013 for each of Citi, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. Since then, the banks have implemented extensive compliance measures to ensure this behaviour does not happen again.\n\nJuliette Enser, Executive Director of Competition Enforcement at the CMA, said:\n\nFollowing constructive engagement between the banks and the CMA, we are pleased that we have been able to settle these 5 cases involving the past sharing of competitively sensitive information about pricing.\n\nThe financial services sector is an integral part of the UK economy, contributing billions every year, and it\u2019s essential that it functions effectively. Only through healthy and competitive markets can we ensure businesses and investors have confidence to invest and grow \u2013 for the benefit of all in the UK.\n\nThe fines imposed today reflect the CMA\u2019s commitment to dealing with competition law breaches and deterring anti-competitive conduct.

            "content": "As the weather warms and #plant25 approaches, it\u2019s time to reflect on a winter that brought about change, opportunities, and risk. The coming months look to be shaped by ongoing tariff instability in the commodity markets.\n\nSoybeans: Brazil anticipates a record-high production year, but uncertainty over tariffs and renewable energy remains\n\nFor soybeans, prices have found some upside moments on a combination of delayed Brazilian harvest, a dry stretch of weather in Argentina, and less-than-feared retaliatory tariffs by China against the U.S., with agriculture goods not directly impacted. These have all been positive developments for raising prices in the shorter term, but unfortunately there are still some large looming threats ahead that could weigh on prices in the weeks and months to come.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the large supply of beans in the world. Even with potential production losses in Argentina, Brazil will still harvest a record soybean crop. This is expected to take world inventory levels, also known as \u201cending stocks\u201d, to yet another record high. This ending stock estimate even builds in an additional 21 mmts of demand globally.\n\nSecondly, political risk is heightened as the threat of a looming trade war have been front and centre in the media. This situation remains fluid with many unknowns resulting in increased volatility and price swings.\n\nLastly, uncertainty remains around the prospects of the U.S. renewable fuel industry. January 1st marked the end of the old $1.00 blending credits and replaced with the new 45z credit system. As of writing, the interim ruling that came out in early January was much less favourable towards soybean oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel than the previous calculations. This interim ruling will fall to the U.S.\u2019s new administration for approval, however an executive order to halt funding for the Green New Deal has caused uncertainty whether 45z credits will be implemented.\n\nCanola: While prices remain competitive, U.S. policy and potential tariffs are a risk\n\nThe changes to the U.S. renewable fuel industry blending credits could have a big impact on our Canadian canola market. 70% of all the canola oil produced in Canada is exported. Of that 70% produced, 97% goes to the U.S. The U.S. uses approximately 57% of the canola oil they import from Canada as a feedstock for renewable fuel production. Unfortunately, that means we are very tied to any potential policy changes related to the 45z program.\n\nIt also means potential tariffs could have an oversized impact on canola prices. This, however, is where the similarities to the soybeans stop. Unlike with soybeans, supplies both domestically for canola and globally for rapeseed are tight. This was precipitated from late season dryness in Canada and growing season problems in Europe. As well as this, exports remain at a pace that is well ahead of the pace needed to reach the current balance sheet\u2019s goal.\n\nCanola remains priced competitively in the world, which should help to keep some value buying under this market in the short term. Longer term, if world oilseed prices fall on the backs of large soybean supplies, canola will likely follow. However, it should be positioned to weather the downside better than soybeans.\n\nGrains: Concern that corn acreage could expand relative to soybeans in North America\n\nCorn\n\nSwitching over to the grains, a surprise adjustment to corn yield in January shocked many, as a near-optimalgrowing season for many was stunted by a very dry August in the U.S. corn belt. Reflecting this, the U.S. ending stocks estimate fell from over 2.0 billion bushels in September to 1.54 billion bushels come January.\n\nAlso contributing to the falling ending stocks was a very competitive U.S. corn export program, causing the USDA to update their export forecasts higher. A strong export pace has been a feature of early 2025, as world ending stocks are projected by the USDA to be at the lowest levels since 2014.\n\nLooking forward, analysts are concerned that corn could win acres against soybeans in North America as a whole. This is due to corn prices rallying in the early winter relative to U.S. soybeans, causing the ratio between new crop 2025 corn and soybeans to widen to levels that previously have encouraged large year-over-year increases in corn planted acreage. While the demand picture has been supportive of corn, an upcoming Brazil second crop corn harvest, ever-changing news regarding potential Mexican tariffs and the USDA March Planting Intentions report will provide key developments to follow.\n\nWheat\n\nWheat has seen world ending stocks continue to contract this year as issues in Russia and the EU have brought the stocks to use ratio to the lowest level since 2014. Prices have not begun to reflect tightness as ample Australian and Argentinian supplies have kept the cash pipeline adequately full. War-related risk has lost its influence in the market with Ukraine exports not far off prewar levels.\n\nGoing forward, trade will pay close attention to Northern Hemisphere growing season and specifically how both the Russian and U.S. crops come out of dormancy. Both crops suffered drought concerns in the fall and potential winter kill problems this past month. This will put create extra stress for an ideal growing season this spring.\n\nLivestock: While the outlook is bright for both cattle and hog producers in Canada and the U.S., looming trade issues could provide headwinds to start the year\n\nCattle\n\nTurning to the livestock markets: Low cattle inventories and tight supplies will continue to dominate the live cattle and beef markets during 2025. The year has started with record high cash prices for both feeder and live cattle. Total North American cattle inventories are expected to be slightly smaller compared to 2024. Herd expansion remains muted with heifer supplies down 3.4% below year ago levels and 1.6% below the five-year average, the smallest total since 2019.\n\nIn turn, live cattle, feeder cattle, and box beef wholesale markets are already looking forward and are pricing in a risk premium level due to the projected smaller supplies and uncertainties. However, the bullish enthusiasm in the beef market is not without its problems, as a host of potential issues have greeted both Canadian and U.S. cattle producers in early 2025.\n\nThe first was a carry-over from late 2024 with the closure of the U.S. border to Mexican feeder cattle. The border was closed on November 22nd, 2024 following the detection of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexican cattle. This has impacted nearly 100,000 head of feeder cattle which were destined to cross into the U.S. With feeder cattle supplies already historically tight due to drought conditions dating back into the early 2020-2022 period, the border closing only amplified the situation.\n\nThe second major risk premium is the threat of tariffs with the new change in the U.S. administration. The most direct impact of tariffs on the beef industry was likely in the wholesale beef market. Since wholesale beef is sold on longer term contracts, the price uncertainty as to whether costs would increase with the implementation of a tariff forced the meat packing industry to increase prices. Packers just do not know what cattle prices will be in eight to 12 months.\n\nWhile the outlook for cattle prices is bullish, producers are now faced with new \u201cexternal\u201d factors such as government and trade. So as higher average prices are expected, one should also expect higher than average volatility. Both the domestic and international beef markets are subject to considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. There has not been any other time in history that the dollars at risk for beef producer were this large with raising costs and record high replacement costs. Managing price risk should be top of mind for the beef producer in 2025.\n\nHog and pork\n\nThe hog and pork market have also experienced exceptionally higher prices through the winter period. Similar to beef, the outlook for hogs and pork looks bright as we head through 2025. Smaller than anticipated hog supplies and stronger than expected pork demand, both domestic and export, have supported higher hog and pork prices.\n\nFollowing a brief stint of stability within the North American hog sector, there would seem to be another wave of liquidation underway from the U.S. producer as supply numbers were less than what the industry was expecting. Growth and expansion within the industry remains nonexistent for the fifth consecutive year. Pork demand was another supportive factor which also contributed to the higher-than-average price for hogs during the winter period. On a price competitive basis, pork remains cheap compared to competing proteins. This has appealed to the price-conscious consumer looking for better value as their food dollar budgets are stretched with winter and post-holiday related bills.\n\nThe export side of the equation is where both opportunity, as well as risk, lies. Nearly a quarter of total U.S. pork production is exported, the majority of which goes to Mexico. With potential trade tariff threats levied by the U.S. against Mexico, the potential to see retaliatory tariffs could affect pork amongst a host of other commodities. Losing Mexico as a main buyer of U.S. pork will be detrimental and could have wide ranging negative consequences for U.S. hog and pork prices.

HMRC [2025] UKSC 2 casts a spotlight on \u2013 among a wide range of other things \u2013 the UK\u2019s approach to tax substance which will be of interest to the worlds of private capital and financial institutions.\n\nUK tax law and practice have generally shied away from employing an overarching economic substance doctrine to police entitlement to tax treaty benefits. This can make the UK appear an island of (relative) certainty in contrast to some continental European jurisdictions, where the prospect of a unifying approach to substance held out by the proposed ATAD III directive is now apparently receding fast.\n\nAsset managers structuring investments into Europe therefore continue to grapple with the need to satisfy shifting, and sometimes conflicting, source state requirements in respect of investing entities such as holding company platforms and SPVs. In contrast, reliance on a tax treaty to achieve an expected UK tax treatment is typically not contingent on meeting and managing substance-based criteria such as company premises, staff and payroll, own-name bank accounts, or a diversified asset base and sources of income.\n\nThe judgment in Royal Bank of Canada may concern an unusual and historic fact pattern, which is highly specific to the natural resources sector, but it also reasserts this orthodox UK approach to tax treaties in a way that is generally likely to reassure inbound investors into the UK.\n\nRBC financed a Canadian company, Sulpetro Ltd (Sulpetro), with a sizeable loan which Sulpetro used to fund offshore oil exploration and exploitation under a UK Government-granted license which was required to be held by a UK subsidiary (Sulpetro (UK)). Sulpetro (UK) had an obligation, under the license and an accompanying Illustrative Agreement, to pay a royalty to the Government and to land the oil (which Sulpetro owned and then sold on) on the UK mainland but otherwise had no asset base and no material activities.\n\nSulpetro subsequently transferred this business, including Sulpetro (UK), to BP, formerly the operator of the oil field, for cash consideration plus a quarterly contingent payment payable to the extent the price per barrel extracted from the field exceeded $20 (the Payments). Sulpetro subsequently entered insolvency proceedings in Canada as a result of which the receiver assigned Sulpetro\u2019s right to the Payment to RBC who wrote off the outstanding loan and paid Canadian tax on the Payment but no UK tax (whether through RBC\u2019s UK branch or otherwise).\n\nThe question before the Supreme Court concerned whether, and on what basis, the UK enjoyed taxing rights over the Payments. As a Canadian resident receiving business profits other than through a UK permanent establishment, RBC might have expected to enjoy protection from UK taxation under the UK-Canada double taxation treaty through the exclusive allocation of the right to tax the Payments to the residence state.\n\nThe immovable property article, however, gives the source state another bite of the cherry: \u201crights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources\u201d are deemed for the purposes of the treaty to be themselves immovable property and may be taxed in the non-residence state \u2013 and the UK does duly exercise, for profits of this nature, those taxing rights under the corporation tax regime for oil-related and UK continental shelf activities (ss 1313 CTA 2009 and 279A CTA 2010).\n\nWere the Payments, which arose under the transfer agreement with BP for Sulpetro\u2019s UK oil business, consideration for the working of / right to work the oil field, and so taxable in the UK (at the then-applicable rate of 62%) by virtue of the treaty\u2019s deeming provision?\n\nIf they were anything else, they would be generic business profits and so have the non-UK taxable treatment that RBC would undoubtedly have expected when, as a result of Sulpetro\u2019s receivership, its loan was replaced by a contingent payment right in the form of the Payments. Precisely how to classify the Payments, which had earn-out qualities but were inconsistently referred to as royalties (the actual royalty on the license was payable by Sulpetro (UK) to the Government), for tax purposes seems to have eluded the various courts or (ultimately) not to have mattered.\n\nThe approach taken by Lady Rose\u2019s leading judgment, following that of Falk LJ in the Court of Appeal, was to focus on the strict legal reality of the arrangements. Sulpetro (UK), and not its parent company, had the UK Government-granted right to explore and exploit of the oil field, the obligation to pay the (actual) royalty in respect of oil extracted, and was answerable to the Secretary of State for the discharge of its obligations under the license in respect of its exploration and exploitation activities.\n\nAs a limited company with legal personality, Sulpetro (UK) contracts under English law in its own right irrespective of considerations of its economic substance. The (Government-approved) agreement between the parties required Sulpetro to bear the costs of the exploration, in exchange for owning and receiving all the actual oil extracted, but did not change the fact that only Sulpetro (UK) had the actual license and the legal entitlement to the oil. As a result, the right to work the natural resources was Sulpetro (UK)\u2019s only and the consideration payable to Sulpetro was (whatever else it was) not consideration for that right and so didn\u2019t fall to be treated as UK immovable property.\n\nIn taking this approach to construing the treaty, Lady Rose said of the deeming provision in the treaty that:\n\nAny definition which extends the meaning of a term such as \u201cimmovable property\u201d beyond what would normally be included in it creates its own penumbra of uncertainty in a different place from the penumbra that exists around the ordinary meaning of the term. There must be a dividing line somewhere between what is caught and what is not caught and that has the inevitable consequence that some cases will fall on one side of the line and others on the other side even though they appear similar in economic terms.\n\nThis approach of seeking certainty and clarity of tax treatment where reasonably available based on a transaction\u2019s legal reality may resonate with anyone grappling with recent and evolving European approaches to substance and beneficial ownership. Securities financing transactions present a good example of the latter, with the courts and tax authorities of various jurisdictions taking the approach of ignoring the legal reality of the transactions (under a stock loan, say, the disposal of securities by the lender who therefore does not receive the income arising during the term of the loan) on the basis of a supposed economic reality (i.e., that manufactured payments received by the lender may be equated with the income).\n\nThe uncertainty that this can open up is considerable. Just as there are important legal differences between owning securities and having contractual rights based on them, or between making an investment outright and making it through an SPV, so in Royal Bank of Canada the majority judgment held that \u201c[t]here is a legal difference between someone having a right to work natural resources and someone having a right to require another person to work those natural resources\u201d. Sulpetro had the latter but not the former and as a result the Payments were protected under the treaty.\n\nDissenting judgments in tax cases in the UK\u2019s highest courts are (increasingly) rarities and so attract attention when they do appear. In \u201clonely disagreement\u201d with the majority, Lord Briggs\u2019s tightly-reasoned dissent uses principles of statutory (and UK treaty) construction to argue that the required realistic view of the facts at hand does necessitate an economic analysis which in turn justifies the conclusion that Sulpetro had the right to work the oil field and the Payments were consideration for the disposal of that right:\n\nAlthough Sulpetro (UK) remained the holder of the relevant government licenses, its role in the working of the hydrocarbons to which the licences related became nothing more than that of a not for profit (or loss) risk-free puppet, with all its relevant strings being pulled by Sulpetro, which thereby enjoyed the whole of the economic benefits and risks of the working of that share.\n\nIt is notable that the brief dissent uses the term \u201csubstance\u201d repeatedly in reaching the conclusion that the right held legally by Sulpetro (UK), as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary, acting as [the parent\u2019s] puppet and at no charge\u201d, should be imputed to its parent Sulpetro for the purposes of the treaty. This use of an overarching economic override of a transaction\u2019s legal reality would represent a novel approach to UK treaty construction in a non-tax avoidance case.\n\nThe scope for that override to create its own penumbra of uncertainty may be illustrated by a counterfactual in which the license-owning UK SPV was owned not by a sole parent company but by a consortium of three 1/3 joint venture partners or coinvestors, perhaps with contract outsourcing of operational services. Where would ownership for treaty purposes lie in that case \u2013 fragmented across the three owners, or perhaps with the operator, or would it return to the level of the UK SPV \u2013 and how would you start to apply the treaty? Sometimes sticking to legal reality has much to recommend it.\n\nUltimately the fact that avoidance and artificiality were not at issue in Royal Bank of Canada \u2013 unlike in the SPV business rates case of Hurstwood Properties v. Rossendale Borough Council [2021] UKSC 16, decided by the Supreme Court on statutory interpretation grounds and with a leading judgment by Lord Briggs \u2013 was determinative in the judgment of the majority (para. 90). The treaty purpose case of Burlington Loan Management v. HMRC, recently heard in the Court of Appeal, may also throw further light on the UK\u2019s approach to this area in the context of a transaction which involved entities of substance (BLM had $6.9bn of assets) but was classed by HMRC as a form of engineered arbitrage.\n\nThe approach taken by the Tribunals in Burlington, of unpicking the parties\u2019 respective percentage economic returns from the transaction, has parallels with prominent jurisprudence in the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and may be effective in isolated cases but could prove to be a blunt tool in more sophisticated scenarios (e.g., broker-dealers and other market participants who may trade at high volumes on small margins and thereby provide market liquidity).\n\nThe fact that the majority in Royal Bank of Canada upheld the conventional approach taken by the Court of Appeal, and declined to follow the substance-based approach taken by Lord Briggs and the lower Tribunals, is to be welcomed and will appear to many to ensure an appropriate outcome on these facts. Whether the UK\u2019s general aversion to the fiscal doctrine of economic substance continues in the long run, however, remains to be seen and investors and their advisers will be watching this space keenly.\n\nSubscribe to Ropes & Gray Viewpoints by topic here.",

It begins:\n\nIt was the height of the depression, 1932. Tough times. But Sidney Rafuse and Gerald Freckleton had a plan: they were going to rob a bank. As they say, that\u2019s where the money is. Sidney Rafuse knew about banks. Rafuse was from Lunenburg. In 1917 he enlisted in the army and was deployed to France, where he was injured by shrapnel at the Battle of Fresnoy. By 1920, Rafuse was back in Lunenburg, working as a clerk at the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. That year, at 24, Rafuse married a woman from Halifax named Hazel, and soon was promoted to bank manager at the Royal Bank of Canada in Louisbourg. He worked for 10 years at the Louisbourg bank, but in 1931 was transferred to the Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. In May 1932, Rafuse \u201cretired\u201d from the bank \u2014 at age 35 \u2014 and found a job as an insurance salesman. How or why Rafuse left the banking profession isn\u2019t explained in the records. But in August 1932, Rafuse was still living with Hazel and their two sons on Union Street in Sydney \u2014 yes, he was Sidney from Sydney. People called him Syd, but confusingly, sometimes Nick. Either way, he evidently thought he knew enough about Royal Banks of Canada that he\u2019d be able to rob one. Rafuse and Gerald Freckleton were brothers-in-law: Rafuse\u2019s wife Hazel was Freckleton\u2019s sister. In 1932, Freckleton was 27 years old and living in a rented room on Maynard Street in Halifax with his 26-year-old wife, Lilian. Naturally, people called him Freckles. Lilian worked as a sorter at Ungar\u2019s Laundry on Barrington Street. But Gerald was at best an itinerate worker \u2014 he drove a taxi for a while, found some other odd jobs, and in May 1933, he joined the staff at the newly opened Rosa Dress Shop on the second floor of the Roy Building on Barrington Street, but only after proprietor Gerald Avery convinced Lilian to buy in as a partner. The Rosa Dress Shop was named for Avery\u2019s wife, Rosa, who was the daughter of former Halifax Mayor George Ritchie. Yet despite that illustrious pedigree, the shop was, well, sketchy. It never obtained a business licence, and it looked like at least some of the dresses for sale were stolen from other dress shops \u2014 soon after the Rosa Dress Shop opened, Freckleton was arrested for a theft from Bendel\u2019s dress shop in Truro, where he worked before he was fired. Much of the Rosa business consisted of the employees driving around the rural parts of the province and going door to door as salesmen. And perhaps Avery used the excuse of sales trips to stay at the \u201covernight cabins\u201d in Truro with women who were not his wife. Perhaps the overnight cabins were sometimes used as a brothel.\n\nClick or tap here to read \u201cNova Scotia\u2019s Policing Panic, Part 1: \u2018A coupla suckers.'\u201d\n\nWhile Part 1 is mostly just a fun read, the full series will sprawl in surprising directions and become very serious. Deadly serious.\n\nI\u2019ve finished Part 2 and that will be published next Saturday. I\u2019ll probably finish writing Part 3 today or tomorrow, and that will tentatively be published on March 1. Part 4 is about half done, and I\u2019m writing frantically to get it out tentatively on March 8. That timing could change depending on a news event tied to this, and just because Part 4 is already so long, I might break that into two parts.\n\nI hope you enjoy the series.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n2. Security guards\n\nPaladin Security workers and CUPE members rally outside Province House on Feb. 14, 2025. Credit: Jennifer Henderson\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been to a hospital, shopping mall, or the airport in the past five years, you\u2019ve probably noticed Paladin Security officers wearing their distinctive blue uniforms,\u201d reports Jennifer Henderson:\n\nThe majority are newcomers to Canada who arrived through temporary work permits which the province issued to their employer through the Nova Scotia Nominee Program (NSNP). Rohit Kumar lives in Dartmouth and is one of 300 Paladin employees working under contract to Nova Scotia Health. Kumar has worked security at the Dartmouth General Hospital for three years. But Kumar\u2019s application \u2014 and those of at least 100 of his co-workers \u2014 to become permanent residents of Canada are now in jeopardy. That\u2019s because Paladin was disqualified from the NSNP for failing to abide by the rules \u2014 more on that later. And Nova Scotia\u2019s Department of Immigration and Population Growth has failed to find a solution for Paladin employees whose work permits are expiring. \u201cFor me, personally, I was on the last step to obtaining permanent residency,\u201d Kumar told the Halifax Examiner. \u201cI got an email from Ottawa confirming my application was pending, and (that) the next email would say \u2018Congratulations, you are now a permanent resident of Canada.\u2019\u201d But Kumar may soon be forced to leave Nova Scotia for good. His temporary work permit is about to expire since his employer, Paladin Security, did not meet its obligation under the NSNP to file the paperwork requesting the permit be extended. Last summer the security company was the focus of a routine compliance review. In mid-October, the Nova Scotia Department of Immigration informed Paladin it would be \u201cde-listed\u201d as an employer eligible to bring in foreign workers. The consequences of that decision are still being felt by Kumar and hundreds of other Paladin employees in Nova Scotia, who earn $20 \u2013 $24 an hour. In late November, Kumar received an email informing him his application to the federal government for permanent residency was being \u201cpaused\u201d because his employer no longer qualified under the NSNP. But Paladin\u2019s de-listing occurred months \u2014 and in some cases more than a year \u2014 after an estimated 100 Paladin employees had received the necessary documentation and sign-off from the province to continue with their application to obtain Permanent Resident (PR) status from Ottawa. The processing time in Ottawa is currently taking about 13 months, so the \u201cpause\u201d creates a huge stress for hundreds of workers whose temporary permits expire after three years.\n\nClick or tap here to read \u201cPaladin Security\u2019s paperwork screwup dashes hopes for hundreds of temporary foreign workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u201d \u2014 collectively \u2014 don\u2019t want to pay living wages, so we build elaborate schemes to encourage people living outside Canada to come here and work on the cheap. The promise is they\u2019ll have a track to citizenship. But while they\u2019re here, we treat them shoddily, and then we renege on the path-to-citizenship part of the deal.\n\nAs Henderson reports, besides Paladin\u2019s paperwork snafu, there are two other intersecting issues at play here. First is the labour issue specific to this company. \u201cPaladin is a big corporation trying to bust a union,\u201d said Paul Wozney, the MLA for Sackville-Cobequid. \u201cThey know if they can send home a whole lot of the people voting to ratify a first collective agreement, they frustrate the process of workers like yourselves organizing to fight for better pay and working conditions in a workplace that is challenging and demanding.\u201d\n\nSecond is the Houston government\u2019s response to the federal government\u2019s reduction in immigration targets, reports Henderson:\n\nOttawa also cut in half the number of people Nova Scotia can accept in 2025-26 through the Atlantic and provincial Nominee Programs. The maximum is now 3,150 newcomers a year, compared to 6,300. It\u2019s a big change which has already raised concerns among trucking associations and restaurant owners. Both Premier Tim Houston and Nolan Young have stated that with dramatically lower levels of immigration, Nova Scotia must be \u201cstrategic\u201d about who gets in the door, and that priority will be given to skilled workers to fill jobs in health care and the construction industry.\n\nIn practice this means screwing the people who have already come here under the former rules.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\nMayor Andy Fillmore during a scrum after the morning session of the new Halifax Regional Council on Nov. 12. Credit: Suzanne Rent\n\n\u201cDuring Halifax Regional Council\u2019s budget committee meeting Friday, Coun. Becky Kent asked a question out loud that was likely on the minds of her council colleagues, people in the chamber gallery, and viewers on YouTube,\u201d reports Suzanne Rent:\n\nWhere is Mayor Andy Fillmore? Last week, council met for budget discussions all day Wednesday and then all day Friday. On the agenda were the budgets for community safety, Halifax Fire, Halifax Regional Police, and the Halifax Regional Detachment of the RCMP. But Fillmore wasn\u2019t in council chambers all week. \u2026 Besides the budget committee meetings, Fillmore also missed council\u2019s regular meeting on Tuesday. That\u2019s when councillors voted in favour of a staff report on if and how the municipality should remove X as a social media platform it uses to get information to residents. Council also approved a motion for funding of $100,000 for a community mediation pilot to go to the budget adjustment list (BAL). After Kent\u2019s comment on Friday, the Examiner contacted Fillmore\u2019s senior advisor to find out where the mayor was. We didn\u2019t hear back but according to this story by Haley Ryan at CBC, Fillmore was on vacation. If we find out where Fillmore was vacationing, we will update this story.\n\nClick or tap here to read \u201cWhere\u2019s Andy? Halifax Regional Council is in the 2025-26 budget process, but Mayor Andy Fillmore is on vacation.\u201d\n\nFillmore has been on the job for just three months, and he\u2019s already taking a vacation.\n\nAs I was editing this story, I wondered whether \u201cvacation\u201d might be a euphemism for some personal tragedy or emergency that Fillmore needs to attend to. We certainly wouldn\u2019t begrudge anyone for taking off from work to be with a dying relative or to go through a medical procedure or the like. But Rent specifically asked Fillmore\u2019s communications staff about his absence, and they didn\u2019t communicate. We wouldn\u2019t need details \u2014 a simple \u201cAndy has a personal emergency that we\u2019d prefer not to discuss publicly\u201d would suffice, and we\u2019d honour that request for privacy. But as both Coun. Kent and the CBC have said that Fillmore is on vacation, we\u2019re reporting that.\n\nEither Fillmore is actually on vacation just three months into the job and during the most important work of council (formulating the budget and tax rates) or his communications staff has failed to properly inform the public. Either way, it\u2019s on Fillmore.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n4. African heritage\n\nAlex Ross wearing the African Heritage Month t-shirt he designed.

The public policy failure of the Bloomfield School fire\n\nFirefighters at the scene after a fire at the Bloomfield School on Agricola Street in Halifax. Credit: Suzanne Rent\n\nThe historic Bloomfield School burned down early Sunday morning.\n\nThis was predicted. As I reported last winter:\n\nIn the documents, fire inspector Dustin Garnett is very plainly stating that people are sleeping in the building and to keep warm are setting fires. There have already been multiple fire calls to the building, and as the cold weather approaches, both the sleeping and the fires will likely increase. \u201cThere could be a fatality in the building,\u201d wrote Garnett. There was one fire call to the building in 2019, one in 2021, and two in 2022. Three of the calls involved fires inside the building, and the fourth was \u201can incendiary fire on the exterior burning up against the exterior wall.\u201d There is no electricity, water, or fire suppression equipment in the building. The public has also reported that there is a fire pit inside the building, presumably used by unhoused people trying to stay warm. Garnett visited Bloomfield on Oct. 3 and found two open access points into the building. When Garnett walked by a window that was one of the access points in the building, he seems to have startled someone who was in the building, and that person ran away. Garnett noted that there were 8-10 vehicles parked on the property, some with people in them, and that \u201cthe site is not secure to public access.\u201d \u201cAreas of the fa\u00e7ade are failing and there is debris on the ground below from fallen bricks,\u201d wrote Garnett. The next day, Oct. 4, Fire Prevention Officer Larry Viren emailed Garnett, as follows: I would advise not making entry into the Bloomfield Centre. If you are going to make entry into this building, use extreme caution and adequate PPE. We investigated an incendiary fire (HF23\u201011890) at this address about a year ago and due to unsafe conditions on the first floor we did not make entry. The crew reported a hole in the floor in the gym when they were conducting their interior search. The ceiling had collapsed in areas around the entrance and there were wire entanglements throughout the first floor from what we could see from the entry door on the left side of the building.\n\nAn open access point into the Bloomfield school building, on Oct. 3, 2023. Credit: Halifax Fire inspector Dustin Garnett\n\nA second open access point into the Bloomfield school building, on Oct. 3, 2023. Credit: Halifax Fire inspector Dustin Garnett\n\nDustin Garnett, the fire inspector, did his job. He recognized that a building not being properly cared for or secured combined with homeless people seeking whatever shelter they could find from a cold winter could result in terrible tragedy, and he took steps to address it.\n\nBut the building owner resisted Garnett\u2019s efforts:\n\nAlso on Oct. 4, Garnett had a phone conversation with Alex Halef, the co-owner of Banc. Garnett, clearly annoyed at Halef\u2019s general attitude about the problems at Bloomfield, summarized the call in a memo to file: Spoke to Alex and wanted to introduce myself and asked who was the best person to communicate with in reference to 2786 Agricola st and he said him and only him \u201cI\u2019m it\u201d I explained my position and concerns and Alex suggested I should ask HRM as he just bought the property from them so they should have to answer. I said the building has been vacant for two years since he has been the owner and weather has been infiltrating through missing windows and no maintenance has been do [sic] so I felt he as the current [owner] is the only appropriate person to deal with and I wasn\u2019t interested in the history of the building I just needed to deal what was at hand, being the unsecure building with potentially being occupied by people taking shelter and our crews in a position of potentially hesitating making entry due to questionable structural stability. The exterior is showing signs of failure an in an effort of us managing risk effectively we need assurance that the building structural integrity is not compromised. I expressed my concerns that people would seek shelter in this building as temperatures drop and Alex replied people are always in there and they couldn\u2019t be stopped and if he thought that fencing the entire property would stop all trespasser he would instantly fence the property by he knows as soon as he does someone would just easily cut the fence and he would constantly be paying to have the fence repaired just as he does with the boarding of openings, he said he has spent a ton of money buying wood to board over windows. I told Alex he should certainly not be so casual to say to me that there are people in the building all the time. I explained my concerns of people being trapped and disoriented and having egress issues. [I said] that it would be very likely there could be a fatality in the building if there were an emergency. Alex didn\u2019t feel there was much risk of fire and I gave a few examples and explained the importance of fire personnel being confident to make safe entry. Alex felt he may not be able to comply as he first had to consult with his lawyer and alluded to court proceeding may take place under the direction of his lawyer so it is very likely he would not comply by the compliance date, I told him it was a reasonable request I was making and a reasonable amount of time has been given so I expected compliance and suggested that he should really re consider debating since I was motivated by life and public safety. Alex said the property was built like a brick shit house and he couldn\u2019t see the structure being compromised to which I replied that sounded great and should make this an easy issue to deal with. I advised I would send the OTA [Order to Take Action] the following day. The next day, Oct. 5, Halef received the Order to Take Action and emailed Garnett, saying simply \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do here.\u201d\n\nWhat Halef did was appeal the order.\n\nThere was a lot of bureaucratic back and forth, and the city and Banc worked out an agreement in January 2024. But whatever the terms of that agreement, Sunday\u2019s fire demonstrates that it neither kept people out of the building nor lessened the fire risk. The public needs to know why that agreement failed; councillors should be demanding answers and public accountability.\n\nThe collapsing exterior of the Bloomfield school building on Oct. 3, 2023. Credit: Halifax Fire inspector Dustin Garnett\n\nWhen I woke up Sunday to the news that the building was on fire, I was very much worried for unhoused people who may have been in the building, and for firefighters responding to the scene. It is quite fortunate that no one was killed.\n\nAnd although Garnett didn\u2019t name the property in documents I reviewed last winter, he was very clearly alluding to a similar set of circumstances playing out at the former St. Pat\u2019s\u2013Alexandra School on Maitland Street, which like Bloomfield has been sitting vacant for over a decade.\n\nThere are broader issues at play here. As Susanna Fuller, who was an animating force behind Imagine Bloomfield, wrote on Facebook Sunday:\n\nSo many things to say about the fire in the Bloomfield Centre early this morning. Working on writing the history of bad decisions regarding a place that was a safe haven for so many over the years, from a shelter during the Halifax explosion (original building replaced in 1917), to a school for so many, and then in its final stages a community centre that housed artists, food banks, community programs and sports, small non profits who worked for the people who needed them, an unlikely assortment of people and organizations that came together because there was no where to else to go. And the fire last night \u2013 perhaps started by someone trying to keep warm because there was nowhere else to go. Had money not been the primary driver of the decision in 2012 by HRM to sell to the highest bidder, it would likely be an active community centre today, with affordable housing and maybe even a heritage building still in use. A heart breaking pattern of the wrong decisions at the wrong time. A publicly owned property should never have gone back out to a private sale. So much more to say \u2013 but the parade of neighbours today, people who remembered how amazing a place it was \u2013 provided some solace that at least we still have community.\n\nBesides the specific history of Bloomfield is the practice of developers buying up property and then sitting on it, without quickly moving forward with any construction. While they locked other potential developers out of the sites, they didn\u2019t have the organizational capacity or financing to move forward with construction. The result is collapsing buildings that put life at risk.\n\nThese were public properties \u2014 Bloomfield, St. Pat\u2019s\u2013Alexandra, Shannon Park \u2014 that long ago should have been developed quickly with affordable housing, but which have been sitting abandoned for decades. This reflects the unwillingness of governments to build affordable public housing managed by the public on public land on the public dime. The religious faith (there\u2019s no better term for it) in the private market in the face of repeated failures demonstrates the extreme indifference of public officials to the public good, and suggests corruption.\n\nAs a result, more and more people are living rough, and even the tiniest of steps to protect them \u2014 having organized encampments, for example \u2014 are opposed by the likes of Halifax Mayor Andy Fillmore.\n\nBloomfield shows that without an organized place to go, unhoused people will go to places without any oversight at all \u2014 what else are they supposed to do? \u2014 increasing the danger to themselves and others.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to burn down next? St. Pat\u2019s\u2013Alexandra? Point Pleasant Park? Let\u2019s hope that what\u2019s lost in the next fire isn\u2019t accompanied by the loss of life.\n\n(Send this item as a separate article: right click and copy this link)\n\n6. The Icarus Report\n\nCredit: Twitter\n\nI mean, come on.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\nVIEWS\n\nThere is no bottom to the depravity of Trump and Musk\n\nThey are telling us who they are.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack the above tweet and quote tweet.\n\nFirst is Donald Trump\u2019s tweet of \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\u201d This comes just after Vice President J. D. Vance tweeted that \u201cJudges aren\u2019t allowed to control the executive branch\u2019s legitimate power.\u201d\n\nAs Politico reporter Ian Ward notes: \u201cthere is no need for interpretive guesswork regarding Vance\u2019s position. In several instances dating back to the start of his Senate campaign in 2022, the vice president has explicitly said that a second-term Trump should defy the courts \u2014 even the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 if they stand in the way of him exercising executive authority in ways he deems fit.\u201d\n\nSo Trump\u2019s tweet endorses Vance\u2019s view that the president can do whatever he wants, the rule of law be damned. But that\u2019s the least of it.\n\nSeveral large news organizations (CNN, New York Times, ABC, etc.) have reported that \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law\u201d was reputedly uttered by Napoleon. In actual fact, it was attributed to Napoleon many years after his death by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac.\n\nThat\u2019s besides the point, which seems to have missed all those large news organizations: \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law\u201d is now a catchphrase used by ultra-right wingers and Nazis. Most recently, Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, who identifies as a Nazi, used the phrase in his manifesto to justify the murder of children.\n\nNext, let\u2019s look at Musk\u2019s retweet. It consists of 14 flags, sent out at 2:14pm Eastern Time (14:14). Musk, who is obsessed with numbers and hidden meanings, is very clearly making a reference to the \u201c14 words.\u201d As the Anti-Defamation League explains:\n\n\u201c14 Words\u201d is a reference to the most popular white supremacist slogan in the world: \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d The slogan was coined by David Lane, a member of the white supremacist terrorist group known as The Order (Lane died in prison in 2007). The term reflects the primary white supremacist worldview in the late 20th and early 21st centuries: that unless immediate action is taken, the white race is doomed to extinction by an alleged \u201crising tide of color\u201d purportedly controlled and manipulated by Jews. Because of its widespread popularity, white supremacists reference this slogan constantly, in its full form as well as in abbreviated versions such as \u201c14 Words\u201d, \u201cFourteen Words,\u201d or simply the number \u201c14.\u201d\n\nLest anyone think that the use of 14 flags, and not 13 or 15, was just happenstance, Musk tweeted 14 flags again yesterday:\n\nSo both Trump and Musk are happily and openly using the language and symbolism of white supremacy and Nazism, and yet the major news organizations appear unwilling to report on it.\n\nThese people and the followers they are signalling to are quite capable of the absolute worst depravity. Unless stood up to and stopped, they will murder millions.\n\nThey\u2019re telling us as much.\n\nGovernment\n\nCity\n\nTuesday\n\nAudit and Finance Standing Committee (Tuesday, 10am, City Hall) \u2014 agenda link\n\nHalifax and West Community Council (Tuesday, 6pm, City Hall and online) \u2014 agenda\n\nWednesday\n\nBudget Committee (Wednesday, 9:30am, City Hall ) \u2014 link\n\nOpen House \u2013 PLANAPP 2023-01906 (Wednesday, 4pm, Wallace Lucas Community Centre, Lucasville) \u2014 application to allow for campground use and a formalized park entrance for the existing amusement park (Atlantic Splash Adventure)\n\nProvince\n\nTuesday\n\nLegislature sits (Tuesday, 1pm, Province House, and online)\n\nOn campus\n\nMount Saint Vincent\n\nTuesday\n\nNo events\n\nWednesday\n\nFrom Africville: The Paintings of Edith MacDonald-Brown (1886-1954) (Wednesday \u2013 Sunday, to April 26, MSVU Art Gallery) \u2014 exhibition details here\n\nNSCAD\n\nMetu\u2019na\u2019q; Costumes for a Storm (Tuesday, 5:30pm, Treaty Space Gallery) \u2014 community collaborative project; more info here; followed by a performance by Richard \u201cKrow Dog\u201d Taylor at 7pm\n\nIn the harbour\n\nHalifax\n\n04:00: NYK Meteor, container ship, sails from Fairview Cove for Southampton, England\n\n06:00: Atlantic Sun, container ship, arrives at Fairview Cove from Liverpool, England\n\n15:30: Atlantic Sun sails for New York\n\n17:00: Frisian Octa, cargo ship, sails from anchorage for Bilboa, Cuba\n\n18:30: Vivienne Sheri D, container ship, sails from Pier 42 for Reykjavik\n\nCape Breton\n\nNo arrivals or departures.\n\nFootnotes\n\nBy waking up at 4:30am Monday, I was able to attack the ice before the refreeze, and so my sidewalks are currently ice-free.

An ETF can provide plenty of diversification and produce a lot of dividend income. Inside of a tax-free savings account (TFSA), it can be an ideal investment to just buy and hold for years.\n\nA solid option for TFSA investors to consider today is the iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (TSX:XDV). Its management expense ratio is 0.55% and it gives investors exposure to 30 of the best Canadian dividend stocks. The fund picks stocks based on not only their yields but also their track records for dividend growth and their payout ratios.\n\nTop stocks in the fund include Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY)(NYSE:RY), TC Energy (TSX:TRP)(NYSE:TRP), and Canadian Tire (TSX:CTC.A). Financials make up the bulk of the fund\u2019s holdings, accounting for 57% of its overall weight, followed by utilities at 12%. Energy and consumer discretionary stocks also each represent more than 8% of the ETF\u2019s weight.\n\nWhat\u2019s appealing about the fund is that it makes distributions to shareholders on a monthly basis, providing you with a consistent stream of cash flow on a more regular basis than if you just invested in the average dividend stock. And with it yielding 4.3%, it\u2019s a fairly high yield for investors overall.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the ETF has risen by around 18%. This can be an ideal investment for risk-averse investors to put into their TFSAs. With some good diversification and great dividend stocks, you can keep your risk relatively low while also taking advantage of having exposure to companies which offer high payouts.",

Founded in 2013, the company has quickly emerged as a key player in precision medicine, leveraging the power of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to address a wide range of genetic diseases.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics aims to develop innovative therapies that harness the potential of gene editing to provide life-changing treatments for patients in need. The company seeks to correct disease-causing mutations at the root level by precisely modifying genes and promising long-lasting and potentially curative therapies.\n\nHeadquartered in Zug, Switzerland, with additional offices in the United States, CRISPR Therapeutics operates globally to advance its groundbreaking research and collaborate with partners in the scientific and medical communities. The company's multidisciplinary team of scientists, researchers, and industry experts is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of genetic medicine and revolutionizing patient care.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics focuses on developing CRISPR-Cas9-based therapies that target specific genetic sequences. The company's pipeline includes a diverse portfolio of investigational treatments for various diseases, including blood disorders, cancer, and rare genetic conditions. The company's lead product candidate, CTX001, aims to treat transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease by editing patients' hematopoietic stem cells. This product candidate has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA and has been designated with Fast Track Designation from the FDA.\n\nThe target market for CRISPR Therapeutics' gene-editing therapies primarily comprises patients suffering from genetic diseases with limited treatment options. The company's focus on hematopoietic stem cells and blood disorders demonstrates its commitment to addressing this field's unmet medical needs. By targeting genetic mutations directly, CRISPR Therapeutics aims to provide personalized and potentially curative treatments for individuals affected by these conditions.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics boasts a seasoned management team that combines diverse expertise in genetics, drug development, and business strategy. Led by Chief Executive Officer Samarth Kulkarni, Ph.D., the management team has a proven track record of success in the biotech industry. The company's leadership is dedicated to driving scientific innovation, clinical progress, and commercial growth.\n\nOver the past few years, CRISPR Therapeutics has demonstrated mixed financial performance, driven by its groundbreaking research, development efforts and slowed market uncertainty. The company has struggled with reporting revenue growth, reflecting uncertainty in the interest and investment in gene-editing technologies.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics' valuation metrics, such as its price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, are competitive compared to its industry peers. Investors recognize the potential of CRISPR Therapeutics' gene-editing therapies to revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases, leading to increased investor sentiment and a positive outlook for the company's stock.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics stock has exhibited mixed performance in recent years. The company's shares have experienced significant price movements, reflecting the market's recognition of its innovative approach to gene editing. However, there have been several declines in the stock price due to missed earnings reports and regulatory concerns.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics operates within the broader biotechnology industry, which is experiencing rapid advancements and substantial growth potential. The field of gene editing has garnered significant attention due to its ability to target and potentially cure genetic diseases. The industry's growth is fueled by increasing investments in research and development and a growing understanding of the human genome.\n\nCompetition within the industry is intense, with several companies vying to develop gene-editing therapies. However, CRISPR Therapeutics has established itself as a leader in the space thanks to its pioneering CRISPR-Cas9 technology and its robust pipeline of product candidates. The company's early clinical trial success and strategic partnerships further strengthen its competitive positioning.\n\nRegulatory and political factors also play a crucial role in shaping the industry. Gene editing is a rapidly evolving field, and regulatory frameworks are being developed to ensure these technologies' ethical and safe application. Changes in regulations or public sentiment regarding gene editing could impact the industry's trajectory and the adoption of gene therapies.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics has several avenues for growth and expansion. One significant opportunity lies in the advancement of its pipeline and the successful commercialization of its gene-editing therapies. As the company progresses through clinical trials and obtains regulatory approvals, it can potentially bring life-changing treatments to patients worldwide.\n\nWhile CRISPR Therapeutics has demonstrated significant progress and potential, it is essential to acknowledge the risks and challenges inherent in the biotechnology industry. The company faces scientific, regulatory, and commercialization risks that could impact its future prospects.\n\nScientific challenges include ensuring the efficacy and safety of gene-editing therapies and addressing potential off-target effects. The complex nature of genetic diseases and the need for long-term follow-up data pose additional hurdles in demonstrating the durability and efficacy of treatments.\n\nRegulatory uncertainties and evolving guidelines can impact the timeline and cost of clinical development and regulatory approval. Changes in regulations or unexpected regulatory hurdles may delay the commercialization of CRISPR Therapeutics' products and hinder market access.\n\nCommercialization challenges include pricing and reimbursement considerations and competition from other companies developing gene therapies. The ability to secure favorable reimbursement terms and navigate complex healthcare systems will be crucial for successfully commercializing CRISPR Therapeutics' therapies.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics has implemented robust risk management strategies to mitigate these risks and challenges. The company strongly focuses on rigorous scientific research and clinical development, ensuring thorough evaluation of its therapies before advancing them into clinical trials. CRISPR Therapeutics aims to address scientific risks associated with gene editing by prioritizing patient safety and efficacy.\n\nAdditionally, CRISPR Therapeutics actively engages with regulatory authorities to stay informed about evolving guidelines and requirements. The company invests in regulatory affairs expertise to navigate the complex regulatory landscape effectively.

            "content": "Fluence Energy, Inc. is a global leader in energy storage solutions, providing technology and services to customers in over 20 countries. The company was founded in 2018 as a joint venture between Siemens AG and The AES Corporation. Fluence Energy's mission is to transform how the world generates, stores, and uses energy to create a more sustainable future. The company provides energy storage solutions that allow customers to manage their energy supply more efficiently, reduce costs and increase resilience.\n\nFluence Energy's products and services include energy storage systems, control software, and services for customers in various industries, including utilities, renewable energy, commercial and industrial, and data centers. The company has over 300 energy storage projects installed worldwide, representing over 2.5 GW of installed capacity. Some of Fluence Energy's key customers include Arizona Public Service, Duke Energy, and Tesla.\n\nFluence Energy's leadership team comprises experienced executives with deep expertise in energy and technology. Julian Nebreda is the President and Chief Executive Officer. Before becoming CEO, Mr. Nebreda was the South African Strategic Business Unit president at The AES Corporation.\n\nFluence Energy's revenue has grown steadily over the past few years, with the company reporting 15% - 20% increases yearly. The company's gross profit margin has also improved, averaging around 25%. Fluence Energy has yet to be profitable, reporting nominal net income losses yearly; however, it is important to note that during this same period, revenue reported has increased from under $100 million to over $1 billion. This correlates to an increase in total assets mirroring the revenue increase.\n\nFluence Energy's stock has performance paralleled industry peers and is relatively volatile, reflecting changes in the energy markets. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $3.5 billion and a price-to-sales ratio on par with industry peers.\n\nThe energy storage market is rapidly growing, with increasing demand for energy storage solutions to support the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid. The market is highly competitive, with several established players, including Tesla, LG Chem, and Samsung SDI. Fluence Energy has a competitive position in the market, with a well-established brand, a broad product portfolio, and a robust global presence.\n\nFluence Energy has several growth opportunities in the coming years, driven by increasing demand for energy storage solutions and the company's focus on innovation and technology development. The company has recently announced several large energy storage projects. Fluence Energy is also expanding its product portfolio, focusing on developing new energy storage technologies and control software.\n\nWhile Fluence Energy has positioned itself to capitalize on the growing demand for energy storage solutions, the company faces many risks and challenges that could impact its future growth prospects.\n\nThe energy storage market is highly competitive, with established players already operating in the space, including Tesla, LG Chem, and Siemens already operating in the space. These companies have significant resources and established relationships with key customers, which could make it difficult for Fluence to win new business and maintain market share.\n\nAnother risk is the regulatory environment. The energy storage industry is subject to complex regulations, including environmental and safety standards, building codes, and interconnection requirements. Changes in these regulations could significantly impact the company's ability to operate in specific markets, and compliance with these regulations could add additional costs and complexities to Fluence's operations.\n\nIn addition to regulatory risks, there are also macroeconomic risks that could impact the company's performance. Economic downturns could reduce demand for energy storage solutions. At the same time, geopolitical events or trade disputes could disrupt global supply chains, increasing costs and impacting the company's ability to deliver products and services to customers.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Fluence has implemented a number of strategies. The company has invested heavily in research and development to continue innovating and improving its products and services, expanding into new markets, and diversifying its customer base. Additionally, the company has a strong balance sheet, with manageable debt and notable cash reserves, which provides a buffer against potential economic downturns or other challenges.",

The U.S. economy is less sensitive to international trade risks than many of its close trading partners (like Canada), but some sectors, particularly manufacturing, will be negatively impacted by tariff increases.\n\nStill, labour markets look firm. The Trump administration\u2019s DOGE cuts will likely nudge the unemployment rate higher in coming months but we expect it to remain historically low. A slower month-over- month increase in the consumer price index (CPI) in February confirmed that a spike in prices in January was more a reflection of technical seasonal adjustment issues than a change in trend, but inflation is still running above the Fed\u2019s 2% objective.\n\nOur base case assumption is that an outperforming U.S. economy and above-target inflation will keep the Fed from cutting the fed funds target range this year. But, the balance of risks around that call have been shifting with market expectations for additional cuts already showing up significantly in lower term bond yields.\n\nIn Canada, the focus will be on February CPI data\u2014in addition to international trade headlines. We expect to see a rise in year-over-year price growth to 2.5% with the GST tax holiday that mechanically depressed prices in December and January, ending in mid-February. That would end a string of six straight readings at or below the Bank of Canada\u2019s 2% inflation target.\n\nIndeed, evidence was building that a faster-than-expected re-acceleration in Canadian growth late last year and into early 2025 was also putting a floor under inflation. The BoC\u2019s preferred \u201cmedian\u201d and \u201ctrim\u201d core measures (which exclude the impact of changes in indirect taxes) picked up 2.7% year-over-year on average in January, and we expect it likely edged higher again in February. But, concerns that intensifying international trade risks will weigh on the economy are overshadowing stronger recent growth data. We continue to expect further BoC interest rate cuts down to 2.25% this summer.\n\nWeek ahead data watch:\n\nCanadian retail sales are expected to contract by 0.4% in January, following robust growth in the previous month. This decline is primarily attributed to a significant 9% reduction in unit auto sales, partially offset by higher sales at gas stations due to price increases.\n\nare expected to contract by 0.4% in January, following robust growth in the previous month.

            "content": "Source: Getty Images\n\nWritten by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD) and Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) are two of Canada\u2019s best-known bank stocks. Both are in the top three TSX stocks by market capitalization. Both are leading players in Canadian financial services. And finally, both are dividend stocks with comparatively high yields (very high in TD\u2019s case; slightly higher than average in RY\u2019s case).\n\nBoth TD and Royal Bank are well-known banks with strong brands, conservative lending standards and high capital/liquidity ratios. There\u2019s a case to be made for owning both. However, there are some investors out there who want the best-in-class names in their portfolios. For those investors, it might pay to know which, between TD and Royal Bank, is the better bank stock. In this article, I\u2019ll explore that question by comparing TD and Royal Bank side by side.\n\nThe case for TD Bank\n\nA case for buying TD Bank instead of Royal Bank can be based on relative valuation.\n\nTD Bank is much cheaper than Royal Bank stock today. At today\u2019s price, TD trades at the following:\n\n11 times adjusted earnings\n\n18 times reported earnings\n\n12.5 times analysts\u2019 estimate of this year\u2019s earnings\n\n2.8 times sales\n\n1.4 times book\n\nThese are pretty low multiples, particularly if you think that TD\u2019s adjusted earnings figure better represents the company\u2019s long-term average than reported earnings (it excludes the $3 billion fine the company took last year).\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the same multiples for Royal Bank. At today\u2019s price, RY trades at the following:\n\n13.90 times adjusted earnings\n\n15 times reported earnings\n\n13.6 times analysts\u2019 estimate of this year\u2019s earnings\n\n4.4 times sales\n\n1.9 times book\n\nApart from the reported price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, these multiples are all much higher than those of TD Bank. Now, if we take the average of the adjusted and reported P/E ratios, TD is at 14.5 times earnings and RY is at 14.45. These are nearly identical figures, so TD is cheaper overall, ignoring growth potential and risk.\n\nThe case for Royal Bank\n\nAs I showed above, TD Bank stock is cheaper than Royal Bank stock if we ignore growth potential and risk. The thing is, we can\u2019t just ignore growth potential and risk, as these are factors in valuation. And it\u2019s here that a case for buying Royal Bank can start to be built.\n\nTD Bank stock is riskier than Royal Bank of Canada stock by several measures. RY actually has a slightly higher-than-average beta than TD, but if we consider operational risk, there\u2019s no question that TD is riskier. The bank got embroiled in a money laundering controversy in 2023 that led to it taking a $3 billion fine and a $430 billion asset cap last year. The $430 billion asset cap will hold back growth in U.S. retail, which was previously TD\u2019s main growth driver. Royal Bank is not involved in any such legal entanglements, so its business faces fewer risks than TD.",

            "content": "Royal Bank is up 28% in the past year. Are more gains on the way?\n\nRoyal Bank (TSX:RY) delivered good returns for shareholders last year. Investors who missed the rally are wondering if RY stock is still undervalued and good to buy for a self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) portfolio focused on dividends and long-term gains.\n\nRoyal Bank stock price\n\nRoyal Bank trades near $168 per share at the time of writing. The stock is actually off the 12-month high of $180 but is still up 28% in the past year.\n\nRoyal Bank is getting a nice boost from its 2024 acquisition of HSBC Canada. The $13.5 billion deal added 780,000 clients and more than 100 branches. The purchase also gave Royal Bank a leg up on expanding its international capabilities in supporting international wealth, commercial, and retail banking customers.\n\nRoyal Bank negotiated the deal in 2022. The timing proved savvy as two of its Canadian competitors were busy buying or looking to buy banks in the United States and were not in a position to outbid Royal Bank for HSBC. The decision to purchase HSBC Canada instead of chasing an American bank looked even more attractive when regional banks in the U.S. tanked in early 2023 amid a wave of panic triggered by a handful of failures.\n\nRisks and opportunities\n\nCanada is entering a two-year period where more than two million fixed-rate mortgages are coming due. Most of these loans are at much lower rates than the rates currently available in the market, even after the drop from the highs reached in 2023.\n\nBond yields have been volatile in recent months as markets try to determine if sticky inflation will force the Bank of Canada to pause rate cuts or, in the case of the United States, potentially raise rates before the end of the year. Fixed-rate mortgages are priced according to movements in government bond yields. If bonds sell off (yields rise) on expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates, there could be some trouble on the way for the banks who have clients who are unable to cover the jump in interest costs on their mortgage renewals.\n\nAs long as unemployment remains near its current level, households should be fine. However, the tariffs being floated by Donald Trump and retaliatory tariffs coming from Canada risk driving the Canadian economy into a recession while also potentially pushing up prices. The Bank of Canada has to keep inflation in check by maintaining higher interest rates, so it might not be able to reduce rates as much as needed to stimulate a weak economy. In the worst-case scenario, unemployment would spike and rates would remain high. In that situation, loan defaults could surge.\n\nOn the positive side, Royal Bank can leverage its size and financial strength to compete for the best customers of other banks, as homeowners who need to renew their mortgages in the next two years shop for offers.\n\nTime to buy?\n\nNear-term risks need to be considered, but buy-and-hold investors might want to start nibbling on RY stock to take advantage of the recent dip and can look to add to the holding on any further weakness. Royal Bank is very profitable and is positioned well to grow in the coming years.",

Designed for businesses of all sizes and industries, Carbonhound's platform offers intuitive tools intended to simplify carbon tracking and reporting processes.\n\nTORONTO, Feb. 10, 2025 /CNW/ - Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Carbonhound, an automated greenhouse gas emissions reporting platform, today announced a collaboration to help Canadian businesses measure, verify, and manage their carbon emissions. This collaboration aligns with RBC's strategy to support clients in their transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs outlined in RBC's Climate Blueprint, one of the four pillars of the bank's climate strategy focuses on supporting its clients to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2024, the bank set a goal to triple lending to renewable energy across RBC Capital Markets and Commercial Banking, and to allocate $1 billion to support the development and scaling of innovative climate solutions by 20302. RBC aims to accelerate the deployment of capital to the emissions reduction efforts of clients in high-emitting, hard to-abate sectors that are producing the traditional energy the world still relies on. These important actions will lay the foundation to help our clients make progress on the journey to a net-zero future at an accelerated pace.\n\n\"Sustainability reporting has become table-stakes for businesses that want to work in global supply chains and attract top-tier talent. We are excited to work with RBC to help enable Canadian businesses to compete more effectively and expand their margins through sustainability data,\" said Sanders Lazier, CEO and co-founder of Carbonhound.\n\nFor more information about this collaboration and how RBC clients can benefit from Carbonhound's platform, please visit Commercial Sustainable Finance - RBC Royal Bank.\n\n__________________________________ 1 Statements about the performance and the benefits of the Carbonhound platform are made by Carbonhound Inc.

While RBC's approach may evolve over time, we intend to prioritize allocating capital toward solutions that will lead to GHG emissions reductions in Canada and globally. RBC's investment commitments eligible to count towards this goal may also include support for solutions with outcomes linked to biodiversity, nature and/or adaptation, such as those described in RBC's Sustainable Finance Framework, among others. RBC aspires to achieve this goal by 2030; however, market conditions, among other factors\u2014many of which are beyond RBC's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict\u2014could impact our ability to invest capital to advance climate solutions over this timeframe. For purposes of tracking progress towards this goal, RBC's eligible investment commitments made from fiscal 2022 onward are included.

            "content": "Wall Street Banks Target Crypto Boom Amid Regulatory Shift\n\nSeveral major Wall Street banks are strategizing to tap into the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market, according to Bloomberg. This move is spurred by President Donald Trump's favorable stance towards digital assets, potentially unlocking a surge of initial public offerings (IPOs), share sales, and convertible bonds.\n\nMorgan Stanley, traditionally not a significant player in the crypto sector, is actively seeking potential clients for IPOs, while Bank of America Corp. contemplates entering the field of facilitating deals for digital asset firms. Similarly, the Royal Bank of Canada is keen to expand its footprint following its involvement in a crypto deal at the end of last year.\n\nThis renewed interest follows Trump's initiatives to transform the United States into the \" crypto capital of the planet\". Such efforts include executive orders and the establishment of a SEC task force dedicated to monitoring digital assets, potentially reversing the hesitant approach towards cryptocurrencies witnessed during the Biden administration.\n\nNotable crypto companies like Gemini and Bullish are reported to be exploring IPO opportunities, with other firms like Circle Internet Financial Ltd. and Kraken having longstanding ambitions to go public.\n\nData from IndexBox reveals that despite the cautious approach by top banks, the crypto industry experienced a notable surge in capital raising activities. The direction is promising as observable through the $6.5 billion raised in global crypto IPOs in 2023. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. and other financial institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald are also gearing up for increased involvement, signaling a broader industry trend towards embracing digital currencies.\n\nAs optimism around Bitcoin and other digital assets rises, banks like Morgan Stanley and RBC are increasingly aligning their strategies to capitalize on this burgeoning market. Morgan Stanley is particularly keen to target future IPO opportunities after previously assisting Coinbase with a convertible bond sale. Meanwhile, RBC discusses an uptick in Bitcoin and crypto issuers seeking market entry under the new administration.\n\nAt Bank of America, discussions surrounding engagement in the crypto domain have intensified, underscoring the potential of multi-million dollar fees from such transactions. CEO Brian Moynihan mentioned in a CNBC interview that participating in this market depends significantly on the establishment of a regulatory framework.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

The bank was founded in 1855 in Toronto, Canada, and has since grown to become one of the largest banks in North America, with over 85,000 employees and more than 26 million customers. TD Bank is headquartered in Toronto, Canada, and has additional offices in New York City and other major cities throughout the United States.\n\nTD Bank's key highlights and achievements include its status as the sixth-largest bank in North America by assets, its recognition as one of Canada's Best Managed Companies for 20 consecutive years, and its commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility.\n\nThe management team at TD Bank is led by Chief Executive Officer Bharat Masrani, who has been with the company for over 30 years and has held various senior leadership positions before being appointed CEO in 2014.\n\nRegarding financial performance, TD Bank has delivered consistent results over the past few years, with revenue and net income increasing yearly for the past several years. The bank's profit margins have also remained robust, with an average net profit margin of 25%. However, TD Bank has also faced challenges related to debt levels and changes in ownership, with a recent decrease in ownership by TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. Regarding valuation, TD Bank's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios align with industry peers. The company's market performance has also been relatively stable, with modest price movements and steady trading volume over the past few years.\n\nTD Bank operates in a highly competitive and regulated industry, with other major players, including the Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The broader banking industry is also subject to regulatory and political issues, such as changes in interest rates and financial regulations.\n\nDespite these challenges, TD Bank has identified growth opportunities in new markets and product areas. These include launching new digital banking services and expanding the bank's presence in key markets such as the United States and Asia. TD Bank has also made several acquisitions in recent years, including the addition of Scottrade Bank in 2017 and the purchase of Chrysler Financial in 2011.\n\nHowever, TD Bank also faces several risks and challenges, such as changes in consumer preferences and increased competition from fintech startups. The bank's focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility also presents risks related to environmental and social factors, such as climate change and social inequality. There are also recession risks involved. TD Bank could face challenges if there is a downturn in the economy.",

            "content": "Many investors understand the reasons for having a diversified portfolio. One way to accomplish this is to diversify within an asset class. For equity investors in the United States this can mean investing in both growth and value stocks.\n\nIt can also mean investing in international stocks. And when investors want to do this, they need look no further than our neighbor to the north. Canada has a range of stocks for investors to consider. This article will focus on strategies that investors can use when looking to invest in Canadian stocks.\n\nWhy Buy Canadian Stocks? There are a few reasons for investors to consider Canadian stocks as part of their diversification strategy: A Large Natural Resources Sector \u2013 The sheer size of the country and its location lets investors know that it is an area rich in natural resources. This also means that the country has a source of current and future wealth. An Advanced Skills-Based Economy \u2013 In this regard, Canada is similar to other western nations. The difference is that it is not as common to find these skill-based professions in a country with so many natural resources. Stability \u2013 Canada is not exempt from any problems that impact the global economy. However, the country is known for stable financial and business policies that have kept the economy relatively stable. This Goldilocks economy has meant that many Canadian stocks haven\u2019t enjoyed the outsized growth of some U.S. equities. However, it also comes with a bit of protection against downside risk.\n\nHow Have Canadian Stocks Performed? According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, there was a time when U.S. stocks and Canadian stocks performed nearly identically. Here\u2019s a graph that shows the performance of the S&P 500 Index vs. the TSX Index\n\nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence You can see that with a couple of exceptions, the two indexes performed remarkably similar. That all changed around 2012 and Canadian stocks became less attractive. Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence This disparity is widely due to one sector, technology. However, Canadian technology stocks have been on the rise. And in 2022, the country is benefiting from renewed interest in materials stocks as well as a spike in commodity prices.\n\nWhat Are the Best Sectors of Canadian Stocks? For different reasons finance, materials, and energy stocks are among the best performing stocks as of September 2022. Here\u2019s a brief overview of each sector and some of the top names for investors to consider. Financial \u2013 Similar to the United States, Canada has a strong banking industry. Many Canadian banks have a track record of solid performance that can provide long-term value to a portfolio. And several of these stocks pay dividends with attractive yields for investors. This sector makes up the largest percentage of the TSX at roughly 30%. And the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)is the top-weighted constituent in the TSX. Beyond the Royal Bank of Canada some of the other top-performing Canadian financial stocks include: National Bank of Canada ( OTCMKTS: NTIOF )\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank ( NYSE: TD )\n\nBank of Nova Scotia ( NYSE: BNS )\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( NYSE: CM )\n\nBank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) Materials and Mining \u2013 Canadian stocks can be an ideal choice for investors looking to diversify into gold and precious metals without owning the physical metal. Canada has a large natural resources sector. So, it\u2019s not surprising that there are a number of gold mining companies with Canadian origins. This sector also gives investors exposure to other components in the mining and agriculture sectors. This sector makes up approximately 11.5% of the TSX. Some of the top Canadian materials and mining stocks include: B2Gold ( NYSE: BTG )\n\nNutrien (NYSE: NTR) Energy \u2013 Canadian stocks offer both traditional fossil fuel-based energy stocks as well as some renewable energy stocks. This sector makes up approximately 18.5% of the TSX. Some of the top Canadian energy stocks include: Suncor Energy ( NYSE: SU )\n\nEnbridge ( NYSE: ENB )\n\nAlgonquin Power & Utilities (NYSE: AQN) Technology \u2013 As mentioned earlier, technology stocks have largely been the domain of the United States. As evidence of this, information technology stocks make up only about 5.5% of the TSX. However, there are a few Canadian companies that have become stars in the new economy being created. Some of the more popular names include: Shopify ( NYSE: SHOP )\n\nConstellation Software ( OTCMKTS: CNSWF )\n\nLightspeed Commerce ( NYSE: LSPD )\n\nKinaxis ( NYSE: KXS )\n\nBlackberry (NYSE: BB)\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Investing in Canadian Stocks? One concern about investing in Canadian stocks is that they can be heavily weighted towards cyclical industries. For example, as of February 2022 financials (33.5%), energy (14.8%) and industrials (11.7%) made up nearly 60% of the index. That may be too much for some investors particularly because those sectors all tend to correlate roughly the same way as the economic cycle. But as a long-term play, Canadian stocks are worth considering with a small part of your portfolio.\n\nHow to Buy Canadian Stocks\n\nBuy Individual Stocks on a Stock Exchange\n\nHundreds of Canadian stocks have dual listings on either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ. This is the most convenient way to get exposure to Canadian stocks because there are no barriers to stock ownership. These shares can be purchased in U.S. dollars directly from the exchange just like purchasing a U.S. stock.\n\nHowever, for a full list of the best Canadian stocks, investors should look at the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). The TSX is one of the oldest stock exchanges having been founded in 1852. It\u2019s also the third largest stock exchange in North America in terms of market capitalization.\n\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange includes approximately 1,500 companies. It allows investors to trade stocks, investment trusts, exchange-traded products, bonds, commodities, futures, options, and other derivative products. All transactions on the TSX are executed in Canadian dollars.\n\nInvest in a Mutual Fund or ETF\n\nThere are many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that supply exposure to Canadian stocks. Some funds supply exposure to both U.S. and Canadian stocks. Other funds hold just Canadian stocks. Some examples of those include:\n\nBMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF\n\nHorizons S&P/TSX 60\u2122 Index ETF\n\nVanguard FTSE Canada All Cap ETF\n\nAs with investing in any asset class, investors need to consider their investment objective, time horizon and risk tolerance before choosing a fund that fits their needs. Investors will also want to pay attention to the fund\u2019s fee structure to ensure you\u2019re making the most efficient use of your capital.\n\nThe Final Word on Investing in Canadian Stocks\n\nInvesting in Canadian stocks is one way for investors to add diversification to their portfolio. MarketBeat provides a list of the top Canadian stocks that trade on the TSX. This is Canada\u2019s version of the NYSE or NASDAQ in the United States and includes many of the same stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s one advantage of investing in Canadian stocks is that many have a dual listing which removes many of the obstacles that can come with investing in international stocks.\n\nHowever, investors should be aware that many of the best Canadian stocks are in highly cyclical industries which can lead to underperformance when those sectors are out of favor. Still, due to their relative stability and in some cases an impressive dividend, Canadian stocks may have a place in an investor\u2019s portfolio.",

            "content": "MANY years ago, clients of the Royal Bank of Canada used to receive \u201cRoyal Bank Letters\u201d which covered a wide variety of personal and global issues. One of the more memorable and compelling articles was entitled, \u201cThe Elements of Folly\u201d which examined how folly is committed and how it can be avoided.\n\nThe authors regard folly as an elusive concept. To them, there\u2019s a difference between folly and simple foolishness. Anyone can act foolishly sometimes; however, folly involves repeated acts of tomfoolery. Its primary dictionary definition as a \u201cfoolish belief or act\u201d covers minor follies that occur daily. Secondary definitions, such as \u201ca useless and senseless undertaking\u201d or \u201can action that ends or can end in disaster,\u201d come closer to the way folly is used by historians and philosophers.\n\nHowever, the authors do not feel these definitions fully capture the essence of folly. They attribute this shortcoming to a certain mystery about folly, in that it tends to be repeated in the face of compelling evidence that certain decisions and/or actions will reap dire consequences. A similar mystery surrounds criminals who repeatedly commit crimes knowing that if they\u2019re caught, a prison term will result.\n\nThe authors draw examples in history and literature to support their claim about the irresistibility of folly. They cite the familiar story of the Greek\u2019s conquest of Troy. The Trojans were strongly warned that soldiers were hidden inside the wooden horse gifted to them by the Greeks. Yet, they did exactly what they were warned not to do when they hauled it within their city walls. The folly of the British in the 1700s in losing their American colonies was repeated by the Americans in the 1960s and 1970s when they lost the Vietnam War. Arguably, the most egregious folly related to the infamous invasion of Iraq by the USA and its allies. They dismissed the pleas of UN Weapons Inspectors for more time to do a more thorough search for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). They insisted that by bombing the Iraqis into submission\u2013using their own high-priced, hi-tech, WMDs\u2013they would take over the country and find the WMDs much faster than the UN could. As is well known, after a military campaign that cost billions of dollars and claimed the lives of thousands of innocent Iraqis, no WMDs were found. We later learned that the WMD tale was a \u201cred herring\u201d all along.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\nThese examples support Barbara W. Tuchman\u2019s contention in her 1984 best seller \u201cThe March of Folly,\u201d that social and technological progress does not alter the workings of folly. She argued that the architects of folly over the years committed the following errors: (1) they embraced fixed notions and could not be budged from them; (2) they tried to triumph over others by force rather than finesse; (3) they placed exaggerated importance on not showing weakness; (4) they ignored evidence that events were not proceeding as they had predicted; they misinterpreted facts to suit their own biases; (5) they refused to listen to contrary opinions; and they ceased to weigh possible gains against losses.\n\nTuchman highlighted other causes of folly, such as constant overreaction, exaggeration of the danger of not following the chosen course of action, and invention of excuses to persist in it. She concluded that \u201cpeople bent on folly are overpowered by ambition, anxiety, status-seeking and face-saving\u201d.\n\nThe RBC article admonishes us that it would be folly to place all the blame for folly at the feet of those in power and/or those holding positions of authority. She notes that because most of the time folly is committed in quest of what\u2019s new, society seems to have lost its memory, which is \u201cthe mother of all wisdom.\u201d Moreover, in pondering the future, many of us ignore the benefits of looking beyond the recent past, thus allowing folly to work its mischief, and deprive us of the ability to exert whatever influence we can on our leaders and public officials, to steer them clear of it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that CARICOM governments have committed folly by not using the priceless lessons from past, external, political, economic and health shocks to deal with current and future global crises, including those presented by the current administration in the USA. We ought to have been better prepared to deal with any policy-induced hardships that emerge in the short to medium term.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\nThe article concludes by offering the following helpful tips to enable us to avert folly:\n\n1. Don\u2019t kid yourself. Always remember the old saying that there is one you can dupe more easily than yourself. Always seek the advice of people with experience and heed what they have to say.\n\n2. Don\u2019t indulge in wishful thinking. Often, folly begins with wishful thinking about other people\u2019s reactions to the action we propose to take. Distinguish between your desires and your logic, remembering that desire has the upper hand, psychologically. In other words, be realistic.\n\n3. Don\u2019t throw good money after bad. There is a point to cut your losses. To find that point, consider whether the possible good you expect to do for yourself (or for the country- my emphasis) is greater or lesser than the possible bad.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\n4. Admit your mistakes. Many lives are lost, and much money is wasted because people refuse to change direction after their mistakes become clear to everybody but themselves. This resistance to admitting errors, partially explains why folly is repeated so persistently.\n\n5. Face the facts. Folly-prone people have the habit of twisting facts around to justify what they want to do.\n\n6. Don\u2019t go into denial. Since denial is self-generated, it cannot be guarded against by the interested party. It\u2019s best to talk things over with an experienced person who can think and speak objectively.\n\n7. Don\u2019t get carried away. It never does any harm to question what everybody is thinking, saying or doing. Practice what Descartes termed \u201cmethodic doubt\u201d.\n\nSponsored | Article continues below\n\nI commend these helpful tips to you.",

            "content": "The fortunes of Britain\u2019s biggest lenders may well be reflected by a mix of celebratory champagne and commiserative pints by next week, as bankers with an eye on their bonus assess the fallout from a patchy earnings season.\n\nBosses of the UK largest lenders are due to kick off the annual reporting period from Thursday, but their financial performance \u2013 and any resulting bonuses \u2013 will be overshadowed by corporate shake-ups and job losses.\n\nOf the big four bank bosses, NatWest\u2019s Paul Thwaite has one of the easiest jobs ahead. While he is expected to report a 1.8% drop in annual pre-tax profits to \u00a36.1bn on Friday, he will be able to hail the fact that the government\u2019s stake is months away from disappearing.\n\nThe Treasury spent nearly \u00a346bn to bail out NatWest, then known as Royal Bank of Scotland, at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, leaving taxpayers owning about 84% of the lender. That stake has since dwindled to less than 8%, despite a campaign to sell shares to the public, fronted by Sir Trevor McDonald, having been ditched. Instead, Thwaite now expects to return the bank to private hands by June.\n\nNatWest bosses are also reportedly considering boosting the bonus pool by up to 25% to \u00a3450m, giving its bankers much to celebrate.\n\nThere will be far less cheer at HSBC. Bankers at the high street rival are steeling themselves for a swathe of job cuts, with new chief executive Georges Elhedery due to reveal the details of a major restructuring plan, alongside its results on 19 February.\n\nFirst announced in October, the overhaul involves dividing the bank\u2019s operations into eastern and western markets in a move that many believe could help the bank navigate competing political pressures from Washington and Beijing.\n\nAnd while Elhedery had already said he would cut jobs and let some of his most senior staff go, he shocked bankers last month by announcing plans to shut parts of its investment banking operations \u2013 including those handling mergers and acquisitions, and equity fundraising for listed companies \u2013 in the UK, US and Europe.\n\nMorale is horrible. Everyone is panicking, everyone has sent out CVs Banker at HSBC\n\nIt is unclear how many of its nearly 214,000 global staff, including its 40,000 UK workers, will be axed as part of those plans, and bankers fear their bonuses will also suffer.\n\n\u201cMorale is horrible,\u201d one UK-based HSBC investment banker told the Observer. \u201cEveryone is panicking, everyone has sent out CVs.\u201d And for those yet to jump ship, patience is waning. \u201cWhat\u2019s the motivation for me to work when I\u2019m not going to be rewarded?\u201d the staffer said.\n\nFears over a combined \u00a344bn compensation bill over the motor finance commission scandal could also cast a cloud over full-year earnings for UK banks, including Lloyds and Barclays.\n\nLenders have been grappling with the fallout of a shock court judgment in October that vastly expanded a Financial Conduct Authority investigation into motor finance commissions and sent compensation estimates soaring. The landmark ruling determined that paying a \u201csecret\u201d commission to car dealers who had arranged the loans without disclosing the sum and terms of that commission to borrowers was unlawful.\n\nLloyds is expected to suffer a 15% drop in full-year profits to \u00a36.4bn, according to average analyst estimates. But predicting future profits comes with an asterisk, given uncertainty over the outcome of a supreme court case in April where car finance companies hope to overturn the motor finance ruling.\n\nWhile Lloyds is not a party to the court case, it has the biggest exposure to car loans out of the UK\u2019s high street banks. RBC Capital estimates that it could be on the hook for up to \u00a34.6bn. Chief executive of Lloyds Charlie Nunn may struggle to drum up excitement over his progress towards his five-year strategic plan, which has involved branch closures and a major push into digital banking.\n\nThere is one bright spot for UK bankers, though.\n\nBarclays is expected to post a 23% jump in annual profits to \u00a38bn on Thursday, according to Shore Capital, leaving staff in line for large payouts. Its dealmakers are also set fair, as bankers step into the \u201cgo mode\u201d some claim Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has injected into Wall Street, where the UK bank has offices.\n\nBarclays bulked up its half-year bonus pool for the first time in three years in August, signalling that there could be larger payouts for bankers who can now earn 10 times their salary since the EU bonus cap was scrapped. Only the motor finance payouts, estimated to cost it \u00a3442m by RBC, may provide a blemish for the bank, which may be the standout performer in a rocky reporting season.",

These tend to be the bank\u2019s highest rates because they haven\u2019t been discounted. Think of RBC\u2019s posted rates as you would a car dealership\u2019s sticker prices: They\u2019re a fine starting point for a negotiation, but you\u2019d never want to pay them. Special mortgage rates RBC\u2019s special rates are the bank\u2019s posted rates that have already been discounted. These might be limited-time offers or the rates a bank offers its mortgage broker partners. Even if you\u2019re offered a special mortgage rate at RBC, don\u2019t be afraid to try and negotiate a lower one.\n\nRBC special mortgage offers New mortgages: Receive a cash bonus of up to $3,500 and 55,000 Avion points if you get an eligible mortgage by November 30, 2024. Eligible mortgages include closed fixed-rate terms of three to five years and five year variable closed mortgages with principals of at least $100,000.\n\nReceive a cash bonus of up to $3,500 and 55,000 Avion points if you get an eligible mortgage by November 30, 2024. Eligible mortgages include closed fixed-rate terms of three to five years and five year variable closed mortgages with principals of at least $100,000. Mortgage switches: Switch your mortgage to RBC by November 30, 2024 and receive the same benefits listed above, plus a fee rebate worth up to $1,100. Other terms and conditions may apply. Be sure you understand the requirements of any special offer before signing a contract.\n\nFixed vs. variable RBC mortgage rates\n\nFixed mortgage rates With a fixed-rate mortgage, your interest rate will remain the same for the duration of your mortgage term, no matter how much RBC might increase its mortgage rates. Fixed rates offer stability and predictability, but they can cost you plenty in prepayment penalties. Like most major banks in Canada, RBC offers a much larger selection of fixed mortgage rates than it does variable mortgage rates. RBC\u2019s fixed rates range from one to 10 years. Variable mortgage rates If you opt for a variable rate on your RBC mortgage, the rate could rise or fall many times during your term. When it rises, more of your monthly mortgage payment will go toward interest; when it falls, more will go toward the principal. Getting a variable-rate mortgage from RBC allows you to switch to a fixed rate mid-term without incurring any penalties. You can also break your mortgage contract to prepay your mortgage and only be charged three-months interest.\n\nOpen vs. closed RBC mortgages\n\nOpen mortgages RBC offers a small number of open mortgages, which allow you to increase your mortgage payments or even pay your mortgage in full at any time without penalty. RBC\u2019s open mortgages are available as one-year fixed-rate or five-year variable-rate options. Closed mortgages A closed mortgage imposes annual limits on how much you can prepay your mortgage, and may impose other restrictions on the changes you can make to it mid-term. Most of RBC\u2019s mortgage products are closed. The difference? Choosing between open and closed mortgages is often a matter of cost. Open mortgages tend to come with much higher interest rates. At the time of this writing, RBC\u2019s five-year variable rate offer on a closed mortgage was 5.88%. For an open mortgage, it was 9.78%.\n\nConvertible mortgages\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure how long a mortgage term you should choose, RBC offers a six-month convertible mortgage product that allows you to extend your term at any time.\n\nConvertible mortgages tend to offer lower rates than open mortgages.\n\nInterest rate vs. APR\n\nWhen investigating RBC mortgage rates or comparing them to the rates of other lenders, it\u2019s best to use the annual percentage rate (APR) provided rather than the interest rate itself.\n\nAPR includes any other fees that might be added to the cost of your mortgage, and gives you a more accurate figure with which to calculate your potential mortgage costs.\n\nMortgage term lengths at RBC\n\nBetween one and 10 years for its fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThree and five years for its variable rate mortgages.\n\nSix months for its convertible mortgages.\n\nPrepayment privileges at RBC\n\nRBC offers a few prepayment options on its closed mortgages. You can prepay up to 10% of your original mortgage principal once a year. You can also take advantage of RBC\u2019s Double Up feature, which allows you to increase your mortgage payment by up to 100% on any payment date.\n\nHow to get the best RBC mortgage rate\n\nAs Canada\u2019s largest federally regulated A-lender, RBC follows the country\u2019s strict lending guidelines. That means being offered the best mortgage rates at RBC might require:\n\nRaising your credit score. RBC considers credit scores between 660 and 724 to be \u201cgood\u201d, so your credit score will have to be in this range or higher before you\u2019re offered an optimal mortgage rate\n\nRBC considers credit scores between 660 and 724 to be \u201cgood\u201d, so your credit score will have to be in this range or higher before you\u2019re offered an optimal mortgage rate Making a larger down payment. Canada\u2019s minimum down payment guidelines require you to have at least five percent of a home\u2019s sale price at hand to qualify for a mortgage at RBC. But you may have to put far more than that down for more expensive properties, or if the mortgage stress test reduces how much you can borrow.\n\nCanada\u2019s minimum down payment guidelines require you to have at least five percent of a home\u2019s sale price at hand to qualify for a mortgage at RBC.

Negotiating: Never be afraid to ask your RBC mortgage advisor if they can improve on the rate they\u2019ve offered you.\n\nHow to apply for a mortgage with RBC You can apply for a mortgage pre-qualification and pre-approval on RBC\u2019s website. Both forms take just a few minutes and don\u2019t require you to dig up any supporting documentation. If you\u2019d prefer, you can request an RBC agent to walk you through these processes. If you decide to formally apply for a mortgage with RBC, you\u2019ll learn about how to do that directly rom them; there\u2019s no publicly accessible application form online. How to get started on RBC's website Get pre-qualified online Pre-apply for a mortgage Scroll to the bottom of RBC\u2019s mortgage home page, and you\u2019ll find quick links to start the online pre-approval and pre-qualification forms.\n\n\n\nFrom here, you can also contact an RBC mortgage specialist in your area if you\u2019d prefer assistance with these tasks, or if you\u2019d like to get more information. Pre-qualificaiton is a quick way to estimate how large a loan you may be approved for. It\u2019s less comprehensive than getting pre-approved. You\u2019ll want to get pre-approved before you start putting offers on homes. Filling out the pre-qualification form is a simple process. After providing your contact information, you\u2019ll be asked to give RBC permission to access your credit score. Doing this won\u2019t affect your credit score. You\u2019ll be prompted to enter a potential home value as well as the amount of money you have saved up for a down payment. If you haven\u2019t made an offer on a home yet, you won\u2019t know what to enter for \u201cPurchase Price\u201d. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to fill out that field to continue. It\u2019s a good idea to enter your total down payment savings into the \u201cProposed Down Payment\u201d space, though. It\u2019s not necessary, but it\u2019s useful information for your RBC mortgage specialist to have. You\u2019ll then choose a nearby mortgage specialist to help you with the rest of your pre-approval. Click on the card icon next to each name to learn a little bit more about each specialist. RBC provides a modest amount of information about nearby agents, including the languages they speak and their areas of specialization, such as investment properties or first-time home buyers. Who you choose to work with shouldn\u2019t be a make-or-break decision \u2014 they\u2019ll all be offering the same products and using the same qualification guidelines.",

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

So, what\u2019s it worth?\n\nWhile you might have a gut feeling, there\u2019s no substitute for a proper valuation. \u201cA valuation provides a clear picture of the true market value of your business,\u201d says Nuri Benturk, senior vice president of Investment Banking Solutions at RBC Wealth Management\u2013U.S.\n\nThis information is necessary for business owners to plan for the future of their company, whether that\u2019s building a succession plan; deciding whether or not to sell, pass a business down to a future generation or transfer ownership to employees via an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP); or simply determining a growth strategy. Yet a 2024 survey of RBC Wealth Management\u2019s business owner clients found that 41 percent have never completed any type of valuation analysis.\n\nA common refrain among business owners is that the valuation process is too expensive, time consuming and complex. But getting a valuation could be easier than you think. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nWhat is a business valuation?\n\nYour accounting statements present a stripped-down value of your business\u2014the book value if you sold every asset, paid off your debts and cashed out. However, this is rarely the full picture, and there are other determinants of a company\u2019s value to a potential buyer that aren\u2019t found on the balance sheet.\n\n\u201cFor example, imagine a large competitor is eager to expand in your geographic area,\u201d Benturk says. \u201cThey could be willing to pay a premium that\u2019s not being captured in your book value.\u201d\n\nA valuation considers both tangible and intangible aspects of a business, such as assets, liabilities, profitability, market position and future growth potential, to determine its overall worth. Most valuations are conducted by a third party, such as a wealth management firm, business broker, accountant or appraiser, to provide the owner with an objective assessment of their company\u2019s performance and an estimate of what a buyer might pay under current market and economic conditions.\n\n\u201cSometimes owners lose sight of what their business is actually worth, so a valuation can be an important reality check,\u201d Benturk says.\n\nWhen a professional values your business, they come up with a number using different market-based, income-based and asset-based approaches. The appraiser will choose the best method for your specific situation, considering factors such as the purpose of the valuation, your company size, location and industry.\n\nThe benefits of a business valuation\n\nKnowledge is power, and knowing how much your business is worth allows you to make informed decisions in a number of situations, including:\n\nPreparing to sell\n\nNearly 30 percent of RBC Wealth Management\u2019s surveyed business owner clients currently have plans to sell or transition their businesses\u201470 percent of those in the next five years, according to the survey.\n\nWhen thinking about their exit, valuation was a top concern of the surveyed owners. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a crucial step that helps create a more effective business transition plan.\n\nNot only does a valuation give you an idea of what to expect from a sale, but it also helps you identify opportunities to optimize your business that could have a significant impact on the sale price\u2014for example, by reducing costs and improving your margins over the upcoming years.\n\nIt\u2019s important to have your valuation completed early\u2014before you begin looking for buyers or discuss transitioning the business with family or business partners. That way you\u2019ll have time to implement changes that may affect your business value, and you\u2019ll be in a better position to negotiate if someone unexpectedly comes with an offer.\n\nMaking future investments\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about investing even more to grow your business, a valuation can show the return on the money you\u2019ve already spent. \u201cBefore contributing another large round of savings or financing, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know how things worked out in the past?\u201d Benturk asks.\n\nThe valuation and proof of past results would support your case to investors. It could also inform ways to spend additional capital that may generate the most value.\n\nRetirement and estate planning\n\nNo matter how you transition your business, doing so will have implications for both your own future and that of your loved ones. Knowing your business value lets you see how much you\u2019ll have for retirement and what might be available to leave to your heirs.\n\n\u201cEstate planning and business transition planning are integrally related,\u201d says Bill Ringham, director of Private Wealth Strategies at RBC Wealth Management\u2013U.S. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s especially important for owners to work with a coordinated team of experts, including a financial advisor, tax advisor and estate planning attorney, throughout the process.\u201d\n\nFor example, if your valuation indicates that you will be exposed to estate taxes, your advisors can work together to identify tax-efficient strategies that may potentially reduce the tax hit for your heirs, such as by gifting business shares to younger family members.\n\nThey can also advise on other wishes for your estate, such as philanthropic donations, that may influence your succession planning.\n\nNegotiating with your business partners\n\nFor family businesses or companies with multiple owners, if one of your business partners decides to leave, you or another partner may decide to buy out their share. The same is true if a partner passes away and you use a buy-sell agreement with their heirs.\n\nKnowing the business\u2019s valuation helps determine the amount for these future buyouts and enables you to have rational discussions with the best interests of all parties involved, without being clouded by emotions, stress or urgency.\n\nHow to get a business valuation\n\nSome wealth management firms offer informal valuations to their clients for free. In this instance, you\u2019ll need to provide your financial statements and business tax returns.\n\nBut if you are looking for a formal valuation that could form the basis of a buy-sell agreement or to help you prepare for a future sale, it could cost around $30,000 to $50,000, estimates Benturk. These valuations are in-depth, and the firm may partner with an investment bank with experience in your industry to research your valuation. This process takes several weeks, and selling can take several months, which is why it\u2019s wise for business owners to get a head start.\n\nRemember, even a formal valuation is still just an estimate. What you ultimately get in return for your business will be what someone is willing to pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like real estate websites that give you an estimate of what your house is worth\u2014it\u2019s a good starting point for knowing what to expect, but what you actually sell it for depends on the market and the offers you receive,\u201d Benturk explains.\n\nBut, when it comes time to sell, you may be able to use that to your advantage by seeking multiple offers and creating an auction process. \u201cWe had one client where the original estimate was $30 million, but after speaking with over 300 potential buyers, we ended up closing for close to $60 million,\u201d he says.\n\nWhether you\u2019re getting ready to sell or simply want to enhance your business\u2019s strategic planning, working with your financial advisor to understand your valuation is key to navigating the future with confidence.",

            "content": "Canadian employment little changed in February but unemployment rate held steady\n\nBy Nathan Janzen\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nThe February labour market data was broadly in line with expectations \u2013 there are early signs that the intensification of uncertainty from U.S. tariff threats, and pull back in measures of business confidence, had an impact on hiring on the more trade-sensitive goods producing side of the economy, with offsetting growth in more domestically focused services jobs.\n\nOn its own, the improvement in Canadian economic data (upside surprise in Q4 GDP growth, unemployment rate still below its peak late last year, and upside inflation surprises in recent months) would probably be enough to warrant a pause in the BoC\u2019s rate cutting cycle next week. But those positive developments are being overshadowed by escalating U.S. trade threats. The reported one-month reprieve from tariffs for USMCA compliant trade will help, but more trade uncertainty is in the pipeline including steel and aluminum tariffs set to kick in next week and \u2018reciprocal\u2019 tariff announcements to follow in April. We expect next week\u2019s interest rate decision could still be impacted by news flow into early next week and will be a close call.\n\nThe Details:\n\nEmployment was little-changed in February (+1.1k) on relatively soft underlying details \u2013 a 20k drop in full-time work offset by a 21k increase in part-time jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate held steady at 6.6% after falling over December and January from a 6.9% recent peak in November. The steady unemployment rate was due to a 16k pullback in the labour force as the participation rate edged lower and population growth continues to slow (+47k in February)\n\nActual hours worked plunged 1.3% \u2014 the largest one-month drop since 2022 \u2014 but largely because of bad weather. The survey reference week coincided with major snowstorms in parts of Canada. Statistics Canada reported that 429k employees lost work hours due to weather (~4 times more than the average of the prior 5 years.)\n\nOn an industry basis, hiring in the goods sector ticked lower, including a 5k pull-back in the heavily trade-exposed manufacturing sector. But that still only partially retraced a surge in jobs over the prior two months. Transportation services (also heavily trade-exposed) fell by 23k but with offset from a 51k surge in more domestically-focused wholesale and retail jobs.\n\nWage growth ticked higher, to 3.8% (year-over-year) from 3.5% in January.\n\nSee previous versions:\n\nCanadian labour markets showed signs of firming in January\n\nSee update from February 7, 2025 The Bottom Line: Canadian labour markets surprised broadly on the upside for a second straight month in January, with employment rising solidly and the unemployment rate unexpectedly slipping lower.\n\n\n\nIt is probably too early to give labour markets the all clear \u2014 the unemployment rate is still up almost a percentage point from a year ago and wage growth slowed to its lowest year-over-year rate since May 2022. But the unemployment rate may be closer to peaking (or have peaked) earlier than feared.\n\n\n\nThe BoC signaled following their January rate cut that further reductions would be contingent on economic data continuing to look soft so another round of firm looking labour market data reduces the urgency for the BoC to cut again in March. Still, interest rates are at relatively high levels relative to a soft economic backdrop, household spending has shown signs of picking up, but business spending is still very soft. There remain significant risks that U.S. tariffs could be announced before the March policy meeting, and another round of labour market and inflation data still to be released before then.\n\nThe Details: Canadian employment jumped 76k in January, building on the 91k jump in December and with broadly firm underlying details.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate edged down to 6.6%, down from 6.7% in December and 6.9% in November.\n\n\n\nThe drop in unemployment was despite another large jump in the labour force (61k) due to another large population increase (56k) and an increase in the labour force participation rate.\n\n\n\nCanadian monthly labour market data is highly volatile, but the 3-month average of the unemployment rate held steady for the second straight month for the first time since spring 2023.\n\n\n\nThe employment gain was led by a 57k increase in private employment and was roughly split between full-time (35k) and part-time (46k) jobs.\n\n\n\nHours worked jumped 0.9% to build on a 0.7% increase in December.\n\n\n\nWage growth was a soft spot, moderating to 3.5% year-over-year, which is the slowest in 2 1/2 years. But that is not unexpected \u2013 wage growth has long been expected to slow given a higher unemployment rate (still up almost a percent from a year ago) and lower job openings. By Nathan Janzen Canadian labour markets firmed, but still soft, in December\n\nSee update from January 10, 2025 The Bottom Line: The December labour market numbers are clearly firmer than expected, with headlines and details broadly better than feared. Still, the data is notoriously volatile, and the unemployment rate is still up almost a percentage point from a year ago and at its second highest level (outside of the 2020/21 pandemic) since 2017.\n\n\n\nWe continue to think it is unlikely that the broader uptrend in the unemployment rate has ended (the 3-month average rate continued to rise in December) with hiring demand (job openings) still running well below year-ago levels.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada already flagged in December that with interest rates no longer clearly at \u2018restrictive\u2019 levels, and inflation running back around the central bank\u2019s 2% target, the pace of rate cuts will be more gradual, and contingent on the evolution of economic data, going forward. We continue to expect that ultimately the BoC will need to cut the overnight rate to slightly \u2018stimulative\u2019 levels this year \u2013 below the 2.25% to 3.25% the BoC currently estimates as the likely range for the current neutral rate.\n\nThe Details: Canadian employment jumped 91k in December \u2013 the largest increase in almost 2 years and with relatively firm underlying details including a tick lower in the unemployment rate to 6.7% following a jump to 6.8% in November (from 6.5% in October)\n\n\n\nThe increase in employment was mostly from full-time work (+58k) and split between public (+40k, mostly from higher education and health care workers) and private (+27k) employment\n\n\n\nEmployment in transportation and warehousing bounced back 17k after a 19k drop in November that was attributed at least in part to labour disruptions in the earlier month. Manufacturing employment rose by 13k to partially retrace a 29k drop in November.\n\n\n\nHours worked bounced back 0.5% in December after falling 0.2% in November (earlier decline attributed at least in part to labour disruptions)\n\n\n\nThe one soft spot came from a pullback in wage growth to 3.8% (year-over-year) from 4.1% in November and 4.9% in October. The slowing in wage growth is not unexpected given falling job openings (still running well-below year ago levels) and higher unemployment.\n\n\n\nPopulation growth showed further signs of slowing \u2013 the population aged 15+ rose by 67k in December, still higher than historically \u2018normal\u2019 rates, but the smallest increase since early 2023. By Nathan Janzen Canada\u2019s unemployment rate rose again in November\n\nSee update from December 6, 2024 The Bottom Line: Details underlying the November labour market data were mixed but the rise in the unemployment rate (alongside a slowing in wage growth) should reinforce that interest rates are higher than they need to be to keep inflation at the BoC\u2019s inflation target. Our base-case expectation remains that the BoC will cut the overnight rate by another 50 basis points next week.\n\nThe Details: Canadian employment continued to rise in November (+51k) but \u2013 consistent with broader trends over the last couple of years \u2013 not quickly enough to keep up with a growing labour force.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate jumped to 6.8% after dipping to 6.5% in September and holding at that rate in October. The rate is up a percentage point from a year ago and 2 percentage points from its lows post-pandemic lockdowns in 2022.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment increase was driven by another large increase in the population (+80k) but also a retracement of a 0.3 percentage point cumulative drop in the labour force participation rate over the prior two months.\n\n\n\nPart of the volatility in labour force participation (and unemployment rates) in recent months has been tied to volatility in youth labour markets around a time of year when seasonal adjustment of those numbers is difficult. The typically more stable 25-54 year old unemployment rate has continued to grind higher through the fall, rising another 0.2 percentage points in November to build on smaller increases in each of the two prior months.\n\n\n\nThe rise in the unemployment rate continues to be driven more than \u201cusual\u201d by longer job searches for new entrants into labour markets (newcomers to Canada and new graduates) but permanent layoffs have still accounted for almost 40% of the rise since late 2022.\n\n\n\nThe employment increase in November itself was relatively firm \u2013 +54k full-time employment to offset a small part-time decline. Most of the increase came from public sector jobs (education and healthcare) with manufacturing employment down 29k. And hours worked declined 0.2%, although in part due to the impact of strikes.\n\n\n\nBut wage growth also slowed to 4.1% from 4.9% \u2013 we continue to expect the recent pace of wage growth will not be sustained with job openings (hiring demand) lower and the unemployment rate higher. By Nathan Janzen Canada labour markets still soft in October\n\nSee update from November 8, 2024 The Bottom Line: October marked a second straight month of headline labour market data that was better than feared \u2013 particularly the unemployment rate holding steady after ticking lower in September. But details were once again softer than headlines would suggest. Hiring demand has continued to slow with job openings falling and we continue to think the most likely near-term path for the unemployment rate is higher rather than lower.\n\n\n\nWe continue to think there is more urgency for the Bank of Canada to respond to a underperforming Canadian economy (and slowing inflation pressures) with larger and more interest rate cuts than other advanced economy central banks. Our base-case forecast assumes the BoC will cut the overnight rate by another 50 basis points in December.\n\nThe Details: Employment rose 15k in October \u2013 close to expectations and still running well below population growth (still elevated at 85k in October)\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate, though, held steady at 6.5% after declining for the first time since January in September.\n\n\n\nDetails underlying headline employment and unemployment rate numbers were mixed.\n\n\n\nFull time jobs rose by 26k (with partial offset from an 11k pullback in part-time work) and hours worked rose 0.3%.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate, though, only held steady thanks to falling labour force participation (to 64.8% from 64.9% in September and 65.1% in August) and a sharp pullback in unemployment among younger workers (20-24 year olds) that offset increases across other age groups.\n\n\n\nYouth labour market data has been highly volatile, but unemployment rate for the core 25-54 year old cohort that makes up the bulk of the workforce has continued to grind higher, including another increase (to 5.6%) in October.\n\n\n\nWage growth rose to 4.9% from 4.6% in September, but wages lag broader economic conditions and lower job openings (which have still been falling) and higher unemployment rates continue to argue that growth in pay will slow going forward.\n\n\n\nThe three-month rolling average for the unemployment rate overall still hit a new post-pandemic high in October, and driven mostly by a tick higher in the share of unemployment coming from permanent layoffs. By Nathan Janzen Canada job growth jumped higher, but details are soft\n\nSee update from October 11, 2024 Employment jumped by 47k in September and the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged lower for the first time since January (to 6.5% from 6.6% in August)\n\nFull time employment jumped 112k with partial offset from a 65k drop in part-time work. But details beyond those headlines are substantially more mixed, and still consistent with a further underlying softening in labour markets.\n\nDespite the favourable full-time/part-time job mix, total hours worked declined by 0.4% (consistent with still soft GDP growth trends)\n\nThe tick lower in the unemployment rate was driven by a drop in labour force participation among 15-19 year olds that may have reflected difficulties seasonally adjusting the data around the end of the typical summer jobs work period.\n\nOverall population growth continued to run well in excess of employment growth at 110k, and the unemployment rate for 25-54 year olds (which make up the bulk of the labour force and should not be as impacted by summer seasonal trends) actually rose to 5.5% in September from 5.4% in August.\n\nAnd wage growth showed further signs of slowing, easing to 4.7% from 5.1% in August. Pressure on wage growth should remain downward given persistently falling job openings, higher unemployment (even with the tick lower in September) and weak post-pandemic productivity growth trends.\n\nBottom line: Our own base-case forecast assumes 50 basis point cuts from the BoC to the overnight rate in each of October and December, and those moves would still make sense after today\u2019s labour market data. Details behind the September job numbers were far more mixed than the headline employment and unemployment rate readings alone would imply. Hiring demand (job openings) have continued to move sharply lower, increasing the odds that the unemployment rate will continue to rise, and a pullback in hours worked leaves GDP growth in Q3 still tracking in line with our own 1.0% (annualized) forecast and well below the BoC\u2019s latest 2.8% forecast from July. Combined with slower inflation, interest rates still look clearly higher than they need to be with a softer economic backdrop still leaving risks tilted to price growth slowing to below the BoC\u2019s 2% target in the year ahead. By Nathan Janzen Canada\u2019s job market continues to cool\n\nSee update from July 05, 2024 Employment was little changed in June \u2013 edging down 1k with a 3k drop in full-time employment offsetting a small 2k rise in part-time work. Hours worked declined by 0.4%.\n\nBut with population and labour force still surging that pushed the unemployment rate up to 6.4%, the highest reading outside of the pandemic shock since October 2017.\n\nA large share of the rise in the unemployment rate is still coming from students, in part due to a softer summer jobs market. But the rate of monthly layoffs has also continued to creep higher, and was up 20% from a year ago in June.\n\nAverage hourly earnings remained firm, rising 5.4% from a year ago. Still, other wage measures derived directly from business payrolls (and typically viewed as a more reliable indicator) have been slower and are still running below the rate of inflation growth versus pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe BoC will be watching the potential inflationary impact of wage growth closely, but slowing hiring demand and rising supply of unemployed workers means that wage growth is most likely to move lower.\n\nBottom Line: The dip in employment in June is small but layoffs are creeping higher under the surface. The unemployment rate is now up 1.6 percentage points from its post-pandemic lows (a larger increase than in some historical \u2018recessions\u2019) and a downtrend in hiring demand (lower job openings) has shown no sign of ending. The BoC will still be watching the next round of inflation data and their own Business Outlook Survey closely ahead of the next interest rate decision later this month (July 24th) but with interest rates still at restrictive levels, the bar to at least easing off the monetary policy brakes further in the near-term is lower. The June labour market data increases the odds that the central bank will cut rates in July.\n\nDisclaimer",

We made our decision not based on what project we thought was the easiest or the cheapest to execute, but what we found our community would ask us to do. What we thought the community had been begging for yet no one took the time to lend an ear.\u201d\n\nAzaria Ali of St Stephen\u2019s College who took home the third place prize and the award of the best written presentation said her experience was nothing short of transformative.\n\n\u201cIt was more than just a competition, it was an opportunity to harness creativity, leadership and teamwork to address real-world issues. Through the St Stephen\u2019s College eco-aquatic aquaponic project, we learned that sustainability isn\u2019t just a buzzword, it's a responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe programme pushed us beyond our comfort zones, teaching us resilience, strategic thinking and the power of a well-executed vision. I now understand that leadership is not a title, but an action \u2013 one that requires patience, persistence and the ability to inspire others.\u201d\n\nJerome Chambers, co-operative development co-ordinator at the Youth Development and National Service Ministry, was inspired by the speeches of the young leaders, who revived his sense of hope for the future of TT.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that irks me is when I hear people say TT is not a real place,\n\n>\n\n\u201cBut this morning I am convinced that it is. Because we are doing great things, not just for ourselves, but for the generation that comes after. There is hope. TT is a real place.\u201d",

            "content": "XRP USD XRP +0.74% )\n\nWhether you are new to the cryptocurrency space or have been here since 2009, there\u2019s a good chance you have come across Ripple and the cryptocurrency XRP. While at first, it\u2019s easy to mistake Ripple and XRP as the same thing, this isn't the case by any means. In fact, many are surprised to learn that the terms XRP and Ripple are not interchangeable.\n\nWhat is Ripple?\n\nSimply put, Ripple is the company that created the Ripple Consensus Ledger. In this way, Ripple functions as both a platform and a currency. Ripple developers utilize an open-source protocol to provide users with a host of benefits. These benefits include secure, fast, and inexpensive transactions.\n\nHowever, Ripple is not meant to function purely as currency such as with Bitcoin. Whereas Bitcoin was meant as a means to circumvent the traditional financial system, Ripple fulfilled a totally different market niche. The platform was designed to bridge the gap between traditional financial institutions and the blockchain sector.\n\nImportantly, Ripple (XRP +0.74%) is different than many other popular cryptocurrencies for some key reasons. Primarily, it differs from the competition because it was created by a private, for-profit company. Today, Ripple has offices in San Francisco, New York, London, Sydney, Luxembourg, Singapore, and Mumbai. The firm serves more than 300 financial institutions across over 40 countries.\n\nThe history of Ripple begins back in 2013 when a group of intuitive developers decided to join forces to create something unique within the market. At that time, Jed McCaleb, best known as the creator of the EDonkey network, invited a team of advantageous investors to participate in a project known as Ripple Labs. Importantly, McCaleb is also a major figure in the sector. He was pivotal in the creation of numerous crypto-based startups including Ripple, Stellar, and Overnet.\n\nRipple Labs\n\nRipple Labs is the official name of the tech firm that developed the Ripple payment protocol. Notably, this San Francisco-based firm was founded officially in 2012. Originally, Ripple Labs entered the market under the name Opencoin. However, in 2015, the firm rebranded into its current name.\n\nRipple Labs was founded by a well-known angel investor and privacy activist, Chris Larsen. Larsen is a charismatic figure who is best known for co-founding online mortgage lender E-loan back in 1996. He was joined by the programmer and entrepreneur, Jed McCaleb.\n\nNotably, McCaleb is best known as one of the co-founders of the infamous Mt.Gox exchange. Mt.Gox was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges in the world and for a long time, it was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world. At one point, the exchange handled 70% of all Bitcoin trading volume. Importantly, he sold his shares and was not affiliated with the exchange during the June 2011 hack that sent Bitcoin prices plummeting for months.\n\nRippleNet\n\nRippleNet is the community of banks, financial institutions, and professionals that make up the Ripple business community. Since its inception, Ripple worked hard to secure this vast network of industry professionals. These firms are privy to Ripple's advanced blockchain system.\n\nThe network enables banks to enjoy a frictionless experience as they send funds globally in seconds. Today, RippleNet includes some of the best-known institutions in the sector. Here are some of the major milestones during the RippleNet expansion so far:\n\nBank of America\n\nIn 2016, BOA announced a partnership with Ripple. It turned out that the bank had been secretly testing the firm's technology as a way to improve inter-bank infrastructure for months prior to the announcement.\n\nSBI Holdings\n\nIn 2016, SBI Holdings and Ripple inked an agreement to integrate the bank into RippleNet. The move was seen by banking executives as a way to streamline remittances and instantaneous cross-border payments. Not surprisingly, since the concept emerged, more than 47 banks have signed on to the project.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank (SCB)\n\nIn 2016, Standard Charter Bank joined a team of other investors to put forth $55 million towards further development of Ripple\u2019s technologies. In total, the investment took Ripple\u2019s Series B funding round up to $93 million in total.\n\nSantander and American Express\n\nIn 2017, Ripple partnered with the credit card firm American Express and major banking firm Santander. The strategic partnership was meant to further streamline cross-border payment systems. Notably, the news helped bolster XRP prices at that time. Specifically, XRP's market value shot up over 35% when the news went public.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada\n\nIn a surprising maneuver, the Royal Bank of Canada released a detailed report titled \u201cImagine 2025\u201d in which the bank went into detail regarding their testing of Ripple\u2019s technologies. Specifically, the report states that RippleNet can reduce average banking costs by 46% per payment. Additionally, RBC\u2019s report states that the settlement time for transactions processed through Ripple is only 3-5 seconds. This is a huge improvement over the current system which takes 2-3 days on average.\n\nMoneyGram\n\nIn June 2019, Ripple secured a partnership with one of the most recognizable names in the remittance sector. MoneyGram. Again, the goal of the project was to provide money gram access to Ripple's cross-border payment technology:\n\nMore Partners\n\nNational Bank of Fujairah PJSC (NBF)\n\nMoneyMatch\n\nWestpac Institutional Bank and Bank of Australia\n\nUniCredit, Reisebank, ATB, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, UBS\n\nMUFG Bank\n\nDBS\n\nTogether, RippleNet continues to work on the development of a new framework to implement across the network. Notably, the guidelines cover important aspects of the functionality of the network. These points of concern cover legal compliance, operational custody, and other standards for acting as the intermediary.\n\nWhat is XRP?\n\nXRP serves a very important purpose within the Ripple Ecosystem. This token is the digital asset that facilitates the use of the network's utilities. In this way, XRP functions as a utility token. This token represents the transfer of value across the Ripple Network.\n\nYou can think of XRP as the mediator for exchanges. These exchanges can include both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. In essence, XRP is sort of a wild card. It allows participating banks the ability to facilitate global money transfers without the need to consider exchange rates and such.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say a bank in the US needs to send $5 million to another institution located in the EU. Under normal conditions, this transfer would be a costly and time-consuming process for many reasons. Firstly, the funds would need to go through a number of third-party verification systems to ensure they are actually available and sent securely.\n\nEach of these parties adds to the total cost of the transactions, as well as the amount of time it takes to complete the transfer. On top of these fees, banks would have to consider the international money conversion rate. In the example listed, the US bank will lose some of its holdings in the conversion over to Euros.\n\nHere is where XRP serves its utility purpose perfectly. The previously listed example would go much smoother via the Ripple ecosystem. The US bank could simply convert its funds over to XRP. This process is as simple as selecting the number of funds you desire to convert and clicking a button.\n\nNow that the bank's fiat currency has been converted to XRP, it's easier to send the funds anywhere in the world. Best of all, the transfer costs only a fraction of the traditional systems in place currently. To put the savings in perspective, sending a payment of $1,000,000,000 through your bank internationally can cost you thousands of dollars. Using Ripple, the exact same transaction only costs cents.\n\nAdditionally, since there is no cap on how much funds you can send via XRP, it provides banks with more flexibility in the market. Currently, sending over $1 million globally requires banks to meet a host of additional regulatory requirements. These requirements can delay transactions for up to 3 days. XRP eliminates these issues within the Ripple ecosystem.\n\nRipple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) \u2013 A Cryptocurrency Without a Blockchain\n\nWhile you might consider blockchains a core part of all cryptocurrencies, this isn't the case with Ripple. Ripple uses a proprietary decentralization technology and consensus mechanism \u2013 the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA). The Ripple Protocol consensus algorithm (RPCA), is applied every few seconds by all nodes, in order to maintain the correctness and agreement of the network. In the RPCA system, each server publishes a list of new transactions to the network, known as the \u201ccandidate set.\u201d\n\nThen, each server compares its list to the current state of the network and the proposed changes. Once the comparison is complete, the servers will vote on the state of all transactions. In the end, 80% of the nodes must agree on the new transactions to reach a state of approval. The system adds all the transactions that met these requirements to the distributed ledger. The system then closes the ledger. This closed ledger provides a point of reference to verify the next RPCA.\n\nRipple's Products\n\nRipple currently offers two main products to its users. The first product is known as xCurrent. xCurrent was among the first products Ripple Labs developed for the market. This global real-time gross settlement system provides users with some pretty impressive functionality.\n\nFor example, users can clear and settle transactions in minutes. Traditional money transfer systems can take 2-5 days to complete. Additionally, users gain access to the RippleNet messaging services which allows the network to maintain instant communication.\n\nxRapid takes xCurrent a step further and eliminates the need for accounts at all. This protocol is able to source liquidity from the local market to complete the transactions. For example, when a bank may want to send $1 million to another bank in the network, the xRapid system would buy XRP with the sender's money and then sell XRP on the side of the buyer to complete the transaction.\n\nThis process allows banks to send smaller amounts internationally because it eliminates much of the overhead in doing so. Additionally, it enables banks to send money to locations that may cost well above the average transfer rate. Consequently, these products enabled Ripple to compete in the market from day one.\n\nxRapid is revolutionary because banks don't want to hold XRP, or any cryptocurrency, for long periods of time. Instead, the system exchanges the funds to and from XRP in seconds. This speedy transaction is possible because the XRP ledger can handle 1500 transactions a second.\n\nInvesting in Ripple (XRP)\n\nRipple (XRP) is available for purchase on the following exchanges.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nCoinbase \u2013 A publicly traded exchange listed on the NASDAQ. Coinbase accepts residents from 100+ countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States (excluding Hawaii).\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry and offers trading access to over 190 countries, including Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States (excluding Maine, New York, and Washington state).\n\nFiat to XRP\n\nThe process can take a bit longer if you are planning to enter the market with fiat currency. In this scenario, you will need to connect your bank account or debit/credit card to your exchange account. This process can take days as some platforms send a verification transaction to the bank. This transaction is usually just a couple of cents. You will need to verify its amount to prove you own the bank account attached to your exchange account.\n\nOnce you have proven that the account belongs to you, you will then need to purchase one of the cryptocurrencies that have a fiat pairing. Basically, not all cryptocurrencies are available to purchase directly with fiat currency. Many exchanges require you to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum first. Once you possess one of these major cryptos, you can then trade them for any exchange pair they qualify at.\n\nThe fastest service is by Paybis, as it offers super fast credit card processing.\n\nHow to Store Ripple (XRP)\n\nIf you seek to make a major investment in XRP or if you are planning on HODLing this crypto for long periods of time, a hardware wallet is the best option. Hardware wallets keep your crypto stored offline in \u201ccold storage.\u201d This strategy makes it impossible for online threats to access your holdings. The Ledger Nano S or the more advanced Ledger Nano X both support Ripple (XRP).\n\nInvesting in Ripple Stocks\n\nRipple Stock is another way that you can participate in Ripple's growing ecosystem. Unlike XRP, Ripple stock is a direct investment into Ripple. Purchasing Ripple stock requires you to meet all the current securities laws in place in the US. As such, investing in Ripple stock can be a bit more difficult for those unfamiliar with the stock market.\n\nSince Ripple isn't a publicly-traded company, the only way to acquire shares in the firm is via private investors on the secondary market. To buy and trade Ripple stock you will need to qualify as a \u201csophisticated investor\u201d. Consequently, you must be an accredited investor to buy shares of Ripple Inc. at this time. To qualify as an accredited investor, you will need to show that you possess $1 million in liquid assets at this time, or that you earned over $200,000 per year for the last 3 years in a row.\n\nOnce you are able to prove your investment qualifications, you are ready to invest. The first thing you will need to do is head over to shareposts.com or the MicroVentures app. Here you will need to register for an account. Once you are qualified and approved, investing is as simple as finding Ripple Inc. and deciding how many shares you desire.\n\nRipple continues to see growing adoption across the sector and for good reason. This future-oriented firm has effectively carved out its niche in the market for years to come. Consequently, you can expect to hear a lot more from this community as XRP and Ripple expand their presence in the traditional financial markets. For now, Ripple appears to have a bright future ahead of it as more financial institutions express interest in joining the RippleNet.\n\n*July 14, 2023 UPDATE*\n\nAfter a multi-year court battle, Judge Torres, who was presiding over the case, announced a split decision surrounding the charges laid against Ripple Labs by the SEC.\n\n\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, te SEC's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Institutional Sales, and otherwise DENIED. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to the Programmatic Sales, the Other Distributions, and Larsen's and Garlinghouse's sales, and DENIED as to the Institutional Sales.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Ripple was found guilty of selling unregistered securities directly to institutions, as these were clearly viewed as investment contracts. Outside of this point, which is in favor of the SEC, it is widely viewed that Ripple \u2018won' the case. It was found that both programmatic sales of XRP and those made by Larsen & Garlinghouse did not constitute the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nThis decision was made due to the following distinction.\n\n\u201c\u2026the vast majority of individuals who purchased XRP from digital asset exchanges did not invest their money in Ripple at all. An Institutional Buer knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract, but the economic reality is that a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money\u2026Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the Court concludes that Ripple's Programmatic Sales of XRP did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.\u201d\n\nThese rulings are significant, as many of the circumstances of the case and points made echo those of other digital assets on the market. While each and every case is unique, a modest level of clarity has now been provided for the status of altcoins.\n\nWhile the ruling may be challenged by the SEC, digital asset exchanges have already begun relisting the asset now that the fear of regulatory violation has diminished. Moving forward, a trial will decide whether Larson and Garlinghouse knowingly aided in the illegalities that the company did take part in.",

And, even as the list of unknowns remains long, the past week has taught us a few things about what a trade shock could look like for the Canadian economy.\n\nHere are five things we learned this week that are critical for the trade discussion.\n\n1. Trade angst isn\u2019t likely to go away anytime soon\n\nWhile we won\u2019t speculate on the odds of whether 25% tariffs come back into play after the 30-day pause, there are a range of other trade policies that will keep conversations about American trade with Canada and its global trading partners alive.\n\nFor one, the America First Trade Policy is set to deliver recommendations by April 1st, and it involves an investigation into whether foreign countries are subjecting U.S. citizens and companies to \u201cdiscriminatory or extraterritorial taxes.\u201d Second, Mexico, Canada and the U.S. will be preparing for the July 2026 review of the USMCA trade agreement. Moreover, while Canada and Mexico averted tariffs, the U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on China, which prompted retaliatory measures from China. While we see these being more impactful to China than the U.S., this is another clear indication of the momentum of global protectionist policies.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has indicated he is thinking about tariffs on the European Union. Combined, this agenda tells us that trade uncertainty is likely to be a persistent multi-year economic force that may not only require short term forecasts to be adjusted, but also long term perspectives about global economic orders.\n\n2. The Bank of Canada would likely cut interest rates further\n\nMarkets have suggested (and we agree) that the BoC would likely cut in response to an aggressive tariff policy.\n\nAs we noted in A playbook for how to measure a tariff shock in Canada, a central bank\u2019s response to a trade shock is an important factor in assessing the ultimate hit to growth from tariffs. There were questions in the lead up to how the BoC might respond, even as recently as their Jan. 29th meeting when they explained their reaction would depend on whether the hit to growth or the rise in inflation would dominate. And yet, in the trading day following the news of tariffs, yields at the front-end of the Canadian bond curve swiftly priced in almost an additional rate cut from the BoC, and the Canadian dollar sharply weakened. While we typically wouldn\u2019t take much from one day of market activity, those moves give us a taste of what enacted trade disruptions could mean for markets. It also tells us that markets expect (and we agree) that the economic growth risks from higher tariffs would offset any potential mechanical impacts on inflation from Canada\u2019s retaliatory measures.\n\nSustained (lasting more than weeks) tariff hikes will likely push the BoC to cut rates more aggressively than we currently expect. Although, as we\u2019ve discussed, the expected duration of tariffs and the extent of fiscal responses from provincial and federal governments would determine the ultimate size and speed of further cutting.\n\n3. Canada\u2019s retaliatory strategy would impact growth and inflation\n\nOne giant question mark in our ability to assess the impact of a trade conflict has been around what Canada\u2019s retaliatory strategy might look like. We did get clues, at least, as to what the current government\u2019s approach might be.\n\nThe federal government had previously hinted at a partial response of tariffs on about $155 billion of Canadian merchandise imports from the U.S.\u2014worth 20% of U.S. goods imports. Details about the initial $30 billion of planned U.S. imports to target with tariffs were released over the weekend (with another $125 billion of yet to be specified products to be targeted in three weeks).\n\nIn our view, those retaliatory measures would raise prices for Canadian purchasers. More than a third of the initial $30 billion retaliatory products are food by our count. But the partial response means Canadian importers and households would have more options to avoid tariffs by sourcing from alternative regions or substituting with cheaper non-tariffed products.\n\nFor roughly a quarter of products targeted in the initial package, the U.S. accounts for 30% or less of total Canadian imports, implying other import sources could readily be available. And, there are other avenues for households to substitute for alternative products. For example, oranges would be hit with significant tariffs in that original wave, but apples and pears would not.\n\n4. Sectors and provinces would be hit differently by proposed tariffs\n\nA different tariff treatment creates a different shock for manufacturing versus energy, and their corresponding provincial exposures. Our prior work on Canadian trade has highlighted two areas of particular vulnerability in a U.S.-Canada trade conflict\u2014manufacturing and energy.\n\nWe know manufacturing is roughly 9% of gross domestic product and tight integration leaves it exposed to the compounding effect of tariffs on parts and components crossing the border several times through the production process, and any breakdown of supply chain links arising from a loss of competitiveness. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Ontario would be harder hit by U.S. tariffs, because their manufacturers are overweight U.S. exports\u2014accounting for 71% to 78% of sectoral GDP. Quebec\u2019s economy would also face significant challenges.\n\nYet, a more favorable treatment of Canadian energy exports, tariffed at 10% instead of 25%, was information that helps us frame a slightly better outlook for energy and thus, energy-related products than manufacturing as a base case. Canada\u2019s mining and oil and gas sector also strongly depends on the U.S. market\u2014U.S. exports represent 64% of sectoral GDP. But a lower 10% rate, and the fact that U.S. Midwest refineries may not have immediate substitutes for Canadian heavy crude oil gives a relative (not absolute) reprieve that would relieve some pressure on energy-producing provinces\u2014mainly Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nMeanwhile, broad-based tariffs would have a lesser impact in British Columbia and Nova Scotia, which have greater export market diversification.\n\n5. Fiscal strategies suggest both outlays and reforms could be in play\n\nFederal and provincial governments appeared more focused this past week on retaliation, but we gathered some idea of the potential fiscal direction that could be taken should trade conflicts begin to reheat.\n\nFirst, the government did not announce an immediate fiscal support package as it did with 2018\u2019s U.S. steel and aluminum tariff, but highlighted it was monitoring developments and utilizing existing government programs. That\u2019s a possible hint governments would need to see tariffs in place for a sufficient amount of time to create a need for support. In our estimates, large tariffs would likely need to be in effect from somewhere between three to six months, depending on the policy, to accelerate the risk of recession. And yet, it appears several governments stand ready to provide support. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his government would provide income replacement plans like the federal government did during COVID-19, along with subsidizing targeted companies and providing general economic support. However, as we highlighted before, governments will have to think hard about the correct size, scope and targets of policy\u2014a tariff shock is a different economic animal than a pandemic.\n\nSecond, we have witnessed a lot more discussions around investment in Canada\u2019s economy that would improve its resilience, productivity and self-sufficiency ranging from a commitment to critical minerals to tax reform. While we try not to speculate on the path of policies, the emphasis on items we have long felt would be productivity-enhancing is helping to provide us with a sense of optimism about Canada\u2019s medium and longer-run prospects. Still, it remains to be seen whether politics become policy. We also think the renewed urgency and desire to tackle productivity-damaging internal trade barriers in Canada is a critical discussion that would support growth and lower inflation\u2014with or without a trade conflict with the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer",

            "content": "Charter Communications Inc is a mass media and telecommunications company in Stamford, Connecticut. The company has become one of the largest cable and internet service providers in the United States since it was founded in 1993. Charter Communications serves over 30 million customers across 41 states. In addition to providing cable television and internet services, Charter offers home phone services, mobile services and advertising solutions. Key highlights of the company include its acquisition of Time Warner Cable in 2016, which made it the second-largest cable operator in the US and its launch of Spectrum Mobile, a mobile virtual network operator, in 2018.\n\nCharter has seen steady growth in its financial metrics over the past few years. However, the company's debt levels have increased recently, with long-term debt rising from $64.2 billion in 2020 to $96 billion in 2023. This rise in debt is coupled with a stock price decrease of close to fifty percent from the third quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2022.\n\nCharter operates in the highly competitive telecommunications industry, undergoing significant changes due to technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences. The industry is dominated by a few prominent players, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon. In addition, there has been a trend towards cord-cutting in recent years, as consumers increasingly opt for streaming services over traditional cable television. This trend has pressured cable companies to adapt and offer customers more flexible and affordable options. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political forces, with ongoing debates around net neutrality and the role of telecom companies in shaping public discourse.\n\nCharter's leadership team changed hands in the fourth quarter of 2022 when Charter appointed previous COO Christopher Winfrey to the CEO lead, replacing CEO Thomas Rutledge, who had been at the helm for ten years.\n\nOne of the key growth opportunities for Charter is its expansion into the mobile services market through Spectrum Mobile. The company launched Spectrum Mobile in 2018, leveraging its existing infrastructure to offer customers affordable mobile plans. Spectrum Mobile represents a significant growth opportunity for Charter as the demand for mobile services continues to grow. The company is also investing in its broadband network, with plans to extend its coverage and increase internet speeds in underserved areas.\n\nOne of the critical risks facing Charter is the ongoing trend towards cord-cutting, as customers increasingly opt for streaming services over traditional cable television. This trend has pressured cable companies to adapt and offer customers more flexible and affordable options. The industry is also subject to regulatory and political pressures, with ongoing debates around net neutrality and the role of telecom companies in shaping public discourse. As a result, Charter could face increased regulatory scrutiny, impacting its operations and financial performance. Another challenge for Charter is the potential for increased competition, particularly from new entrants to the market. The telecom industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies and players emerging. Charter must continue to innovate and invest in its network to remain competitive.",

The project is known as SFF-06 (the \u201cProject\u201c) and is located in Cramahe, Ontario. The SFF-06 project is being financed through a combined loan for two projects (SFF-06 and 903) (\u201cLoan\u201c) in a principal amount of $25.8 million from Royal Bank of Canada as Lender, Administrative and Collateral Agent and Green Loan Structuring Agent (the \u201cLender\u201d or \u201cRBC\u201c).\n\nSolarBank has selected Anvil Crawler Development Corp. (\u201cAnvil Crawler\u201c) to perform the civil and electrical work on the project and awarded Anvil Crawler a contract with an expected value of $1.85 million to complete such work. Anvil Crawler is part of Skyline Group of Companies (Skyline), a fully integrated asset acquisitions, management, development, and investment firm. With $5.4+ billion (as of December 31, 2020) in assets under management, Skyline has been building strong, supportive, and sustainable Canadian communities for 20+ years.\n\nThe Project is owned by 1000234763 Ontario Inc. (\u201cProjectCo\u201c) and ProjectCo is the borrower under the terms of the Loan. The Project represent SolarBank\u2019s initial foray into battery energy storage, a market forecast by Fortune Business Insights to grow at a 16.3% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to reach US$31.2 billion by 20291. SolarBank\u2019s interest in ProjectCo was acquired as part of the $45 million valued acquisition of Solar Flow-Through Funds Ltd. that closed in July 2024.\n\nIn July 2023, the Project was awarded a contract by the Independent Electricity System Operator (\u201cIESO\u201c) under the Expedited Long-Term RFP (E-LT1 RFP). The contract, which has a term of 22 years, includes a fixed contract capacity payment of $1,221/MW per business day, significantly above the weighted average price of $876/MW for all storage category projects under the E-LT1 RFP. This underscores the competitive positioning of these projects in the Ontario energy storage market. The Company expects that once operational the Project will have 4.74 MW of daily contract capacity available (at a capacity payment to ProjectCo of $1,221/MW per business day) for 251 business days in a year.\n\nFurthermore, the Project is eligible for the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit introduced in 2024. This refundable tax credit provides up to 30% reimbursement of eligible capital costs for new clean technology, significantly enhancing the economic returns of the projects. This aligns with SolarBank\u2019s commitment to leveraging government incentives to accelerate the transition to renewable energy while optimizing financial performance.\n\nThe Company has an indirect 50% interest in ProjectCo, with the remaining 50% held by a partnership formed by First Nations communities in Ontario.\n\nThere are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to required permits, the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company, the risks associated with the construction of a battery energy storage project and the degredation of battery storage capacity over time based on the number of discharge cycles. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for battery energy storage, which could result in future projects no longer being economic.

            "content": "Romance scams are one of the leading scams in Canada, the U.S. and many countries around the world. Already the leading scam in 2018, losses due to romance scams continued to rise through the 2020s. A recent Norton report highlights this troubling trend, revealing that online dating scams increased by 72% in the past year alone.\n\nNearly 350 million people worldwide use dating apps and sites, and participation continues to grow. While the popularity of online dating steadily climbs, however, so does the presence of romance scammers. Not only stealing money from their victims, these scammers can also cause significant emotional harm.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from becoming a victim of a romance scam.\n\nBe cautious about sharing information online\n\nOne of the reasons romance scammers are so successful in manipulating victims is that they do their research: they learn what individuals are interested in, what their hobbies are, where they love to travel, and even where they live. Consider this: You love to garden and go hiking in the winter. By posting pictures of these hobbies on Instagram, you give scammers details about you that they can use to get close to you. A question about your favourite winter hikes in the area would undoubtedly catch your eye!\n\nWhile you may not be prepared to give up your social accounts (and nor should you have to), there are some things you can do to limit the personal details you reveal to strangers:\n\nKeep your social accounts private \u2013 only allow people you know personally to follow you\n\nRegularly go through your friends and followers \u2013 if you don\u2019t have a real relationship with someone anymore, delete them\n\nWhen you\u2019re chatting with someone on a dating site, hold back on some personal details \u2013 don\u2019t share everything about yourself\n\nCreate a profile name that doesn\u2019t give away too much \u2013 avoid using your last name, year of birth or place of work\n\nRecognize the red flags\n\nRomance scams aren\u2019t always easy to spot \u2013 especially when you become emotionally invested in a relationship. Many people also believe that they simply wouldn\u2019t fall for a romance scam \u2013 they\u2019re too smart for that! The reality is that even the brightest, most experienced, most skeptical people can fall victim to a romance scam. This is because these scammers know what they\u2019re doing, often have a team of people working with them (along with proven scripts and tactics they can use) and know how to prey on people\u2019s vulnerabilities.\n\nThat\u2019s why avoiding romance scams takes a good measure of diligence and perceptiveness. Here are some of the most common red flags of a romance scam:\n\nSomeone looks too perfect \u2013 their profile picture resembles a model more than a regular person\n\nTheir profile picture is an extreme close-up or just a partial photo \u2013 this suggests they want to hide their \u201cidentity\u201d\n\nThe individual you\u2019re chatting with showers you with over-the-top affection and compliments early in the relationship \u2013 this is a sign a scammer is trying to win you over quickly\n\nSoon after connecting, they want to leave the dating site and ask to communicate directly \u2013 dating sites now have tools that can detect romance scams, so taking a conversation offline increases a scammer\u2019s chance at success\n\nThey claim their job makes them unable to connect in person \u2013 i.e., they are in the military, work on an oil rig, or work in an undisclosed branch of government\n\nThey promise to meet in person but always come up with an excuse why they can\u2019t \u2013 if you haven\u2019t met the person after a few months, there is reason to be suspicious\n\nThey ask for money \u2013 this is a bright red flag that someone is trying to scam you. Even if you\u2019ve been in an online relationship for several months or the amount they ask for is small, any request for an online transfer, prepaid gift card or investment dollars is a sign of a scam.\n\nInvolve your friends or family\n\nWhile you may understandably want to keep your personal life personal, one of the best ways you can protect yourself against a romance scam is to keep someone else in the loop about who you\u2019re connecting with online. Compared with someone who is emotionally connected, an individual with an outside perspective may be in a better position to spot red flags.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t need to share every conversation, letting a trusted friend or family member in on the direction and nature of the online relationship can help avoid heartbreak. Remember, if they try to isolate you from friends or family, that\u2019s a signal they\u2019re running a romance scam.\n\nDo your research, ask questions\n\nOnline scammers helped launch the term \u201cCatfishing,\u201d which happens when someone lures another into a relationship through a fictional persona. As many romance scammers are not who they appear to be, they can\u2019t often stand up to a few simple questions. Here\u2019s how you can test their authenticity:\n\nUse online searches, like Google\u2019s reverse image search, to research the person\u2019s photo and profile and see if they have been used elsewhere\n\nAsk questions about specific experiences \u2013 i.e., \u201cCan you walk me through your trip to Italy? What cities did you visit?\u201d\n\nAsk about their local area, such as their favourite local restaurant\n\nIf you\u2019re on a video call, ask to see something in the room they\u2019re in \u2013 such as the view out their window or a pet they claim to own. Asking for the person to move around can help reveal AI-generated/enhanced personas\n\nWhile romance scams continue to cheat people out of money, love and trust, it is possible to avoid being a financial or emotional victim. Navigating online dating platforms armed with your own tactics and defenses can help you fend off fraudsters and find people with a similar objective \u2013 to find someone real to connect with.",

            "content": "TLDR The U.S. has paused imposing 25% tariffs on a wide swath of Canadian exports and 10% tariffs on energy exports. Canada has also paused its proposed tariffs in response. Canadian business owners have demonstrated resilience in the past. Drawing from tried-and-true tools and strategies can help weather upcoming uncertainty. Business scenario planning \u2013 also known as \u2018what if\u2019 planning \u2013 can help you prepare for a range of situations in times of change. Your 2025 business plan can help you stay focused and agile. Bringing it up to date is an important step.\n\nCanadian business owners are no strangers to disruption. From pandemic shutdowns to supply chain issues, talent shortages to inflation, they\u2019ve weathered it all. Now, with the reality setting in of possible 25% tariffs on Canadian exports to the US., businesses are bracing for more turbulence.\n\nWill things get choppy? Likely. But you\u2019ve got this. As a business owner, you\u2019ve adapted, pivoted and developed resilience that has pulled you through tough times before. Weathering this next storm comes down to applying lessons learned, preparing your business for change and creating a Plan B (and maybe a Plan C) to navigate through the uncertainty ahead.\n\nOn February 1st, the U.S. announced 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and 10% tariffs on Canadian energy exports imported into the U.S. In response, the Canadian government announced 25% tariffs on $155B worth of goods imported from the U.S. As of February 3rd, a day before the tariffs were due to take effect, the U.S. and Canadian governments reached an agreement that put the tariffs on hold for 30 days. Visit the Government of Canada website for a rundown of the U.S. tariffs and Canada\u2019s response.\n\nThe RBC Economics team has released its key insights on the situation. Read A U.S.-Canada trade shock now in play: first economic takeaways for their outlook.\n\nHow can tariffs affect Canadian businesses?\n\nAs goods enter a country, they are classified by customs. Some goods have a government-mandated tariff added to the cost that the buyer must pay, essentially a sales tax, before the goods are released at point-of-entry (for example a retailer buying inventory or manufacturer securing parts to make their products). The impact of these tariffs on the Canadian economy and Canadian businesses will depend largely on how long the tariffs remain in place and what, if any, escalation occurs as a result of counter-tariffs.\n\nThis article from RBC Economics outlines the potential impacts to Canada, the factors that influence that impact and the ways a U.S. tariff would likely flow through the economy.\n\nCanadian businesses of all sizes will feel the impact of tariffs \u2013 not just big business. While 56% of Canadian goods exported to the U.S. come from larger businesses, 43% of exports are from small and medium-sized businesses, according to Statista.\n\nAs businesses face the uncertainty of what might come next, there are ways to prepare for the fallout.\n\nFive things to do now to prepare your business for U.S. tariffs\n\n1. Evaluate the risks within your industry\n\nAs the RBC Economics report outlines, trade-sensitive industries are the most vulnerable to tariffs. If your industry trades a lot relative to your production, it will be more exposed to the impact of tariffs. The automotive industry has been highlighted as the most vulnerable, with primary metal and chemical manufacturing, construction and agriculture as others high on the list.\n\nKeep in mind, some industries may contend with indirect impact \u2013 restaurants in towns reliant on automotive manufacturing, for instance, may see fewer customers if there are layoffs or even extended uncertainty.\n\nIf your business relies on goods imported from the U.S., it\u2019s worth reviewing the list of items covered by tariffs imposed by the Government of Canada. It appears the government is keen to give Canadian businesses time to find alternate suppliers. This last-minute reprieve also provides an opportunity to find ways to protect your business \u2013 some of the strategies outlined below can be a great starting point.\n\n2. Examine your inventory, supply chain and customer base\n\nDecades of free trade have led to integrated supply chains across Canadian and U.S. borders. This means goods travel back and forth throughout production lifecycles \u2013 a product may be manufactured in Canada but require parts from the U.S. \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 and may be shipped back and forth before it\u2019s completed.\n\nIn other circumstances, companies might import supplies from China or Mexico, which may transit through the U.S. Businesses that rely on transitioning goods \u2013 even if those goods aren\u2019t destined for the U.S. \u2013 could be affected.\n\nHow might tariffs affect your business?\n\nIf you export to the U.S. Your products will become more expensive for your U.S. customers. This could mean they become less competitive in the U.S. market: Demand may soften \u2013 especially if Americans can find a similar product for less\n\nProfit margins may need to be cut\n\nCost cutting measures may be necessary If you import from the U.S. Retaliation tariffs will likely occur. As the prices you pay for U.S. goods rise, your margins may take a hit: Owners may be forced to substitute U.S. goods and inputs\n\nProfit margins may tighten if businesses absorb price increases\n\nGoods imported from China or Mexico that transit through the U.S. may need to be reevaluated\n\n3. Run business scenarios based on changing consumer demand\n\nScenario planning is one of the best ways to prepare your business for periods of uncertainty. Often defined as \u201cwhat if\u201d planning, business scenario planning involves making assumptions about what the future will bring to understand how different situations may affect your business.\n\nSince there is considerable uncertainty around the tariffs, there are plenty of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d to consider.\n\nCatch webinar re-cap: RBC Small Business Talks: Incorporating Scenario Planning into your Business Plan [Webinar Recap]\n\nWhat if sales slowed? If the U.S. is one of your primary markets, you may face softer demand \u2013 especially if American consumers can find an alternative to your product for less.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nInitiate new marketing programs to reach new client groups\n\nAdjust product features to appeal to a new audience\n\nExplore alternate markets\n\nWhat if profits take a hit? If the cost of your inputs increases, your bottom line may be affected.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nRevisit your market analysis and consider raising your prices\n\nLook for alternate suppliers that aren\u2019t subject to tariffs\n\nFind ways to reduce your fixed and operating costs\n\nWhat if there is fluctuation with the Canadian dollar? The Loonie has already dropped and further fluctuation isn\u2019t out of the question. How do you prepare for economic circumstances beyond your control?\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nConsider raising your prices to offset the impact of a lower CAD\n\nRenegotiate supplier contracts where possible\n\nLook for domestic suppliers to mitigate foreign currency concerns\n\nWhat if you need to take on more debt? If you need to turn to credit to shore up your cash flow, can your business absorb the repayments?\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nLook for lower-interest-rate debt, especially for longer term needs\n\nRenegotiate terms with lenders, if possible\n\nMeet with an advisor to discuss your options\n\nBuy Canadian If you\u2019re purchasing parts, inventory, materials or other goods, consider supporting your fellow Canadian business owners whenever possible.\n\n4. Research new revenue streams\n\nWhile it may be impossible to replace the U.S. as a customer, consider ways into other markets that can help you diversify your sales.\n\nRBC offers tools and support to help you identify potential markets, global trading partners and new supplier networks.\n\nWhile you\u2019re doing your research, consider, too, new ways to deepen your existing local customer base. Is there a different demographic set you can reach with new marketing tactics or product features? Are there new sales channels you can tap into? As you evaluate your products and your markets, it\u2019s also a good opportunity to brainstorm ways to further innovate or differentiate your offering. This may be the time to get creative!\n\n5 min read: Turning Point: Real Entrepreneurs Share Their Marketing Secrets for Growing a Customer Base\n\n5. Streamline your business operations\n\nAs you potentially deal with higher input prices, softer demand and/or tighter profit margins, it\u2019s worth looking for ways to reduce your operating costs. Can you lean into technology to automate time-consuming and expensive manual processes? Can you outsource labour? Does it make sense to downsize your office or warehouse space so rent and utilities costs go down? Read our Five Tips to Help Find Hidden Savings and Offset Rising Business Costs for more ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Canada is a major market for the U.S. \u2013 in fact, this country is the #1 market for 34 U.S. states and cross-border trade sustains millions of jobs and businesses on both sides of the border. So, as a Canadian business owner, you do have some negotiating power when working with U.S. customers and suppliers. Staying informed and being positioned for change can help prepare your business for what comes next.\n\nRead RBC CEO Dave McKay\u2019s message on Linkedin\n\nIf you haven\u2019t refreshed or created your 2025 business plan, this it the time to get moving!

            "content": "In December, the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its overnight rate by 25 basis points, marking its third consecutive rate cut. But mortgage rates in the U.S. haven\u2019t followed suit. In fact, rates have gone up \u2013 not down \u2013 since the Fed began lowering rates in September. Why? Here we look at what really affects mortgage interest rates in the U.S., and what\u2019s behind the recent rise.\n\nTLDR The 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. is benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury yield \u2013 not the Fed\u2019s overnight rate The rate on the 10-year Treasury yield is driven largely by future economic expectations rather than current monetary policy The U.S. is facing stubborn inflation figures and economic uncertainty as new policies take shape under a changing administration \u2013 this future uncertainty drives up the rates that are more closely tied to U.S. fixed rate mortgages\n\nFactors that drive mortgage rates in the U.S.\n\nThe rise and fall of mortgage rates in the U.S. are not influenced by one single factor \u2013 rather, there are several drivers that may cause fluctuation. The health of the economy is a major influencer \u2013 economic downturns tend to lead to reduced demand for credit, and as lenders compete for borrowers, rates typically go down. The opposite holds true when the economy is healthy. Inflation is another key factor. Since lenders have to ensure that interest rates are higher than the rate of inflation to maintain the value of returns, mortgage rates tend to rise with inflation.\n\nFinally, federal monetary policy decisions have both a direct and indirect effect on mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve\u2019s overnight rate, also known as the federal funds rate, serves as a key benchmark that influences all other interest rates in the economy. But wait\u2026 the federal funds rate has been going down while mortgage rates have gone up, right? The reason is that fixed rate mortgage rates are influenced less by current monetary policy and more by future outlook.\n\nThe impact of future monetary policy and the secondary mortgage market on fixed mortgage rates\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend money to one another overnight, making it an interest rate on very short-term lending. So, interest rates on other short-term bonds and loans will move very closely with changes to this overnight rate. Because a 30-year mortgage is a long-term loan, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the 30-year mortgage rate isn\u2019t all that tight.\n\n\u201cThe federal funds rate influences short-term consumer loans and credit cards,\u201d explains Jaren Hawks, Senior Product Manager, Real Estate Financing at RBC. \u201cA 30-year mortgage has a different timetable, so is influenced by different rates, and has a different benchmark.\u201d\n\nThat benchmark is the 10-year Treasury yield, as its term is closer to the average mortgage. As this rate moves, mortgage rates tend to follow suit. This connection exists because of the secondary mortgage market, where investors buy mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In this secondary market, lenders bundle the mortgages they underwrite and sell them to investors. More on that later.\n\nWhen it comes to the effect of monetary policy, it\u2019s true that current monetary policy has some impact on the 10-year Treasury note rate. However, it\u2019s investors\u2019 expectations for future monetary and fiscal policy, economic growth and inflation that have the greater influence.\n\nBecause the Treasury yield is so closely linked to future expectations, it wasn\u2019t the rate cut itself that had the greatest impact on fixed mortgage rates in December. Rather, it was more the message that the Fed will take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025 that contributed to the rise in mortgage rates. Following the December announcement, economists changed their thinking: while they initially thought rates might be reduced to below 3 percent, they now project that the Fed will keep rates between 3.5 and 4 percent.\n\nSo, why is the Fed taking a cautious approach? At the December meeting, most Fed members agreed that inflation risks are rising, pointing to stubbornly high prices, strong economic growth, and the potential effects from changes in trade and immigration policies tabled by the Trump administration. Fed staff also warned that tariffs could slow economic growth and keep inflation high, adding to the uncertainty.\n\nTerm premiums also play a role in mortgage rates\n\nThe term premium is the portion of the 10-year Treasury yield that reflects additional compensation investors expect for buying longer-term debt versus repeatedly reinvesting in short-term securities. In other words, it\u2019s the extra return investors demand for tying up their money in a longer-term investment, given the uncertainty and risk that comes with holding debt for a longer period. The term premium is partly driven by the balance between supply and demand for Treasury bonds and partly by uncertainty \u2013 the more uncertain the future is, the more compensation investors require because buying longer debt becomes riskier.\n\nThe 10-year term premium has risen a total of 85 basis points since September, when the Fed announced the first of last year\u2019s three rate cuts. This rise would explain at least half of the increase in long-term rates. Case in point: the rise in the term premium aligns with the 111.7 basis-point jump in the 10-year Treasury yield during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe spread\u201d can have an impact on rising rates\n\nWhile fixed mortgage rates and the 10-year Treasury yield are closely linked, they\u2019re not exactly the same \u2013 there is a gap between the two, which is known to economists as \u201cthe spread.\u201d The spread, or difference, between the rate offered on a 30-year mortgage and the 10-year Treasury note is made up of two components:\n\nThe primary-secondary mortgage spread, which represents industry origination costs such as servicing fees, guaranty fees and other lending costs and profits The secondary mortgage spread, which represents the additional risk that investors take on when investing in a mortgage-backed security (MBS) relative to investing in a 10-year Treasury\n\nTypically, the gap is 1.5 to 2 percentage points, but for much of 2023 and 2024, the gap grew to 3 percentage points, further bumping up mortgage rates.\n\nWhy have spreads been so high? Here again, uncertainty plays a role: people are unsure about the future. After all, mortgage rates soared in a short amount of time \u2013 rising from 3.15 percent in November 2021 to 7.12 percent in October 2022 \u2013 so Americans don\u2019t really know what to think going forward! Moreover, the recent negotiations over federal debt between former President Biden and House Republicans have played a role. History has shown that even getting close to a breach of the U.S. debt ceiling could cause significant disruptions to financial markets \u2013 in fact, the last federal debt showdown \u2013 in 2011 \u2013 caused spreads to widen.\n\nWith this potential economic disruption comes a wariness by both lenders and investors to take on risk, which in turn translates to an extra fee to borrow. As such, spreads rise.\n\nAnother contributing factor is that there are fewer buyers for mortgage mortgage-backed securities (MBS). During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve bought billions of dollars\u2019 worth of mortgage bonds, but they\u2019re no longer in the market for them. And so, remaining MBS buyers are looking for a better deal. As you might expect, when investor demand is high, mortgage rates trend lower. When investors aren\u2019t buying, rates might rise to attract them.\n\nWhile spreads have leveled out recently, their sustained widening in recent years have contributed to the rise in mortgage rates.\n\nHow the Fed rate cuts affect adjustable-rate mortgages\n\nFixed-rate mortgages dominate the U.S. mortgage landscape \u2013 of the 40 percent of Americans that have a mortgage, a whopping 92 percent have a fixed rate mortgage. The remaining 8 percent have adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Adjustable-rate mortgages (also known as variable-rate mortgages) have interest rates that can change over time based on the financial index they are linked to. While they start out with a fixed rate for a certain period of time, once this fixed period is up, rates adjust on a regular basis according to whatever index the rate is tied to.\n\nFor example, with a 7/1 ARM, you would pay the same interest rate for the first seven years, then the rate would adjust every year after that. With a 5/6 ARM, meanwhile, the rate is fixed for the first five years, then adjusts every six months.\n\nThe rates on ARMs are often tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Because the Fed\u2019s rate decisions influence savings tools, raising or lowering the federal funds rate can make the SOFR go up or down. Accordingly, ARM rates go up or down as well when the rate resets.\n\nSo, if the federal funds rate goes up, your ARM rate will increase as well at the next adjustment. And of course, when the federal funds rate goes down, so too will your ARM rate.\n\n\u201cWhile ARMs can help you save money in a declining interest rate environment, the risk of rising rates is a key reason so many Americans prefer the stability of a fixed-rate mortgage,\u201d says Hawks.\n\nHow Canadian and U.S. mortgages respond differently to federal rate cuts\n\nIf you have both a Canadian and U.S. mortgage and have seen federal interest rate cuts both sides of the border, you may wonder why Canadian mortgage rates have come down while U.S. mortgage rates have gone up. The main reason is that Canadian mortgages have shorter refinancing terms versus their U.S. counterparts. Consider this: In the U.S., the mortgage terms span the length of the amortization period \u2013 hence the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Canadian mortgages, meanwhile, have a number of shorter mortgage terms within the amortization period (think your standard 3-year or 5-year term). This means that changes to the Bank of Canada\u2019s overnight rate affect Canadians\u2019 mortgage rates more directly.\n\nMore Canadians have variable rate mortgages than Americans too \u2013 while roughly 13% of Canadians had variable rate mortgages at the start of 2024, their popularity is rising once again. Remember, only 8 percent of Americans have a mortgage with a variable rate.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t determine fixed mortgage rates, but its policy decisions do affect the larger economic picture, which in turn influences your borrowing costs. So, while interest rate cuts may not have a direct impact, the Fed\u2019s monetary policy will affect mortgage rates indirectly \u2013 it\u2019s just not an immediate correlation. Rather, a complex web of factors influence fixed mortgage rates. And, with considerable uncertainty, sticky inflation figures and changing policies with a new U.S. President, the Fed has issued a message of caution. This means mortgage rates haven\u2019t dipped even with recent rate cuts \u2013 and they will likely maintain their current range for the foreseeable future.",

            "content": "$25.8 Million Royal Bank of Canada Facility is being used to finance\n\nconstruction of the 4.99 MW BESS Project\n\nTORONTO , Feb. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - SolarBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) (\"SolarBank\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that its first Battery Energy Storage System (\"BESS\") project located in Ontario is expected to commence construction during the week of February 10, 2025. The project is known as SFF-06 (the \"Project\") and is located in Cramahe, Ontario . The SFF-06 project is being financed through a combined loan for two projects (SFF-06 and 903) (\"Loan\") in a principal amount of $25.8 million from Royal Bank of Canada as Lender, Administrative and Collateral Agent and Green Loan Structuring Agent (the \"Lender\" or \"RBC\").\n\nSolarBank has selected Anvil Crawler Development Corp. (\"Anvil Crawler\") to perform the civil and electrical work on the project and awarded Anvil Crawler a contract with an expected value of $1.85 million to complete such work. Anvil Crawler is part of Skyline Group of Companies (Skyline), a fully integrated asset acquisitions, management, development, and investment firm. With $5 .4+ billion (as of December 31, 2020) in assets under management, Skyline has been building strong, supportive, and sustainable Canadian communities for 20+ years.\n\nThe Project is owned by 1000234763 Ontario Inc. (\"ProjectCo\") and ProjectCo is the borrower under the terms of the Loan. The Project represent SolarBank's initial foray into battery energy storage, a market forecast by Fortune Business Insights to grow at a 16.3% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to reach US $31.2 billion by 20291. SolarBank's interest in ProjectCo was acquired as part of the $45 million valued acquisition of Solar Flow-Through Funds Ltd. that closed in July 2024.\n\nIn July 2023, the Project was awarded a contract by the Independent Electricity System Operator (\"IESO\") under the Expedited Long-Term RFP (E-LT1 RFP). The contract, which has a term of 22 years, includes a fixed contract capacity payment of $1,221 /MW per business day, significantly above the weighted average price of $876 /MW for all storage category projects under the E-LT1 RFP. This underscores the competitive positioning of these projects in the Ontario energy storage market. The Company expects that once operational the Project will have 4.74 MW of daily contract capacity available (at a capacity payment to ProjectCo of $1,221 /MW per business day) for 251 business days in a year.\n\nFurthermore, the Project is eligible for the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit introduced in 2024. This refundable tax credit provides up to 30% reimbursement of eligible capital costs for new clean technology, significantly enhancing the economic returns of the projects. This aligns with SolarBank's commitment to leveraging government incentives to accelerate the transition to renewable energy while optimizing financial performance.\n\nThe Company has an indirect 50% interest in ProjectCo, with the remaining 50% held by a partnership formed by First Nations communities in Ontario .\n\nThere are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to required permits, the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company, the risks associated with the construction of a battery energy storage project and the degredation of battery storage capacity over time based on the number of discharge cycles. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for battery energy storage, which could result in future projects no longer being economic. Please refer to \"Forward-Looking Statements\" for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the projects and statements made in this press release.\n\n1 https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/battery-energy-storage-market-100489\n\nAbout SolarBank Corporation\n\nSolarBank Corporation is an independent renewable and clean energy project developer and owner focusing on distributed and community solar projects in Canada and the USA .

Canada's banking industry is highly concentrated, with its big six domestic banks \u2014 Royal Bank, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Bank and National Bank \u2014 accounting for the vast majority of total bank assets.\n\nThe Big Six already have an extensive and entrenched network of loyal clients in the domestic market, which makes it harder for foreign banks to get a foothold here: \"It's not a very exciting market for a large U.S. bank,\" said Kryzanowski.\n\n\"If a foreign bank goes in and they want to set up a network, they have to get a lot of retail customers to switch.\"\n\nCanada's Big Six fall under the Schedule 1 category \u2014 meaning they must be Canadian-owned institutions that take deposits. Any American bank that wanted to buy a major Canadian bank would face these and other restrictions.\n\nEven smaller Schedule 1 banks face ownership limits, said Kryzanowski, because 35 per cent of the bank has to be publicly owned. \"Typically, if an American bank is going to move into Canada, they want to have complete control.\"\n\nThere are arguments to be made for and against the Canadian banking's strict regulatory environment, he added.\n\nCanadian banks known for stability\n\nThe regulations make it difficult for foreign competition to compete here, but they've also given Canadian banks a reputation for stability.\n\n\"The big difference between Canadian bank requirements and U.S. bank requirement is the domestic stability buffer,\" said Jie Zhang, a finance professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ont.\n\nThat buffer \u2014 a kind of fund that Canadian banks must set aside in case of financial emergencies \u2014 helped our banking institutions stave off the worst pains of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Zhang.\n\nCanadians banks are required to set aside a larger percentage of these funds than U.S. banks do, and those compliance costs could be another factor that dissuades American-owned banks from operating in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Bankers Association refuted Trump's claim on Monday, noting in a statement that there are 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches holding about $113 billion in assets currently operating in Canada.\n\n\"Canada has a strong and competitive banking sector comprised of both domestic and foreign banks,\" reads a post on the association's X account. \"These banks specialize in a range of financial services, including corporate and commercial lending, treasury services, credit card products, investment banking and mortgage financing.\n\n\"They serve not only customers with cross-border business activities, but also Canada's domestic retail market.

            "content": "Royal Bank of Canada was the latest in leaving the banking industry\u2019s largest climate-finance alliance, insisting the decision would not impact its net-zero pledge.\n\n\u2014\n\nCanada\u2019s six biggest banks have announced their withdrawal from the industry\u2019s largest climate alliance, following a recent Wall Street firms exodus.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RBC) became the latest to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, after Toronto-Dominion, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce all announced their departure last month.\n\nThe UN-sponsored initiative was set up in 2021 by former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney to encourage financial institutions to limit the environmental footprint of their operations and push toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe exodus of Canadian banks comes on the heels of a trend where several major Wall Street banks are stepping back from climate initiatives.\n\nThe six biggest banks in the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan \u2013 recently quit the alliance. While not directly citing it as an influencing factor, the banks have for some two years been the focus of a Republican-led campaign against environment, social and governance investing.\n\nAll banks insisted their decision would not impact their decarbonization pledges, with RBC Chief Executive Officer Dave McKay reassuring that pulling out of the alliance \u201cdoesn\u2019t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.\u201d\n\nHowever, analysts say the moves send a clear signal to the market that climate change has become even less of a priority for Wall Street.\n\nExodus\n\nBanks are not the only ones shying away from sustainability commitments.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment management corporation, last month withdrew from the Net-Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, a key international group of asset managers committed to reaching net-zero emissions. The New York-based firm, which manages assets worth some $11.5 trillion, said the decision to leave was prompted by pressure from public officials and Republican-led legal inquiries.\n\nFollowing Blackrock\u2019s departure, the alliance \u2013 a voluntary initiative \u2013 said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d but respected \u201cany individual decisions signatories take.\u201d It later announced it was suspending activities to \u201ctrack signatory implementation and reporting\u201d to undergo an internal review, citing \u201crecent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors\u2019 respective jurisdictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a voluntary initiative, NZAM has successfully supported investors globally as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths in the energy transition in line with their fiduciary duties and clients\u2019 long-term financial objectives. NZAM looks forward to continuing to play this constructive role with investors around the world,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe alliance launched in December 2020 to support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets. The group counted over 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion of assets, its website stated prior to Blackrock\u2019s departure.",

            "content": "AGNC Investment Corp. is an internally managed REIT based in Bethesda, Maryland. The company employs an active management strategy to provide investors with favorable risk-adjusted returns. The company focuses on a combination of agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities and earns income via interest and gains on investments and hedging activities. It is the 2nd largest internally managed residential REIT in the US by market cap.\n\nThe company\u2019s goal is to provide risk-adjusted returns on a monthly basis through dividends. The company has paid dividends every quarter since its inception and on a monthly basis since 2014. The distribution can vary depending on income and may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains and return-of-capital, which is important for tax purposes. Investors of record may participate in a direct purchase program and a dividend reinvestment program. Investors may also purchase preferred stock to receive dividends.\n\nThe Company uses leverage to invest in mortgage-backed securities. The primary target is agency residential mortgage-backed securities using a collateralized borrowing structure. The collateralized borrowing structure is in the form of repurchase agreements, which guarantees the issuer will repurchase the asset at a later date at a higher price. The higher price is, in effect, an interest on the loan.\n\nThe company agency-backed investments and securities are typically guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginny Mae. The non-agency securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities and credit risk transfer securities, among other hedging activities.\n\nRegarding cost, the company\u2019s expense ratio runs below 1.0%. This ranks it among the lowest-costing REITs regarding stockholder equity and is central to its ability to pay consistently industry-leading dividends. As of 2022, the company had more than $61 billion in cash and securities. At the time, the portfolio consisted of 92% 30-year fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities, 3% 15-year fixed-rate RMBS, 3% CMBS, 2% 20-year fixed-rate RMBS and only 1% of variable rate and non-agency residential loans.\n\nThe company operates via a network of subsidiaries that includes Bethesda Securities. Bethesda Securities is a self-clearing registered broker/dealer of fixed-income securities and facilitates most of the company\u2019s investment activities. The company is registered with the SEC, FINRA, the Depository Trust Corporation and 2 Fixed Income Clearing Corporation divisions.\n\nThe company\u2019s active management strategy allows it to alter the portfolio as interest rates change. As of 2022, the company was shifting the 30-year fixed-rate portfolio in line with FOMC policy and listed expected life CPR of investments in a range of 5% to 7% with the total portfolio expected to return 7%. In regard to funding, the company\u2019s repurchase agreements are issued with maturities of 3 months or 6 to 12 months. The average cost of the funding portfolio was 2.85% with an average of 35 days until maturity. Hedging activities include interest rate swaps, payer swaptions and US treasuries (short or long).",

The company aims to enable organizations to digitize and automate their business processes, increasing efficiency and productivity. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, ServiceNow operates globally, serving customers across various industries, including healthcare, finance, technology, and manufacturing.\n\nServiceNow's core product is its platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, allowing businesses to create custom applications and workflows tailored to their needs. The platform encompasses various modules, including IT Service Management, Human Resources, Customer Service Management, and Security Operations. By leveraging ServiceNow's platform, organizations can automate routine tasks, streamline communication and collaboration and enhance employee and customer experience.\n\nThe company's target market primarily comprises large enterprises that seek to modernize their operations and enhance digital transformation initiatives. ServiceNow has established a solid customer base, including well-known brands such as Coca-Cola, Siemens, and Visa. Its solutions cater to the needs of diverse organizations, ranging from IT departments seeking efficient incident management to HR departments streamlining employee onboarding processes.\n\nServiceNow boasts a strong, experienced management team that drives the company's success. Led by Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott, a seasoned technology executive with a proven track record in the industry, the group comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise.\n\nServiceNow has demonstrated impressive financial performance in recent years, reflecting its strong market position and growing customer demand for its products and services. The company has consistently reported robust revenue growth, driven by the increasing adoption of its platform across industries.\n\nServiceNow has maintained healthy profit margins, showcasing its ability to generate investment returns and maintain efficient cost structures. The company's strong financial position has allowed it to invest in research and development, innovation, and strategic acquisitions to drive further growth and market expansion.\n\nServiceNow's valuation metrics reflect the market's recognition of its strong growth potential and position within the industry. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-book (P/B) ratio are often higher than its industry peers, indicating the market's confidence in ServiceNow's future prospects. The higher P/E ratio suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings the company generates, reflecting expectations of strong future earnings growth. Similarly, the higher P/B ratio indicates that investors value ServiceNow's assets at a higher multiple compared to its book value, emphasizing the company's intangible assets and intellectual property.\n\nThe factors driving ServiceNow's valuation are its consistent revenue growth, expanding customer base, and market leadership position. The company has successfully established itself as a trusted provider of digital workflow solutions, capturing a significant market share and demonstrating its ability to deliver value to its customers. ServiceNow's focus on innovation and product development has allowed it to stay ahead of competitors and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.\n\nServiceNow operates in the broader enterprise software industry, which is characterized by rapid technological advancements and the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions. The industry is highly competitive, with several key players vying for market share and constantly innovating to meet evolving customer needs.\n\nServiceNow maintains a competitive advantage through its comprehensive platform and the breadth of its product offerings. The company's focus on delivering solutions that streamline digital workflows across departments positions it well in the market. ServiceNow enables efficient collaboration, automation, and process optimization by providing a unified platform that integrates various organizational functions.\n\nThe enterprise software industry is also subject to regulatory and political factors that can impact companies operating within it. Changes in data protection regulations or cybersecurity requirements may influence the demand for software solutions, including those offered by ServiceNow. Investors must monitor such developments and assess their potential impact on the company's operations and market position.\n\nServiceNow has several growth opportunities on the horizon. One significant opportunity lies in expanding its product offerings and penetrating new markets. The company can leverage its existing customer base and reputation to introduce new modules or vertical-specific solutions that address specific industry needs. For example, ServiceNow can develop tailored solutions for sectors such as healthcare or manufacturing, enabling it to tap into untapped markets and drive revenue growth.\n\nWhile ServiceNow presents promising growth prospects, it has risks and challenges. One of the key challenges the company may face is intense competition within the enterprise software industry. Competitors, both established players and emerging startups, continuously innovate and introduce new solutions that could potentially erode ServiceNow's market share. To mitigate this risk, ServiceNow must focus on innovation, invest in research and development and ensure its offerings stay ahead of the curve.\n\nAnother potential risk lies in changes to regulatory or compliance requirements. As a business operating in an increasingly regulated industry, ServiceNow must stay updated with evolving regulations and adapt its solutions to ensure customer compliance. Failure to address regulatory changes adequately could result in reputational damage and loss of customers.\n\nMoreover, macroeconomic factors can impact ServiceNow's business. Economic downturns or recessions may lead to reduced spending by enterprises, affecting the demand for software solutions. ServiceNow must remain agile and adaptable to market conditions, continuously demonstrate the value of its offerings and provide cost-effective solutions that align with customers' budgetary constraints.",

Canada\u2019s top 15 industries by trade with the United States, most of which are manufacturing based, represent nearly 3.1% of the country\u2019s total workforce. A key area of concern is Canada\u2019s motor vehicles sector, which is exceptionally integrated with the United States and Mexico. Parts can cross the border multiple times, meaning an end-product like a car may incur several rounds of tariffs.\n\nNotably, Canadian raw commodity exports are less likely to see a drop in U.S. demand as Americans lack substitutes for these goods. This likely encouraged a lower 10% tariff on energy products for Americans, as this particular imported good is one of the most likely to create a larger and more immediate inflationary burden for American producers and consumers.\n\nAs outlined in our tariff playbook, we are mindful that secondary industries in the services sector, for example, are also likely to feel knock-on effects. Consider an auto plant that experiences reduced demand and is forced to lay off workers. These workers, in turn, are less likely to then go to restaurants, movie theatres or engage in other \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending. This ripple effect leaves a variety of non-tariffed industries exposed to the broader economic shock, and are also somewhat challenging to model as they can be exacerbated by confidence and sentiment channels.",

Companies that acquired during the last economic downturn achieved an average annual total shareholder return (TSR) of 5.9% compared with 4.7% for those that did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose companies that were active acquirers before the recession performed best by staying active\u2014their average annual TSR was 6.1% compared with 3.8% for those that decided to move to the sidelines. For those companies that were inactive before the recession, a change in their M&A behavior toward becoming an active acquirer resulted in an annual TSR of 5.5% compared with 5.0% for those that remained inactive.\u201d\n\nThe message is clear:\n\nSeek M&A . Businesses that have a history of acquisitions, coupled with enough dry powder should seek M&A opportunities. This is a particularly good time for private equity, which has a history of outperforming the public markets, in part due to the \u201cactive role that private equity investors play as owners and operators of businesses\u201d. 4\n\n.

Win by helping America win. Trump believes that Canada has not held its side of the bargain,\u201d Tobi Lutke, who co-founded Shopify, wrote on X.\n\n3 Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke ripped Canada\u2019s retaliation effort.

For context, in 2023, Canadian crude oil exports accounted for about 24% of US refinery production, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nTrudeau, 53, who is poised to remain PM until his Liberal Party elects a new leader in March, had jetted down to Mar-a-Lago in November to meet with Trump after the then-president-elect first issued the threat.\n\nAt the time, the outgoing Canadian leader attempted to make nice with Trump and dissuade him from following through on the tariff threat, which could wreak havoc on Canada\u2019s economy.\n\n3 President Trump has called the term \u201ctariff\u201d one of the most beautiful words in the English language.

The original location for the company was Cambridge, Massachusetts. Vannevar Bush, Laurence K. Marshall and Charles G. Smith originally started Raytheon as the American Appliance Company.\n\nRaytheon Manufacturing Company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company in 1925. After the name change, Raytheon Manufacturing Company began marketing its rectifier. During World War II, Raytheon designed and built magnetron tubes for microwave radar sets. It later went on to construct complete radar systems.\n\nRaytheon's Percy Spencer invented the microwave oven in 1945. While eating lunch, he discovered that the magnetron could rapidly heat food. Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics in 1959 and after the acquisition, the company changed its name to Raytheon Company.\n\nIn 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon's Patriot missile received great international exposure, increasing sales for the company outside the United States. In 1995, it acquired Dallas-based E-Systems. In 1997, it acquired the defense unit of Texas Instruments, Defense Systems and Electronics Group and the defense portion of Delco Electronics (Delco Systems Operations). In 2005, it acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division.\n\nRaytheon Technologies formed in April 2020 due to a merger between Raytheon Company and the aerospace subsidiaries United Technologies Corporation (UTC). Before the merger, UTC spun off its non-aerospace subsidiaries, including Otis Elevator Company and Carrier Corporation and changed its name to Raytheon Technologies, relocating its headquarters to Waltham, Massachusetts. The company's operations have four main segments: Collins aerospace systems, Pratt and Whitney, Raytheon intelligence and space and Raytheon missiles and defense.\n\nCollins Aerospace Systems is a global provider of aerospace and defense products and aftermarket services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, general aviation and defense and commercial space operations.\n\nThe aerospace segment offers a wide range of products and services, including:\n\nCabin interiors\n\nFood and beverage preparation\n\nOxygen systems\n\nStorage and galley systems\n\nCommunications and aviation systems\n\nLavatory and wastewater management systems\n\nAirborne intelligence\n\nSurveillance and reconnaissance systems\n\nCrew escape systems\n\nTest and training range systems\n\nSimulation and training solutions\n\nInformation management services\n\nAftermarket services that include spare parts, engineering and technical support, overhaul and repair, information management services and training and fleet management solutions\n\nThe Pratt and Whitney segment supplies aircraft engines for general aviation customers, military aviation, commercial jets and business jets.

We\u2019ll also provide valuable tips to improve your loan eligibility and manage repayments effectively.\n\nRBC Personal Loan 2024\n\nFeature Details Loan Amount Up to $50,000 Interest Rate Options Fixed and variable rates available Loan Term Flexible terms, typically ranging from 1 to 5 years Eligibility Canadian citizen or permanent resident, age of majority, good credit score, stable income Documentation Required Basic identification, proof of income, bank statements, asset/liability details Application Process In-branch and by phone with RBC credit specialists (online application currently unavailable) Official Website Visit RBC Personal Loans\n\nRBC\u2019s personal loans offer a robust solution for Canadians dealing with emergency expenses.

            "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. is a leading global food and beverage company operating in more than 200 countries. The company was founded in 1898 and was incorporated in 1965 through the merger of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay and has since grown to become a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands. PepsiCo's headquarters are in Harrison, New York, with additional offices and manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nPepsiCo's products include a range of popular beverages such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade, as well as snacks and food items under brands such as Fritos, Doritos, Tostitos and Quaker Oats. The company also owns a number of other brands, including Tropicana, Naked Juice and Sabra. Some key highlights of PepsiCo's recent history were the acquisition of SodaStream, a maker of home carbonation products, in 2018 and Rockstar Energy in 2020.\n\nPepsiCo's current CEO is Ramon Laguarta, who took over from long-time CEO Indra Nooyi in 2018. Laguarta has been with the company for over two decades, having served in several executive positions before becoming CEO. Other notable members of PepsiCo's leadership team members include Hugh Johnston, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Kirk Tanner, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America.\n\nOver the past few years, PepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth the company's net income has also increased. PepsiCo's profit margins have remained steady over the past few years, with a gross profit margin averaging around 7%. The company has a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio indicating a relatively low level of debt compared to its equity. PepsiCo's current price-to-earnings ratio is slightly above the industry average. The company's price-to-book ratio is also above the industry average. These valuation metrics suggest that PepsiCo is currently trading at a slight premium to its peers. PepsiCo's stock has generally performed well over the past few years, with a steady increase in share price.\n\nPepsiCo operates in the highly competitive food and beverage industry, characterized by constant innovation, changing consumer preferences and intense competition. The industry is also subject to significant regulatory and political pressures, particularly around issues such as health and wellness.\n\nPepsiCo's main competitors include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle and Kraft Heinz. These competitors constantly introduce new products and invest in marketing and advertising campaigns to gain market share.\n\nOne of the key trends in the food and beverage industry is a shift towards healthier, more sustainable products. PepsiCo has responded to this trend by investing in its healthier brands, such as Naked Juice and Sabra and committing to sustainability initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to these broader industry trends, PepsiCo has faced specific challenges recently. For example, the company has had to contend with declining soda consumption in the United States as consumers increasingly turn to healthier beverage options.\n\n\n\nPepsiCo has diversified its product portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade and Tropicana to address this trend.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the increasing regulation of sugary and high-calorie food and beverages. In response, PepsiCo has made efforts to reduce its products' sugar and calorie content and has also introduced new low-sugar and low-calorie options.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo has many growth opportunities in its pipeline. One key area of focus is the at-home beverage market following the acquisition of SodaStream in 2018. PepsiCo has also launched a line of at-home cocktail mixers under its Tostitos brand, further expanding its presence in the at-home beverage category.\n\nPepsiCo has also invested in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in emerging economies such as China and India. In 2020, the company announced plans to invest $5 billion in India over the next few years to expand its manufacturing facilities and distribution network.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, PepsiCo has continued to invest in innovation and new product development. For example, the company recently launched a line of plant-based snacks under its Quaker Oats brand, catering to the growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nDespite these growth opportunities, PepsiCo also faces several risks and challenges. One risk facing the company is the increasing focus on health and wellness, particularly in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Consumers increasingly seek healthier, more natural food and beverage options, which could impact demand for PepsiCo's traditional soda and snack products.\n\nPepsiCo is also subject to various regulatory and political pressures, particularly around sugar and calorie content, plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These pressures could increase costs and regulatory compliance requirements, impacting the company's profitability and growth prospects.",

Choose the right one for your spending habits and financial goals.\n\nNerdWallet's picks for the best cash-back credit cards in Canada include top contenders across numerous categories. Choose the right one for your spending habits and financial goals.\n\nWhen it comes to the complex world of credit card rewards, there are few words as simple \u2014 or as sweet \u2014 as \u201ccash back.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for a cash-back credit card in Canada, you have plenty of choices.\n\nMethodology BACK TO TOP NerdWallet Canada selects the best credit cards based on overall consumer value as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nHow cash-back credit cards work in Canada\n\nBefore deciding which cash-back credit card is right for you, it\u2019s helpful to understand how the cash-back redemption process works, the many categories cash-back rewards can fall into, and how cash-back cards compare to other types of credit cards.\n\nWhat is a cash-back credit card?\n\nCash-back credit cards are pretty straightforward: you use them as you would any other credit card, and in exchange for making eligible purchases, you get a certain percentage of what you\u2019ve spent back in cash.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of a cash-back credit card?\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimplicity \u2014 cash-back cards make it easy to earn valuable rewards.\n\nWelcome bonuses and introductory offers can be quite generous.\n\nAccumulated rewards can help pay down your card balance.\n\nHigh earn rates for items you buy regularly can yield big rewards.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nYou may not typically buy items that yield above-average earn rates.\n\nAmassing rewards can be slow depending on how much you spend each month, and whether you pay your bill in full.\n\nBonus and introductory offers tend to come with conditions, including spending minimums, which may be challenging to meet.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nTypes of cash-back credit cards\n\nAll cash-back credit cards work similarly, but even minor differences are worth noting as they can affect your earn rate.\n\nFlat-rate\n\nThis type of cash-back credit card earns cash-back at the same rate for all purchases made.\n\nBonus rewards categories\n\nSome cash-back credit cards offer an increased earn rate for rewards on select spending categories, such as groceries and restaurants.\n\nFlexible bonus cash-back cards\n\nSome cards allow you to choose the spending categories to earn your bonus rewards. By selecting categories that align with the types of items you buy frequently, you can maximize your cash-back rewards.\n\nHow to earn cash-back\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make purchases to earn cash-back rewards with a credit card. For example, let\u2019s say you have a card that offers 2% cash back on groceries. If tomorrow\u2019s weekly run to the supermarket winds up costing you $100 and you pay with your card, you\u2019ll earn $2 in cash-back rewards.\n\nCash-back rewards will accumulate as you continue using your cash-back credit card. The running total of how much cash you\u2019ve earned should be easy to find on your monthly statement or via your online account.\n\nMake sure to stay within your credit limit, keep your account in good standing, and look closely at your cash-back credit card\u2019s details to find out how much you can earn on your purchases. Earn rates can vary based on time, such as when an introductory offer provides a higher rate of rewards and what kinds of products you purchase.\n\nHow to redeem cash-back\n\nOnce you have accumulated enough cash-back rewards, you can redeem them for statement credits, bank deposits, gift cards, or other rewards. Make sure to understand the redemption options and requirements of your card. Some may require you to meet a minimum threshold of cash-back rewards before redemption. If you don\u2019t have enough points available, you\u2019ll have to sit on them until you do.\n\nRedemption requirements by issuers\n\nEvery credit card provider has different rules when it comes to redeeming your cash back. Some allow monthly redemption, while others pay out annually. Other providers allow redemption only after you\u2019ve hit a certain threshold. The following are the payout requirements for the major cash-back credit card issuers:\n\nAmerican Express. All cash back earned is paid out annually on your September statement.\n\nBMO. Redeem as little as $1 in cash back as a statement credit. You can also set up automatic direct deposits to your BMO chequing or savings account starting at $25.\n\nCIBC. Cash-back redemptions start at $25. Any unredeemed cash back will appear on your January statement annually.\n\nRBC . Once you earn $25 in cash back, you can have the balance credited to your account at any time by calling in. Alternatively, all accumulated cash back will be credited to your account every January.\n\nScotiabank. All cash back earned appears as a credit on your November statement.\n\nTangerine. Paid monthly to your savings account or applied to your credit card balance.\n\nTD. You can redeem your cash back when you have a minimum amount of $25. Another option is to take your cash back annually every January where there is no minimum amount required.\n\n\u00bb MORE: Read our in-depth TD Cash Back Visa Infinite* Card review\n\nWhen is a good time to redeem my cash-back rewards?\n\nMany cash-back credit cards will allow you to redeem your rewards as soon as they reach a minimum threshold. But you can also save them up over time and cash them in for a more significant, single-shot pay-down of your credit card balance, for example.\n\nChoosing to redeem cash rewards on a regular basis is certainly satisfying. But it could mean dipping below your minimum threshold. The next time you want \u2014 or need \u2014 to use your rewards, you may not have enough at your disposal. Saving your cash back rewards to generate more impact \u2014 to ease the blow of a particularly big purchase \u2014 is a worthy strategy, too. But know that if you fail to keep your account in good standing or decide to close it suddenly, you could lose out on accumulated rewards.\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories\n\nCash-back bonus rewards categories refer to the specific spending categories or types of purchases that earn higher cash-back rewards on a credit card.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say your credit card gives you 4% cash back on gas. If the card has a flat rate of 1%, this means you\u2019ll earn cash back on gas with a bonus rate of 3%, making it so all your gas purchases would give you 4% cash back. Since many gas stations sell other things, such as snacks and gift cards, you\u2019d also earn 4% cash back on any of those items.\n\nGenerally speaking, Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards offer multiple bonus categories. Getting a cash-back card that aligns with your spending patterns can be pretty lucrative. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, getting a cash-back credit card with an increased earn rate on groceries can significantly benefit you.\n\nYou\u2019ll earn cash back at an increased rate when making purchases in specific spending categories, but you\u2019ll still earn the base earn rate when you make purchases that don\u2019t fall under a bonus category or after you have reached the bonus category cash-back limit. The base earn rate differs for each cash-back credit card but typically ranges between 0.5% and 2%.\n\nCommon rewards categories\n\nCash-back categories can vary depending on the credit card and issuer, but here are some common categories in Canada:\n\nGrocery. Any purchase made at grocery stores, such as Loblaws, No Frills and Metro.\n\nGas. Includes any purchase made at a gas station or service station, like Shell, PetroCanada and Esso.\n\nRestaurants and dining. This usually includes takeout and food delivery services like Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes.\n\nTravel spending. Airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, etc.\n\nTransit and transportation. This may include taking an Uber, a taxi, or paying for public transportation.\n\nStreaming services. Monthly subscriptions to products like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.\n\nDrug stores and pharmacies. This may include purchases made at a drug store, like Shoppers Drug Mart.\n\nEntertainment. This may include money you spend on tickets to the movies, theater, or a live music concert.\n\nBills and recurring payments. Including wireless phone, internet, and utility bills paid with a credit card.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that each credit card defines its categories differently and employs its own merchant category codes. For example, some cards may group gas and transportation. Some cards lump groceries and restaurants into a \u201cfood and drink\u201d category. To further complicate things, some merchants don\u2019t fall into the categories you would think they would. For example, Costco is not considered a grocery store. As far as credit card processors are concerned, Costco is a wholesale store.\n\nCredit card companies do not typically reveal all of the stores associated with a merchant category publicly. Still, you should be able to contact your credit card provider\u2019s customer service to ask about a specific store. Overall, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out what category your purchases will fall under, but you may need some trial and error.\n\nHow to choose a cash-back card\n\nBefore applying for a cash-back credit card, select the right one for you and ensure you\u2019re eligible.\n\nCompare cash-back credit card options\n\nWith dozens of cash-back credit cards available, comparing them all can be time-consuming. That said, there are a few things you should look at when considering any cash-back card.\n\nInterest rates . It\u2019s important to look closely at the interest rates associated with any cash-back credit cards you\u2019re considering; many start out in the 19.99% range. Zero interest is charged on balances paid in full every month, but if you don\u2019t, it can significantly add to your debt and erode the benefit of any cash-back rewards you earn.\n\nAnnual fee . Decide if you want to pay an annual fee or not. In most cases, paying a yearly fee means earning more cash back and getting better benefits. On the other hand, no-fee cash-back cards may have a lower earn rate, but if you don\u2019t charge much to your card, you could come out ahead compared to a card with a fee.\n\nWelcome bonus or intro offer . Cash-back credit cards in Canada commonly offer a sign-up bonus for new applicants. The welcome bonus usually comes as a higher cash-back rate for a set period. For example, you might get 10% cash back on all purchases up to $3,000 in spending. If the earn rates are similar with two cards, but one has an excellent welcome bonus, then you might as well take advantage of the promotion. Credit card bonus offers nearly always come with terms and conditions to be met, but be sure you read over the offer thoroughly and understand how much you may need to spend to qualify.\n\nBonus rewards categories . The increased earn rate on bonus categories is arguably the most critical factor when comparing cash-back cards. It\u2019s ideal to choose a card that gives you the most cash-back in the categories where you do the most spending. Remember that the amount you spend in bonus categories every year could earn you more than any welcome bonus offered.\n\nCredit card insurance and additional perks. Many cash-back credit cards offer various forms of insurance and additional benefits that may appeal to you. Some perks to look out for include: Travel insurance. Roadside assistance. Mobile device insurance. Credit card concierge services. Extended warranties. Purchase protection.\n\n\n\nMake sure you qualify\n\nEven though the benefits of a cash-back credit card are relatively simple to understand, you\u2019ll still have to reckon with a few eligibility requirements to consider before applying.\n\nAge and residency status . Most cash-back credit cards require you to be both a Canadian resident and the legal age of majority in the province where you live to apply for your own card. The age of majority is 18 in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan. It\u2019s 19 everywhere in all other provinces.\n\nCredit score . A good credit score is required in most cases to qualify for a cash-back credit card. In Canada, a credit score that ranges between 660 and 724 is considered good. If you do not have a good credit score, consider a credit card designed for bad or no credit, a prepaid card, or a secured credit card instead of a cash-back credit card.\n\nPersonal or household income requirements. Some cash-back credit cards come with relatively lower income requirements, but if you want a higher-tier cash-back credit card, you\u2019ll likely need a higher income.\n\nHow to maximize your cash-back rewards\n\nThere are plenty of tricks to help you get the most out of your cash-back credit cards. The more tips you adopt, the more cash back you\u2019ll earn. That said, it\u2019s best only to follow the advice that you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nApply for a new card ahead of major expenses . Since many of Canada\u2019s best cash-back credit cards have a generous welcome bonus, it\u2019s often worth your trouble to apply for a new card before you make a major purchase. For example, let\u2019s say you need to renew your home and auto insurance, which will cost you about $2,000. You could apply for a cash-back credit card offering 10% cash back as the welcome bonus. Then, when you charge your insurance to your card, you\u2019d get $200 back.\n\nKeep your eye out for attractive intro offers and sign-up bonuses . Welcome offers are constantly changing, so watch for any current promotions. Getting 10% cash back for a set period is generous, but if the card also waives the annual fee for the first year, they\u2019re practically paying you to sign up. When you get close to 12 months of card membership, you might cancel the card before your annual fee posts. You could then apply for a new cash-back credit card with a strong bonus.\n\nPay attention to intro offer limits. Keep in mind that many cash-back credit cards have a limit on their sign-up offer. If you have a substantial purchase, you could apply for more than one card and split up your purchase to maximize your cash back. However, if you need to pay an annual fee for the new card, it may negate the cash back you earn, so pay attention to the details.\n\nCarry multiple cards . Many people focus on a single cash-back credit card, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having multiple credit cards. In fact, having more than one card is the easiest way to maximize your cash back. Start with a primary card that gives you an increased earn rate where you spend most of your spending. You could then complement that card with a no-fee card that gives you bonus categories where your primary card doesn\u2019t. Just use the credit card that gives you the most cash back whenever you shop.\n\nBuy gift cards in bonus categories . Groceries and gas are two of the most popular merchant categories where you\u2019ll earn additional cash back. Here\u2019s the thing: grocery stores and gas stations sell gift cards that can be used at many retailers. That essentially allows you to earn extra cash back.\n\nAdd supplementary users . Most credit cards allow you to add supplementary users. The advantage is that all authorized cardholders earn cash back on their purchases, including any bonus. Best of all, the cash back gets combined into a single pool, so you\u2019ll be racking up that cash back in no time.\n\nUse cash-back websites. Various online sites allow you to earn additional cash whenever you shop online. First, you need to create an account. Afterwards, you would select the partner retailers through their online portal. When you do your shopping, eligible purchases will earn you cash back. You\u2019ll earn cash back twice if you pay with your cash-back credit card.\n\nShould I choose cash-back or rewards points?\n\nAnswering this question depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of your credit card.\n\nCash-back rewards may be the route to take if you\u2019re hoping for a little help paying your credit card bills, or want to earn rewards that are typically easy to calculate, collect and apply toward your balance.\n\nRewards points, however, can generally be redeemed in a wider variety of ways, including discounts on travel or merchandise. That flexibility can be very attractive to some consumers. However, the value of the points you collect can fluctuate, making tracking your points a more complicated endeavour than cash-back rewards.\n\nAre cash-back credit cards worth it?\n\nThere are two situations where a cash-back card might not be the right choice:\n\nIf you\u2019ll pay more in annual fees than you\u2019d earn in cash-back. If you can get a better return with a points-based rewards card. For example, let\u2019s say you got a travel rewards credit card and did the same spending. Would the points you earn be worth more than the cash back you could potentially earn? If so, it makes more sense to get a travel credit card.",

Based in Miami, Florida, the company operates in North America, Europe, and Asia and has been in business for over 85 years. Ryder offers many services, including fleet management, dedicated transportation, supply chain optimization, and last-mile delivery solutions. With a fleet of over 230,000 vehicles, Ryder serves customers across various industries, including healthcare, food and beverage, retail, and e-commerce.\n\nRobert Sanchez has been Ryder's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2013. Before he was appointed CEO, Sanchez served in various executive roles at the company, including President of Global Fleet Management Solutions and Chief Financial Officer. The rest of the company's senior leadership team includes Karen Jones, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer and John Diez, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIn recent years Ryder has reported total revenue increases. Net income is also moving in a positive direction. The company's debt levels have remained relatively stable over the past few years, with total debt of around $11 billion. Ryder's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio are both below the industry average. Over the past few years, Ryder's stock price has increased, outperforming the broader market. The company's stock has also experienced decreased trading volume, with an average daily volume of 309,000 shares.\n\nThe transportation and logistics industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the rise of e-commerce and the increasing importance of supply chain management. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this trend, as companies have had to adapt rapidly to changing consumer behavior and supply chain disruptions. However, the industry also faces rising fuel costs, driver shortages, and increasing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRyder competes with many large companies in the transportation and logistics space, including XPO Logistics, Inc., J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and United Parcel Service, Inc. The company differentiates itself by offering a wide range of services, from fleet management to last-mile delivery, and investing in technology and innovation to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nRyder sees significant growth opportunities in several areas, including e-commerce fulfillment, autonomous trucking, and electric vehicles. The company recently announced a partnership with Embark Trucks to develop and deploy autonomous trucks for long-haul routes, which could significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Ryder is also investing in electric vehicles, with plans to add 1,000 electric trucks to its fleet by 2023.\n\nIn addition, Ryder is focused on expanding its presence in the e-commerce fulfillment space, where demand has surged in recent years. The company offers a range of solutions to help retailers and e-commerce companies manage their supply chains, including warehouse management, transportation management, and last-mile delivery.\n\nLike all companies in the transportation and logistics industry, Ryder faces many risks and challenges. These include rising fuel costs, regulatory scrutiny, and supply chain disruptions. In addition, the company faces increasing competition from new entrants, such as Amazon and Uber Freight, which could put pressure on pricing and margins.\n\nAnother challenge Ryder faces is the ongoing driver shortage, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to higher driver wages and increased competition among companies for a limited pool of qualified drivers. Ryder is working to address this challenge by offering competitive salaries and benefits, investing in driver training programs, and exploring the use of autonomous and electric vehicles.\n\nRyder is subject to various regulatory and legal risks, including potential changes to environmental regulations and labor laws. The company has committed to reducing its carbon emissions and improving sustainability across its operations, which could help mitigate some of these risks.",

            "content": "\u201cRBC certainly stands out now that its share price has gone in the opposite direction of TD\u2019s,\u201d said Jeremy Rudin, former head of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions , the country\u2019s top banking regulator.\n\nWhile Royal Bank was going about winning deal mandates such as Smuckers-Hostess, its biggest domestic rival, Toronto-Dominion Bank , was becoming engulfed in a massive money-laundering scandal south of the border. TD ultimately paid hefty fines to U.S. authorities in a settlement that also capped its limits on asset growth there, all of which helped cement RBC\u2019s position as the unchallenged biggest of the Big Five Canadian banks.\n\nPersonal banking may be the powerhouse, but capital markets is a strong second plank for RBC, responsible for 26 per cent of its net income in fiscal 2024, with more than half the unit\u2019s revenue now coming from the U.S.\n\nRBC was the buyer, beefing up its position in personal and commercial banking, the largest and most lucrative segment of Canadian financial services, by adding nearly 800,000 customers and 100 branches.\n\nThe strategic pivot to investment banking in the U.S., which coincided with pulling out of an unsuccessful and capital-intensive foray into the ultra-competitive and regulation-heavy retail banking market there, put RBC in a prime position when another global financial services player, HSBC Holdings PLC , was preparing to part with its Canadian franchise for $13.5 billion.\n\nThe strategy paid off, with RBC\u2019s team in position to pitch the acquisition of Hostess to New York Stock Exchange-listed Smuckers, positioning its team of bankers as the lead financial adviser on the deal that combined household-name brands such as Twinkies, DingDongs, Folgers coffee and Jif peanut butter. The team was also able to arrange a committed bridge facility to fund the acquisition and advised on the subsequent permanent capital structure.\n\nThe transaction involving the Ohio- and Kansas-based food companies looked like just one of the many mid-sized deals that happen every year in the United States. But for Royal Bank of Canada , it was the culmination of a strategic shift in the aftermath of the great financial crisis, when it determined that the smart move was to focus on snapping up dealmaking superstars suddenly cut loose from their American and European firms so that it could compete with the biggest global players in investment banking.\n\nJ.M. Smucker Co. chief executive Mark Smucker leaned on close advisers when he made the decision to bolster the jelly and coffee company through a US$5.6-billion acquisition in 2023 of Hostess Brands Inc., an equally well-known name in food, and they came from a seemingly unusual place: a Canadian bank.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven more striking, perhaps, is how shareholders appear to be bestowing a premium on RBC rather than simply rewarding the collection of assets such as loans, securities and reserves amassed by what is not only the No. 1 bank in Canada, but the No. 1 company in the country with a lead of about $32 billion in market cap over its nearest rival, Shopify Inc.\n\n\u201cMeasured by assets, the Top Five are more closely clustered than by market cap,\u201d Rudin said, nodding to the amount by which RBC has overtaken TD on the latter. \u201cI would guess that\u2019s always been the case, but it\u2019s \u2026 particularly marked now.\u201d\n\nRBC is approaching $2.2 trillion of assets, with TD not too far behind at $2.06 trillion. But RBC\u2019s market cap has soared to $244 billion, putting the valuation gap between the No. 1 and No. 2 banks at more than $100 billion. Though TD and RBC have at times jostled for the top spot over the years, it\u2019s usually been a much tighter race. In late 2011, TD briefly pulled ahead of RBC, but both companies\u2019 market caps were hovering around $65 billion.\n\nRBC has also become \u201ca clear standout\u201d among its Canadian rivals when it comes to the ratio of advisory revenues to lending income, a metric analysts use to determine how effective each bank is at generating higher-margin investment banking revenue in relation to lower-margin corporate lending, according to National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine.\n\nNevertheless, Rudin, like other longtime bank watchers, isn\u2019t ready to declare the end of the Big Five or to replace the catch-all moniker with something like a \u201cBig One and a few others,\u201d but the divergence in market capitalization is hard to ignore and it dates back to the latter half of the first decade of the 2000s when they began to pursue very different strategies in the U.S.\n\n\u2018Apples and orangutans\u2019\n\nTD\u2019s recent troubles in the U.S., though at first blush driven more by regulatory scrutiny than competitive forces, could remind some of RBC\u2019s former troubles down south, when it was badly stung by the tough competition in U.S. retail banking following a buying spree in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAfter selling that loss-making franchise in the southern U.S. in 2011, RBC has spent the past decade and a half focusing on investment banking and high-net-worth clients through California-based City National Bank.\n\nDavid McKay, RBC\u2019s chief executive, has been open about steering clear of the U.S. retail banking sector, telling attendees at an industry conference in September that he feels no pressure to \u201cbet the organization\u201d on U.S. banks even at times when they appear cheap or ripe for consolidation.\n\nBrian Madden, chief investment officer at First Avenue Investment Counsel, whose holdings include both RBC and TD shares, isn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cIf you try to compare U.S. branch banking or traditional P&C (personal and commercial) banking business to a Canadian franchise, it\u2019s like comparing apples and orangutans,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just night and day. In the U.S., you\u2019ve got a fragmented, hypercompetitive landscape of 4,000 players. Granted, only a handful or a few handfuls of them really matter, but there are thousands of competitors. It\u2019s fierce; it\u2019s cutthroat. There\u2019s net-interest-margin pressure competing for deposits and loans.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a different risk appetite in the U.S., Madden said, and a much more adversarial relationship between U.S. banks and their regulators.\n\n\u201cAmerican lending culture is just sort of more risk-seeking, less risk-averse. There are structural differences in important categories of lending in the U.S., like mortgages,\u201d he said. \u201cPutting it all together, the competition and the loss/credit experience and then, not to be ignored, the more adversarial relationship with the regulators where it is not an impossibility that someone\u2019s going to smack you down with a US$3 billion fine \u2026 it all rolls up to a lower ROE (return on equity).\u201d\n\nIn October, TD, which ramped up its U.S. retail banking as RBC was pulling out, paid a record-breaking US$3 billion in fines and other penalties to settle with U.S. authorities after pleading guilty to failing to put adequate controls in place to stop criminals, including drug traffickers, from collectively laundering hundreds of millions of dollars through TD Bank accounts in three separate schemes.\n\nBut looking at TD\u2019s strategy over the past decade and a half suggests only some of RBC\u2019s growing market cap lead is attributable to the recent fines and growth constraints faced by its rival.\n\nTD\u2019s aggressive growth in retail banking in the U.S., fuelled by acquisitions, was underway for years before a planned $13.4-billion takeover of Memphis, Tenn.-based First Horizon Corp. fell apart in 2023 over stalled regulatory clearance, a corporate tremor that further shook the bank that August when it first disclosed the brewing money-laundering investigation.\n\nThe growth strategy in the U.S., with retail deposit-taking as the anchor, appeared to be working until it wasn\u2019t, said Robert Colangelo, a vice-president and senior credit officer in the financial institutions group at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\n\u201cTD has been pursuing a business model that would leverage its retail banking, capital markets as well as wealth-management capabilities, perhaps similar to what RBC is pursuing in the U.S., but any progress on this plan will now be challenged by its U.S. asset cap,\u201d he said.\n\nMadden said that TD\u2019s recent troubles have obviously had an impact, with its shares trading at a double-digit discount to the average of their peers on measures of price-to-book value and expected earnings, a reversal from the three per cent premium they carried before.\n\nRBC shares, on the other hand, trade at a 31 per cent premium on price-to-book value and a 13 per cent premium on expected earnings.\n\nLooking back to the years leading up to TD\u2019s planned acquisition of First Horizon in 2022, Madden expected to find that the bank had carried a premium larger than in the low single digits, but it turned out that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nA \u201creasonable theory,\u201d he said, is that investors were always a bit cautious about TD\u2019s U.S. strategy, given the return-on-equity profile of retail banking there.\n\nRetail competition\n\nAlso known as personal and commercial banking, retail is one of the most competitive segments in financial services in the U.S., with hundreds of banks offering a variety of products and services, and different \u201cvalue propositions,\u201d said James Darroch, associate professor emeritus at York University\u2019s Schulich School of Business.\n\nIn Canada, by contrast, there are just the five big banks \u2014 some would say six including National Bank of Canada \u2014 and they don\u2019t offer the same level of differentiation in products or services and, therefore, the same costly win-or-lose competition level, he said.\n\nDechaine spelled out the impact on TD by comparing its U.S. returns with those of its Canadian retail franchise, the real money maker.\n\nThe Canadian personal and commercial banking segment contributed nearly 50 per cent of the bank\u2019s profits in 2024, and generated returns on equity three times greater than in the U.S., the analyst said in an Oct. 31 report. The U.S. retail banking franchise, with more branches than the bank has in Canada, contributed only 37 per cent of the bank\u2019s earnings from retail and wholesale banking.\n\nInitially, though, TD\u2019s strategy of spending more than US$15 billion to buy banking franchises, including Banknorth Group Inc., based in Maine, and New Jersey-based Commerce Bancorp Inc., in 2008 paid off, pushing TD\u2019s assets past market leader RBC\u2019s in 2013.\n\nOperations were expanded across the eastern seaboard through a network of more than 1,000 branches spanning 15 states and Washington, D.C., with more than 10 million customers from Maine to Florida. TD rolled out about US$193 billion in loans, while deposits tallied up to around US$316 billion, giving it a top-three market share position at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe bank\u2019s U.S. personal and commercial banking franchise, branded as TD, America\u2019s Most Convenient Bank, garnered top-10 rankings in categories such as commercial real estate and real-estate-secured loans.\n\nHowever, U.S. regional personal and commercial banking profits are slim compared to those in Canada, where customers tend to stick with their bank for many of their financial needs, from car loans and mortgages to credit cards and wealth management, rather than splitting their business among several, said Darroch, who focused on financial services, strategic management and risk in his academic career.\n\nAs TD expanded in a fiercely competitive market, growing profitably meant keeping a tight rein on expenses.\n\n\u201cSome of the lack of controls was because they were pursuing growth,\u201d Darroch said. \u201cThe problem you have competing with those regional banks is that most of the U.S. retail banking is a single-digit ROE business.\u201d\n\nAn unlikely place to find acknowledgment of the tough business conditions TD was operating under in the U.S. is in the court filings and public statements by authorities meting out the money-laundering penalties, some of which blamed the bank\u2019s ills on being too focused on profit margins.\n\n\u201cTD Bank chose profits over compliance in order to keep its costs down,\u201d Merrick Garland, U.S. attorney general at the time, said at an Oct. 10 news conference. \u201cThat decision is now costing the bank billions of dollars in criminal and civil penalties.\u201d\n\nDeputy attorney general Lisa Monaco chimed in, saying the Canadian bank had \u201cstarved its compliance program\u201d of the resources it needed to obey the law, and warning every bank compliance official, CEO and board member to look at TD\u2019s case as a \u201cstudy of what not to do.\u201d\n\nEven before the money-laundering crisis, Madden said there were sharp contrasts between TD\u2019s and RBC\u2019s growth strategies.\n\nFor example, in capital markets, TD again leaned on acquisitions to reach scale, notably with an all-cash purchase of New York-based Cowen Inc. for US$1.3 billion in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe most obvious risk (with acquiring scale) is that you pay a premium,\u201d Madden said, adding that buying talent via a large acquisition also brings the risk of culture clash and the prospect that employees of the acquired company don\u2019t stick around.\n\nThe capital play\n\nRBC, meanwhile, has spent years building its capital markets presence in the U.S. \u201corganically, by creating a great platform, a winning platform, and picking people off, talented rainmakers, one by one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were really aggressive in doing it counter-cyclically (in the wake of) the financial crisis, when there (were) a lot of dislocated bankers and traders.\u201d\n\nRBC\u2019s annual fees earned in the U.S. had more than tripled by 2014, boosting its share of the fee pool to three per cent from one per cent, a feat that caught the attention of the international press and resulted in a glowing story in the Financial Times.\n\nDarroch said the mergers and acquisitions business RBC is chasing in the U.S. can be volatile and subject to economic and geopolitical shocks, yet it remains desirable because advisory services involve less risk for banks than holding equity or debt on their balance sheets. In addition, the most senior investment bankers collect hefty fees for their expertise and advice on deals.\n\nMoreover, he said, such deals usually involve a much closer and longer-lasting relationship with the client, so it creates opportunities to provide additional services.\n\nRBC, of course, hasn\u2019t had an entirely trouble-free path in the U.S. since selling its struggling retail bank in the U.S. southeast to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in 2011 for around US$3.6 billion, a discount to its tangible book value.\n\nFor example, a Delaware judge in 2014 ordered the bank to pay US$75.8 million in damages to former shareholders of ambulance operator Rural/Metro Corp. after ruling RBC Capital Markets LLC had failed to disclose conflicts of interest during the buyout of the company.\n\nIt was the biggest award for damages against an investment bank for its role as a mergers and acquisitions adviser at the time. More recently, both RBC and TD were among 26 financial institutions fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a case involving the failure to preserve electronic communications as required.\n\nRBC has also faced challenges with Los Angeles-based City National, a private bank with high-net-worth and celebrity clients purchased for US$5.4 billion in 2015. Now operating as part of RBC\u2019s wealth-management division, City National tripled its assets to around US$100 billion, but struggled with losses and high funding costs in 2023 and required a US$3-billion balance sheet injection from RBC.\n\nCity National has also paid fines and faced increased costs to beef up compliance in the wake of two regulatory settlements.\n\nRBC installed new senior management in late 2023 at City National, which had earned the Bank to the Stars nickname thanks to previous clients such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Frank Sinatra.\n\nTo help deal with the problems, CEO McKay turned to a key man behind the success in U.S. capital markets and investment banking to guide the overall strategy in the United States and help smooth the waters stirred up by City National.\n\nDerek Neldner, the Toronto-based chief executive and group head of RBC Capital Markets, was the \u201carchitect\u201d of the bank\u2019s U.S. strategy from 2022 until the end of the last year when the reins were passed to Greg Carmichael, City National\u2019s executive chair, according to an RBC spokesperson.\n\nMcKay refers to the U.S. as the bank\u2019s second \u201chome\u201d market, and investment bankers garnered special mention in the annual report published in December.\n\n\u201cThe strength of our U.S. franchise is anchored by our capital markets business,\u201d he said in the report, noting that RBC is now the ninth-largest investment bank in the U.S. and competes with the world\u2019s largest global players.\n\nAbout 51 per cent of capital markets revenue now comes from the U.S., around 30 per cent from Canada and the balance coming mostly from the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, where the bank has also gained market share.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is our biggest market and every year continues to grow as a more sizable part of the business,\u201d Neldner said from the bank\u2019s headquarters in downtown Toronto.\n\nNext moves\n\nA short walk away, at TD\u2019s headquarters, the path forward is less clear. With a new CEO set to take over in February, analysts expect the bank to turn its attention back to the Canadian market, where it doesn\u2019t face the same growth constraints as in the U.S. In a bullish scenario, this could mean higher profits.\n\nDechaine said the strategy \u201ccould theoretically be ROE accretive\u201d for the bank, given the profit profile of Canadian retail banking versus the U.S., but that could be easier said than done.\n\nBased on TD\u2019s historical growth in Canadian banking, he said market share gains are likely to be contingent on a more aggressive pricing strategy, which would reduce returns and dilute profits intended to offset stalled growth in the U.S.\n\nFor now, TD officials say the U.S. remains a priority, especially since the bank was able to establish a top-10 position there in less than 20 years.\n\n\u201cOur investments to strengthen our governance and control structure, core operations and anti-money laundering measures will position us well for years to come,\u201d Leo Salom, chief executive of TD\u2019s U.S. personal and commercial banking operations, said in an email. \u201cWe continue to be deeply committed to the U.S. market and confident in the strength of our franchise.\u201d\n\nBut the uncertainty for TD was clear when fourth-quarter and year-end financial results were released in December: the bank suspended medium-term financial targets, and said they won\u2019t be revisited until the second half of 2025.\n\n\u201cThe impetus is now on TD to comprehensively \u2018clean house,\u2019 placate the U.S. regulators and get the consent order that restricts their U.S. growth lifted as swiftly as possible,\u201d Madden said. \u201cCertainly no small feat, but something we believe the bank is eminently capable of doing in the coming years and that we expect, in time, will be rewarded with an upward re-rating of its trading multiples and its share price, both in the absolute and relative to its rivals.\u201d\n\nDechaine is more skeptical about TD\u2019s rebound, but he also questions Royal Bank\u2019s ability to maintain such high premiums when measured against the rest of the country\u2019s largest banks.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, we can\u2019t help but wonder how long this trade can still work, especially considering valuation spreads that are historically wide,\u201d he said in an Aug. 29 note. \u201cIn our experience, these spreads don\u2019t last forever and there will come a time when Canadian bank investors seek more U.S. exposure.\u201d\n\nBack at RBC, Neldner, a 29-year veteran of the bank, was keen to talk about the U.S. and how his team is working to win more top-notch advisory work for companies such as Smuckers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the story\u2019s really accelerated in the last five years,\u201d he said.\n\nFees earned on U.S. mergers and acquisitions have already nearly doubled since 2019, climbing to US$380 million, while the Canadian bank\u2019s M&A market share in the U.S. has climbed to 2.2 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent, according to Dealogic Ltd. data.\n\n\u201cOut of any of our products \u2026 M&A is one of the most difficult pieces of business to win with a client,\u201d Neldner said. \u201cStrategy and M&A are determined at the top of an organization \u2014 at the board, at the CEO. They\u2019re looking for deep advisory capabilities and people who they really trust.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don\u2019t miss the business news you need to know \u2014 add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.",

You might receive two: one records the contributions you made up until Dec. 31, and the other records contributions for the first 60 days of this year. Your financial institution or investment brokerage may provide these to you by mail or online.\n\n3. Investment Income\n\nIf you have other investments, look for T5 slips from your financial institution or investment brokerage, either through mail or their online platform. They will detail your income from dividends and interest.\n\n4. Education Expenses\n\nIf you\u2019re a post-secondary student, you\u2019ll need your T2202A from your educational institution. This documents your tuition fees and months of enrollment for your education credits. You may be able to find this on your student portal, or through the registrar\u2019s office.\n\n5. Work From Home Expenses\n\nIf your employer requires you to work from home some of the time, you may need a T2200 from your employer. This certifies that you were required to pay for some of your home office costs, and allows you to deduct some of those expenses.\n\nEvery tax situation is different. If you have medical expenses, child care expenses, or are self-employed, you may also need to collect and calculate your receipts. It\u2019s also worth finding out what\u2019s new to the 2024 income tax and benefit return as there may be new deductions you may qualify for. Consult with your tax advisor, accountant and/or legal advisor for specifics related to your tax situation.\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

This analysis encompasses various RBCIS client plans across private and public sectors.\n\n\"Powered by healthy returns in the equity market, we are pleased to report our fourth consecutive positive quarter for RBCIS DB client plans for 2024,\" said Isabelle Tremblay, Asset Owner Segment Lead at RBC Investor Services.\n\nGlobal equities for RBCIS DB pension plans generated gains of 4.1% this quarter, led by U.S. equities whose returns were boosted by a rapid depreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Over the quarter, the MSCI World Index returned 6.3%, led by the Consumer Discretionary (15.7%), Communication Services (13.6%) and Information Technology (11.4%) sectors. On a one-year basis, global equities for client plans returned 24.1%, while the MSCI World Index returned 29.4%, where the top performing sectors were Communication Services (46.0%), Information Technology (45.0%) and Financials (38.2%).\n\nCanadian equities for client plans underperformed their global counterparts, in part due to a smaller exposure to growth style stocks. They closed the quarter at 3.2% and the year at 21.2% aligning closely with the TSX Composite Index's 3.8% and 21.7% respectively. Top performing sectors for the TSX both this quarter and 2024 included Information Technology (22.2% quarterly and 38.0% annual return), Financials (6.6% quarterly and 30.1% annual return) and Energy (6.6% quarterly and 24.0% annual return).\n\nIn the Canadian fixed income asset class, RBCIS DB pension plans experienced a -0.2% loss for the quarter and 3.6% for the year, aligning with the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index's -0.04% for Q4 and 4.2% for 2024. Over the year, the FTSE Canada Short Term Bond Index's annual return of 5.7% outperformed the FTSE Canada Long Term Bond Index's return of 1.4% as the market responded to the Bank of Canada's substantial interest rates reductions.\n\n\"Our analysis shows solid annual returns for RBCIS DB pension plans, but also emphasizes the need for diversification and active risk management, especially as we enter a year of uncertainty,\" added Isabelle Tremblay. \"Plan managers continue to adapt their strategies for the evolving pension landscape as we prepare for political changes, including possible U.S. government policies and new Canadian Prime Minister.\"\n\nABOUT RBC\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada is a global financial institution with a purpose-driven, principles-led approach to delivering leading performance.

If you\u2019re looking to grow your business, learn how government funding can help you achieve your goals. There\u2019s nothing better than tapping into new funding opportunities that you don\u2019t have to pay back..\n\nWhen companies are looking to move beyond \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and explore growth opportunities, one of the first steps is to determine how growth will be generated. Will it be achieved by increasing an existing customer base or by boosting the engagement or usage of existing customers? Will growth come from introducing new products and/or services or entering new markets with the current offering?\n\nHowever you\u2019re planning to grow, expansion of any kind takes investment, which is often a barrier for businesses with limited cash flow. Fortunately, government grants and incentives can provide much-needed funding for businesses with growth plans, particularly if they align with Canada\u2019s economic priorities. In the recently published 2024 Fall Economic Statement, the Federal government has reinforced its commitment to building a strong economy that works for everyone.\n\nAs GrantMatch Co-Founder and Managing Partner, Mike Janke explains, \u201cGovernment grants and incentives can accelerate your business growth and help de-risk your financial investment. Grants go straight to your bottom line, unlike new sales, of which you only get to keep your profit margin. It is worth it for small businesses to spend the time researching and applying for grants and incentives.\u201d\n\nGrantMatch is Canada\u2019s leading grants and incentives management firm, offering a range of software and service-based solutions to assist Canadian businesses maximize funding attained from government incentive programs. Janke adds that these programs provide opportunity for businesses to expand and grow through capital investments in areas such as job creation, training, innovation, technology and ecological efficiency.\n\n\u201cOne way to improve your chances of securing government funding is to create a grant strategy that aligns with the most prominent funding program themes for the year ahead. This way, you can plan investments that are most likely to receive grant funding support,\u201d says Janke.\n\nHere are five ways government grants and incentives can help you grow your business in 2025.\n\n1. Grants for Hiring and Training\n\nWhether you need to grow your workforce to boost production or upskill existing talent to drive innovation, a commitment to create new jobs and develop current employees can position your business for grant and incentive programming. This is because both federal and provincial governments have a hearty commitment to job creation, particularly as it relates to the country\u2019s transition to a green economy, our competitiveness on the world stage and the economic vitality of local communities.\n\nBusinesses can tap into tomorrow\u2019s workforce with the help of the Government of Canada\u2019s Student Work Placement Program (SWPP) that provides employers with wage subsidies up to $7,000 to hire post-secondary students for paid work experiences.\n\nVisit Magnet to find talent and explore the SWPP program.\n\nHiring and training to support Canada\u2019s pursuit of a net-zero economy is a key federal priority \u2013 in the November 3, 2022, Federal Fall Economic Update, $250 million was earmarked for green skills training over five years, including:\n\nSustainable Jobs Training Center: This new initiative is designed to assist in the training of up to 15,000 workers in low-carbon jobs such as the sustainable battery industry.\n\nApprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit: This program provides non-refundable tax credits in hopes of encouraging training and long-term apprenticeships in Red Seal trades, offering up to 10% of the eligible salary.\n\nThere are also several open funding programs from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), which support jobs, training, and social development across a range of industries. Further, provincial and territorial governments offer funding opportunities for job creation and upskilling to address regional priorities.\n\nGrant in action: Walpole Island Algonac Ferry Ltd. received $82,000 from the Canada-Ontario Job Grant for a Ferry Captain Training program to train up to 12 participants. Training is provided through Georgian College\u2019s Marine Studies Program and will take place at their Owen Sound campus and onsite at the Walpole Island Ferry facility in southwestern Ontario. Upon completion of the course, trainees will receive an industry-recognized certificate of Master Limited over 60 Tonnes and will have the opportunity to work as part of Walpole Island Ferry\u2019s expanded ferry service between Canada and the U.S. on the St. Clair River.

Grants for Technical and Digital Innovation\n\nIn order to compete and grow in today\u2019s market, businesses of all types and sizes need to add technology to their business or apply digital innovation to be competitive. Whether it\u2019s digital tools and technology, scientific research and development, new product design, improved industrial processes or supply chain enhancements, technology and digital innovation are essential levers.\n\nGrants and incentive programs designed to boost regional and national economies \u2014 and make them more competitive \u2014 can help businesses tap into the technologies that can help them thrive. For instance:\n\nFoodtech Next offers up to 50% eligible costs or $500,000 for early-stage Canadian technology firms who seek to be part of, or sell to, the wider food industry. The program allows companies to demonstrate and pilot their innovation in operational environments to prove their solutions and validate the return on investment for the food sector.\n\nWhat Business Owners Need to Know Before Applying for the Food Tech Next Program\n\nThe total eligible project costs must be between $200,000 and $500,000, and the maximum level of matching funding from the program will be 50% of total eligible project costs, or $250,000. Applications must be submitted by Canadian incorporated businesses with less than $1M in annual sales in their most recently completed fiscal year. Applicants can submit an Expression of Interest between February 24, 2025, and April 7, 2025. The full application deadline is May 26, 2025.\n\nThe National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) \u2013 The primary role of NRC-IRAP is to help small and medium-sized Canadian businesses with mentorship and funding so they can grow and develop innovative technologies.

If successful, the Project will have the capability to process 200,000 tonnes per annum of municipal solid waste, diverting residential garbage from landfill.\n\n3. Grants for Infrastructure, Equipment & Facilities\n\nIf the growth of your business relies on new or improved manufacturing infrastructure, equipment and facilities, there are grant and incentive programs dedicated to enabling necessary construction and expansion. Because these projects can be capital-intensive, it\u2019s important to note that it is recommended to apply for the grant well ahead of starting the project as there are differing terms and conditions for each grant.\n\nThe Supply Management Processing Investment Fund provides non-repayable contributions to support investments in dairy, poultry, and egg processing facilities that improve productivity and/or efficiency through the purchase of new automated equipment and technology.\n\nPriority consideration is given to SMEs and it offers a great opportunity at 50% eligible costs with up to $10 million for dairy processors and $5 million to Dairy processors, Poultry Primary processors (chicken and turkey), Poultry Further processors (chicken and turkey), Hatcheries (broiler, egg-type or turkey), Egg graders and Egg processors.\n\nGrant in action: British Columbia\u2019s ReFeed is on a mission to develop programs, best practices and new products to help fix our broken food system. With the help of funding secured through the BC Accelerating Manufacturing Scale-Up Grant Program, ReFeed was able to pilot their Circular Nutrition\u2122 technology in a new 3,000 square foot custom facility. The investment resulted in job creation, a scale-up of technology, and the ability to expand into North American and global Cleantech markets. Learn more\n\n4. Grants for Environmental & Green Investments\n\nThere are several grant and funding opportunities offered by all levels of government that support projects aimed at protecting or conserving the environment. Businesses making investments in processes, technologies or equipment that reduce their carbon footprint may be eligible for grant funding that makes such projects more attractive or feasible.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Funding Programs: The government of Canada offers funding through a variety of grants and contributions programs. A complete listing of programs can be found here.\n\nGrant in action With the help of GrantMatch, Waterloo Brewing secured $414,830 in funding through the CME Smart Green Program for a new canning line pasteurizer that significantly reduced natural gas consumption. The brewery was also successful in securing funding through the Climate Action Incentive Fund to support an investment in a new compressed air system. Learn more\n\n5. Grants for New Businesses and Start-ups\n\nGetting access to funding is one of the biggest challenges new businesses face, and admittedly most of the grants and funding opportunities out there apply to companies that have been up and running for at least a year. But there are grants and other sources of funding that start-ups can qualify for, helping entrepreneurs launch their ideas.\n\nFunding for start-ups:\n\nThe National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) \u2013 The previously mentioned NRC-IRAP program is a diverse program and includes providing mentorship and funding to start-ups so they can grow and develop innovative technologies. The program offers grants to fund R&D project costs from $50,000 to $500,000. Learn more about IRAP\n\nThe Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) funds and provides continued mentorship to Cleantech start-ups that already have a proof-of-concept (POC) but haven\u2019t yet commercialized their product or service.

Looking ahead in 2025, the high likelihood of a Federal election could invariably impact the grants space.

Factors in our evaluation methodology include each card\u2019s earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or bonus categories), annual fee, redemption options, promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as insurance, loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one\u2019s own rewards categories.\n\nThe information below was last updated on Aug 28, 2024.\n\nWhat cardholders should know about the HSBC acquisition\n\nOn March 28, 2024, RBC completed the purchase of HSBC Bank Canada and its subsidiaries and transitioned HSBC credit card customers to comparable RBC cards. Migrated members who were unhappy with their new credit cards were also given the opportunity to switch to different RBC cards, assuming they qualified.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief look at what the RBC-HSBC deal looked like for customers who migrated:\n\nThings that stayed the same\n\nSome things carried over during the migration, with little to no disruption for cardholders. These included:\n\nCredit limits.\n\nOutstanding card balances.\n\nAuthorized users.\n\nAutomatic payments.\n\nCash-back rewards.\n\nAddresses, phone numbers and other personal account information.\n\nSome things that changed\n\nInterest rates, fees, and earn rates. In communications to HSBC customers, RBC expressed that it had tried to offer comparable credit cards to migrated members. However, a perfect product match didn\u2019t exist in every case, so some HSBC cardholders experienced changes in interest rates, fees, earn rates and other key product features.\n\nIdentification numbers. Former HSBC members were assigned new account, card and personal identification numbers (PINs) to go with their RBC credit cards.\n\nCommunication preferences. Cardholders who previously received e-statements from HSBC had to re-enroll in paperless statements with RBC.\n\nReward programs. HSBC Rewards points were converted to RBC Avion points at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nInsurance coverage. Former HSBC customers were asked to review their new credit cards\u2019 insurance coverage to ensure it met their needs.\n\nRBC credit cards: Types, features and cost\n\nRBC credit card options include co-branded cards, cashback cards and rewards cards, among others. RBC\u2019s proprietary travel rewards program, Avion Rewards, allows users to redeem points for travel, merchandise and more.\n\nTypes of RBC credit cards\n\nRBC\u2019s collection of credit cards includes a large array of travel rewards cards, as well as cards specifically designed for students and businesses. Here are some of the main types of cards offered by RBC.\n\nRBC Mastercard and RBC Visa\n\nRBC uses both Visa and Mastercard networks for its cards. At the time of this writing, RBC offers five Mastercards and 15 Visas.\n\nRBC cash-back cards\n\nCash-back credit cards let you earn a set amount of money back for each eligible purchase. RBC offers three cash-back cards, as of this writing:\n\nRBC Cash Back Preferred World Elite Mastercard.\n\nRBC\u00ae Cash Back Mastercard\u2021.\n\nRBC\u00ae Business Cash Back Mastercard\u2021.\n\nRBC travel credit cards\n\nTravel credit cards help you earn travel rewards, such as Avion points or WestJet dollars, and often feature travel-friendly perks, like airport lounge access, priority boarding and travel insurance.\n\nRBC offers nine travel credit cards, as of this writing:\n\nRBC Avion Visa Infinite.\n\nWestJet RBC World Elite Mastercard.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Infinite Privilege \u2013 A Luxury Travel Credit Card.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Platinum.\n\nRBC U.S. Dollar Visa Gold.\n\nWestJet RBC Mastercard.\n\nRBC\u00ae British Airways Visa Infinite\u2021.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Infinite Business.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Business.\n\nRBC business credit cards\n\nBusiness credit cards can help you manage your spending and earn rewards while running a business. RBC offers five business credit cards, as of this writing:\n\nRBC Avion Visa Infinite Business.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Business.\n\nRBC\u00ae Business Cash Back Mastercard\u2021.\n\nRBC Visa Business.\n\nRBC Visa CreditLine for Small Business.\n\nRBC student credit cards\n\nIf you\u2019re attending a post-secondary school, student credit cards are worth considering, as they often have lower interest rates, low or no annual fees and can help you build credit. RBC offers six credit cards it deems suitable for students, as of this writing:\n\nRBC ION Visa Credit Card.\n\nRBC ION+ Visa Credit Card.\n\nRBC\u00ae Cash Back Mastercard\u2021.\n\nRBC Avion Visa Platinum.\n\nmoi RBC Visa.\n\nWestJet RBC Mastercard.\n\nRBC low-interest credit cards\n\nLow-interest credit cards have lower-than-normal interest rates that can be useful if you know you\u2019ll carry a balance or need to minimize debt. RBC offers three low-rate cards, as of this writing:\n\nRBC\u00ae Visa\u2021 Classic Low Rate Option.\n\nRBC RateAdvantage Visa Credit Card.\n\nRBC Visa CreditLine for Small Business.\n\nRBC no-fee credit cards\n\nNo-fee credit cards can be a good addition to your wallet, since there is no cost you need to recoup. RBC offers five cards without annual fees, as of this writing.\n\nRBC ION Visa Credit Card.\n\nmoi RBC Visa.\n\nRBC\u00ae Cash Back Mastercard\u2021.\n\nRBC Visa Platinum.\n\nRBC RateAdvantage Visa Credit Card.\n\nFeatures of RBC credit cards\n\nInterest rates\n\nThe purchase interest rate for RBC credit cards ranges from 12.99% to 20.99%. However, most of their cards sit at 20.99%. The bank offers two cards with a variable rate: the RBC Visa CreditLine for Small Business and RBC RateAdvantage Visa Credit Card.\n\nThe interest rate for cash advances on most of RBCs cards sits at 22.99%.\n\nAnnual fees\n\nAs mentioned above, all but five RBC credit cards charge an annual fee, as of this writing. The fees for RBC credit cards range from $0 to $399, as of this writing. Getting a card with an annual fee may be worth it if the value of the rewards you\u2019ll earn exceeds the cost.\n\nRewards\n\nAlmost all RBC credit cards offer points or cash back rewards. The available reward programs include:\n\nAvion points.\n\nWestjet dollars.\n\nMoi points.\n\nAvios points (British Airways).\n\nCash back.\n\nHow to choose the best RBC credit card for you\n\nWhen choosing any credit card, be sure to look for the eligibility requirements. It doesn\u2019t make sense to apply for a credit card card that has age, location, income or credit score requirements you can\u2019t satisfy.\n\nAdditionally, you should consider the following:\n\nAnnual fees. Cards that charge annual fees tend to have higher value perks than those that don\u2019t. But be sure that the value of any rewards you\u2019ll earn will offset the cost of the card.\n\nInterest rate. You should always aim to pay off your credit card each billing period to avoid paying interest. But for various reasons, that may not always be feasible. If you know you tend to keep a balance on your card, it\u2019s wise to look for a card with a lower interest rate.\n\nRewards or cash back. If your goal is to earn rewards, figure out which form of reward makes sense for you. Points or miles can be more lucrative than cash back but can be more complicated to redeem.\n\nWho should get an RBC credit card?\n\nRBC credit cards can be particularly attractive to those looking to earn Avion points. Depending on the card you select, you can earn between one and three points per CAD spent. Categories include groceries, gas, dining and more.\n\nRBC cards may also appeal to jet-setters looking for a flexible travel rewards program that offers numerous redemption options, has no blackout dates and lets you transfer points to other loyalty programs.\n\nFurthermore, RBC is the only financial institution that offers Canadians WestJet- and British Airways-branded credit cards \u2014 handy if you\u2019re a frequent flyer on either airline.\n\nHow to apply for an RBC credit card\n\nTo apply for an RBC credit card, visit the bank\u2019s website, then click on the \u201cApply Now\u201d button for the card you want. At this stage, RBC may list the income requirements to apply for a card. Be sure you meet these requirements before proceeding. You\u2019ll then be asked if you\u2019re an existing client or not. If you already bank with RBC, the application process is much faster. You\u2019ll log in to your pre-existing account, which already has your personal information, and go from there. You\u2019ll then be asked to review the card\u2019s details, such as APR and annual fees, before clicking \u201cContinue\u201d. When prompted, give your name and personal info, such as a phone number, email address, home address and birth date. The bank will also ask about your rent or mortgage information, your employment status and history, as well as the name and phone number of your employer, as applicable. You\u2019ll be expected to provide your income, how much (if any) you earn from investments and whether you pay alimony. A social insurance number is optional. You may be asked to provide a personal identification word in case RBC needs to verify that they\u2019re communicating with you. You might also be asked if you want to add an authorized user. If you do, you\u2019ll need to provide the person\u2019s name, phone number and address, and select the person\u2019s relationship to you (e.g., daughter or spouse). Once you\u2019ve provided all of the required info, you\u2019ll be asked to review your application and the terms and conditions of the card before submitting it. Depending on the card, you may get a response in as little as 60 seconds, or the bank may have to review your details and contact you at a future date to let you know if your application was successful.",

            "content": "Banks make little progress, RBC ranks dead last amongst world\u2019s largest lenders\n\nGLOBAL \u2013 Today, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) released its updated report, Energy Supply Banking Ratios, revealing that major fossil fuel financing banks \u2013 including Citi and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) \u2013 continue to vastly underfinance renewable energy and climate solutions. This comes as US and Canadian banks quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance around Trump\u2019s inauguration, and following Earth\u2019s hottest-ever year.\n\nEnergy ratios are becoming an increasingly crucial tool for investors to evaluate how banks are helping or hindering the energy transition. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the ratio of financing clean-to-dirty energy supply must be 6:1 by 2030 to support an energy transition that hopes to keep temperature increase under 1.5 degrees.\n\nNotably, BloombergNEF reveals that the Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s was the lowest of the world\u2019s biggest lenders, at 0.47.\n\nOn this latest report, Hannah Saggau, Stand.earth Senior Climate Finance Strategist , issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cThis well-researched report provides a much-needed standardized methodology for investors to transparently measure and compare banks\u2019 financing for renewable energy relative to fossil fuels. Unfortunately, global banks like RBC and Citi remain dangerously out of line with a just transition while backsliding on global commitments. As our communities experience intensifying fires, floods, and storms, any self-reporting diverging from this standardized model risks confusing investors and perpetuating greenwashing.\u201d\n\nAccording to BNEF, top fossil fuel financing banks reveal the following ratios:\n\nBank Clean-to-dirty energy financing ratio RBC 0.47 Citi 0.75 JP Morgan Chase 0.80 Bank of America 1.04 BNP Paribas 3.18 Wells Fargo 0.521\n\nThe BNEF report uses a standardized methodology applied across 1000 banks it reviews, allowing a like-for-like comparison for investors. Self-reporting by banks using individualized, custom methodologies, like those used by JPMC, contain different and often conflicting data, making it ineffectual for investors who seek to compare banks\u2019 progress. For example, JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) released its own self-reported ratio as 1.29:1 low- to high-carbon energy financing, using a flawed methodology.\n\nThis also comes as an expos\u00e9 from The Examination, The Associated Press, Toronto Star, and Mississippi Today reveals how banks are giving billions to major polluters, and labeling it as \u201csustainable,\u201d with 1-out-of-5 sustainability-linked dollars since 2018 going to major polluters.\n\nIn early 2024, shareholder resolutions by New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, supported by Stand.earth, advanced at the largest North American banks. Prior to planned votes at Citi, RBC, and JPMC, the banks agreed to the terms of the resolutions, resulting in withdrawals of the proposals and commitments to transparently report their energy ratio financing. Investor support for the resolutions that went to a shareholder vote at Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, ranged between 23% and 29%. These resolutions have been submitted at these banks, as well as other Canadian banks, for consideration at 2025 meetings.\n\n###",

            "content": "Commercial real estate veterans have welcomed the first rate cut of 2025 by Canada's central bank, saying another reduction in the overnight lending rate should help the industry.\n\nThe Bank of Canada announced it is lowering its trend-setting policy rate by 25 basis points to 3%. Wednesday's move follows a reduction of 50 basis points in both December and October, and a total of five cuts in 2024. The overnight lending rate rose to 5% in July 2023 before the central bank started to cut it last year.\n\n\"The cumulative reduction in the policy rate since last June is substantial,\" the Bank of Canada said in a statement accompanying its decision. \"Lower interest rates are boosting household spending and the economy is expected to strengthen gradually and inflation to stay close to target.\"\n\nDoug Porter, chief economist with the Bank of Montreal, noted that economic policies the United States might enact are probably weighing heavily on Canada's central bank. The U.S. Federal Reserve was scheduled to announce a rate decision later Wednesday. The Bank of England is scheduled to decide next week whether to embark on what would be its third rate cut since August.\n\n\"It's a very, very different set of calculations confronting the Bank of Canada,\" said Porter, noting the overlap of rate decisions will happen five times this year, with the remaining four in the second half of the year. \"While the tariff threat is of some academic interest in the U.S., it is an existential risk to Canada.\"\n\nThreats by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods have created concern about the impact such a move could have on the Canadian central bank's decisions regarding future rate cuts.\n\n\"If these were normal times, we would be calling for the bank to stand aside,\" Porter said. \"With the Fed on hold, the Canadian dollar on its heels, core inflation turning back up, and plenty of signs of life in domestic spending, there are reasons to take a pause.\"\n\nEyes on tariffs\n\nCanada's central bank indicated it is keeping a close eye on potential tariffs.\n\n\"If broad-based and significant tariffs were imposed, the resilience of Canada\u2019s economy would be tested,\" the Bank of Canada said. \"We will be following developments closely and assessing the implications for economic activity, inflation and monetary policy in Canada. The bank is committed to maintaining price stability for Canadians.\"\n\nThe Royal Bank of Canada noted in a report that Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem already flagged the downside risks from potential protectionist U.S. trade policy as a \"major new uncertainty\" for the country.\n\n\"Those concerns have likely only become more pronounced with the new Trump administration threatening to impose aggressive tariffs on imports from Canada as early as next month,\" the Royal Bank of Canada said in its report. \"We expect policymakers would be more likely to cut interest rates faster and further should those downside risks materialize with the ultimately disinflationary growth and labour market implications from tariff hikes more a concern than a one-time increase in prices.\"\n\nDuring a news conference to discuss the rate decision, Macklem said the possibility of tariffs prevents the bank from providing normal guidance on future cuts.\n\n\"There are many uncertainties. There is a lot we don't know,\" he said. \"We don't know what new tariffs will be imposed, when or how long they will last. We don't know the scope of retaliatory measures or what fiscal support will be provided.\"\n\nEven with more information, Macklem said, it would be difficult to be precise about economic impacts.\n\n\"We have little historical experience with tariff changes of the magnitude\" under consideration by the United States, he said\n\nIndustry applauds cut\n\nChristopher Wein, chief operating officer of developer Equiton, applauded the latest rate cut.\n\n\"From a development perspective, they have an impact on our costs. We can pass on those savings to the consumers. For the construction we are building, the financing runs on variable interest rates,\" Wein told CoStar News. \"The interest rate environment is important to us.\"\n\nHowever, Wein said, a lower-rate environment is also important from a consumer confidence perspective. With rates starting to fall, \"it helps with consumers \u2014 both investors and end-user condo purchases.\"\n\nThe executive added that tariffs would likely help the decision to lower rates even more. \"Tariffs are deflationary, not inflationary. Short term, they might feel inflationary, but in the midterm they create deflation and slow the economy.\"\n\nHe added that \"no one knows what to do\" with the threat of tariffs from the United States because it is too difficult to predict the outcome today.\n\nMark Fieder, principal and president of Avison Young Canada, said the reduction is welcome news for commercial real estate investors looking to step off the sidelines and into the market.\n\n\"We continue to actively monitor economic conditions and acknowledge a degree of risk and uncertainty ahead due to the possibility of tariffs imposed on Canadian goods by the U.S.,\" Fieder said in a statement emailed to CoStar News. \"We remain optimistic about a longer-term bull run going into the last half of the year, stimulating appetite and capital allocation in such asset classes as industrial and multifamily.\"\n\nPhil Soper, chief executive of Brookfield companies Royal LePage and Bridgemarq, said if the Bank of Canada had not lowered rates then it could have taken the wind out of the residential market.\n\n\"It was widely expected,\" Soper told CoStar News. \"People are concerned about Trump tariffs, and it would have been a real shock to the nascent recovery\" for rates not to fall.\n\nThe Canadian Real Estate Association this month modified its forecast upward for the market for existing homes.\n\n\"I think normalcy is returning,\" Soper said, as price increases \"are holding steady in the mid-single-digit range.\"",

            "content": "TLDR The Bank of Canada reduces its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3% New mortgage reforms \u2013 including 30-year amortizations on new builds and default insurance changes \u2013 are making it easier for more Canadians to afford a home New refinancing options for insured mortgages are designed to encourage and enable homeowners to add secondary units including Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), laneway homes or basement apartments to their existing property\n\nHomeownership is a much-aspired-to milestone for Canadians. Yet in today\u2019s housing climate, the barriers prospective buyers face \u2013 especially among the Millennial and Gen Z population \u2013 have been significant. In the last decade, mortgage payment costs, housing prices and supply shortage have conspired to put homeownership out of reach for many young buyers. At the same time, a hot rental market in many Canadian communities has meant limited supply and high prices for renters.\n\nRecent changes to the mortgage landscape are helping to make the path a little easier for all. For one, the Bank of Canada\u2019s interest rate reductions are helping to bring down the cost of borrowing on many mortgages, loans and lines of credit. The latest interest rate announcement, which revealed a reduction of 25 basis points, continues to signal good news for both current and prospective buyers \u2014 in the last year, rates have come down from 5% to 3%.\n\nThe interest rate environment aside, the recent Government of Canada mortgage reforms should have a meaningful impact on buyers and owners. Targeting the housing supply issue, as well as affordability in major Canadian cities, the reforms are intended to boost new home construction (the government has a plan to build nearly 4 million homes by 2031), add rental units to a densifying Canada and help more Canadians qualify for a mortgage.\n\nWhat are the mortgage rule changes?\n\n30-year mortgage amortizations for all buyers of new builds: For Canadians buying a new construction home, the government is allowing 30-year mortgage amortizations \u2013 an increase from the standard 25-year amortization period.\n\nIncrease to the insured mortgage price cap from $1 million to $1.5 million: To reflect current housing market realities, particularly in Canadian urban hubs.\n\nInsured mortgage refinancing to add unit(s) to an existing home: To make it easier for homeowners to add 1-3 rental spaces to their homes, for example basement apartments, or secondary suites such as Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) or laneway homes.\n\nWhat do these changes mean for me?\n\nThese mortgage reforms have impacts across several groups:\n\nBuyers of new construction homes\n\nWith the introduction of 30-year mortgage amortizations for all buyers of new builds, including condos, Canadians have the opportunity to reduce the cost of their monthly mortgage payments. Moving from a 25-year amortization to a 30-year amortization effectively spreads out regular mortgage payments over a longer period of time.\n\nFor example, a homeowner with a $650,000 mortgage at a 5% interest rate and 25-year amortization would have a monthly payment of $3,780.44. At a 30-year amortization, this monthly payment comes down to $3,468.99 \u2013 a difference of over $300 per month.\n\nBuyers of homes of $1 \u2013 $1.5 million\n\nBefore December 15, 2025, homebuyers looking to purchase a home over $1 million had to put at least 20 % of the home\u2019s purchase price as a down payment. This is because mortgage default insurance \u2013 which allows people with down payments of less than 20% take out a mortgage \u2013 was limited to homes valued at $1 million or less. (Mortgage default insurance protects the mortgage lender if the borrower defaults on their mortgage).\n\nGiven the cost of homes in the country\u2019s more expensive cities, such as Toronto and Vancouver, this $1 million price cap made it difficult for buyers to enter the housing market.\n\nToday, buyers can buy a home worth up to $1.5 million without having to put down 20% or more. Under the new rules, buyers are required to put down 5% on the first $500,000 of the home\u2019s value and 10% for the remaining, up to $1 million, when taking out an insured mortgage. This means, on a $1.5 million home, the down payment requirement drops from $300,000 to $125,000.\n\nHomeowners looking to add units to their existing home\n\nEffective January 15, 2025, homeowners may be able to refinance their property with an insured mortgage to allow them to add more living units, with insurance for up to $2 million in property value after redevelopment. As default-insured mortgages often have the lowest interest rates on offer in Canada, this change makes it easier for homeowners to leverage their property\u2019s equity, generate rental income and help ease the crunch on housing supply.\n\nFor those looking to take advantage of this change and add units to their home, there are certain parameters. Borrowers must:\n\nAlready own their properties\n\nOccupy one of the current units (a close relative may also be the occupant)\n\nIntend to construct additional units (to a maximum of 4 units, including the existing)\n\nFurther, the additional unit(s) must not be used as a short-term rental.\n\nSecondary units on existing properties, or ADUs, offer a promising solution to the nation\u2019s housing challenges, providing homeowners and municipalities with innovative ways to increase housing supply while preserving neighbourhood character. But the process will be new for many homeowners, who may be unsure of how best to move forward. Resimate, a Canadian company specializing in digitally assessing the suitability of a residential lot for ADUs, can help simplify the process for those interested in redeveloping their property.\n\nBottom line: The new mortgage rules are designed to make it easier for more Canadians to own, refinance or rent a home in today\u2019s market. Whether you\u2019re looking to buy your first home, your next home, or build additional units at your current property, an RBC Mortgage Specialist is available to help you bring your ideas to life.\n\nWhen is the next Bank of Canada announcement?\n\nInterest rates aren\u2019t the only factor that affect housing affordability, but they can have a meaningful impact. Staying up to date on the interest rate environment can help buyers and owners make the right mortgage decisions for their current and future needs.\n\nThe next Bank of Canada interest rate announcement is March 12, 2025.\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

OpenAI has sought to improve this in its latest iterations. But the ability of large language models such as ChatGPT to reliably do complex calculations remains in question.\n\nThis has not stopped bankers from embracing gen AI for tasks such as summarising documents or sifting through internal policies and procedures \u2013 mainly internally, but with some attempts now to make these systems customer-facing. Banks are also getting gen AI models to write marketing content and to help with coding, among other relatively low-risk use cases.\n\nYet, most banking data is numerical: securities trading, payments, risk metrics and so on. At Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), for example, 80% of the data on its servers is not in language form. The ability of language-based models alone to get to the financial heart of banking, and add value to it, is consequently limited.",

            "content": "New York City is known around the world for its buildings, culture, culinary scene and, of course, its shopping. With the largest concentration of fashion designers and retailers in any city, it is a haven for those seeking a healthy dose of retail therapy. From mega department stores to tiny village boutiques, New York City offers a U.S. shopping experience like no other place on earth.\n\nHere are eight reasons shopping in New York City ia top choice when considering a U.S. shopping trip.\n\n1. Fifth Avenue\n\nIt\u2019s easy to lose count of the number of flagship stores that call Fifth Avenue home. From Swarovski to LEGO, Bergdorf\u2019s to Tiffany & Co. to Apple, it\u2019s no wonder this is one of the most famous shopping streets on the planet. Admire the massive and imaginative LEGO displays, snap a selfie outside Apple\u2019s iconic glass cube (which rises impossibly from the sidewalk), browse high-end designers (think Prada, Armani, Dolce & Gabbana) or snag only-in-New York goods at the Nike or Adidas stores. Fifth Avenue is a must-visit stop on any U.S. shopping tour for its window shopping alone.\n\n2. Department Stores\n\nNew York City stands unrivalled as the global epicentre of iconic department stores. Saks Fifth Avenue offers ten stories of designer clothing, handbags and shoes. Bergdorf Goodman offers nine floors dedicated to women\u2019s luxury fashion, jewelry and home goods on the west side of 5th and men\u2019s fashions on the east side. Farther south, Bloomingdale\u2019s has been a fixture since the 1860s, and Macy\u2019s, a NYC landmark for over 150 years, retains its status as the largest department store in the nation. It\u2019s easy to spend the day (or several) wandering through these legendary stores.\n\n3. SoHo\n\nSoHo is a vibrant enclave of fashion-forward boutiques, pop-up shops, flagship retailers and street vendors tucked into the area \u201cSouth of Houston Street\u201d (hence the SoHo moniker) and between Broadway and 6th Avenue. Here, you\u2019ll find your favourite global brands, local designers, modern furniture, art shops, and so much more. Whether you\u2019re on the hunt for designer jeans, a new accent for your dining table or a one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry, SoHo is the place to go. By night, the area is home to a provocative mix of trendy restaurants, hidden speakeasies and old-school pubs.\n\n4. Brooklyn\n\nFor a decidedly different \u2014 yet authentically New York \u2014 shopping experience, head across the bridge and into Brooklyn. It\u2019s a great spot to snag cool sneakers, vintage goods, hip clothing and interesting furniture. However, Brooklyn is a big place, with several neighbourhoods within this NYC borough.\n\nIn Williamsburg, for instance, you\u2019ll find interesting shops selling everything from plants to textiles, home d\u00e9cor to books and skateboards. This neighbourhood at the north end of Brooklyn also has some of the city\u2019s trendiest restaurants and nightlife. DUMBO, meanwhile, with its charming streets and stunning views of Brooklyn Bridge, is home to Brooklyn Flea, Brooklyn\u2019s largest flea market. Open every Saturday and Sunday, you\u2019ll find vendors hawking vintage design, antiques, collectibles, and food.\n\nFifth Avenue in Park Slope was recently named the coolest street in New York City by a local magazine. Its mom-and-pop shops, independent bookstores, record shops and cafes sit on tree-lined streets in this brownstone-filled Brooklyn neighbourhood that enchants with a decidedly literary feel.\n\n5. Upper East Side\n\nExuding classic New York elegance, the Upper East Side is synonymous with refined sophistication. Madison Avenue\u2019s prestigious row of haute couture boutiques is a shopper\u2019s paradise. The expansive Herm\u00e8s flagship features an upscale cocktail bar and exclusive VIP lounge, while Ralph Lauren\u2019s flagship straddles both sides of the avenue. Unlike NYC\u2019s busier districts, this neighborhood delivers a serene experience, frequented mostly by locals. If you\u2019re looking for a quiet stroll past high fashion storefronts, this neighbourhood is worth a stop.\n\n6. The Shops at Columbus Circle\n\nThe Shops at Columbus Circle is an upscale shopping centre at the bottom west corner of Central Park. Small, manageable and not nearly as crowded as midtown, the Shops at Columbus Circle feature well-known brands spread across 40 stores and three floors. If you\u2019re there over lunch or dinner hours, the selection ranges from grab-and-go to Michelin-starred restaurants, and everything in between.\n\n7. Herald Square\n\nThis hectic tourist spot is home to H&M and Macy\u2019s flagship stores. The intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and 34th Street forms this major shopping hub. With food stalls, outdoor seating, umbrellas and chess boards, it\u2019s a bustling, pedestrian friendly area that\u2019s full of people and energy.\n\n8. Meatpacking District\n\nThe Meatpacking District is one of Manhattan\u2019s coolest areas. Situated near the beginning of the High Line, the area is anchored by Chelsea Market, a food and retail marketplace that\u2019s a popular spot for food tours and features all kinds of unique shops. Elsewhere in the area you can find high-fashion boutiques, superb restaurants and trendy roof-top bars that are excellent places to relax after a long day of shopping \u2013 and maybe spot a celebrity or two.\n\nThrow a dart in New York City, and you will find a street, neighbourhood, or intersection with incredible shopping. With so much to explore, narrowing down the best of the city isn\u2019t easy, so it\u2019s worth checking out NYC for a weekend of shopping for yourself. Just be sure to pack your walking shoes!",

            "content": "Royal Bank and TD Bank have delivered very different results for investors in the past few years.\n\nRoyal Bank (TSX:RY) and TD Bank (TSX:TD) are the largest players in the Canadian financial sector. The stocks have delivered very different performances for investors in recent years, with RY being the big winner.\n\nInvestors are wondering if TD Bank is now undervalued and good to buy or if Royal Bank remains a better pick for a self-directed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) portfolio focused on dividends and total returns.\n\nRoyal Bank Stock\n\nRoyal Bank trades near $176 per share at the time of writing. This is close to the record high of around $180 it reached in early December. The stock is up 33% in the past year and gained 68% over the past five years.\n\nRoyal Bank is benefitting from its $13.5 billion purchase last year of HSBC Canada. The deal added 780,000 customers and 4,500 new employees. Management\u2019s focus on a Canadian acquisition sets Royal Bank apart from its peers in the past few years, where deals in the United States have been more common.\n\nRoyal Bank delivered a 10% gain in adjusted net income in 2024 to $17.4 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 8% compared to fiscal 2023, and adjusted return on equity (ROE) came in unchanged at a solid 15.5%.\n\nRoyal Bank finished fiscal 2024 with a common equity tier-one (CET1) ratio of 13.2%. This means the bank still has ample capital on hand to ride out market turbulence or make additional acquisitions.\n\nThe bank delivered a strong performance in a year where high interest rates put pressure on businesses and households with too much debt. Royal Bank\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter (Q4) 2024 provision for credit losses (PCL) rose $120 million, or 17% compared to fiscal Q4 2023.\n\nRate cuts by the central bank will ease the pressure on variable-rate borrowers, but bond yields remain high, making fixed-rate mortgage renewals more expensive in the current market compared to when homeowners took out the initial mortgages five years ago.\n\nAt the current share price, investors can get a dividend yield of 3.3% on RY stock.\n\nTD Bank\n\nTD trades near $82.50 at the time of writing compared to $108 about three years ago. In the past 12 months, the stock price has been relatively unchanged, and investors are up about 13% from where the stock sat five years ago.\n\nThe stock\u2019s underperformance is due to issues in the American operations. Regulators fined TD more than $3 billion in 2024 and placed an asset cap on the U.S. business as penalties for not having adequate systems in place to identify and prevent money laundering.\n\nTD spent billions of dollars over the past 20 years buying American regional banks from Maine right down the East Coast to Florida. The bank ranks among the top 10 in the U.S. market and expansion south of the border was a core part of the growth strategy. In fact, TD had to abandon its planned US$13.4 billion takeover of First Horizon due to regulatory challenges.\n\nTD is now in a transition phase. A new chief executive officer will take control next month to work out a new strategy to deliver growth for shareholders. At the current share price, investors can get a dividend yield of 5% from TD stock.\n\nIs one a better pick?\n\nRoyal Bank isn\u2019t cheap right now, and the dividend yield is a bit low, but the stock still deserves to be on your radar for a buy-and-hold portfolio focused on total returns.\n\nTD is arguably a contrarian pick right now. Investors will need to be patient, but the shares might be undervalued at this point and you get paid a decent dividend yield to wait for a recovery.\n\nIncome investors might want to go with TD as the first choice today. Otherwise, it might be worthwhile to split a new investment between the two stocks.",

            "content": "Despite its mixed financial performance in recent quarters, BMO\u2019s consistent focus on long-term growth initiatives and U.S. market expansion make it an attractive bank stock to watch in 2025.\n\nAfter a strong 22% rally over the past six months, Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) has continued its upward momentum in 2025, with the stock trading up nearly 4% year to date at $144.90 per share as of January 27. Investors seem increasingly optimistic about Canadian bank stocks, as better-than-feared economic conditions are creating a favourable environment for growth.\n\nAs Canada\u2019s third-largest bank, with a market cap of $106 billion, BMO has long been a safe stock for cautious investors. But could BMO stock keep up its momentum in 2025? In this article, I\u2019ll break down key fundamental factors that could impact its performance this year and explore whether the stock is still worth adding to your portfolio this year.\n\nMain reasons for BMO stock\u2019s recent rally\n\nTwo of the key factors behind Bank of Montreal\u2019s strong stock performance in recent months are the broader optimism surrounding the Canadian banking sector and expectations of an improvement in its financial growth trends. Falling interest rates and easing inflationary pressures are expected to provide a supportive environment for loan growth, while improving credit quality could reduce the sector\u2019s risk across the board. Investors expect BMO\u2019s well-diversified business model and strong market position to help it benefit from these favourable economic conditions.\n\nAlso, BMO\u2019s strong track record of rewarding its shareholders with reliable dividends year after year seems to be a major driver of its appeal to income-focused investors. Currently, the stock offers an annualized dividend yield of 4.4%.\n\nMixed financial performance but strong capital position\n\nBank of Montreal\u2019s financial performance in its fiscal year 2024 (ended in October) was largely mixed but still reflected resilience in a challenging environment. While the bank\u2019s total revenue for the fiscal year rose 13.9% YoY (year over year) to $32.8 billion, its adjusted earnings were slightly down due mainly to higher provisions for credit losses.\n\nIn the latest quarter, BMO\u2019s Canadian personal and commercial banking segment showed strength. The segment saw a 5% YoY revenue growth with the help of higher net interest income and deposit balances. Similarly, its wealth management posted a 35% YoY jump in quarterly revenue due to client asset growth, reflecting the bank\u2019s ability to continue leveraging its wealth services despite economic uncertainties.\n\nLower margins and elevated provisions for credit losses in its U.S. personal and commercial banking segment affected BMO\u2019s overall profitability. Nevertheless, it continued to strengthen its balance sheet, with its common equity tier-one ratio rising to 13.6% in the most recent quarter. This strong financial base provides the bank with enough flexibility for future investments.\n\nBMO stock\u2019s outlook for 2025\n\nBank of Montreal is trying to leverage AI (artificial intelligence) and other technological innovations to enhance its analytics capabilities to improve customer retention and operational efficiency. Moreover, the bank is continuing to improve its U.S. presence with its acquisition of Bank of the West, which is expected to drive growth in both commercial and retail banking. This strategic expansion could help BMO capture a larger share of the U.S. market while further diversifying its revenue streams going forward. Considering these factors, despite its mixed financial performance in recent quarters, BMO stock continues to be one of the most attractive bank stocks to watch in 2025.",

As Canada\u2019s largest financial institution, it combines innovation with a continued commitment to growth, making it a strong player in the Canadian banking industry. In addition, its excellent track record of rewarding investors with increasing dividends year after year makes it even more attractive for income investors.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at Royal Bank\u2019s recent financial performance, its growth initiatives, and fundamental outlook for 2025 and find out why it could continue to shine this year.\n\nRoyal Bank stock\n\nCurrently trading at $174.11 per share, RY stock has a market cap of $246.3 billion and offers an attractive annualized dividend yield of 3.4%. Over the past year, it has delivered a 30.5% gain, outperforming broader market benchmarks. By comparison, the TSX Composite Index has risen 21% in the last 12 months. RY stock\u2019s strong performance reflects not only a solid financial base but also the trust investors have in Canada\u2019s largest bank.\n\nSolid growth, even amid challenges\n\nRoyal Bank\u2019s financial performance in its fiscal year 2024 (ended in October) showcased its resilience and adaptability. During the year, the bank\u2019s net profit climbed by 11% YoY (year over year to $16.2 billion, while adjusted net profit saw a 10% rise from a year ago to $17.4 billion. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, the bank managed to expand its adjusted net profit margin to 29.8% in fiscal 2024 from 20.2% in fiscal 2023.\n\nSimilarly, its financial growth in the latest fiscal year was fueled by robust performances across key segments, with personal banking delivering a 16% YoY jump in net profit due to strong deposit and loan growth. On the wealth management side, its earnings surged by 27% from a year ago with the help of higher fee-based client assets. At the same time, Royal Bank continued to manage risks well by maintaining a strong capital position and controlling loan loss provisions.\n\nFocus on long-term growth\n\nRoyal Bank\u2019s recent acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada in March 2024 could be a big boost to its long-term growth strategy. This move not only strengthened its foothold in the Canadian market but also added $453 million in net profit during the fiscal year 2024. Also, RBC\u2019s investments in technology to enhance digital banking platforms and expand data-driven solutions clearly show its long-term approach.",

            "content": "STAG Industrial, Inc. is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in acquiring, owning, and operating industrial properties across the United States. The company has become a key player in the industrial real estate market with a robust portfolio of strategically located assets.\n\nSTAG Industrial identifies industrial properties with relative value across various locations, property types, and tenants. Its mission is to be a disciplined, relative value investor and a leading owner and operator of industrial properties in the United States. The company operates under the REIT structure, which provides tax advantages and requires it to distribute a significant portion of its income to shareholders. STAG Industrial owns a diversified portfolio of 562 buildings in 41 states, with approximately 111.7 million rentable square feet. Its portfolio consists primarily of warehouse/distribution buildings, light manufacturing buildings, flex/office buildings, and value-add portfolio buildings. With a high occupancy rate of approximately 98.5% as of December 31, 2022, the company has effectively leased its properties to a mix of single and multi-tenant tenants, ensuring a balanced revenue stream.\n\nA highly experienced management team leads STAG Industrial with a deep understanding of the industrial real estate market. Benjamin S. Butcher is the Executive Chairman, providing strategic guidance and industry expertise. William R. Crooker, the Chief Executive Officer and President, brings strong leadership and a track record of success in the industrial property sector.\n\nSTAG Industrial has demonstrated consistent growth and financial strength. In recent years, the company has achieved impressive revenue and earnings figures. Furthermore, STAG Industrial maintains a healthy profit margin, indicating efficient property management and operational excellence. The company's prudent capital structure, with a low debt-to-equity ratio, demonstrates a balanced approach to financing its operations.\n\nThe industrial real estate market is vital to the broader commercial real estate sector, and STAG Industrial operates within a highly competitive landscape. The demand for industrial properties has increased, driven by factors such as e-commerce growth, supply chain optimization, and the expansion of logistics and distribution networks. As companies strive to meet the evolving needs of consumers, the demand for strategically located warehouses and distribution centers has increased significantly.\n\nSTAG Industrial is well-positioned in this dynamic market, with its diverse portfolio of industrial properties spread across key locations throughout the United States. The company's focus on acquiring properties offering relative value allows it to capitalize on market opportunities and enhance its competitive advantage. By maintaining a solid tenant mix and avoiding dependence on any single tenant or industry, STAG Industrial mitigates risks associated with tenant turnover or industry-specific downturns.\n\nSTAG Industrial has identified several growth opportunities that can fuel its future success. The company aims to leverage its expertise and market knowledge to identify and acquire industrial properties with strong income-generating potential. The ongoing expansion of e-commerce and the increasing demand for last-mile delivery facilities present significant growth prospects. STAG Industrial can seize these opportunities by strategically acquiring properties near densely populated areas or regions with robust logistics and distribution networks.\n\nAdditionally, the company can pursue growth through portfolio optimization and value-add initiatives. By re-leasing single-tenant properties to multiple tenants or implementing property improvements, STAG Industrial can enhance rental income and property value. The company's fully-integrated acquisition, leasing, and asset management platform and experienced management team provide a solid foundation for executing these growth strategies.\n\nWhile STAG Industrial has demonstrated resilience and growth potential, it is not immune to risks and challenges inherent in the industry. Changes in economic conditions, including recessions or slowdowns, could impact the demand for industrial properties and potentially affect the company's rental income and occupancy rates. Moreover, regulatory changes, environmental regulations, or zoning restrictions could create hurdles in property acquisitions and operations.\n\nAdditionally, STAG Industrial faces competition from other REITs, institutional investors, and private equity firms active in the industrial real estate market. Intense competition could impact property acquisition opportunities and potentially affect rental rates. The company must continue to identify and acquire properties that offer value and maintain a disciplined approach to portfolio management.",

            "content": "American Express Company is a multinational financial services company based in New York City. The company provides credit cards, charge cards, traveler's cheques and other financial services to individuals and businesses worldwide.\n\n\n\nFounded in 1850, American Express has been a pioneer in the credit card industry and has developed a reputation for offering premium products and services that cater to high-income consumers. The company operates in over 130 countries and employs over 75,000 people globally.\n\nStephen J. Squeri has served as American Express Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2018, succeeding Kenneth I. Chenault. Squeri joined the company in 1985 and has held various leadership positions.\n\n\n\nHe is credited with leading the company's digital transformation and developing new partnerships with technology companies such as Apple, Google and Amazon. Other key management team members include Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey C. Campbell and Vice Chairman Douglas E. Buckminster.\n\nAmerican Express has consistently generated strong financial results, with revenue increasing consistently over the past few years. The company's net income has also grown during this same time frame. The company's profit margin has remained relatively stable at around 14%.\n\n\n\nAmerican Express has maintained a strong balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio and a price-to-book ratio consistent with industry averages. Over the past couple of years, American Express' stock has performed well, leading its industry peers.\n\nThe credit card industry is highly competitive, with a few prominent players dominating the market. American Express competes with other major credit card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard and banks that issue private-label credit cards.\n\n\n\nThe industry has been growing steadily, with global credit card transactions expected to reach $8.8 trillion by 2025. However, the industry faces several challenges, including increasing regulatory scrutiny and the threat of disruption from fintech startups.\n\nAmerican Express has several growth opportunities, including expanding its presence in international markets and developing new partnerships with technology companies. The company has made significant progress in these areas, with global revenue growth from 2016 to 2022.\n\n\n\nAmerican Express has also partnered with companies such as Uber, Marriott and Delta Airlines to offer unique benefits to its cardholders. Additionally, the company has been investing in its digital capabilities by launching its digital wallet and mobile app.\n\nDespite its stable financial performance and growth opportunities, American Express faces several risks and challenges. The company's high-end products and services may be vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences, and the company may need help to appeal to younger generations who prefer debit cards and mobile payments.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, American Express is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny, with regulators monitoring the company's anti-money laundering practices and compliance with consumer protection laws. The company's debt levels and dependence on the global economy also pose risks, as a recession or economic downturn could impact its profitability.\n\nAnother major challenge for American Express is the increasing competition from fintech startups, disrupting the traditional credit card industry by offering innovative products and services. These startups are often more agile and adaptable than established companies like American Express and may be able to offer more attractive rewards and lower fees to customers.\n\n\n\nTo stay competitive, American Express must continue to innovate and develop new products and services that cater to changing customer preferences.",

Let\u2019s break down the major similarities and differences.\n\nWealthsimple or RBC: Fintech vs. Bank\n\nWealthsimple is a fintech company that was launched in 2014, but just because they\u2019re new, that doesn\u2019t make them insignificant. Wealthsimple has about 3 million account holders and over $50 billion in assets under management. Wealthsimple Invest was once our most recommended robo-advisor, but they\u2019ve recently fallen to second place, behind Justwealth.\n\nRBC is the largest bank in Canada with over 20 million clients and over 160 years of history. Their robo-advisor, RBC InvestEase, launched in late 2018. RBC is one of only two big banks to offer robo-advising (the other is BMO, which rolled out their SmartFolio robo-advisor in early 2016).\n\nThese two companies are incredibly different, but they overlap in one area: they\u2019re dedicated to providing investors with a user-friendly passive investing option.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Security\n\nBoth Wealthsimple and RBC are legit, safe, and trustworthy. Your account is held by a custodial broker that is a member of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) and regulated by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization (IIROC).\n\nThis means two things for you:\n\n1. The way both companies invest your money is regulated by an independent agency\n\n2. If either robo-advisor goes bankrupt (extremely unlikely with billions of dollars under management by each one), your accounts are protected up to $1 million.\n\nBoth companies also protect your data with bank-level encryption and security. RBC even offers account holders a 100% reimbursement if a data breach results in an unauthorized transaction.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Fees\n\nWhile account holders are charged based on a percentage of their account total annually, the fee structures for Wealthsimple and RBC vary.\n\nWealthsimple takes a tiered approach and charges:\n\n0.5% on accounts up to $100,000\n\n0.4% on accounts of $100,000 to $10,000,000\n\n0.2% on accounts over $10,000,000.\n\nRBC on the other hand charges a flat rate of 0.5% regardless of account totals.\n\nSo, if you hold more than $100,000 in assets, you will be charged a lower fee with Wealthsimple than with RBC.\n\nThe MER on Wealthsimple\u2019s ETFs varies, ranging from 0.12%-0.15% annually. The MER for their Socially Responsible Investments is higher, ranging from 0.21%-0.23%.\n\nRBC InvestEase\u2019s ETFs have an average MER range of 0.11%-0.14% and their SRI options range from 0.18-0.23%, which is slightly lower than Wealthsimple\u2019s.\n\nObviously, we appreciate Wealthsimple\u2019s discount for larger accounts, which can add up to a lot as your total holdings increase. We can\u2019t deny that RBC does offer fractionally lower total fees for their SRIs, but if you have an account over $100,000 and qualify for Wealthsimple\u2019s lower annual fee, the cost difference disappears almost entirely.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: ETF Selection\n\nWealthsimple portfolios typically include ETFs from top providers in Canada such as Vanguard, iShares, and BMO.\n\nRBC works with a selection of 7 standard and 7 SRI ETFs. They have an exclusive partnership with iShares, so they offer RBC iShares ETFs only.\n\niShares is one of the best ETF providers in Canada, so this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, it just means that RBC investors could miss out on offerings from companies like Vanguard and BMO.\n\nWhen it comes to ETFs in Canada there are so many options. Of course, we\u2019ve taken a deep dive into researching them for you. Check out our articles on the Best Canadian All-One ETFs, Top ETFs in Canada, and Best Dividend ETFs in Canada.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Socially Responsible Investments\n\nBoth Wealthsimple and RBC InvestEase take responsible investing seriously.\n\nWealthsimple Invest\u2019s SRI ETFs:\n\nContain no investments in the oil, tobacco, or weapons industries.\n\nStick to more sustainable industries like clean energy, electric cars, and plant-based meats.\n\nAvoid the top 25% of carbon producers in each industry for their SRIs.\n\nMake sure that every company in their fund has at least 25% (or a minimum of 3) women on their board of directors. The fact that this is still notable in 2025 is a whole other issue, but we appreciate the gesture.\n\nRBC has branded their SRIs \u201cResponsible Investing\u201d because it goes beyond the social aspect and covers environmental, social, and governance factors. For example, they:\n\nAvoid companies in the tobacco, \u201ccontroversial weapons,\u201d and civilian firearms industries.\n\nAvoid any company involved in \u201csevere controversies\u201d (harassment claims, emissions test data falsification, etc).\n\nAssess all investment candidates based on environmental, social, and governance standards.\n\nTBC has a lot of math to back this up, which you can find on their website, but basically what it means for you is a collection of ETFs you can feel good about investing in.\n\nThe bottom line here is that both Wealthsimple Invest and RBC InvestEase are dedicated to finding unproblematic investment options, not only environmentally but also socially and legally. RBC has a slight leg up on Wealthsimple in this area because they offer a wider selection of ETFs with lower average MERs, so if SRIs are your main focus, you may want to keep this in mind.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Portfolio Options\n\nBoth companies offer a variety of portfolio options. Wealthsimple offers 3 basic portfolio templates: Conservative, Balanced, and Growth. These are available for their standard, SRI, and Halal portfolios. Within each of those 3 types of portfolios, your asset allocation is adjusted based on your risk tolerance and is given a value from 1-10. This value is based on information you provide and is used to determine the exact allocation of your portfolio, so there\u2019s a good amount of customization.\n\nRBC offers 5 portfolios ranging from Very Conservative to Aggressive Growth, using either standard ETFs or responsible investing ETFs. It\u2019s a solid range of portfolios, diverse enough to provide options for any goal or level of risk tolerance.\n\nBoth Wealthsimple and RBC InvestEase rebalance your portfolio if it strays too far from your ideal asset allocation. They also reinvest any dividends earned to grow your account even faster.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: TFSAs, RRSPs, and more\n\nWe\u2019re always interested to see what accounts a robo-advisor offers, and it can make a difference in how we rank them. We value a good selection!\n\nWealthsimple Invest offers a wide range of accounts including:\n\nMeanwhile, RBC InvestEase only offers TFSAs, RRSPs, FHSAs, and non-registered accounts. However, RBC Direct Investing (RBC\u2019s DIY online broker) offers RRIFs and RESPs. Even with RBC\u2019s variety of options through either their robo-advisor or their online brokerage, you don\u2019t have as many account options as with Wealthsimple.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Performance\n\nYear-to-year investment performance is a tricky metric and nearly impossible to draw useful conclusions from.\n\nWealthsimple Invest and RBC InvestEase allocate funds differently, and that will lead to different results based on how those particular sectors are doing in any given year. For example, Wealthsimple invests more of your money into the US and emerging markets than the more Canada-focused RBC does at every risk level.\n\nThe thing is, differences in year-to-year performance don\u2019t indicate that one robo-advisor is better than the other \u2013 they\u2019re just different, that\u2019s all.\n\nDon\u2019t chase returns!\n\nPick a robo-advisor that works for your needs, stick with it, and recognize that you\u2019re in it for the long haul. Any discrepancies in performance tend to even themselves out over time.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Sign-up Process\n\nSigning up for both RBC InvestEase and Wealthsimple Invest is easy. All you need is your SIN, address, and banking information. You\u2019ll be taken through a questionnaire that helps them pinpoint your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance, and select the right portfolio for you.\n\nOnce you\u2019re all set up, all you need to do is fund your account.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Minimum Balance\n\nOne of the things we love about Wealthsimple is that they start investing with however much you put in your account, even if you only deposit $5. RBC will allow you to open an account with any amount of money, but they won\u2019t invest it until you reach a $100 balance. Furthermore, your money won\u2019t be invested in a fully diversified portfolio until your balance reaches $1500.\n\nThis isn\u2019t as good as Wealthsimple, but it\u2019s miles better than robo-advisors like NestWealth, which requires a $1,000 deposit, or Justwealth, which requires a $5,000 minimum deposit for all accounts except RESPs.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Perks, Benefits And Extra Features\n\nIn addition to their 0.1% discount on annual fees for accounts over $100,000, Wealthsimple Invest provides higher-balance investors with tax-loss harvesting, a discount on estate planning, and more. Accounts over $500,000 get those perks plus enhanced offers like a personalized financial report and 50% off of a health insurance plan (for residents of Ontario).\n\nRBC doesn\u2019t offer any perks for higher balances. Everyone pays 0.5% annually and there aren\u2019t any bonus features at all. Obviously, if your account is under $100,000, this difference doesn\u2019t affect you, but if you have more to invest, Wealthsimple is the better value.\n\nWhen it comes to perks \u2013 our stance is that while they\u2019re nice, they can\u2019t be at the expense of quality of service, and they\u2019re only worthwhile if they\u2019re perks you\u2019ll actually use!\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Available Promotions\n\nWealthsimple Invest is offering our readers a welcome bonus: $50 cash if you open an account and invest $500. There are many other reasons why they\u2019re one of our most-recommended robo-advisors, but this certainly doesn\u2019t hurt!\n\nRBC does not have a current promotion running.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Mobile App and Website\n\nWealthsimple Invest\u2019s app is streamlined and easy to use. It allows you to monitor your investments, fund your account, and contact the financial advising team easily. It is rated at 4.6 stars on the Apple App Store and 4.4 stars on the Google Play Store for Android users.\n\nRBC InvestEase doesn\u2019t have its own app. Instead, you can view your account and make transfers from your RBC bank account using the RBC banking app or RBC online banking site. The RBC Mobile app has a spectacular 4.8 star rating on the Apple App Store, but a low 2.2 stars on the Google Play Store.\n\nIf you\u2019re already an RBC customer, this all-in-one app could be seen as an advantage (one less site or app to check!). If you\u2019re only with RBC for the robo-advisor, it\u2019s not ideal (and there are better choices out there). RBC\u2019s app and online platform are fine, but when investing is just one of many features, it\u2019s easy for finer details to fall by the wayside.\n\nWealthsimple vs. RBC: Customer Service\n\nBoth RBC InvestEase and Wealthsimple Invest have a team of accredited portfolio advisors on call by phone or email.\n\nCertified Portfolio Advisors are fiduciaries, which means that they\u2019re legally required to give you advice in your own best interests. Not all \u201cfinancial advisors\u201d are registered, and you can have confidence in the ones who are.\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking at robo-advisors or Canadian online brokers, having real people you can talk to is not a given. The teams of actual accredited humans on call for Wealthsimple and RBC are just one reason why they\u2019re among the best robo-advisors in Canada.\n\nWealthsimple or RBC?

            "content": "The U.S. bank stocks have been fairing incredibly well in recent weeks and months, thanks in part to a very solid round of quarterly earnings. Indeed, it\u2019s tough to tell if the big banks are really ready to sustain gains that could extend for another few years. Either way, it\u2019s hard not to be encouraged by the latest banking rally, which many investors seem to think is worth banking on. As the financial sector gets a bit of the lift, questions linger as to whether the same benefits will work their way into those battered shares of Canadian banks.\n\nCan Canadian bank stocks follow suit?\n\nIndeed, Canadian bank stocks have been hurting for quite some time. And while many of them have newfound momentum and a renewed sense of optimism going into the new year, investors should be ready to play the longer-term game. At the end of the day, Canadian banks aren\u2019t guaranteed to rocket higher just because their peers south of the border have. With a unique slate of headwinds and other uncertainties surrounding the Canadian economy, there\u2019s a realistic chance that Canada\u2019s banks could stay stuck for longer.\n\nEither way, one major reason to give Canada\u2019s banks the benefit of the doubt is the incredibly low valuation metrics. Indeed, Canadian banks are not only cheap, they could be absurdly cheap, especially if we move into an environment that sees growth (and not provisions) become the theme that analysts and investors look for when earnings results come due.\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll check in on a Canadian bank stock that may very well be next up to the plate as the bank stocks look to make up for lost time and perhaps power their way to brand-new all-time highs. Indeed, it has been a while since we\u2019ve viewed the big Canadian banks as leaders in the stock market. Either way, their high dividends and return to growth could make them fantastic pick-ups in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada: A great 2024 market beater to bank on in 2025\n\nSpeaking of soaring banks, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) shares are already off to the races. In fact, they\u2019ve been surging since the lows were hit back in late 2023. Undoubtedly, it was tough to buy just about any bank stock back then. With RY stock up nearly 60% from its 2023 depths, investors wonder if there\u2019s even more gain in store for 2025. Indeed, RY stock is already up a TSX Index-beating 31.3% over the past year.\n\nThat\u2019s a return that will be tough to replicate. Either way, the stock has a nice dividend yield of 3.23% (it\u2019s below-average for the Canadian banks, but it is subject to impressive growth) alongside a modest 15.61 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.\n\nSure, Royal Bank is not the cheapest Canadian bank in the basket. Arguably, it\u2019s the priciest. However, if you want quality, you\u2019ve got to pay for it. In the case of RY, I think the premium isn\u2019t all too high, given the brighter road ahead and the bank\u2019s distinct advantages over peers.",

But in his initial batch of economic announcements, China was omitted from tariff plans which only targeted Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent levies from Feb 1.\n\nThe combination of a bearish positioning going into a second Trump administration and the softer-than-feared stance on tariffs has been enough to bolster assets, and JPMorgan Chase sees room for additional relief for currencies such as the forint and South Africa\u2019s rand.\n\n\u201cInitial indications of a more targeted approach to tariffs help contain left-tail risks,\u201d the bank\u2019s strategists including Saad Siddiqui and Tania Escobedo Jacob wrote in a note on Thursday. \u201cEMFX should well trade with a \u2018no news is good news\u2019 bias.\u201d\n\nThe Malaysian ringgit climbed more than 1 per cent on Friday to the highest since November, the biggest gainer in Asia.\n\nStill, investors remain wary as the uncertainty over US policies remains high. While JPMorgan\u2019s gauge of emerging-market currency volatility has eased, it remains at its highest since August.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump used a speech at Davos to threaten more widespread tariffs on goods not manufactured in the US. A survey by HSBC Holdings showed that 58 per cent of fund managers helping oversee US$343 billion in developing-nation assets were bearish on EM currencies in December, up from 10 per cent in September. And the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows hedge funds are most bearish on Mexican peso since April 2023.\n\n\u201cEM FX has been given a reprieve for now,\u201d said Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Singapore. \u201cHowever, the threat of a resumption of trade wars will limit too much appreciation for EM currencies.\u201d BLOOMBERG",

            "content": "Nortel Networks, the first to challenge RBC\u2019s dominance\n\nIn the late 90s, you didn't need to know much about stocks or tech to be making money in the stock market. The dot com boom was a rising tide that lifted all boats, even if some of those boats could barely be called a liferaft. In Canada, Nortel Networks surpassed Royal Bank of Canada to become the largest company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) between 1998 - 1999 and, at one point, this single company had a valuation that represented about one third of the value of all companies listed on the TSX. With a valuation of nearly $400 Billion in the year 2000, Nortel was massive when compared to RBC, which had a valuation of around $20 Billion at the time. But, like many other dot com companies, Nortel's success came to an end swiftly. Just two years after it's peak, Nortel's valuation was sitting at a mere $5 Billion, leaving heavy losses for many investors in the company.\n\nSource: Investing.com . I wish I could get you a nice chart of Nortel market capitalization, but the data for this delisted company is extremely difficult to pin down.\n\nUnlike Nortel, RBC has continued to grow in the Canadian economy and is currently the largest publicly traded company in Canada. Few other companies have grown to test RBC's Market Capitalization over the years and many have met the same fate as Nortel, which has lead to what is called the RBC Curse. The Curse, it is said, is that any company that overtakes RBC as the largest publicly traded company is doomed for failure with nothing but economic losses and light pocketed investors in their future.\n\nThe March of Valeant Pharmaceuticals\n\nConsider the fate of Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Having grown rapidly through a strategy of pharmacy acquisitions from 2010 - 2015, Valeant surpased RBC to became the most valuable company in Canada in 2015. This title was short lived as later in 2015, a researcher (and Valeant short seller) with Citron Research published a document that claimed that Valeant was recording false sales and, through its network of pharmacies, pushing more expensive drugs. Later on, Valeant was also caught up in criticism of its pricing strategy for drugs - yes, the same type of scheme that Martin Skreli, the infamous finance \u2018Bro\u2019 who purchased the $1 million dollar Wu-Tang Clan album, was involved in and played a part in his criminal conviction.\n\nThe stock price of Valeant Pharmaceuticals dropped more than 90%. The company was so tainted by the scandal that it was later force to change its name to Bausch Health (Ticker BHC) in order to distance itself from the public image of Valeant's crash. It was with the crash of Valeant Pharmaceuticals that the story of the RBC Curse - the idea that any company that overtakes Royal Bank as the largest public company in Canada is doomed to fail - was solidified in the psyche of Canadian finance.\n\nShopify\u2019s first round\n\nBy 2020, with the RBC Curse well-established as lore in financial circles, when another company started to challenge RBC's valuation for the top spot as Canada's largest company, many including myself, looked upon the situation with curiosity. Shopify's rapid growth in 2020 and 2021 caught the attention of all those who closely watch the Canadian economy. The tech economy was hot and Shopify promised to be changing the game for online retailers all lead by a charismatic leader, Tobias Lutke.\n\nBut, alas, Shopify's crash in late 2021 came as the broader environment around tech companies shifted for the worse. Google, Facebook, and Amazon all layed off thousands of employees as the COVID-19 pandemic started to wane. Furthermore, central banks began to raise interest rates in order to fight high inflation caused by an overheated economy and the era of cheap money that fuelled the tech industry came to an end. The RBC curse seemed to have struck again and it seemed that Shopify was bound to go down as just the latest victim.\n\nShopify\u2019s return\n\nYet its crash from 2021 highs was not to be the end of the story of Shopify. As I type this, it is January 2025 and Shopify\u2019s story is not over. In fact, the company appears to be back stronger than ever. The value of the company sits at around CAD $200 Billion compared to the value of RBC, which is around CAD $250 Billion. The company appears set to grow to overcome RBC as the largest public company in the Canadian economy. Perhaps the crash was all that the company needed to shake off the RBC curse and realign itself to take the top spot in Canada? Or, perhaps this is just another momentary challenge and one more data point to keep the story of the RBC curse alive a bit longer.\n\nCould this mark a regime shift in Canada?\n\nOkay, if this sounded a bit like I was trying to make the market valuations of companies in Canada feel a little bit like a horse race, a little bit more exciting than numbers and charts, I\u2019m guilty as charged. It\u2019s fun to think that there could be something like a curse that all companies that overtake The Royal Bank as largest public company in Canada are doomed to failure.\n\nSadly, for writers like I, there is no curse and this is just an interesting way to look at a handful of snapshots of the Canadian marketplace. Companies grow, mature, and decline. Sometimes this happens over many decades, and sometimes it happens rapidly. However, what is a truly interesting view is that should Shopify grow to become the largest public company in Canada and sustain that level, this could usher in a change in the economy itself. For many, many years, Canada\u2019s economy has vacillated between that of a petro-state, its success intimately linked to the world price for oil, and that of a haven for international money to be parked in real estate and financed by a small club of banks that are referred to as \u201cthe big 5\u201d.\n\nCanada\u2019s economy has struggled with diversification for decades and perpetually lagging productivity in the country continues to worsen. Perhaps this is just hope? Hope that Canada can transform from an economy that solely pulls minerals from the ground, cuts trees from the forest, and sells them abroad. There is certainly nothing wrong with any of those industries and they are absolutely a necessary part of the economy. However, Shopify gives me hope as a Canadian, that innovation is part of who we are and we can diversify the economy into one that isn\u2019t eternally dominated by banks.",

EXPLORE NOW\n\nWhat to know about secured credit cards\n\nA secured credit card works like a regular credit card but requires a security deposit, which reduces the risk to the lender.\n\nWhat is a secured credit card?\n\nA secured credit card requires the cardholder to provide a cash security deposit to open an account. The card\u2019s credit limit is typically the same as the security deposit. So, for example, if your deposit is $500, you\u2019ll have a $500 credit limit.\n\nThe deposit acts as a form of collateral, reducing the risk for the credit card provider. If the secured credit cardholder doesn\u2019t make their payments, the issuer can use the deposit to pay off the debt. This is why secured credit cards tend to be easier to qualify for than unsecured, regular credit cards \u2014 making them ideal for people with poor credit or no credit history.\n\nWhen used responsibly and paid on time and in full, a secured credit card can build your credit. If your score is high enough, you\u2019ll likely qualify for a traditional unsecured credit card that does not require a deposit.\n\nIf you use the card responsibly, and build up a healthy credit history with a higher score, you may then be eligible for a standard, unsecured credit card. The issuer will pay back the security deposit in full (as long as there are no outstanding payments) when the account is closed.\n\nEach secured credit card provider may have different minimum and maximum deposit requirements. Minimum deposits can be as low as $50, and maximum deposits do not typically exceed $10,000.\n\nSecured vs. unsecured credit cards\n\nFor the most part, secured credit cards work very similarly to unsecured ones. You use the card to purchase items, up to the credit limit, and ideally pay back the balance at the end of the billing cycle.\n\nThe biggest difference between the two is that a secured credit card requires a cash deposit, which typically sets the credit limit. The deposit acts as collateral in case you fail to pay your debt. While you can\u2019t use the deposit to pay your balance each month, the issuer will return it when you close the account in good standing.\n\nAnother difference between the two is the perks. Unsecured credit cards often come with benefits, perks and rewards not typically offered by secured cards.\n\nWhether a secured or unsecured credit card is the best fit for you will essentially come down to your credit report and score. Generally, you can expect to need a score of at least 660 to qualify for an unsecured credit card.\n\nIf you have a history of bad credit, it will be challenging to find an issuer willing to give you an unsecured credit card that doesn\u2019t come with steep fees and charge high rates of interest.\n\nCheck your credit score to see what option is best for you.\n\nHow does a secured credit card work?\n\nA secured credit card works like a regular, unsecured credit card once you\u2019ve been approved and provided the required security deposit. You can use a secured credit card to make in-person and online purchases and then pay off your balance in full, or make the minimum payment each month.\n\nAs with a traditional credit card, unpaid balances typically accrue interest, so it\u2019s a good idea to pay off the bill in full when it\u2019s due.\n\nThe issuer usually reports your payments to Canada\u2019s credit bureaus, just like standard credit cards. As long as you use your card responsibly and make your payments on time, your credit score will rise. If boosting your credit score is your goal, make sure your payments are being reported \u2014 not all issuers report to the credit bureaus.\n\nWhat is the security deposit for a secured credit card?\n\nThe security deposit for a secured credit card can vary widely depending on the issuer. With few exceptions, most secured credit cards in Canada require a deposit of at least $50.\n\nWhat is the credit limit for a secured credit card?\n\nTypical credit limits\n\nCredit limits vary with each provider, but you can start with as little as a $50 security deposit and can go up to as much as $10,000.\n\nHow to increase credit limits\n\nEach provider may have a different method for increasing your credit limit. As long as it falls within the maximum allowable amount, you should be able to increase your limit if you can provide the security funds.\n\nMaking payments\n\nAs you would with a regular, unsecured credit card, you will want to pay your bill in full and on time. To keep your account in good standing, you\u2019ll need to pay at least the required minimum payment each billing cycle.\n\nRemember, the security deposit acts as collateral, and won\u2019t pay off charges to the card. The deposit is only used if the cardholder defaults on payments.\n\nTypical secured credit card rates\n\nSecured credit card interest rates vary, from as low as 14.90%, as with Home Trust\u2019s low-interest option, to as high as 29.99%.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Nerdy Tip Use our credit card interest calculator to see how much you\u2019ll owe if you don\u2019t pay off your balance.\n\nHow to get a secured credit card\n\nThe process for getting a secured card is similar to getting any credit card.\n\nSecured cards are typically aimed at people who are just entering adulthood or are new to Canada and need to build up a credit history. They are also intended for people who would have a hard time getting an unsecured card, like those with bad credit. For that reason, secured credit cards are easier to get than unsecured credit cards.\n\nEligibility\n\nCredit card issuers tend to be much more flexible with their eligibility requirements for a secured card.\n\nCredit score needed for a secured card\n\nBecause secured cards are designed for people with no or bad credit, an issuer may not even consider an applicant\u2019s credit score. Many secured credit card issuers will approve applicants regardless of their credit scores.\n\nIncome requirements\n\nSecured credit cards do not tend to have strict or clearly stated income requirements.\n\nUsually, you just need to be able to provide the security deposit and can\u2019t be in bankruptcy.\n\nOther requirements\n\nAside from providing a minimum amount for a security deposit, you generally need to be a Canadian resident who is the age of majority in your territory or province.\n\nHow to choose the right secured credit card\n\nBriefly, here are some things to consider when choosing a credit card.\n\nCredit bureau reporting\n\nThe main point of having a secured credit card for most users is to build a credit history and improve their credit score, so it\u2019s important to ensure that the issuer is reporting payments to a credit bureau.\n\nAffordable deposit\n\nCarefully consider your budget and how much money you can afford to tie up indefinitely as a security deposit. Do you have enough savings in your emergency fund to cover both the security deposit and an unexpected expense, for example?\n\nLow or no fees\n\nAnnual fees can vary significantly among issuers, so be sure to check the cost of each card when making your selection.\n\nAbility to switch to unsecured\n\nOne reason to consider going with a credit card issuer that also has unsecured credit card options is that it can be easier to switch to another type of credit card after you\u2019ve built up your credit.\n\nApplication process for a secured credit card\n\nSome major banks in Canada don\u2019t advertise secured credit cards on their websites. They may offer secured cards to some applicants, but you must generally contact the bank to apply.\n\nSome smaller banks and alternative financial institutions that issue dedicated secured credit cards allow prospective cardholders to apply online, and many offer instant or guaranteed approval.\n\nThe process is the same as applying for an unsecured credit card. You simply hit the \u201capply\u201d icon on the website and follow the steps listed, which will go something like this:\n\nReview the terms and conditions and accept them. Provide personal information like your name and social insurance number (SIN). Employment details. Indicate whether you want to include an authorized user. Submit your application. If approved, pay your deposit. The method by which you pay the deposit varies among banks, but may include mailing a cheque or completing a bank transfer.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t approved, make sure to wait about six months before applying for another card as credit card issuers view multiple card applications in quick succession as a sign of financial distress.\n\nWhere to get a secured credit card in Canada\n\nMost major banks in Canada don\u2019t offer dedicated secured credit cards \u2013 or at least, they don\u2019t advertise that they do. You can contact them to ask about secured card options that might fit your needs, but you\u2019ll generally have more luck with smaller banks or alternative financial institutions that carry dedicated secured credit cards.\n\nWho offers secured credit cards?\n\nFinancial institution Secured credit card TD Canada Trust Secured cards are available but require an in-branch appointment to apply. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) None available. Credit-building options are available for newcomers, students, and others. Contact RBC directly for details. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) None available. Credit-building options are available for newcomers, students, and others. Contact CIBC directly for details.

Neo Financial Secured Neo Mastercard.\n\nCredit union secured credit cards\n\nSome credit unions in Canada offer secured credit cards, such as Vancity and ATB. If you live within an area they operate, you can contact them for more details.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of secured credit cards\n\nAdvantages\n\nAbility to build credit and improve your score.\n\nEasy to get, even for those with no or bad credit.\n\nSome may offer rewards like cash back.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nCash security deposit is required. You won\u2019t get back your security deposit funds back until you close the account, which can be a significant financial burden.\n\nMonthly or annual fees may apply.\n\nHigh rates of interest may apply.\n\nWhat to ask before using a secured credit card\n\nHow do I add money to a secured credit card?\n\nThe method to add money to a secured card varies among providers. It may just be a matter of contacting your credit card issuer and telling them you want an increase, then providing the funds. Or you may be able to increase your limit online with an e-transfer.\n\nShould I pay my secured credit card early?\n\nA secured credit card can be a helpful tool to build your credit history and score, but only if used wisely. For this reason, it\u2019s a good idea to make payments in full and on time each month to avoid interest charges and improve your score.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t have to make payments early, it may be a good habit to adopt if you tend to be late or forget to make payments. You may also consider setting up automatic payments or alerts when your balance is due.\n\nHow long should I keep a secured credit card?\n\nIt\u2019s advisable to keep a secured credit card until you start to see an improvement in your score and feel confident that you can successfully apply for an unsecured credit card. It\u2019s a good idea to aim for a score of at least 660 before applying for an unsecured card for the greatest chance of qualifying and to get the best terms.\n\nWhat happens if I close my secured credit card?\n\nIf you cancel your secured card, you\u2019ll get your full security deposit back as long as you don\u2019t have any pending charges or a balance remaining on the card.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to secured credit cards?\n\nUnsecured credit cards for bad credit are very difficult to successfully apply for without credit history or a strong credit score. If you have a history of bad credit, it will be challenging to find an issuer willing to give you an unsecured credit card that doesn\u2019t come with high fees and charge high rates of interest.\n\nPrepaid cards are another handy way to make purchases without cash. Because you have to load them with your own money, prepaid cards can also help you curb spending and avoid accumulating high-interest debt.However, unlike unsecured credit cards, your transactions are not typically reported to credit bureaus. That means prepaid cards can\u2019t help you improve your credit score or establish a credit history.\n\nStudent credit cards are available for students who don\u2019t have a built-up credit history, so eligibility requirements are more relaxed. While some student cards are available only to those enrolled in a college or university, most are technically available to anyone.\n\nCredit cards for Canadian newcomers are designed for recent arrivals who don\u2019t yet have a Canadian credit history. Many banks offer unsecured cards through newcomer packages, often featuring no annual fees, rewards, and travel perks.\n\nWhat Reddit has to say\n\nTo find the best secured cards in Canada, NerdWallet\u2019s credit card experts review numerous options available on the market. But our Nerds know it can also be helpful to hear what everyday cardholders think. We took to Reddit to find out what users are saying across multiple threads.\n\nRedditors mostly agree with NerdWallet\u2019s secured card picks. As of this writing, Redditors suggest that some of the best secured cards are the Secured Neo Mastercard and Home Trust Secured Visa, both of which made our list. They also recommend the KOHO Prepaid Mastercard, which technically isn\u2019t a secured card but a prepaid card. However, it functions similarly to a secured card if you pay for the optional Credit Building feature. Some Redditors also favor cards that didn\u2019t make our list, like the Capital One Guaranteed Secured Mastercard. THE REDDIT THREAD",

            "content": "iStockphoto/SARINYAPINNGAM\n\nA couple of Canadian banks, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and TD Bank, have signed onto settlements that resolve a proposed class action that arose following regulatory investigations in Europe and the U.S. into alleged collusion in a segment of the over-the-counter (OTC) bond markets.\n\nIn 2015, regulatory authorities in Europe and the U.S. launched investigations into suspected manipulation in the global market for supranational, sub-sovereign and agency bonds (SSA bonds).\n\nUltimately, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) closed their investigations without alleging any wrongdoing, but European regulators alleged that four banks \u2014 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole and Credit Suisse \u2014 breached competition laws.\n\nAnd in 2021, three of the banks were fined a combined \u20ac28.5 million. Deutsche Bank was granted immunity for cooperating with the investigation.\n\nIn the wake of the regulators\u2019 investigations, investor class actions were filed, first in the U.S., and later in Canada, alleging that 11 of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions improperly shared trading information in an effort to rig the price of SSA bonds.\n\nIn the U.S., three banks \u2014 Bank of America, HSBC and Deutsche Bank \u2014 reached a US$95.5-million settlement of the investor class action against them. But in March 2020, a U.S. district court dismissed the claims against various other banks that had been named in that suit.\n\nNow, the proposed class action in Canada \u2014 which sought $1 billion plus punitive damages \u2014 has been settled for just $6.5 million.\n\nTwo of the banks settled for just over $2 million in 2020, and settlements with the nine others, including RBC and TD, were approved by the Federal Court of Canada in November 2024.\n\nThe nine settling banks, which denied the allegations, will pay a combined $4.2 million to resolve the case.\n\nThe bulk of the settlement money, or about $2.2 million, is coming from Deutsche Bank. RBC and TD, which were not implicated in any of the regulatory investigations, are paying $250,000 each; while the other banks are paying between $150,000 and $500,000 each to settle the case.\n\n\u201cThe financial terms of settlement are, as the plaintiffs acknowledge, relatively modest. But in the context of the likelihood of success and the costs and risks of going forward to a certification motion, the financial terms are more than satisfactory,\u201d the federal court said in its ruling approving the settlements.\n\nAfter legal fees and other expenses, the most recent settlements will leave $3.1 million to be shared among investors.\n\nHowever, that money will largely be shared by institutional investors, as they are the primary participants in the global SSA bond markets, and participation in the settlement is restricted to investors who made SSA bond trades worth at least $10 million.\n\nFor investors that qualify under the settlement, their payouts will be pro-rated based on the total value of transactions that investors were involved with in SSA bonds in the years covered by the settlement, from 2005 to 2015.\n\nThe deadline to participate in the settlement is July 25.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters Subscribe",

We're advising Canadians to use the same approach for their financial health and lean into the expertise of an advisor.\"\n\nAdditional anxieties raised by Canadians in responses to the RBC poll:\n\nHalf (50%) are spending all their income on essential bills and expenses\n\nAlmost half are living \"bill to bill\" and that they have dipped into their emergency fund or retirement savings, to help cope with rising costs (47% each)\n\nOver one quarter (27%) are taking on debt to cover monthly basic needs\n\nAlmost a quarter (23%) have asked family for money or moved in with relatives to make ends meet\n\nWith finances stretched thin, Canadians are also expressing apprehension about their ability to handle any unplanned costs. A majority (60%) are worried they don't have enough money to cover unexpected expenses today, with 44% saying this is their biggest financial risk over the next year.\n\nAll the more reason to speak with an advisor, added Bannon. \"We have over 12,000 advisors across the country who can meet with you \u2013 in one of our bank branches, online or over the phone \u2013 to help you explore solutions you may not even know are possible, including options for managing debt and ongoing expenses, as well as dealing with unexpected financial hardships.\"\n\nTo help Canadians rebuild a strong financial foundation and take control of their long-term financial wellbeing, RBC makes a vast array of financial advice and expertise freely available to Canadians on its My Money Matters digital hub.

            "content": "From phishing to romance scams to investment fraud, the most popular cybercrimes today reflect scams that have been running for decades. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, criminals have new technology on hand to make these scams easier to execute and tougher to detect.\n\nThe emergence and evolution of artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. It has been rapidly adopted by individuals, businesses, governments and educational institutions. And, by fraudsters. While this emerging technology has many potential benefits such as summarizing data and enhancing customer service, its drawbacks include its use to advance, enhance and expand cyberattacks.\n\nHere are some of the most commons scams affecting individuals and businesses today, and the effect of AI on their effectiveness and impact.\n\nSocial engineering attacks\n\nSocial engineering is the art of using psychological manipulation to trick people into making security mistakes or giving away confidential information. Social engineering tactics are used in the most common and successful scams, including phishing, romance and investment scams, covered here. Preying on human nature\u2019s inclination to trust, social engineering has always been one of the most common and effective ways a fraudster can gain access to sensitive information. When they layer on the power of AI, scams become even more believable and successful. Here\u2019s how:\n\nHuman-like interaction : Artificial intelligence can imitate the tone, style and content of genuine communication, such as an email, phone call, chatbot or even a video call.\n\nDeep fakes : AI can impersonate a human with high accuracy and trick people into revealing sensitive information, carrying out financial transactions or spreading misinformation.\n\nVoice synthesis: Cyber criminals can gather audio data from people sourced from online interviews, customer service calls or videos on social media sites. Using AI-powered voice synthesis tools, they can accurately mimic the tone, cadence and pronunciation of real people.\n\nPhishing scams\n\nPhishing is a common scam designed to trick individuals into disclosing personal or financial information for the purpose of financial fraud or identity theft. A typical phishing email will give its recipient a fake reason, such as a security breach or a contest, to make them click a link, fill out a form or share sensitive details about themselves or their accounts.\n\nPreviously, phishing emails were easier to identify, if you knew the signs. Grammatical errors and unnatural language were clear giveaways that an email that appeared to be sent from a legitimate organization, was in fact a fake. With advancements in AI technology, including tools like ChatGPT, it\u2019s not as easy to identify these red flags.\n\nUsing AI, cybercriminals can create more in-depth, grammatically correct emails, making them harder to detect as fraudulent. Moreover, by pulling information about their target from a range of social media platforms, as well as stolen details they may have acquired through a data breach, fraudsters can also create content that is more targeted and personalized, making it look that much more authentic.\n\nIn addition to the quality of the scam, AI has made it easier for fraudsters to increase the quantity of scams. With AI\u2019s ability to scan the internet in seconds for data, fraudsters can cast a wider net for their phishing scams, but with more specific details about their targets.\n\nRomance scams\n\nRomance scams have become increasingly prevalent and effective as AI has become more sophisticated and accessible. According to a Norton report, online dating scams increased 72% in the past year, with nearly a third of those targeted been catfished by fake personas (catfishing is when someone uses a fake identity to trick their target into believing they\u2019re in a real online friendship or romance with them).\n\nUsing AI, romance scammers can:\n\nGenerate compelling messages that sound like genuine conversation\n\nUse face-swapping technology and voice simulators in video calls, making their target believe they are speaking with a real person\n\nUse AI to quickly scan the internet about their targets, enabling them to tailor their messages to their interests and situation\n\nCreate entirely new identities with AI software, complete with a voice, face and accent\n\nInvestment scams\n\nA recent experiment carried out by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) revealed that AI-enhanced scams pose significantly more risk to investors compared to conventional scams, again using techniques that convince investors into believing something that simply isn\u2019t true. In the investing world, AI can be used to:\n\nRapidly spread fake information about an investment opportunity\n\nCreate a fake investment opportunity\n\nProduce deceptive telemarketing through voice cloning technology\n\nImpersonate celebrities to create fake endorsements\n\nCreate frenzied situations that lead to misinformed, emotionally driven or impulsive investing decisions\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as AI\u2019s capabilities have gained wider recognition among fraudsters, there has been a rise in investment scams promoting AI-driven trading systems that claim to \u201cnever lose\u201d or offer \u201cguaranteed returns.\u201d These schemes have deceived investors and led to significant financial losses.\n\nGrandparent scam\n\nThe grandparent scam was one of the top 10 frauds based on dollar loss in 2023, scamming Canadians out of more than $11 million. The scam involves a fraudster who poses as a loved one \u2013 typically a grandchild \u2013 who claims to be hurt or in trouble, and in need of money immediately.\n\nBecause scammers can now use AI to analyze a small clip of audio and clone a person\u2019s voice, accent and intonation, they can call a loved one and genuinely sound like a grandchild in trouble, making this scam even more effective.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nThe availability, adaptability and evolution of AI has made it easier for fraudsters to trick targets out of money and information. Some of the tried-and-true defense strategies no longer apply, which means people and businesses must find new ways to protect themselves. Here are some tips:\n\nLook for inconsistencies in tone: Whether in an email, phone call or video call, stay alert for phrases that don\u2019t follow the tone of the conversation.\n\nWatch movements on a video call: If the \u201cperson\u201d on the other end of the call is holding themselves particularly still, it could be a sign that they\u2019re using face-swapping technology that doesn\u2019t hold up when they move or turn\n\nKeep family and friends up to date: If using a dating site, keep others in the loop about the people you\u2019re connecting with \u2013 especially if a conversation or request seems strange. They may have better perspective to spot a red flag\n\nAlways remain skeptical when faced with an out-of-ordinary request, particularly when it comes to divulging information or sending money\n\nThe good news is that while AI is being used by fraudsters to enhance their tactics, it is also being used in defense against scams. Cyber security companies are using AI to identify and thwart attacks more quickly and more widely, and some dating sites are using AI moderators that can effectively spot fake personas. Remember, reporting cyber threats, scams or attempts plays an important role in helping to defend against them \u2013 if you come across a cyber scam, saying something can help protect yourself and others in the future.\n\nIt is critical that we all become more Cyber Aware and safeguard our online activities.

            "content": "In Canada, many financial institutions accept and safeguard your cash deposits while also facilitating a secure way to transfer and withdraw funds whenever you need. They also provide investment products, mortgages and other forms of credit for both individuals and businesses.\n\nWhy are financial institutions important?\n\nBanks, credit unions and other types of financial institutions are more than just places for you to park your money. They offer products and services that help Canadians save for future goals and secure loans to pursue homeownership or entrepreneurship \u2014 ultimately boosting the economy.\n\nTypes of financial institutions in Canada\n\n1. Big Six Banks\n\nPerhaps the most well-known financial institutions in Canada \u2014 and also the largest \u2014 are the \u201cBig Six.\u201d TD Bank and RBC top the chart with over 2 Trillion in assets at the end of 2024.\n\nThese six banks, along with a number of other mid-sized financial institutions, are known as Schedule I banks \u2014 Canadian-incorporated domestic banks, governed by the Bank Act and regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI).\n\nAll these major banks are Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) members. That means, in the unlikely event of banks\u2019 failure, your eligible bank accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and registered savings accounts are covered by CDIC\u2019s deposit insurance.\n\n2. Credit unions\n\nCredit unions are financial co-operatives that provide many of the same services as traditional banks, including savings and chequing accounts, mortgages, investments and insurance. Unlike banks, though, they operate on a not-for-profit basis and distribute any profits or dividends back to their customers \u2014 who are also known as credit union members.\n\nMany credit unions across Canada are involved in their communities via initiatives like scholarships and donations. Saskatchewan-based Innovation Credit Union and Conexus Credit Union are known for providing community support through grants, scholarships and sponsorships.\n\n3. Caisses populaires\n\nOperating on a not-for-profit basis like credit unions, caisses populaires offer members a variety of personal and business banking, investment, lending and insurance products. The members get to vote in their annual general meetings and elect the board of directors and officers.\n\nCaisses populaires are located in francophone jurisdictions of Canada and, along with credit unions, are often regulated under provincial legislation. In Ontario, for example, they are governed by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) under the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act.\n\n4. Online banks\n\nOnline banks, also known as digital banks, have become more popular in Canada in recent years. Many of them provide services similar to bricks-and-mortar banks, such as chequing and savings accounts, registered accounts, and, in some cases, mortgages and investments. Some also offer low or no-fee account options.\n\nIn Canada, many digital banks are affiliated with more traditional banks, credit unions or financial institutions. Canadian online banks include:\n\nManulife Bank (a federally regulated subsidiary of Manufacturers Life Insurance Company).\n\nSimplii Financial (owned by CIBC).\n\nMotive Financial (a division of Canadian Western Bank).\n\nAlterna Bank (a subsidiary of Alterna Savings and Credit Union).\n\nTangerine Bank (a subsidiary of Scotiabank).\n\nEQ Bank (owned by Equitable Bank).\n\nAdditionally, the online-only space includes \u201cneo banks\u201d \u2014 which are completely virtual financial institutions like Wealthsimple and Neo Financial. These fintech companies offer access to e-transfers, savings accounts, bill payments and credit cards exclusively through mobile apps or websites.\n\nAlthough these providers are not regulated as banks by OSFI, deposits held with many of them \u2014 such as EQ Bank and Tangerine \u2014 are covered by CDIC member institutions.\n\nHow to choose a financial institution\n\nWhen choosing a financial institution, look for the following traits and features to ensure your money is protected and you have the best solutions to meet your goals.\n\nProper accreditation\n\nBecause they\u2019re governed by OSFI, federally regulated financial institutions must follow specific guidelines, which include:\n\nCapital adequacy requirements.\n\nAccountancy standards.\n\nLarge exposure limits.\n\nSound business and financial practices, including corporate governance.\n\nCredit unions and caisses populaires regulated by the FSRA must also uphold a statutory standard of conduct, maintain adequate liquidity and strong capital reserves.\n\nVerify if your chosen financial institution meets these governance criteria by reading objective reviews, annual reports and relevant news articles. You can also seek feedback from friends and family about their banking experience.\n\nDeposit insurance\n\nEligible deposits at more than 80 CDIC member institutions are insured up to $100,000 in the event of bank failure.\n\nHowever, coverage from FSRA for credit unions and caisse populaires varies by account type. Members\u2019 non-registered deposits are insured for up to $250,000, and registered deposits have unlimited coverage.\n\nIf you choose a financial institution that holds customer funds in trust with a CDIC member institution, be sure to read the fine print before signing up to confirm your savings are protected.\n\nConvenience\n\nAbout 77% Canadians bank virtually and among them 30% use app banking, according to the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) [1] .\n\nWhile banking preferences are individual \u2014 some people may prefer meeting with a financial advisor, while others may favour entirely online services. So, check if your chosen financial institution offers the services you need, be it digital experiences like virtual cheque deposit and contactless pay, or convenient branch and ATM access.\n\nFeatures, accounts and services\n\nWhile the number of services or account types a bank provides doesn\u2019t reflect the level of quality it offers, having more options can be beneficial when new financial needs arise.\n\nSome financial institutions specialize in serving certain groups, such as small businesses or regional communities. When reviewing your options, make sure that your chosen financial institution provides the services and account types that match your needs.\n\nFees\n\nBefore signing up with a bank, review the banking fees associated with your account \u2014 and if possible, see how you might avoid them. Look for bank accounts that include the type of transaction you\u2019re likely to use, ideally for low or no fees.\n\nMost major financial institutions provide basic account options for around $4 per month, as well as discounted or free accounts for youth, international and domestic students, senior citizens and newcomers to Canada, among others.",

These unprecedented waypoints have helped to decouple large- and small-cap return profiles\u2014much the same as during the tech bubble boom in the early 2000s\u2014helping to shape an unusual and powerful tailwind for large-cap stocks, which posted meaningfully above-average returns in four of the last five years. This dynamic has now built large-cap versus small-cap cumulative returns over recent years into a yawning gap.\n\nLong-term cumulative returns for large-cap and small-cap indexes\n\nThe line chart shows the cumulative quarterly returns relative to December 1994 levels of large-cap and small-cap equity indexes, through December 2024. Large-cap returns began to rise faster than small-cap returns around 2015, when cumulative returns for both indexes were roughly 500%, and the divergence has increased since then. The cumulative return of the large-cap index reached nearly 2200% in 2024, while the small-cap index return was roughly 1200%. Large-cap universe\n\nLarge-cap universe Small-cap universe Source \u2013 RBC Wealth Management, Bloomberg\n\nTaken at face value, this illustration is a bit misleading as we have seen near all-time highs in market concentration across a very narrow subset of names driven by the AI boom\u2014these are chiefly known as the \u201cMagnificent 7,\u201d which include: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Even when excluding the Magnificent 7 from the large-cap index returns, large-cap stocks have still outperformed their small-cap counterparts over recent years.\n\nMedium-term cumulative returns for large-cap, large-cap ex Magnificent 7, and small-cap indexes\n\nThe line chart shows cumulative returns for large-cap and small-cap equity indexes, and for the large-cap index without the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla) from March 2015 through December 2024. Large-cap returns have steadily outpaced small-cap returns over this time period. Large-cap cumulative returns in December 2024 were roughly 230%, and small-cap returns were roughly 100%. Large-cap returns without the Magnificent 7 were roughly 150%. Large-cap universe\n\nLarge-cap universe Large-cap universe ex Magnificent 7\n\nLarge-cap universe ex Magnificent 7 Small-cap universe Source \u2013 RBC Wealth Management, Bloomberg\n\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat \u2026 but it does rhyme\n\nLarge-cap cumulative return spreads of more than double that of small-cap counterparts is eerily reminiscent of the immense outperformance we saw for large caps during the tech bubble runup. Large-cap performance relative to small caps this cycle has mirrored the advance in performance. Unlike the tech bubble burst during the early 2000s\u2014driven in large part from a lack of earnings power which helped drive the collapse of the trade\u2014large-cap earnings today have continued to deliver and we see no signs of investor appetites for AI or other related investment abating anytime soon. That doesn\u2019t mean that this time won\u2019t see cumulative return spreads reset in a similar way to last time over the next several years, but they are likely to be spurred on by other less obvious drivers in addition to elevated investor expectations.\n\nCumulative return spreads during the tech bubble and AI boom\n\nLarge-cap minus small-cap cumulative returns (%)\n\nThe line chart compares the quarterly difference (spread) between the cumulative returns of large-cap and small-cap equity indexes during two historical periods: the tech bubble (1994-2006) and the AI boom (2020-2024). The returns spread during the tech bubble period increased from 4.9% in the first quarter to over 120% after 16 quarters before plateauing and then falling back to around parity after 44 quarters. Spreads during the AI boom have followed a similar upward path, increasing from around 27% to more than 120% after 20 quarters. Tech bubble (left)\n\nTech bubble (left) AI boom (right) Source \u2013 RBC Wealth Management, Bloomberg\n\nSo, what are they?\n\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A) along with initial public offerings (IPO) have historically been key drivers for overall small-cap index performance outside of earnings.\n\nLarge-cap company balance sheets hit an all-time record last quarter coming in at nearly $2.5 trillion with Financials sector companies holding nearly 50 percent of the total and Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Health Care, and Industrials names making up the bulk of the remainder. Despite large-cap company balance sheets being flush with cash, last year was the worst on record for small-cap M&A going back several decades. According to Bloomberg data, 2024 closed out the year with just 52 deals in the small-cap space for a cumulative total of $113.7 billion; this was worse than during the 2008 financial crisis where just 61 deals were closed. Since the U.S. Federal Reserve started raising rates at the beginning of 2022 we\u2019ve seen rate-sensitive sectors like Financials, Communication Services, and Real Estate have substantially fewer deals overall, corroborating the close tie between monetary policy and overall corporate risk-taking, irrespective of cash on hand.\n\nAs for small-cap IPO activity\u2014which also points to investor risk appetites\u20142024 marked the return to a \u201cnew normal\u201d; the year averaged just 31 deals and a scant $7 billion per quarter in value. Albeit up from 2023\u2019s anemic $7.7 billion in total for the year (the smallest amount raised in over three decades), pre-COVID-era small-cap listings were typically in the 60\u2013100 count and $15 billion\u2013$20 billion total ranges per year.\n\nThe turning of the tide\n\n2024 marked an about-face in monetary policy as the Fed started a fresh round of easing after a few years of tighter policy decisions\u2014intending to stamp out inflation driven by abundant cash and more than a decade of easy money policies\u2014and these changes helped spur the beginnings of \u201cgreen shoots\u201d in the small-cap IPO space during the year. 2025 could continue that trend and serve as a turning point as large caps look to spend cash hoards and as more deal-friendly administrators take the wheel. New appointments under the Trump administration for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice seem likely to be in place, quickly providing needed tailwinds to both deal activity (M&A) and IPOs for 2025 and beyond.\n\n2025 and beyond\n\nIn our view, tailwinds to small-cap stocks closing the gap to large include extremely elevated consensus earnings expectations for large caps (particularly amongst AI-related names), election risks fading, more M&A-friendly regulators set in place, easier Fed policy to reignite corporate risk-taking, and record cash hoards being put to good use. After years of underperformance relative to large-cap counterparts, we believe small caps seem poised to return to form.",

            "content": "Here are my top Canadian bank stock picks for January 2025 as the financial sector continues to outperform the broader market.\n\nCanadian bank stocks are proving once again why they\u2019re some of the most reliable investments on the TSX. Over the last year, the financial sector, especially bank stocks, has outpaced the broader market, as easing inflation, an improved borrowing environment, and strong housing market activity continued to boost investors\u2019 sentiments.\n\nWith their reliable dividends and a decades-long history of weathering economic volatility, I expect Canadian banks to continue rewarding investors in 2025. Let\u2019s take a look at two Canadian bank stocks that are top buys in January 2025.\n\nRoyal Bank stock\n\nUndoubtedly, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) could be one of the most reliable investments in 2025. After rallying by 31.2% in the last year, RY stock currently trades at $175.50 per share with a market cap of $248.3 billion, making it the largest bank in Canada. And its dependable 3.4% annualized dividend yield, with quarterly payouts, continues to attract income-focused investors.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 (ended in October), Royal Bank pleasantly surprised investors by achieving a record net profit of $16.2 billion, reflecting an 11% YoY (year-over-year) increase. Its adjusted net profits for the year of $17.4 billion also highlight the bank\u2019s exceptional performance, partly supported by its strategic acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada. This acquisition added $453 million to Royal Bank\u2019s profits and boosted its dominance in the Canadian banking sector.\n\nAs the largest Canadian bank continues to focus on diversified business segments, its wealth management earnings surged by 27% YoY in the latest fiscal year with the help of higher client assets and market appreciation. Similarly, Royal Bank\u2019s personal banking registered a 9% YoY earnings growth for the year, fueled by higher interest income.\n\nDespite facing higher provisions for credit losses due to macroeconomic pressures, Royal Bank continues to maintain a robust common equity tier-one ratio of 13.2%, well above regulatory requirements. In the latest fiscal year, the bank also returned $8.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. For long-term investors, RY\u2019s consistent returns and solid balance sheet make it a safe bank stock to buy now.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank stock\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) delivered an impressive 42.5% stock price gain in 2024, emerging as the strongest performer among Canada\u2019s top five banks. Currently trading at $90.97 per share with a market cap of $85.7 billion, it offers a compelling 4.3% annualized dividend yield with quarterly payouts.\n\nJust like Royal Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank also reported record results for its fiscal 2024 (ended in October), with a net annual profit climbing 13% YoY to $7.2 billion. Its fourth-quarter earnings alone showcased a solid 27% YoY jump in net profit to $1.88 billion with the help of higher deposit margins, volume growth, and efforts to improve efficiency.\n\nAs further reduction in interest rates in Canada and the United States may stimulate borrowing and economic activity in the coming quarters, Canadian Imperial Bank could benefit from these trends, which may help its stock continue soaring in 2025.",

            "content": "The recent exit of Canadian and U.S. banks from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) initiative highlights growing tensions between climate commitments and political pressures. With banks like TD, BMO, and Scotiabank prioritizing independent strategies, the financial sector faces mounting challenges in balancing sustainability goals with fossil fuel financing.\n\nThe NZBA initiative was established in 2021 to align global financial institutions with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals. With over 100 members representing nearly 40% of global banking assets, the alliance focused on reducing financed emissions, encouraging green investments, and increasing transparency.\n\nThese measures were designed to mobilize the financial sector\u2019s efforts toward a low-carbon economy. Sustainable financing is critical in this journey by enabling investments in renewable energy, carbon capture technologies, and reforestation projects.\n\nHowever, the recent departure of major banks from the NZBA threatens to undermine collective action, raising questions about the alliance\u2019s future and the overall momentum toward net zero.\n\nBalancing Green Goals and Fossil Fuel Financing: The Sustainability Dilemma\n\nIn a significant blow to the NZBA, five major Canadian banks\u2014TD Bank, Bank of Montreal (BMO), National Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), and Scotiabank\u2014announced their exit. This exodus highlights the growing tension between political realities and sustainability commitments.\n\nDespite leaving the alliance, these major banks reiterated their dedication to decarbonization and achieving net zero by 2050. Let\u2019s get to know each of the bank\u2019s climate goals and strategies.\n\nTD Bank\n\nTD Bank said it would continue working independently on its climate strategy, leveraging its expertise to support sustainable investments. The bank has already committed over $100 billion in sustainable finance initiatives and aims to achieve net zero emissions in its operations by 2030.\n\nHowever, critics argue that TD\u2019s significant funding for oil sands and fossil fuel projects undermines its climate claims. Between 2020 and 2023, TD Bank ranked among the top global financiers of fossil fuel expansion, allocating billions to high-emission projects. This dual approach raises questions about the bank\u2019s sincerity in addressing climate change.\n\nBank of Montreal\n\nBMO emphasized its ongoing efforts to support clients in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The bank\u2019s Climate Institute and its $330 billion sustainable finance goal by 2025 underscore its commitment to reducing emissions.\n\nThe bank has also been active in funding renewable energy projects, including large-scale wind and solar developments across North America. However, like its peers, BMO faces scrutiny for its continued investments in high-carbon industries, which critics argue contradict its net zero ambitions.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)\n\nCIBC highlighted its progress in climate risk management and financing renewable energy projects. In 2023 alone, the bank allocated $45 billion to sustainability-linked loans and green bonds.\n\nCIBC\u2019s partnerships with green technology firms have further bolstered its image as a climate-conscious institution. Nonetheless, its position as a major lender to oil and gas companies casts doubt on its overall impact on reducing emissions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada\n\nNBC stated it remains focused on aligning its financing activities with sustainability goals while meeting evolving regulatory standards. The bank has supported projects that advance clean energy and sustainable infrastructure. It has also invested in carbon offset programs to mitigate the environmental impact of its loan portfolio and reach the net zero goal, with the following interim targets.\n\nScotiabank\n\nScotiabank reaffirmed its dedication to financing decarbonization efforts, particularly in the oil and gas sector. It recently launched the Scotia Climate Change Transition Fund to provide capital for businesses adopting greener practices.\n\nThe fund focuses on sectors like renewable energy, green manufacturing, and sustainable agriculture. Remarking on its exit, Scotiabank spokesperson Katie Raskina stated in an email:\n\n\u201c\u2026[We] will continue to finance the transition and support our clients in implementing their sustainability strategies \u2014 this is the most important role that we can play.\u201d\n\nDespite these efforts, Canadian banks remain some of the largest financiers of fossil fuels. Data from 2024 shows TD Bank, RBC, BMO, and CIBC among the top 10 global financiers of oil, gas, and coal projects, which poses challenges to their sustainability narratives.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RBC) is now the only major Canadian bank still in the alliance, although its leadership has hinted at reconsidering membership. CEO Dave McKay recently stated that exiting NZBA would not diminish the bank\u2019s climate commitments.\n\nRBC has allocated over $500 billion toward sustainable finance and pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. However, RBC\u2019s role as a top lender to the fossil fuel industry has drawn widespread criticism, making it a focal point for climate activists.\n\nThe U.S. Banks\u2019 Departure and a Growing Trend\n\nThe NZAM also saw a wave of exits from U.S. banking giants in late 2023 and early 2024. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo are among the notable names that departed the alliance.\n\nThese exits coincide with Donald Trump\u2019s return to the presidency and intensified political opposition to climate finance. Republican-led states, such as Texas, have filed lawsuits against banks and asset managers, accusing them of prioritizing climate goals over economic interests.\n\nWhile these banks have distanced themselves from the NZBA, they continue to pursue independent sustainability strategies. For example, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets for 2030.\n\nHowever, their withdrawal underscores a broader challenge: balancing climate ambitions with political and financial pressures.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Global Climate Financing?\n\nThe departures from NZBA highlight a troubling trend that may hinder global progress toward net zero. These exits risk fragmenting efforts within the financial sector, which could delay the mobilization of the trillions of dollars required to combat climate change.\n\nAs shown in the chart, the world needs $7.4 trillion annually through 2030 under the 1.5\u00b0C net-zero scenario. The banking sector has a critical role in ensuring that this amount reaches the right climate projects and initiatives.\n\nUnified alliances like NZBA provide a framework for accountability, collaboration, and standardization, which are essential for large-scale impact. However, political resistance, legal challenges, and the perception of overregulation have created significant barriers.\n\nThe exits also send mixed signals to stakeholders, including investors and policymakers, about the financial sector\u2019s commitment to sustainability. Yet, the growing demand for green bonds, renewable energy financing, and decarbonization technologies presents opportunities for banks to demonstrate leadership.\n\nBy prioritizing transparency, innovation, and partnerships, financial institutions can continue to play a pivotal role in driving the global transition to a sustainable future.",

Dave McKay, RBC\u2019s chief executive officer, said in early January that pulling out of the NZBA \u201cdoesn\u2019t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.\u201d\n\nA representative for RBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on the status of its membership in the group.\n\nCanadian banks were some of the biggest financiers to oil, gas and coal companies in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, RBC, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nSince the beginning of December, the NZBA has been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan. The moves come as US President Donald Trump makes clear he\u2019ll seek to roll back Biden-era climate policies and instead promote a revival of fossil-fuel production. Trump\u2019s return has also emboldened the Republican Party in its ongoing attacks on climate finance, as states double down on bans and lawsuits.\n\nOther climate alliances have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among the asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying in NZAM had exposed it to \u201clegal inquiries.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, a net-zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid Republican litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100 , was hit by high-profile defections last year by the asset-management arms of Goldman, JPMorgan and Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

            "content": "HSBC Holdings is studying options for its consumer banking business in Australia including a potential sale as the bank looks to further slim down its operations, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe UK lender is likely to retain its commercial banking operations in Australia to serve its corporate clients globally, one of the sources said, who asked not to be identified as information is private. The consumer banking business \u2013 which consists of more than 40 branches and offices as well as its loan books and retail customers in Australia \u2013 could attract other major banks in the country, the source said.\n\nDeliberations are at an early stage and HSBC could decide against any deal, said the sources. A representative for HSBC declined to comment.\n\nAny divestment would be part of new chief executive officer Georges Elhedery\u2019s sweeping overhaul that aims to simplify the nearly 160-year-old bank\u2019s businesses. The bank recently created a new Eastern regional unit that included Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, and a Western market that included its non-ring-fenced bank in the UK, Europe and the Americas. Hong Kong and the UK will be standalone units.\n\nHSBC has also explored selling various businesses in Germany including its wealth-management, custody and fund administration units, Bloomberg News reported last year. The UK bank completed a sale of its Canadian business to Royal Bank of Canada for US$10.1 billion in 2024 following its exit from loss-making consumer operations in France and the US.\n\nHSBC established its operations in Australia in 1965 and obtained a commercial license in 1986, according to its website. In November, the lender reported A$31.8 billion (S$27 billion) in mortgages on its books, along with A$516 million in credit cards and A$538 million in other household loans, according to disclosures filed with the regulator.\n\nAustralia\u2019s consumer banking industry has been consolidating in recent years. In 2022, Citigroup sold its consumer unit in the country to National Australia Bank. BLOOMBERG",

Just across the border, New York State and Vermont offer a range of retail options, while no-sales-tax New Hampshire is a little farther afield but still an easy road trip. From designer outlets to unique boutiques, here are some of the top U.S. shopping destinations near Montreal to suit every style and taste.\n\nNew York State\n\nPlattsburg, NY\n\nJust over an hour\u2019s drive from Montreal is Plattsburgh, New York, where Canadians can find practical and budget-friendly U.S. shopping.\n\nChamplain Centre is a convenient and popular go-to from Montreal, with over 60 retailers ranging from outlet stores to specialty brands to designer boutiques. Here, you\u2019ll find Target and Kohl\u2019s, as well as an eight-screen movie theatre. Conveniently located off I-87 on Route 3, it\u2019s just a short drive from the border.\n\nConsumer Square is a budget-friendly option for Canadians. Right across the road from Champlain Centre, it has big box favourites such as Sam\u2019s Club, TJ Maxx and Ulta.\n\nAlbany, NY\n\nFor shoppers willing to drive an extra hour or so south, Albany offers a diverse retail scene, with sprawling centres and trendy shopping districts.\n\nCrossgates Mall is the second-largest mall in upstate New York, with over 250 retailers. You can find your favourite brands and more here, from fashion to electronics to home goods.\n\nColonie Center offers excellent shopping in a warm, welcoming atmosphere, featuring a lounge, fireplace and kids play zone to keep shoppers of all ages entertained and energized. Anchored by Whole Foods, Boscov\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, Colonie Center has many unique stores (such as the only L.L. Bean in New York\u2019s Capital region). Fun fact: It was the first enclosed mall in the U.S.\n\nLark Street has been called the \u201cGreenwich Village\u201d of Albany\u2019s Capital Region. Cobblestone streets are lined with nineteenth-century brownstones, which are home to an eclectic mix of boutiques, cafes, art galleries and wine shops, whether tucked in basements or spilling out onto sidewalks. Art on Lark, an annual open-air art festival, highlights local makers, artists, musicians and craft food.\n\nClifton Park Center, just 15 minutes from Albany, is made up of an outdoor strip mall and indoor shopping centre, all in one stop. Its selection of over 70 shops includes both popular brands and independent boutiques and features a strong food court and cinema.\n\nVermont\n\nWhile New York may be the familiar choice, a short trip to the eastern shores of Lake Champlain brings you to Vermont \u2014 a destination where Montreal\u2019s U.S. shoppers can uncover a uniquely different shopping experience. Vermont offers a fresh perspective and distinct finds, from charming shopping districts to popular malls.\n\nChurch Street Marketplace is an uncovered, outdoor pedestrian shopping and dining mall in Burlington. Extending over four blocks of Church Street, the mall features a range of specialty boutiques \u2014 think one-of-a-kind jewellery, handcrafted ceramics and unique home d\u00e9cor. Your everyday retailers are here, too, rubbing shoulders with eclectic cafes and restaurants. Always a hub of activity in Burlington, Church Street Marketplace also holds annual events from music festivals to family parades, costume contests, and fire truck pulls.\n\nUniversity Mall, also known as U-Mall, is the largest mall in Vermont. Located near the University of Vermont, it\u2019s a popular destination for Canadian shoppers thanks to its frequent promotions (store deals are published on its website) and selection of over 70 stores.\n\nThe Essex Experience, a 20-minute drive from Burlington, is a dynamic hub of 20 independently owned Vermont businesses, from clothing to crafts to vintage treasures. It is also home to wellness centres, restaurants, a performing arts venue, independent cinema and the largest art gallery in Vermont. For those who love art and love to support local artists, The Essex Experience is a must-visit on your cross-border shopping trip.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nYes, New Hampshire is a bit farther away than the convenience of New York and Vermont \u2014 but the promise of tax-free shopping is a powerful lure for those looking for cross-border deals.\n\nJust over four hours from Montreal, New Hampshire is one of 5 states with no sales tax. Its largest mall, Pheasant Lane, features roughly 140 stores and kiosks \u2014 you\u2019ll find well-loved brands (including Target, Apple and Sephora) and a mix of independent retailers. And, because it bears repeating, zero sales tax.\n\nThe Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester is another great option, with 125 specialty stores and all your favourites covered.\n\nFor those on the hunt for even steeper discounts, there are several outlet malls in New Hampshire, including Settlers Green, Merrimack Premium Outlets and Tanger Outlets Tilton.\n\nStarting from Montreal, your options for U.S. shopping are truly exceptional. Whether you\u2019re after a quick border hop for your favourite American stores or ready for a longer trip to stretch your dollar farther, there\u2019s a shopping experience waiting for you just across the line.",

            "content": "Alberta Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz is calling on the four remaining Canadian banks in a United Nations banking alliance created by Liberal leader hopeful Mark Carney to abandon ship.\n\n\u201cThe alliance is a bit of a scam. It\u2019s designed to give Liberals like Carney a platform to virtue signal about the environment,\u201d said Schulz. \u201cBut it is designed to also attack industries who are actually lowering emissions.\u201d\n\nSchulz told True North that it\u2019s only a matter of time until the alliance uses its leverage to restrict financing to other industries it does not like, such as mining, forestry, and others.\n\nSchulz argued that the attacks resulted in a higher cost of living for everyday Albertans and Canadians. She added that it means a worse economy, less money, and fewer jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, Schulz said that international agreements like this alliance do nothing to combat global emissions but hurt hard-working Canadians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to bring back common sense and put the prosperity of our people ahead of ideological Liberal policies,\u201d she said.\n\nFour Canadian banks withdrew from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance on Jan. 17. The four banks were Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), TD Bank Group, National Bank of Canada, and BMO Financial Group.\n\nSchulz said the four banks leaving the alliance was \u201cgreat news.\u201d She added that the departure followed various banks in the United States also abandoning the alliance.\n\nFour departed, and four remain. The remaining four Canadian banks in the alliance are Coast Capital, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, and Vancity.\n\nSchulz told True North that she hopes all Canadians put pressure on the remaining banks in the alliance to abandon the \u201cideological and out-of-touch policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Ottawa to abandon their ideological and partisan pet-projects and start putting Canadian families and workers first once again,\u201d she added.\n\nSchulz also took aim at Carney in her statement to True North.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a multi-millionaire Liberal elite and Justin Trudeau\u2019s top economic advisor. He likes to claim he\u2019s a \u2018political outsider.\u2019 He\u2019s no such thing. He\u2019s as big of an insider as it gets,\u201d she said.\n\nSchulz said that Carney\u2019s environmental activism is no different than that of the Liberal-NDP government. She added that he\u2019s supported policies throughout his career that harm Alberta\u2019s main industries and increase the cost of living for every Canadian, like the carbon tax, the proposed oil and gas cap, the energy transition, and even Greta Thunberg\u2019s \u2018shut it all down\u2019 movement, which he allegedly considers himself apart of.\n\n\u201cCanadians may not know who he is yet, but we know his work. Mark Carney is just another out-of-touch Liberal elite, disconnected from the everyday concerns of Albertans,\u201d she said.\n\nPresident and CEO of RBC, Dave McKay, said he did not sense a waning commitment to climate change. He admitted that some U.S. banks have said the alliance is not the right mechanism to effect change but that pulling out doesn\u2019t mean abandoning net zero.\n\n\u201cI think you can expect us, as long as our societies are still committed to the journey, and I hope they are, you will see us continue to support that,\u201d said McKay.\n\nAn RBC spokesperson told True North that they are not providing any more information than what McKay discussed briefly at the Canadian Bank CEO Conference.\n\nA spokesperson for Vancity told True North that this was a new development and they had nothing to share on the matter at this time.\n\nEvery bank in the alliance has signed the commitment statement.\n\nThe commitment forces banks to transition greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 or earlier. Banks must also set 2030 targets within 18 months of joining, along with a 2050 target and interim goals to be met every five years.\n\nThe Net Zero Banking Alliance is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance, which Carney assembled in 2021. Working as the UN\u2019s Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, he previously called on banks to join the alliance before COP 26 in 2021.\n\nOver the last few months, various U.S. bank giants have withdrawn from the alliance. Among them are JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.\n\nTrue North contacted Coast Capital and Scotiabank but received no reply.",

            "content": "Four of Canada\u2019s biggest banks are leaving the industry\u2019s top climate-finance alliance, joining Wall Street peers and extending an exodus that started in early December.\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they\u2019re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they\u2019re still committed to meeting climate-related targets.\n\nThe departures raise further questions about NZBA\u2019s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm\u2019s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nInvestor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive\n\nThe moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call \u201cwoke\u201d capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven\u2019t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada.\n\nBanks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with \u201cpathways to net zero by 2050\u201d at the latest, according to the group\u2019s website. They\u2019re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they\u2019re on track, and to document their progress.\n\nNZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its \u201cnext phase\u201d to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website.\n\nBMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the \u201cmechanism.\u201d He added that the company also has \u201ca commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won\u2019t abandon that.\u201d\n\nIn announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has \u201crobust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.\u201d\n\nToronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has \u201cthe resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.\u201d\n\nMontreal-based National Bank, Canada\u2019s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to \u201cstreamline how we report on our plans and our progress.\u201d\n\nCIBC said the company recognizes \u201cthe scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same\u201d\n\nCanadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan.\n\nOther climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to \u201clegal inquiries.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.\n\nRelated:\n\nCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.\n\nTopics Canada Numbers",

The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and the Business Development Bank of Canada are the main creditors, collectively owed $150 million.\n\nAfter San Group filed for creditor protection last year, RBC initiated the court process which brought in Deloitte Restructuring to monitor the company\u2019s business and financial affairs.\n\nThe Langley-based San Group bought the Coulson Manufacturing sawmill in Port Alberni in 2017 and 25 acres of the paper mill site in 2018. The company\u2019s new remanufacturing mill at the old paper mill property was hailed as an economic win for Port Alberni and was expected to be completed in July 2020, promising to employ up to 1,100 local workers. However, a late-night fire caused by welding did serious damage to the mill on April 29, 2020, leaving it running at diminished capacity until 2021.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn 2022, the Port Alberni Fire Department issued a standing fire order for San Group, after receiving a complaint that workers were sleeping at one of the mill sites. For safety reasons, the department said no one should be sleeping at the work site.\n\nLast year more complaints revealed dozens of temporary foreign workers living in trailers on site, in sub-standard conditions. The Salvation Army helped move more than a dozen workers to temporary lodgings in Victoria after receiving complaints of human trafficking.\n\nThe Salvation Army\u2019s actions prompted an investigation by the fire department on July 4. Afterwards the company threatened to sue the City of Port Alberni for trespassing, violating Charter rights, and other claims.\n\nWhile reporting on the lawsuit threats, CHEK News contacted WorkSafe BC which said it had been keeping a close eye on the company since 2022, handing out 27 corrective orders and penalties of more than $78,000.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn April, 2024, a fire at the company\u2019s Acorn mill in Delta rendered the facility inoperable.\n\nIn October last year, the company curtailed production at all its mills, including the Port Alberni facilities, blaming a lack of log supply.\n\nOn November 23, 2024, company management claimed it had lost $6 million in logs from the Coulson sawmill site after a storm on November 18. However, no evidence was found of any missing logs, and experts interviewed by Deloitte said \u201ca loss of this size would be known to all in the area and recovery efforts would normally been commenced as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOn November 29, 2024, the San Group filed for creditor protection. It was supposed to expire on January 17, 2025, but it has now been extended to May 30 of this year so the company can fulfill all obligations for the sale to be completed.",

            "content": "Spare a thought for beleaguered Canadians who have had to endure a decade of Justin Trudeau, only to discover Mark Carney is now running to replace him.\n\nIt was bad enough that the Canadian Prime Minister, who announced resignation earlier this month, presided over the gradual destruction of Canada\u2019s economy, immigration system and international standing. But now Canadians are facing the prospect of someone even more smug and incompetent (if that\u2019s possible) taking his place.\n\nAs the self-satisfied former governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, Remainiac Carney tried to carve out a reputation as the only grown-up in the room. Listen to his supporters and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he was banking\u2019s answer to the Messiah.\n\nIn fact, he wasn\u2019t the second coming but a very naughty boy. Contrary to what George Osborne et al might have you believe, in reality Carney helped to screw the British economy by bungling our monetary policy, maintaining ultra-low interest rates and huge amounts of quantitative easing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince then, he has been a spokesman for central banks to focus on climate change, even though their core role is price stability.\n\nAt one point on Carney\u2019s watch we had the highest inflation in the G7. He was also completely lacking in any neutrality when it came to Brexit: instead of encouraging us to embrace Britain\u2019s newfound freedoms, Carney was one of the chief architects of Project Fear, which denigrated the status of the City of London and badly damaged consumer confidence.\n\nIn more recent times, Carney has been one of the most vocal supporters of Rachel Reeves, praising the Chancellor as a \u201cserious economist\u201d. Admittedly this was before she was forced to revise her CV to clarify she only spent six years and not a decade at the Bank of England, and that she was in \u201cretail banking\u201d at the Royal Bank of Scotland, having previously claimed she was an \u201ceconomist\u201d there.\n\nIn a video message to Labour\u2019s annual conference in 2023, Carney gushed: \u201cCrucially, she understands the economics of work, of place and family.\u201d Really? That\u2019s not what the markets, nor many businesses, seem to think.\n\nCarney\u2019s rival for the position, Canadian Conservative Pierre Poilievre, must think his Christmases have come all at once.",

Mitsuhiko Yamada, John Carlile, Robert Gallagher and Dr. Steve Garwin have stepped down as advisors and thanks them for their valuable contributions over many years of service.\n\nIn particular, the Company wishes to thank Mr. Yamada for the years he served as a Board Member, as Representing Director of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Japan Gold KK, and as a strategic Advisor. Mr. Yamada was a founding Director of the Company until his retirement from the Board in 2022. Before joining Japan Gold, Mr. Yamada held the roles of Executive Officer and General Manager of Mineral Resources for Sumitomo Corporation. His vast knowledge of international resource development and the Japanese mining landscape helped shape the Company's exploration strategy and provided valuable insight into its operations.\n\nFurther, the Company announces that it has entered into a loan agreement (the \"Agreement\") with a director of the Company (the \"Lender\") for $140,000 (the \"Loan\").\n\nThe Loan is repayable in full by March 18, 2025, or such earlier date as the Company may elect, and bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The Company intends to use proceeds of the Loan for short-term working capital purposes.\n\nPursuant to the Agreement, and subject to approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, the Company has agreed to issue the Lender 2,000,000 non-transferrable share purchase warrants (\"Bonus Warrants\") as consideration for providing the Loan. Each Bonus Warrant will entitle the Lender to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.07 for a period of 12 months following the date of issuance.\n\nThe Lender is considered an \"insider\" of the Company, and therefore the Loan and issuance of Bonus Warrants are each considered a \"related party transaction\" pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on the formal valuation exemption in section 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and upon the minority approval exemption in section 5.7(1)(a)of MI 61-101 on the basis that, at the time the Loan was made, and the time the Bonus Warrants will be issued, neither the fair market value of the subject matter of, nor the fair market value of the consideration will exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization as determined in accordance with MI 61-101.\n\nAbout Japan Gold Corp.\n\nJapan Gold Corp. is a Canadian mineral company focused on the exploration and discovery of high-grade epithermal gold deposits across the main islands of Japan. The Company holds a significant portfolio of tenements covering areas with known gold occurrences, history of mining and prospective for high-grade epithermal gold mineralization in one of the most stable and under explored countries in the world. The Japan Gold leadership and operational team of geologists, drillers and technical advisors have extensive experience exploring and operating in Japan and have a track record of discoveries world-wide. Japan Gold has an alliance with Barrick Gold Corporation to jointly explore, develop and mine certain gold mineral properties and mining projects with the potential to host Tier 1 or Tier 2 gold ore bodies in Japan.

Download templates for: Reverse-chronological resume Functional resume Hybrid resume Cover letter\n\nThe difference between a resume and a curriculum vitae (CV)\n\nOften, there are two ways job seekers can showcase their professional experience to an employer: by using a resume or a CV. In Canada, employers prefer a resume. A CV is mainly used only for academic applications such as academic jobs, grants, research fellowships, etc.\n\nTo provide more clarity, here are some key differences between a resume and a CV:\n\nResume CV Length Very brief \u2013 about one or two pages long. Usually, two pages or longer; no maximum limit on pages. Content Includes a summary of work experience, education, and skills relevant to the role. It is very detailed and includes work experience, education, skills, publications, awards, honours, research, affiliations, etc. over the entire course of your career. Purpose Job applications. Academic applications.\n\nNote that in some parts of the world, it\u2019s common to include personal information such as marital status, nationality, personal interests, hobbies, date of birth, address, and a photograph on a CV. In Canada, however, you should not include these details on your resume as it is not required under the employment law, and it is also not a part of the resume format.\n\nUnderstanding the types of resume formats used in Canada\n\nAs a job seeker in Canada, there are three types of resume formats you should be familiar with. Each of these formats includes the same basic information in a different layout.\n\n1. Reverse chronological resume\n\nThis type of resume outlines your professional experience in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position.\n\nWhen to use a reverse chronological resume?\n\nIf you\u2019re an experienced professional with at least some experience in the workforce, have no major employment gaps, and intend to continue working in the same field.\n\nTip: The reverse chronological resume is the most popular format in the Canadian job market. Most employers and recruiters are used to and prefer a resume in this format.\n\nDownload the free Canadian Reverse-chronological resume template\n\n2. Functional resume\n\nThe functional resume focuses on your overall skills and qualifications instead of specific professional experiences. The employment history is still included, but it is usually listed after skills and education.\n\nWhen to use a functional resume?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to switch roles and/or industries and start your career in a new field. It may also be ideal for recent college graduates.\n\nDownload the free Canadian Functional resume template\n\n3. Hybrid resume\n\nA combination resume is a mix of the reverse-chronological layout and the functional layout and is ideal for showcasing transferable skills along with professional experience. In this format, work experience is usually outlined in a reverse chronological format, and the skills section includes a summary of qualifications and technical skills (or core competencies).\n\nWhen to use a combination or hybrid resume?\n\nIt is commonly used by a variety of job seekers ranging from experienced workers to recent graduates to those with limited experience, multiple short-term work stints, or those having significant work gaps.\n\nDownload the free Canadian Hybrid resume template\n\nTips for writing a Canadian-style resume\n\nMastering the art of writing a flawless and impactful Canadian-style resume takes practice and patience. Here are a few tips to help you improve your resume-writing skills.\n\n1. Adapt your resume to each job listing and keep it relevant\n\nUsing a generic resume for a variety of positions/roles and companies usually doesn\u2019t yield great results. It is essential to customize your resume to each position that you\u2019re applying for. Tailor your work experience, the skills your showcase, and any additional information to the role and job description. Include keywords from the job posting.\n\nWhile showcasing your past job experience, Canadian employers prefer to see your achievements rather than your job responsibilities. Start your sentence with relevant action verbs like \u201cspearheaded\u201d, \u201cachieved\u201d, \u201cmanaged\u201d, \u201ctrained\u201d, etc. and only list three to five accomplishments for each position you\u2019ve held. Focus on achievements that are relevant to the role you are applying to.\n\nCraft a compelling summary for your resume. Avoid including very detailed information for each position you have held; you can share relevant details in the interview instead.\n\n2. Optimize for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) but write for humans\n\nMany companies use an ATS to pre-screen resumes and then involve recruiters and hiring managers later in the process. You need to keep both in mind when writing your resume.\n\nWhat is an ATS?\n\nAn ATS is a software that scans resumes to determine if it is a good match for a specific job listing. Parameters such as work experience, skills, and education are usually considered during the ATS screening process. Resumes that match the pre-defined criteria are forwarded to hiring managers or recruiters, while human eyes never see those rejected by the system. Therefore, even though you may be qualified for the position, if your resume isn\u2019t optimized for an ATS, it may end up being rejected. An ATS is widely used by organizations, recruiters, and job placement agencies in Canada.\n\nHow to optimize a resume for ATS\n\nUse standard formatting and don\u2019t include images, designs, charts, and tables.\n\nUse correct headers and include keywords that match the job description and desired core competencies and skills.\n\nSend your resume as a Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) document. Most ATS systems tend to process Word files better than PDF.\n\nSpell out abbreviations at least once on your resume.\n\nInclude experience, skills, and qualifications relevant to the position.\n\nAvoid long paragraphs and font size less than size 10.\n\nConvert technical terms, grades, and scores to their Canadian equivalents.\n\n3. Check spelling, grammar, punctuation, and proofread your resume\n\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to proofread your resume and check grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence formation, especially if English isn\u2019t your first language or mother tongue. There are many free tools that can help you with proofreading, and you can also ask a native English speaker to review your resume for language fluency.\n\n4. Quantify your accomplishments\n\nMany job seekers make the mistake of outlining roles and responsibilities instead of achievements. Recruiters and hiring managers prefer seeing quantified accomplishments on resumes. The \u2018CAR\u2019 approach is a good way to help you structure individual sentences:\n\nC = what was the Challenge,\n\nA = what Action did you take, and\n\nR = what was the Result.\n\nSome examples to consider:\n\n\u201cReached eBay Power Seller status within one year by auctioning over 400 items per month, an exceptional accomplishment reached by only 4 per cent of the 29 million eBay sellers at that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesigned and built statistical analysis models on large data sets (e.g. Aster, Teradata) that helped increase online sales (up to 15 per cent per product) and lowered cart-abandonment rate by 23 per cent.\u201d\n\n5. Include a cover letter\n\nA cover letter is a formal one-page document that accompanies a resume. It is not a rephrased or concise version of your resume, but it is mainly supposed to talk about how you fit the role you\u2019re applying for and why the organization should hire you. The cover letter is also a good way to justify any gaps in your resume or provide any additional info that your resume can\u2019t.\n\nDownload the free Canadian Cover Letter template\n\nNote that a cover letter doesn\u2019t have to be a separate document but can also be included in the body of an email when applying for a job. Adding a custom, well-written cover letter to your resume can make you stand out from the crowd, thus improving your chances of being approached for an interview.\n\nTips for writing an impressive Canadian-style cover letter\n\nLimit the length to one page.\n\nTailor your cover letter to suit each job application.\n\nProofread your cover letter; check for grammar, punctuation, and spelling, especially since it serves as a reflection of your communication skills.\n\nUse a standard font size (10 or 12 points, in a font style such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri). Avoid using special effects (bold/underline/italics, different fonts, and colour).\n\nWeave in information you know about the company, their recent projects, or organizational culture and values.\n\n6. Show off your skills with unpaid or local volunteer work\n\nThis is a good way for newcomers to show Canadian experience on their resume. If your volunteer work requires you to use skills that may also be valued in the position that you are applying for, adding the volunteer experience to your resume may work to your advantage.\n\nTip: Volunteering can help you build your network and earn Canadian experience.\n\n7. Double check your contact information\n\nNewcomers sometimes have temporary phone numbers and addresses during their initial months in Canada and occasionally forget to update their contact when they get a permanent one. Before submitting your resume to an employer or a recruiter, do check all your contact information, including social media links, to ensure they are up-to-date.\n\nTip: LinkedIn is extensively used in Canada by recruiters and job seekers, making it an excellent tool to get started on your job search journey.\n\nA well-crafted resume and cover letter are strong marketing tools to help you get the job you desire. Being familiar with the best practices and employer expectations in Canada will better your chances of securing an interview and landing an offer.",

            "content": "Source: Getty Images\n\nWritten by Christopher Liew, CFA at The Motley Fool Canada\n\nCanada\u2019s Big Six banks reported mixed earnings results in fiscal 2024, with increased business lending and mortgage activities in Q4 2024. The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate four times before the presentation of the quarterly reports. Its fifth and last cut for the year was December 11, 2024.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) maintained the Domestic Stability Buffer (DBS) at 3.5%. Canada\u2019s banking giants need to have a buffer or rainy-day fund to cover losses in case of financial uncertainties. The OSFI believes the country\u2019s financial system remains generally stable after assessing its vulnerabilities and risks.\n\nThe Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) is the pre-eminent choice for investors seeking exposure to Canada\u2019s banking sector. Its share price has risen 2.1% in the last five days following an upgrade by sector peers. If you invest today, the share price is $142.10, while the dividend offer is 4.6%.\n\nStock upgrade from peers\n\nOn January 8, 2025, analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada raised the rating from \u201csector perform\u201d to \u201coutperform\u201d and increased their price target for BMO to $161 (+13.3%). The Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have the same ratings for BMO with price targets between C$150 and C$160.\n\nThe bank analysts agree that the 5% year-over-year dividend increase announced last month reflects the bank\u2019s financial strength and commitment to rewarding shareholders. BMO rewarded investors with an overall return of 11.7%-plus in 2024 on top of the dividend hike.\n\nFinancial performance\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering 2025 with a strong foundation and significant balance sheet capacity for growth,\u201d said Darryl White, CEO of BMO Financial Group. In the 12 months ending October 31, 2024, revenue increased 12.1% to $32.8 million compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nBMO\u2019s net income climbed 65.1% to $7.3 billion from a year ago, notwithstanding the 159.8% year-over-year jump in provision for credit losses (PCLs) to $3.1 billion. The Personal and Commercial business segments in Canada ($11.4 billion) and the U.S. ($9.8 billion) contributed the most to total revenues in fiscal 2024. The contribution from the Bank of the West will also show in the coming quarters.\n\nAccording to White, BMO delivered good pre-provision pre-tax earnings growth across all operating groups. It also met management\u2019s commitment to positive operating leverage for the last three quarters and the whole year. He expects the quarterly provisions to moderate through 2025 as the business environment improves.",

            "content": "Looking for some long-term holds for your TFSA? These four can create the perfect porfolio!\n\nBuilding the perfect Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) portfolio is akin to curating a financial masterpiece, with every element designed to balance growth, stability, and income. The magic lies in blending strategic investment choices with a keen eye on the Canadian market\u2019s unique opportunities. Let\u2019s explore four fundamental tips and how specific stocks can align with these principles to help you create a stellar TFSA portfolio.\n\nTip 1: Diversify across sectors to balance risk\n\nDiversification is the cornerstone of any robust investment portfolio. By investing across different sectors, you protect your portfolio from the ups and downs of individual industries. The Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) is a prime example of a stable player in the financial sector. Known as one of the largest banks in Canada, RBC has a legacy of consistent performance.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, RBC delivered 13% year-over-year revenue growth, underscoring its strong financial health. The bank\u2019s diversified operations, especially in wealth management and the U.S. market, provide additional growth opportunities. With a healthy dividend yield of approximately 3.4% and a stable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9, it\u2019s a reliable pick for a diversified TFSA portfolio.\n\nTip 2: Harness the power of dividends\n\nDividends are a game-changer for long-term investors. These provide a steady income stream and, when reinvested, can compound your returns significantly. Enbridge (TSX:ENB) exemplifies a strong dividend-paying stock. As a leader in the energy sector, Enbridge has consistently rewarded its shareholders with generous dividends.\n\nWhile detailed recent earnings are not highlighted here, the company\u2019s strategic investments in renewable energy and extensive pipeline network set the stage for long-term stability and growth. Its dividend yield of over 7% is a testament to its commitment to returning value to shareholders, thus making it a top pick for income-focused TFSA investors.\n\nTip 3: Invest in growth stocks for long-term appreciation\n\nA balanced TFSA portfolio should include growth-oriented stocks that promise significant appreciation over time. Shopify (TSX:SHOP) is a leading example. As an e-commerce giant, Shopify has been at the forefront of digital retail innovation.\n\nOver the past decade, the company\u2019s revenue has surged from US$105 million in 2014 to an impressive US$8.2 billion in the last 12 months. Its operating margin, once a challenge, has improved to 13.1%, highlighting its growing profitability. With the global e-commerce sector projected to expand further, Shopify\u2019s innovative solutions and market leadership position it as a compelling choice for growth within a TFSA portfolio.\n\nTip 4: Add defensive stocks for stability\n\nNo portfolio is complete without a foundation of defensive stocks to anchor it during market turbulence. The Bank of Nova Scotia (TSX:BNS), commonly known as Scotiabank, fits this role perfectly. The bank recently reported a strong fourth-quarter profit, driven by reduced provisions for bad loans and an increase in interest income.\n\nScotiabank\u2019s unique strength lies in its diversified international presence, particularly in Latin America, where it continues to find growth opportunities. Its robust dividend history and prudent financial management make it an ideal candidate for stability within your TFSA.\n\nFoolish takeaway\n\nThe future outlook for these stocks adds another layer of confidence. RBC\u2019s focus on wealth management and expansion in the U.S. market ensures sustained growth potential. Enbridge\u2019s pivot towards renewable energy and consistent cash flow from its pipeline operations underscore its long-term viability. Shopify\u2019s ability to adapt and innovate in a competitive e-commerce landscape ensures it remains a leader in its field. Scotiabank\u2019s diversified geographic strategy and stable dividends promise continued resilience.\n\nWhen selecting stocks for your TFSA, always consider recent earnings, dividend history, and forward-looking strategies. For example, RBC\u2019s consistent revenue growth and healthy dividend yield highlight its reliability. Enbridge\u2019s high dividend yield, coupled with strategic investments, indicates long-term stability. Shopify\u2019s revenue growth trajectory and improving margins signal its potential as a growth engine. Scotiabank\u2019s strong recent earnings and commitment to dividends reinforce its defensive appeal.\n\nBuilding a perfect TFSA portfolio requires a thoughtful mix of diversification, income, growth, and defence. By incorporating these stocks, you achieve a balanced and resilient portfolio tailored for long-term success. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or just starting, these strategies provide a roadmap to make the most of your TFSA.",

            "content": "According to IBM\u2019s report 2024, Generative AI is revolutionizing financial services by improving customer satisfaction and propelling advancements in risk assessment as well as personalized financial solutions. Secondly, the use of hybrid clouds is growing as companies seek to boost compliance, scalability, and efficiency. Thirdly, cybersecurity is still crucial, with growing investment in fraud detection systems as AI-driven threats emerge. Businesses are putting a greater spotlight on sustainability by giving green financial products and ESG initiatives top priority. By utilizing AI technologies such as Watsonx Assistant, customer experience management (CXM) increases customer pleasure and loyalty. Moreover, the use of open banking is growing as a result of APIs\u2019 ability to simplify procedures and provide customers with more control over their data. Secure online transactions are being reinforced by the resurgence of digital currencies and blockchain.\n\nAmidst the growth, as per EY\u2019s report, the financial services industry is also undergoing a change because of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, which boosts productivity, modifications, and innovation. AI is helping banks provide individual solutions and improve risk control while accelerating processes like fraud detection, loan processing, and customer support. Large financial institutions are using AI to lower expenses, improve compliance, and create new products like automated tax compliance and predictive analytics. Nonetheless, issues like data privacy, rules of conduct, and AI\u2019s \u201cblack box\u201d decision-making continue to exist. Notwithstanding these obstacles, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing financial services by spreading beyond banking to include wealth management, insurance, and payments.\n\nMeanwhile, as we have mentioned in our article, 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds , the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years.\n\nAccording to the Financial Industry Index, which increased by more than 30% by mid-December and beat the overall market by about 5 percentage points, 2024 was a spectacular year for the financial industry. This growth followed concerns about mid-sized bank collapses in early 2024, which proved to be isolated incidents rather than an issue impacting the industry as a whole.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against the other best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLooking ahead, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 investment management outlook predicts that AI, digital transformation, and changing investor demands will quickly impact the investment management industry in 2025. Low-cost funds are dominant, with active management flourishing within ETFs. Sustainability-focused investments, hybrid funds, and private financing are important growth areas. AI has exceeded expectations and is transforming operations and sales, but companies that are not embracing it quickly could fall behind. Regulatory changes, cybersecurity, and the combination of traditional and alternative assets are examples of growing risks. While some companies may find it difficult to survive in a high-risk, high-reward environment, bold companies that use AI and diversify their products may benefit from these changes. The key to success is scaling innovation and satisfying the need for sustainable, affordable solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, Deloitte\u2019s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report stated that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. It is anticipated that GDP growth will be 1.5% in 2025, and inflation will be approaching the 2% target, presenting a low-growth, lower-rate scenario for US banks. With savings exhausted by March 2024 and debt reaching $17.7 trillion, consumer spending may decline. Net interest margins may be compressed as a result of declining interest rates, with the federal funds rate falling to 350-375 basis points. Noninterest income presents opportunities, but growing salaries and technology expenditures drive up costs. Credit quality may slightly improve but is expected to stabilize. As geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty further complicate the picture, Deloitte observes that weak business investment and higher deposit costs will test banks\u2019 adaptability.\n\n10 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nAn investment banker in a power suit entering an exclusive board room with a confident stride.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with a projected upside potential of over 7% based on analyst price targets, as of January 9. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)\n\nUpside Potential as of January 9: 28.63%\n\nThe Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) is one of the six banks that hold roughly 90% of all bank deposits in Canada and is one of the two biggest banks in terms of assets. The United States makes up the majority of the bank\u2019s remaining revenue, with Canada contributing two-thirds. It has done an outstanding job of expanding its nonbank business, efficiently running its banking activities, and generating some of the highest returns for stockholders in the industry.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) offers a variety of financial services, including corporate banking, wealth management, insurance, capital markets, and personal and commercial banking. The bank is mostly focused on Canada, although it also operates in the US and other countries. RBC\u2019s global wealth management and capital market reach generate an extensive revenue stream.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) reported earnings of $4.2 billion, with adjusted earnings rising 18% year over year to $4.4 billion. Its Wealth Management division achieved a significant milestone when global assets under administration topped $2 trillion for the first time, and Canadian wealth management AUA grew by 26% over the same period last year. The acquisition of HSBC Canada resulted in run-rate savings of over $400 million and increased quarterly earnings by $265 million. Furthermore, the bank reported record revenue in Corporate Investment Banking and Global Markets during the fourth quarter, and its pre-provision pretax earnings rose 14% year over year.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)\u2019s quarterly dividend increased by $0.06, or 4%, reflecting its solid performance. It is a leading bank stock in terms of growing dividends. Over the last ten years, the bank has been able to raise payouts despite market crises and the pandemic.\n\nArgus affirmed its Buy rating on Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) shares and increased their price target from $132 to $140. In a research note, the analyst informed investors that the company is still competitive, with a solid wealth management franchise and a growing market share in Canadian banking. Argus further stated that the $400 million run-rate annualized savings with HSBC Bank Canada, which was purchased in March 2024, is on target to reach the $740 million total by March 2026.\n\nRajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 5.75 million shares worth $717.89 million as of Q3.\n\nOverall, RY ranks 1st on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for RY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.

            "content": "A recent RBC poll finds one in five grandparents today are helping to support an adult child with everyday needs like clothing and groceries. If you\u2019re approaching retirement age amid this cost-of-living crunch, you\u2019ll want to consider these three steps to stay on top of your finances.\n\nRetirement years are fast approaching for the one in five people in Canada between the ages of 55 and 64 who haven\u2019t yet stepped away from the working world. This milestone can bring a sense of achievement, excitement\u2014and potentially, concern. That\u2019s because lately, the high cost of living is taking a toll on would-be retiree\u2019s finances.\n\nFor those approaching or already in retirement who have children and grandchildren, there\u2019s an additional twist: they\u2019re finding themselves supporting these younger family members who are struggling to keep up with their bills. A recent RBC poll that surveyed grandparents aged 55 plus found one in five (21 per cent) are currently supporting at least one adult child aged 25 plus and three in ten (30 per cent) have gifted money to their grandchildren.\n\nIn addition, seven-in-ten (70%) of these grandparents reported their adult children expect them to help cover necessary costs \u2013 such as food and clothing \u2013 and more than half (54%) are providing this money at least monthly. For the money these grandparents have given to grandchildren, support for everyday living costs (30%) is second only to education expenses (39%). Over half (54%) are providing more money due to rising costs and three in ten (29%) are worried they will need to increase the financial support they provide this year.\n\n\u201cAs costs continue to increase, grandparents are helping out with everyday needs like rent, clothing, groceries and utility bills,\u201d says Craig Bannon, director, Financial Planning Centre of Expertise, RBC. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more important that the money they are providing to younger family members becomes part of their financial plans.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re one of these grandparents, here are three steps to help you stay on top of your finances:\n\nReview your finances\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to sit down with an advisor\u2014something too many people skip, according to Bannon. In the recent grandparent survey, only just under two in five (37 per cent) respondents said that they have reviewed their finances to see how much financial support for younger family members they could afford to provide.\n\nAn advisor can review your investments and portfolio and help you explore your options.\n\n\u201cOnly once you have that knowledge can you really think about what strategies you might be able to put into place now or in the future to help ensure you\u2019re on the right track, or to put yourself into a better situation,\u201d Bannon adds.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re not yet retired but not managing to save enough, you could consider delaying your retirement, continuing to work part-time or scaling back on the retirement lifestyle you\u2019ve pictured. While no one wants to hear they\u2019re approaching a budget shortfall, it\u2019s better than the alternative\u2014not knowing until it\u2019s too late.\n\nIf you\u2019re already retired and supporting adult children and/or grandchildren, Bannon recommends you have open conversations with these family members, early and often. And include talking with an advisor. Frank conversations can help to set expectations and ensure your existing or upcoming financial support doesn\u2019t overstrain your own resources.\n\nRefine your decision-making skills\n\nYou can help yourself to stay on track toward your financial goals by identifying any thoughts, emotions or habits that may be steering you off-track. This can be all too common when it comes to money.\n\nWhile classical economics assumes people make rational choices, this isn\u2019t always the case. There is a field of study that investigates the psychology behind economic decision-making, and how your feelings impact it: behavioural economics. This work sheds light on how people tend to base decisions on intuition and emotions rather than facts and analysis.\n\nMaybe, for example, you\u2019re considering downsizing\u2014but then some friends of yours struggle to sell their home or don\u2019t like their new life in a condo. Now, you\u2019re more reluctant to list\u2014even if those friends live in a different city altogether.\n\nHere are some ways even experienced investors can get tripped up and make decisions that won\u2019t benefit them in the long run:\n\nAnchoring bias is the tendency to stick to first impressions, making a decision that relies more heavily on information received early on, even if it\u2019s less reliable.\n\nPresent bias is the tendency to focus on the here and now and place more value on smaller, immediate rewards than a potentially greater, larger reward in the future. For example, a person with present bias might prefer to have $100 today instead of waiting a week to receive $150.\n\nStatus quo bias is the tendency to stick with your current situation rather than leap into the unknown.\n\nLoss aversion is the inclination to feel the pain of losses as more powerful than the pleasure of similar gains. For example, it may feel better for some to avoid losing $10 than to find $10.\n\nRegret aversion is similar in that regret-averse people want to avoid making a decision today they will regret in the future. Often, they imagine and prepare for a future full of worst-case scenarios.\n\nDo some of those resonate with you? Making major financial decisions is rarely easy, but it can be easier. It starts with taking the emotion out of investing. Retirees can improve their financial literacy as well as getting professional and clear-headed advice from an advisor.\n\n\u201cWhen clients go through an advice-based conversation, such as through MyAdvisor, this can help them understand what\u2019s driving their choices and may be steering them off course from achieving their financial goals,\u201d Bannon says.\n\nMake a multi-part plan\n\nIf you\u2019re nearing retirement, you\u2019ll want to put a plan in place to help you think about three upcoming time horizons: short, medium and long.\n\nA common misconception is that, once retired, people don\u2019t save up for things, but that\u2019s not true. You may be planning a big trip or a home renovation. If you have grandchildren, you may be asked to support their dreams of post-secondary education.\n\nTry the \u201cbucketing\u201d strategy, which separates your portfolio/investments into three main time horizons or buckets:\n\nThe short-term or cash bucket is designed to provide you with the income you require to meet your immediate basic living and lifestyle needs, typically covering one to five years. It can be made up of savings, cash-like and short-term investments such as short-term GICs and money market funds. Your proposed projected income from these investments delivers monthly cash flow. Their conservative nature can help protect you from market fluctuations. The medium-term bucket serves as a buffer between the short-term and long-term buckets, usually within a six to 10-year time frame. This is where you hold income-generating investments, which can include fixed income mutual funds that make quarterly distributions of earnings and equity mutual funds that pay regular dividends, for example. You can draw from the medium-term bucket to top up the short-term bucket or to deal with the unexpected. The long-term bucket holds potentially higher-risk investments but offer higher potential for capital growth to sustain the portfolio for the years of retirement. With a 10-year-plus horizon it may cover more than a full economic cycle, giving the portfolio time to recover from most down markets or economic contractions.\n\nThe overall plan and the decisions about what types of investments to hold within each bucket are based on your income needs, life expectancy, risk tolerance and what your goals are in retirement.\n\nHere are a few key questions to help you build the bucketing strategy that works for you:\n\nHow much annual income will you need from your retirement portfolio to meet your monthly cash flow needs? This will vary depending on your lifestyle and will change over the course of your retirement. For example, someone planning to travel the world the first five years of retirement will have different income needs than someone planning to stay close to home and spend time with family. Knowing your numbers is key\u2014so keep track of your spending, including any support you give to your adult children and grandchildren.\n\nHow many years of cash flow do you want to have readily available? A good plan also has contingencies, such as an emergency fund for unexpected challenges. Planning for just-in-case scenarios puts a buffer in place to protect the income you require to meet your cash flow needs.\n\nWhat are your goals in retirement and when do you want to achieve them? Revisit the bucketing strategy regularly to ensure it incorporates any changes that may have occurred in your life, your goals and the broader markets and economy. There are components that may need to be re-balanced throughout retirement. Sitting down annually with an advisor for a financial health checkup will help ensure your plan is delivering what you need.\n\nIf you\u2019re approaching retirement in the next few years, you have a lot to look forward to\u2014more quality time with your loved ones, discovering new passions or hobbies and embarking on exciting adventures in new or beloved places. You can best position yourself to enjoy this next phase of life through careful planning and decision-making, in partnership with an advisor.\n\nYou can book an appointment online",

            "content": "As one of Canadian Lawyer\u2019s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers and Calgary Avenue\u2019s Top 40 Under 40, Dr. Charles Osuji has a resume stacked with accolades and awards. But his path to excellence was far from easy.\n\nWhen Osuji first arrived from Nigeria in Canada in 2011, sponsored by his older brother, he felt anxious about his prospects as an internationally trained lawyer. \u201cI had just graduated and been called to the Bar back home,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut in Canada, I had no professional network and struggled with self-doubt, wondering if I\u2019d made the right decision to move.\u201d\n\nAfter sending over 300 applications for articling placements, his hope was fading. Then, Jim Smith, a lawyer and then-owner of the firm that would become Osuji & Smith, invited Osuji for an interview. Osuji\u2019s determination and perseverance struck Smith. \u201cHe saw something in me that many people didn\u2019t,\u201d Osuji says. \u201cHe wanted to be the one \u2018yes\u2019 for me when no one else would give me a shot.\u201d\n\nWithin three years, he became a Partner, and soon after, Smith offered him the opportunity to buy the practice. With the encouragement of his mentors, Osuji took the leap. Since then, he has since expanded the firm from six people to a team of more than 45 with offices in Calgary, Yukon, and Dubai.\n\nBuilding a path for internationally trained lawyers\n\nCanada\u2019s legal system can be challenging for internationally trained lawyers like Osuji due to several factors, including expensive accreditation exams, a lack of professional networks, and cultural barriers. \u201cMany employers don\u2019t even know the process for hiring employees who have immigrated and aren\u2019t willing to go down that road,\u201d Osuji adds.\n\nThese challenges inspired him to establish the Foot in the Door Initiative, a nonprofit connecting internationally trained lawyers with volunteer legal opportunities to help them gain experience and confidence. \u201cAfter six months, program participants have connections and feel seen and supported,\u201d Osuji says.\n\nWhen hard work leads to great rewards\n\n\u201cWhen I first bought the firm, I was very unsure of myself and wondered if I\u2019d made the biggest mistake of my life,\u201d Osuji says. \u201cBut I decided to put my head down, work hard, and focus on hiring smart, driven people. I\u2019ve learned that when you do good work with integrity and dedication, people notice.\u201d\n\nHaving earned more than 100 local and national awards for his contributions, including the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, Osuji says these recognitions send a powerful message. \u201cSystemic racism is real, but there are ways to build credibility,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the right work ethic, you can attract clients and build credibility, proving that what truly matters is the work you do and not your background or skin colour.\u201d\n\nFostering diversity and inclusion\n\nOsuji & Smith has become known for its diverse team, representing a wide range of ages and languages. For Osuji, this commitment to diversity is a differentiator. \u201cOur team reflects the changing face of Canada\u2019s business landscape,\u201d he says. \u201cI want clients to walk through our doors and know someone here understands their story.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life changed because someone valued diversity, which is why I\u2019m motivated to help other international lawyers,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many very talented individuals who just need someone to take a chance on them. I know what it feels like to struggle as a new immigrant.\u201d\n\nA leader for aspiring Black entrepreneurs\n\nAs the owner of one of Canada\u2019s largest Black-owned law firms, Osuji feels a certain level of responsibility to be a role model within the Black entrepreneur community. \u201cI want to inspire others to aim higher, to know their dreams are possible with determination, grit, and the right support,\u201d he says.\n\nHe stresses the importance for Black business leaders to seek allyship from beyond their own communities. \u201cEducate yourself on the many programs and organizations that offer assistance to Black entrepreneurs, like RBC, and take advantage of the resources beyond our immediate circles.\u201d\n\nBalancing his leadership responsibilities with his commitment to community impact can be tricky he says, but Osuji embraces the challenge. By training lawyers in his firm to step into leadership roles, he frees up time to focus on his advocacy work. \u201cI\u2019m very deliberate about my work in the community,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause in the end, it\u2019s not about the amount in your bank account but the lives you touched.\u201d\n\nBuilding a legacy for future entrepreneurs\n\nFor internationally trained professionals hoping to follow in Osuji\u2019s footsteps, he stresses the importance of preparation, mentorship and patience. \u201cPace yourself,\u201d he advises. \u201cGrowth takes time.\u201d He also encourages budding entrepreneurs to practice self-compassion and stay optimistic.\n\nLooking to the future, Osuji hopes to leave a legacy of support for Black entrepreneurs and community leaders. \u201cI want to be judged by the number of people who got ahead because of me,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to ensure that future generations have equal or even greater opportunities than I did.\u201d",

            "content": "Important conversations now can protect families financially for the future\n\nTORONTO, Jan. 14, 2025 /CNW/ - Amid a currently challenging economy, Canadians may be feeling some uncertainty about the future. While many are clear that they want to financially protect their families after they're gone, they also admit they aren't actively planning to achieve these goals, according to a recent survey by RBC Insurance.\n\nThe majority (82%) of Canadians feel it is important to ensure their family receives money quickly to avoid paying out-of-pocket for a funeral or other end-of-life expenses. As many as 76 per cent want to ensure their estate is taxed as little as possible to leave their family a larger inheritance, and 70 per cent want to pass money to their family.\n\nHowever, just 15 per cent of Canadians have a plan for how their money and belongings will be transferred to loved ones after they're gone, which only increases to 24 per cent for current retirees. Meanwhile, less than four in ten (38%) retirees have set aside money or have life insurance to pay for final expenses. Retirees are also the least likely to be knowledgeable about various types of insurance policies, overlooking the potential that could help achieve their goals.\n\n\"We often hear people say, 'I had no idea how hard it would be',\" says Selene Soo, director, Product Management at RBC Insurance, referring to the process of managing a loved one's assets after they have died. \"This is followed quickly by: 'If I had known, I would have helped to prepare their finances differently.' It's hard to hear because we know there are ways to make it easier.\"\n\nOpen conversations and working with professionals early to develop strategies based on your goals and unique situation can alleviate stress for you and your family later.\n\nRelieve the admin burden for your loved ones.\n\nWhile over half (53%) of Canadians confess they don't want to be a burden on their families when they're gone, many are surprised by the administrative and financial weight of managing a loved one's estate. Talking with your family and experts in advance can help them navigate complex paperwork, such as closing off bank accounts, paying debts, filing a last income tax return and maintaining property or other assets until they can be sold.\n\nEnsure money is available as soon as your family needs it.\n\nIf not properly planned for, end-of-life costs may leave your family paying out-of-pocket. While money may be available, it is often tied up in probate \u2013 a legal process that can take several months or more than a year, while a court decides what happens to your financial assets and debts after you're gone and who is authorized to act on your behalf. Insurance products like life insurance and segregated funds automatically bypass probate if you name a beneficiary. This means your loved ones will receive any inheritance quickly, so they can be ready for financial surprises that may come their way. It also means you can minimize potential probate-related fees, making sure more money gets to your loved ones.\n\nStay in control of who receives your money.\n\nHelp your family avoid uncertainty and waiting periods by naming beneficiaries \u2013 the people who will receive the benefits of your policy or account when you die. This is especially helpful if you have complex family dynamics, own a business or if there is no written will. Identified beneficiaries receive money quickly and directly, avoiding the risk of needing to pay off debts first.\n\nRegardless of your age or wealth, creating a plan with the help of loved ones and professionals will ensure that your finances are properly structured to achieve your legacy goals. As you consider your unique needs, talk to an advisor to simplify the experience and help your family when you're gone.

For this survey, a sample of 1,250 Canadians aged 18+ was surveyed between July 26 to 29, 2024. Included within this sample is an oversample of 250 Canadians aged 45-75 years old with a reported household income of $150k+. The precision of online polls is measured using credibility interval. In this case, the results are accurate to within \u00b1 3.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, of what the results would have been had the entire population of Canadians 18+ been surveyed. Credibility intervals will be wider for smaller subsets of the population.\n\nAbout RBC Insurance\n\nRBC Insurance\u00ae offers a wide range of life, health, home, auto, travel, wealth, group benefits, annuities and reinsurance advice and solutions, as well as creditor and business insurance services to individual, business and group clients.

            "content": "The Canadian economy may have closed out 2024 with a surge of new job creation, but that may not be enough to breathe life back into the deflated Canadian dollar.\n\nWhile the recent strong December jobs report could lead the Bank of Canada to slow or even pause its interest rate cuts, the path to lower rates seems more intact in Canada than in the US, where the economy (and the jobs picture) is healthy. Couple that with the potential for trade friction between the US and Canada, and continued declines in the Canadian dollar look likely.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a situation where data from both economies are equally good, the US dollar usually wins,\u201d explains Sarah Ying, head of foreign exchange strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. \u201cWe suspect this would limit how much the Canadian dollar can strengthen against the US dollar, especially in the face of tariff risks from the incoming Trump administration.\u201d\n\nCanadian Dollar to Stay Lower for Longer\n\nThe Canadian dollar had a turbulent 2024. It started at C$1.33 against the US dollar and slid steadily throughout the year, ending at a two-decade low of C$1.44 (an 8% decline). Currency watchers see more pain for the loonie in 2025.\n\nThe Canadian central bank cut 175 basis points from its overnight interest rate last year, outpacing its southern counterpart by 100 basis points. The Bank\u2019s rate now sits at 3.25%, while the US Fed is at a target range of 4.25%-4.50%. Experts highlight this divergence as one of the most concerning risks to the Canadian currency in the new year.\n\n\u201cThe Bank of Canada is paying more attention to interest rate differentials as a driver of the currency weakness, but it is not yet at the point of being concerned,\u201d asserts Tiago Figueiredo, macro strategist at Desjardins. However, he cautions that as Canadian policymakers continue to cut rates, the most likely scenario for the loonie in 2025 is further weakening.\n\nWhile the Canadian economy added 91,000 jobs in December (the highest monthly figure in two years), most economists expect the central bank to still move forward with a quarter-point rate cut at its next meeting on Jan. 29. This would further widen its policy differential with the US Fed, as a strong jobs report south of the border further cemented expectations of it standing pat on rates.\n\nThe loonie\u2019s fortunes are closely tied to interest rates, according to Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at IG Wealth. \u201cThe jobs data only matters on how it might alter rate expectations,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the US dollar is facing a lot of major tailwinds right now, [including] stronger-than-expected data, a Fed that is slower to ease interest rates, and an incoming administration that is expected to deliver on its America-first policy, including tariffs,\u201d explains Ying.\n\nYing expects the divergence between the two currencies to widen in the first 100 days of US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term. She forecasts that the Canadian dollar could fall to C$1.46 against the greenback by the end of the second quarter \u201con higher headline risk and higher uncertainty.\u201d\n\nJob Burst Won\u2019t Quite Stem Loonie\u2019s Decline\n\nThe hotter-than-expected jobs print hasn\u2019t changed rate expectations in Canada or the US. \u201cOur base case expects the policy gap between the Bank of Canada and the [US] Fed will continue to widen to more than 200 basis points by mid-2025,\u201d says Royal Bank of Canada economist Claire Fan. Since the situation remains fluid, for the moment, she focuses more on the direction rather than the extent, calling for \u201cmoderate additional Canadian dollar weakness over the first half of this year, with risks tilted toward bigger depreciations.\u201d\n\nBen Jang, portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth, strikes a contrasting note. He stresses that a resurgent jobs market signals a healthier economy, which could influence policymakers to take their foot off the pedal for the time being. \u201cWith stronger jobs data, the market will have more confidence in the Bank of Canada migrating to a more measured approach to interest rate cuts, closing the rate differential with the US,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the short term, Jang thinks this shift might lead to an increase in the value of the loonie as markets perceive it to be more stable than other currencies.\n\nKey Risks to the Loonie Outlook\n\nFan thinks the risks are for more downside on the Canadian dollar. Things could get worse as the divergence in economic conditions grows beyond what is expected due to looser fiscal deregulation stateside and trade disruptions due to potential tariffs.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s resignation, announced mere weeks before Trump takes office in the US, has created a perfect storm of political and economic uncertainty. \u201cCanada is sailing into the trade maelstrom nearly rudderless, with [Trudeau] resigning and proroguing Parliament until March 24, with an election widely expected to soon follow, likely in early May,\u201d BMO chief economist Douglas Porter explained in a note to investors. \u201cThe Canadian dollar is not taking all this news lying down\u2014more like falling down, as it has now sagged by more than 4% since the US election to C$1.44 against the US dollar.\u201d Moreover, he says, the Canadian dollar got little help from the strength in domestic jobs data.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada analyst Nathan Janzen thinks a bigger interest rate gap with the US Fed could mean a further softening of the loonie is still in the cards, but he adds that \u201cwe don\u2019t expect that will stop the Bank of Canada from cutting interest rates.\u201d The underlying reasoning is that a softer Canadian dollar driven by a weak economic backdrop isn\u2019t enough to cause a spike in inflation. \u201cThe disinflationary impact of an underperforming economy will outweigh the impact of higher import costs for the smaller share of consumer spending imported from abroad,\u201d he reasons.\n\nJang remains optimistic that the strength of the December jobs print could help close the policy gap with the US and stabilize the loonie.\n\nBradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, believes the recent bounce in jobs numbers increases the odds that the Canadian central bank may not cut rates at all at its Jan. 29 meeting. Nevertheless, he insists that \u201cgiven the weakness in private sector hiring, as well as political and trade uncertainty, we still think a 25-basis-point cut is the most likely outcome.\u201d\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

These companies now represent a significant portion of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap and have driven a substantial portion of its returns since 2023. While the AI industry is expected to fuel the next tech revolution, the important question for investors is whether market expectations are realistic.\n\nthe possibility that some of the appreciation of the S&P has stemmed from automated buying of these stocks by index investors, without regard for their intrinsic value.\u201d\n\nthe implicit presumption that the top seven companies will continue to be successful, and\n\nthe enthusiasm that is being applied to the new thing of AI, and perhaps the extension of that positive psychology to other high-tech areas,\n\nthe above average valuation on the S&P 500, and the fact that its stocks in most industrial groups sell at higher multiples than stocks in those industries in the rest of the world,\n\n\u201c.....when stocks rise too fast \u2013 out of proportion to the growth in the underlying companies\u2019 earnings \u2013 they\u2019re unlikely to keep on appreciating. Michael Cembalest has another chart that makes this point. It shows that prior to two years ago, there were only four times in the history of the S&P 500 when it returned 20% or more for two years in a row. In three of those four instances (a small sample, mind you), the index declined in the subsequent two-year period. (The exception was 1995-98, when the powerful TMT bubble caused the decline to be delayed until 2000, but then the index lost almost 40% in three years.)\n\nIn his latest memo named \u201cOn Bubble Watch,\u201d Howard Marks, co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital , highlighted several warning signs in the stock market, including high valuations that may lead to poor long-term returns or short-term declines. While not calling it a bubble, he pointed to the S&P 500\u2019s elevated price-to-earnings ratio, which historically correlates with lower returns. Marks also expressed concerns over AI investments' excessive enthusiasm and overconfidence in the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have contributed significantly to the S&P 500\u2019s recent gains. Marks also wrote:\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 13 AI News and Ratings on Wall Street's Radar .

While many major tech firms have strong fundamentals, the high valuations may not be sustainable if the broader market does not fully adopt AI technologies.

Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nThe Dividend Has Growth Potential\n\nInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Royal Bank of Canada has been growing its earnings per share at 5.1% a year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock\n\nOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 11 Royal Bank of Canada analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our free .

            "content": "Update Jan. 18, 2025: Four of Canada\u2019s biggest banks have quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. \u201cBanks including BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group, and CIBC confirmed Friday they were no longer members,\u201d CBC reports. \u201cThe withdrawals from the alliance follow departures by the six largest banks in the U.S. in recent weeks, ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdate Jan. 14, 2025: The Net-Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative is suspending operations and reviewing its next steps after the world\u2019s biggest investor, New York City-based BlackRock, announced it was pulling its US$11.5 trillion in assets out of the alliance, Reuters reported in a Jan. 13 exclusive.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe step followed months of escalating pressure from some Republican politicians over its stance on investing in fossil fuel companies, with concern that such pressure could rise further as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office,\u201d the news agency writes. \u201cThe group counted more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion in assets as members, according to its website as of last week, before the departure of BlackRock.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponsible Investor has details on NZAM members\u2019 mixed reaction to the announcement\u2014some positive, others not so much.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Montreal are signalling that they\u2019re reconsidering their membership in the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), part of a global network that UN Climate Finance Envoy Mark Carney brought together to mobilize US$130 trillion in global economic clout over 30 years to finance the low-carbon transition.\n\n\n\nRBC and BMO would be joining an \u201cexodus\u201d of U.S. banks that have left the alliance in recent weeks, Bloomberg reports, \u201cwith Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. all leaving. The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what U.S. conservatives call \u2018woke\u2019 capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven\u2019t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the U.S. banks are running scared of Trump 2.0,\u201d Reclaim Finance senior analyst Paddy McCully told CBC. \u201cTheir fear over being attacked by Trump is much greater than their climate commitment, so they all ditched the NZBA.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. banks are taking multiple hits on social media for abandoning their climate targets while Los Angeles burns. \u201cThis brazen climate indifference arrives in the narrow window between Donald Trump\u2019s election and inauguration, signaling a grim alignment of financial power with fossil fuel interests,\u201d the We Don\u2019t Have Time coalition wrote, in a weekly newsletter that featured a photo of a Bank of America branch in flames.\n\nCanada\u2019s largest and third-largest banks may not be far behind, Bloomberg says.\n\n\u201cPulling out of NZBA, hypothetically, doesn\u2019t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change,\u201d RBC CEO Dave McKay told a conference in Toronto last week. \u201cIt just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can\u2019t do and how you report, maybe that isn\u2019t the right mechanism to do it.\u201d\n\nBMO CEO Darryl White said his institution is still a \u201cmember of the alliance. At least we are today.\u201d While the bank is onboard with a low-carbon economy, he added, it has \u201ca commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won\u2019t abandon that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe told you so,\u201d Stand.earth Climate Finance Director Richard Brooks said in a statement. \u201cRBC and the other Canadian banks entered into the Net Zero Banking Alliance to greenwash their fossil fuel financing and to gain cover under increasing pressure from customers and investors. It appears they misled investors about their intentions with the alliance. While the world is on fire, quitting even mediocre climate initiatives is an out of touch move that shareholders, workers, and regulators should pay close attention to.\u201d\n\nDecline of a Financial Alliance\n\nCarney, who\u2019s expected to launch his bid for the federal Liberal Party leadership later this week, had unveiled the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero (GFANZ) with great fanfare during the COP26 climate summit in Scotland in 2021. \u201cRight here, right now, is where finance draws the line,\u201d he declared at the time.\n\nIn the wake of the Bloomberg report, Diane-Laure Arjali\u00e8s, associate professor of sustainability and managerial accounting at the Ivey business School, told CBC that supporting the climate transition turned out to be more complicated than the world\u2019s financial institutions had bargained for.\n\n\u201cProgress has been tinted,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause there were new forms of climate exposure\u2026 new carbon emissions that were not really anticipated. So for them, right now, it\u2019s extremely difficult to commit to net zero.\u201d\n\nAdam Scott, executive director of Shift: Action for Pension Wealth and Planetary Health, said there was never any front-line support for the initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s not a real political movement of citizens,\u201d he told CBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a cynical attempt by the fossil fuel industry, in collusion with state governments, to try to slow down this inevitable transition that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nBut the seeds of GFANZ\u2019 decline were sown before the highly-touted initiative was even officially launched. In the months leading up to the Glasgow COP, Carney was only able to bring together such wide-ranging investment firepower by assuring participating institutions they could set their own pathways to achieving net-zero, with or without a commitment to end fossil fuel investment, then counting on sustained public attention to keep them on track, The Energy Mix revealed during the first week of the COP.\n\nThe rules guiding GFANZ\u2019 formation made no explicit mention of a fossil investment phaseout \u201cbecause the rules are outcome-specific rather than process-specific,\u201d a spokesperson told The Mix at the time. \u201cThe overall commitment is to reduce your emissions in line with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, and it\u2019s up to individual banks to do that.\u201d But \u201cthere\u2019s not a rule about fossil fuel financing because it\u2019s up to individual banks how to get to that trajectory.\u201d\n\nA scant three months later, Bloomberg was reporting that a \u201cGreat Climate Backslide\u201d had begun, with banks pouring more than a trillion dollars into oil, gas, and coal while scrambling to burnish their green credentials. That total included $2.5 billion in bond deals that JPMorgan Chase & Co. had underwritten for Russian gas giant Gazprom and Oklahoma-based Continental Resources Inc., while Wells Fargo was on track to double its fossil fuel lending compared to 2020.\n\nBy November 2022, GFANZ was said to be \u201cquiet quitting\u201d its net-zero commitments, after several major institutions threatened to leave the alliance if tougher requirements for real climate action increased the risk of legal exposure.\n\nIn \u201ctense meetings in recent months,\u201d American GFANZ members like JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America along with Europe\u2019s Santander Bank \u201chave said they feel blindsided by tougher UN climate criteria and are worried about the legal risks of participation,\u201d the Financial Times wrote at the time. \u201cThe potential loss of some of the world\u2019s biggest and most influential banks would be a serious blow for Carney\u2019s GFANZ group.\u201d\n\n\u2018Science and Financial Reality Deniers\u2019\n\nThe angst was triggered by a new set of standards released earlier that year by the UN\u2019s Race to Zero initiative, with a June 2023 deadline for participating institutions to comply\u2014even though the banks were given the ample warning that more specific, ambitious targets were a part of the plan. At the time, news reports indicated that Canada\u2019s five biggest banks might be kicked out of GFANZ as a result.\n\nAnd bankers aren\u2019t the only ones abandoning ship. \u201cLast year, a (GFANZ) sub-group for insurers was hit by a mass exodus amid litigation threats,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cAnd in 2022, an equivalent group for asset managers parted ways with Vanguard Group Inc., the world\u2019s second-largest money manager.\u201d\n\nLast week, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander (now a candidate for New York mayor) scorched two major institutional investors for abandoning NZAB and another component of the GFANZ network, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.\n\n\u201cBlackRock and JPMorgan are fiddling while Los Angeles burns,\u201d Lander said in a statement. \u201cTheir shortsighted, weak-kneed decisions to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Net Zero Banking Alliance deny the reality\u2014which their leaders know well, and which is tragically right before our eyes\u2014that climate risk is financial risk.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles wildfires \u201care just the latest overwhelming evidence that climate change is wreaking havoc on our planet, our portfolios, and the economy,\u201d he added. \u201cBy [abdicating] their responsibilities to combat climate change, these financial institutions are yielding to the authoritarian tone set by the incoming Trump administration. They are, in essence, becoming science and financial reality deniers.\u201d",

            "content": "Canada\u2019s banking system is one of the soundest in the world. The most recent validation was in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Its central bank didn\u2019t receive any bailout requests or reports of bank failures. In November 2021, the country\u2019s giant lenders delivered a dividend bonanza to investors after collectively amassing $40.5 billion in cash from unused provisions for credit losses (PCLs) during the global pandemic.\n\nNotably, the Big Five banks are bedrocks of stability, owing to more than 100 years of dividend payments. If you\u2019re investing in the financial services sector this year, should Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY), the largest TSX company by market cap, be your top choice?\n\nBanking outlook 2025\n\nFitch Rating released last December 2024 its outlook for Canadian banks in 2025. The renowned credit rating agency expects the financial profiles to remain broadly \u201cneutral,\u201d notwithstanding a slowdown in economic activity. The banks boast solid financial profiles and have relatively healthy asset quality metrics, stable funding, and good capitalization.\n\nRBC analysts said taming inflation in 2024 was a major victory for the Bank of Canada. They expect additional rate cuts to trickle through the economy and expand on a per capita basis for the first time in three years. However, new headwinds will arise in the path forward.\n\nPosition of strength\n\nIts president and chief executive officer, Dave McKay, said, \u201cIn 2024, RBC relentlessly pursued our ambition to stay ahead of evolving client expectations and create unparalleled value.\u201d He added that the $241.77 billion bank enters 2025 from a position of strength.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (12 months ending October 31, 2024), net income increased 11% year over year to $16.2 billion. Insurance (33%) and wealth management (27%) were the business segments that reported the most significant earnings growth. RBC returned around $8.1 billion to shareholders via common dividends and share buybacks. For the full fiscal year, PCL increased 31% to $3.23 billion from a year ago.\n\nThe recently acquired HSBC Canada increased net income by $453 million. McKay said acquiring HSBC was a defining moment and a pivotal milestone in RBC\u2019s client-driven growth story. It also strengthened the bank\u2019s position as a competitive global financial institution.\n\nOn January 9, 2025, RBC announced a partnership with Cohere, a security and privacy-focused enterprise AI, to develop and launch \u201cNorth for Banking.\u201d The platform will provide enterprise generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) solutions optimized for financial services.\n\nAccording to Dr. Foteini Agrafioti, RBC Borealis senior vice president and RBC chief science officer at RBC, the Canadian big bank is on a path to redefine what a bank is capable of, and AI will play an important role in RBC\u2019s future success.\n\nStock for keeps\n\nRBC announced a 4% dividend during the release of the fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. It started paying dividends in 1870 (154 years) and continues to do so. The share price is $170.92, while the dividend yield is 3.23%. However, if you invest today, the big bank is for keeps.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto\u2019s dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning.\n\nIf interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns.\n\nAlso read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends\n\nThe recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors\u2019 capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX.\n\nConcentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst:\n\n\u201cCanadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for \u2018high\u2019 nominal yield \u2013 there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.\u201d\n\nWhile Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks\u2014common in the domestic market\u2014income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) ranks eighth on our list of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The multinational financial services company and the largest bank in Canada offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. In the past year, the stock has surged by over 27.5% as the bank benefited a lot from higher interest rates in Canada. In addition, the acquisition of HSBC Canada, completed earlier this year, has begun to bolster RBC\u2019s earnings, contributing an additional $265 million to its bottom line in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) reported revenue of over C$15.07 billion, up from C$12.6 billion in the prior year period. Its net income for the quarter came in at C$4.22 billion, growing from C$3.9 billion in the same quarter last year. Personal Banking experienced a 9% increase in earnings, with the addition of HSBC Canada\u2019s results contributing $133 million to the net income.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) maintained a strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, which supported solid volume growth. Furthermore, it returned $8.1 billion to shareholders this year through common dividends and share buybacks. On December 4, the company declared a 4.2% hike in its quarterly dividend to C$1.48 per share. Through this increase, it stretched its dividend growth streak to 14 years. The stock\u2019s dividend yield on January 10 came in at 3.45%.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2024, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), up from 21 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $1 billion.\n\nOverall RY ranks 8th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for RY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nDive Insight:\n\nAs of now, only three U.S.-based banks remain in the NZBA \u2014 Amalgamated Bank, Climate First Bank and Areti Bank \u2014 according to the group\u2019s membership list. Goldman Sachs and Citi also left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cMore and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance,\u201d Paxton said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities.\u201d\n\nPaxton previously said Wells Fargo\u2019s decision to terminate its membership in NZBA came after the state attorney general encouraged the bank to depart the alliance. In a statement at the time, Paxton \u201curged other financial institutions to follow their example.\u201d\n\nThough the recently departed major U.S. banks did not provide an explicit reason for their decision to leave the NZBA, their departures are set against a backdrop of climate-focused alliances facing increased scrutiny from the Republican Party, which has initiated probes on ESG policies across multiple fronts. The NZBA defections also come just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House for a second term, with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate to bolster his legislative agenda.\n\nU.S. banks aren\u2019t the only ones apparently weighing their future with the NZBA. Speaking Tuesday at a conference in Toronto, BMO CEO Darryl White said his bank is \u201cstill a member of the alliance \u2014 at least we are today.\u201d\n\nAt the same conference, Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay said, \u201cPulling out of NZBA, hypothetically, doesn\u2019t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can\u2019t do and how you report, maybe that isn\u2019t the right mechanism to do it,\u201d McKay said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWhite, meanwhile, vowed that BMO remains committed to the transition to a low-carbon economy. He added, though, that the bank has \u201ca commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t abandon that,\u201d White said.\n\nThe NZBA \u2014 whose members have committed to align their lending, investment and capital markets activities with global efforts to tackle climate change \u2014 has been the target of several GOP-led probes and investigations.\n\nAll of the six recently defected NZBA members \u2014 Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u2014 were subject to separate probes initiated by 14 Republican state attorneys general and 12 Republican heads of agriculture in the past few years.\n\nIn his Tuesday statement, Paxton called the alliance \u201can anti-oil and gas activist organization that pushes members to advance destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors,\u201d and applauded the banks for departing NZBA.",

A new tool will be introduced to aggregate nursing job postings in one location, simplifying the job search and application process for students. Career Navigator: A full-time Career Navigator will be dedicated to assisting in navigating the job application process and the additional examinations required for Internationally Educated Nurses to secure work in Ontario and Canada. Various career support options will be available to Canadian Educated Nurses as well. Fast-Track Bachelor of Nursing Stipend: Starting in January 2025, Seneca will offer a new Fast-Track Bachelor of Science - Nursing degree, reducing the program duration from 48 months to 32 months. To support students in this accelerated program, a $2,000 stipend will be provided to help offset costs. This stipend aims to encourage students to enrol in the fast-track program by offsetting the loss of summer break earning opportunities. Retrofit and Growth of Nursing Labs: The grant will fund the retrofitting and expansion of skills labs and simulation suites at Seneca\u2019s King Campus, ensuring that these facilities continue to remain current and capable of meeting the growing needs of the Seneca Nanji Foundation School of Nursing.\n\nThis latest grant brings RBC and RBC Foundation\u2019s cumulative giving to Seneca to $1.76 million. RBC has partnered with Seneca on various mental health initiatives, including sponsoring the Mental Health Symposium, providing student bursaries and supporting skills development programs.\n\n\u201cA strong and resilient healthcare system needs support and investment for the next generation of nursing professionals,\u201d said Michelle Waite, Regional President Greater Toronto Region at RBC. \u201cIt is a privilege to support the development and education of nurses who play an important role in keeping Canadians healthy and thriving.\u201d\n\nThis substantial investment from RBC Future Launch will significantly enhance the educational experience for Seneca\u2019s nursing students, equipping them with the skills and resources needed to succeed in their careers and contribute effectively to the healthcare sector.

The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors, nor does it necessarily present them in order of importance. In addition, you should consult other disclosures made by the company (such as in our other filings with the SEC or in company press releases) for other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the company. Refer to Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of the Form 10-K, Part II, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of Forms 10-Q and subsequent filings with the SEC for additional information regarding factors that could affect the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as they speak only as of the date made and are inherently uncertain. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update such statements, except as required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further public disclosures by the company (such as in our filings with the SEC or in company press releases) on related subjects.\n\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). However, from time to time, the company may present in its public statements, press releases and SEC filings, non-GAAP financial measures such as, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses (SD&A), gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization, and net debt. The company's definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Earnings are net income. The company believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company's ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow. The company also believes that EBITDA measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company's operating performance and debt servicing ability because EBITDA measures assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and non-operating factors (such as historical cost). EBITDA is also a widely-accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to incur and service indebtedness.\n\nEBITDA should not be considered an alternative to (a) income from operations or net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance; (b) cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the company's ability to meet its cash needs; or (c) any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe company defines adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted income tax expense and adjusted SD&A, respectively, to exclude additional costs that the company considers important to present to investors to increase the investors' insights about the company's core operations. These costs include, but are not limited to, the costs of closing a plant or costs associated with acquisition-related activities, restructuring activities, certain impairment charges, legal settlements, costs to implement an enterprise resource planning system and enhance bakery digital capabilities (business process improvement costs) to provide investors direct insight into these costs, and other costs impacting past and future comparability. The company believes that these measures, when considered together with its GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of its business operating results, including underlying trends, by excluding the effects of certain charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as the primary performance measure in the company's 2014 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (Amended and Restated Effective May 25, 2023).\n\nPresentation of gross margin includes depreciation and amortization in the materials, supplies, labor and other production costs according to GAAP. Our method of presenting gross margin excludes the depreciation and amortization components, as discussed above.\n\nThe company defines net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt to EBITDA is used as a measure of financial leverage employed by the company.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flowers-foods-inc-to-acquire-simple-mills-302345725.html\n\nSOURCE Flowers Foods, Inc.",

            "content": "The tale of two Brooklyn Half Marathons came to an end Tuesday when one of them changed its name amid legal pressure.\n\nThe NYCRuns Brooklyn Half Marathon will now be called the NYCRuns Brooklyn Experience Half Marathon, the organizer announced. The title of Brooklyn Half will remain in the hands of rival organizer New York Road Runners.\n\nNYRR has put on its 13.1-mile race in Brooklyn since 1981; the 2025 race is set for May 17. Its current naming sponsor is the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nNYCRuns was founded in 2009 and began its late-April Brooklyn race in 2018. Until Tuesday it was known as the \u201cNYCRuns Brooklyn Half Marathon.\u201d\n\nNYRR filed a complaint against NYCRuns in federal court in February 2024 seeking full ownership of the Brooklyn Half name. The legal move came after NYRR contacted NYCRuns in February 2023 expressing its concerns, according to the complaint, after which NYCRuns continued using the Brooklyn Half Marathon name to promote its 2024 race.\n\nNYRR\u2019s argument was based on trademark law claiming people could be confused by both races having the same name, and said in its complaint that it has been contacted by runners who signed up and paid for the wrong race. (And threw a dig that NYCRuns events \u201cdo not enjoy the same established, quality reputation\u201d as theirs do.) NYRR also argued it has earned claim to the name because it has used it for decades.\n\nThat historical reasoning is why the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted NYRR\u2019s trademark request for Brooklyn Half in 2017. The USPTO originally said the organization\u2019s petition was mainly geographical, so NYRR claimed it \u201cacquired distinctiveness\u201d by using its name for at least five years\u2014making it a term people associate with its event in particular.\n\n\u201cIf somebody started today as American Airlines for an airline that\u2019s literally in America, we would immediately say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s descriptive, you can\u2019t register that as a trademark,\u2019\u201d trademark law expert Carissa Weiss tells Front Office Sports. \u201cBut, at this stage of the game, we uniquely know that mark is referring to a single company that is not United and is not JetBlue, right?\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what acquired distinctiveness is. It\u2019s long use over time that gets the consuming public to think of something that would otherwise be descriptive as uniquely associated with you,\u201d Weiss says.\n\nBecoming distinctive is the goal in trademark efforts. A descriptive term is too broad for a trademark, but a distinctive one sets it apart. This is also something NYCRuns is achieving by amending its name change.\n\n\u201c I think in this context, Brooklyn Experience does the job of having us keep these two marathons apart,\u201d another trademark law expert, Marty Schwimmer, tells FOS. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t have people signing up for the wrong one, as was alleged in the complaint.\u201d\n\nTo Schwimmer, it\u2019s interesting that this dispute even had to go to court, given that NYRR had already reached out to NYCRuns about the name.\n\n\u201cIf my client came in, \u2018Hey, we got this demand letter today.\u2019 I would look up and I would say, \u2018Hey, New York Road Runners has a registration that\u2019s five years old for the term Brooklyn Half Marathon. This just isn\u2019t worth it. Go, change the name,\u2019\u201d Schwimmer says. \u201cThat\u2019s how it should have played out.\u201d\n\nBut NYCRuns denied NYRR\u2019s allegations to the court in March, and called NYRR\u2019s Brooklyn Half marks \u201cweak and unenforceable.\u201d\n\nThe two sides began a period of discovery before agreeing to a \u201csettlement in principle\u201d on Oct. 25, according to court filings. NYRR voluntarily dismissed the case Dec. 16, and it was terminated the next day.\n\nA spokesperson for NYCRuns tells FOS the lawsuit was \u201camicably resolved\u201d and the group thinks the new name \u201cbetter identifies the race for runners as an authentic Brooklyn running experience.\u201d A spokesperson for NYRR also tells FOS the matter reached an \u201camicable resolution.\u201d",

The departure is only the most recent by American banks lately, with exits by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, according to reports.\n\nThe Net Zero Banking Alliance was formed in 2021 and still includes about 140 institutions worldwide, according to the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe American banking exits come as the Republican Party and President-Elect Donald Trump, historically an opponent of environmental and emissions-reduction policies, return to power in the U.S. Those who have departed the Net Zero Banking Alliance contend they are not swayed by political agendas but still committed to combatting climate change through investment in green technologies, if not within the umbrella of the global group.\n\nJPMorgan Chase said it will continue to \u201cwork independently to advance the interests of our firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security,\u201d according to the company\u2019s statement.\n\nBanks which remain in the Net Zero Alliance include Banorte, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Canada and First Abu Dhabi Bank, among more than 130 others.\n\nRead more: Global Banks Calling for More Nuclear Energy",

            "content": "TORONTO, Jan. 7, 2025 /CNW/ - RBC Indigo Asset Management Inc. (\"RBC Indigo\") today announced changes to the RBC Indigo Mutual Funds and/or RBC Indigo Pooled Funds (collectively the \"RBC Indigo Funds\" or \"Funds\"), including proposed fund mergers, closures, and additional changes, effective on or about April 17, 2025 (\"Effective Date\").\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Royal Bank of Canada (\"RBC\") completed the acquisition of HSBC Bank Canada. Upon the completion of the acquisition, HSBC Global Asset Management (Canada) Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of RBC and a member of the RBC Global Asset Management group of companies and was renamed RBC Indigo Asset Management Inc. RBC Indigo continued to operate as the manager of the RBC Indigo Funds and the Funds were renamed.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, RBC Indigo and RBC Global Asset Management Inc. (\"RBC GAM\") thoroughly and thoughtfully reviewed their fund offerings. That review highlighted a high degree of overlap between funds offered by RBC Indigo and RBC GAM. In many cases, RBC Indigo and RBC GAM offer similar types of funds that provide the same exposure to underlying asset classes or that meet specific investment objectives. Where there is overlap, it is proposed that the RBC Indigo Fund will merge into a substantially similar RBC GAM-managed fund (\"RBC GAM Fund\"). In three instances where it has been determined that the merging RBC Indigo Funds do not have substantially similar fundamental investment objectives as the continuing RBC GAM Fund, unitholder approval for such mergers will be sought (as further described below under Fund Mergers). RBC Indigo Funds that are unique and where no suitable or comparable RBC GAM Fund exists, will be either fully transitioned to RBC GAM or closed. Following the implementation of the fund mergers, transitions and closures, RBC Indigo will be wound-up and dissolved.\n\nAs part of these changes, the overall management expense ratios (\"MERs\") of the RBC GAM Funds, which include the management fee and administration fee, are expected to be equal to or lower than those that are currently charged for the corresponding RBC Indigo Funds, except for the RBC Indigo Chinese Equity Fund Institutional Series. The MER for the corresponding series of the RBC China Equity Fund is 1 basis point higher and the merger is subject to unitholder approval.\n\nRBC Indigo Merging, Transitioning or Closing Fund Change

Institutional Series ($CA) units of this fund will close on the Effective Date\n\nFund Mergers\n\nSubject to obtaining unitholder approval for certain fund mergers, each of the fund mergers listed in the table above are expected to be carried out on a tax-deferred or taxable basis on the Effective Date. Distributions of income and capital gains will be made prior to the Effective Date from both the merging RBC Indigo Fund and continuing RBC GAM Fund in a tax deferred merger, and from the merging RBC Indigo Fund in a taxable merger. RBC Indigo Canadian Money Market Fund, RBC Indigo U.S. Dollar Money Market Fund, and RBC Indigo Canadian Money Market Pooled Fund will also make a special distribution on or around April 11, 2025, to pay out interest accrued up to this date, except for Royal Mutual Funds Inc. accounts. Certain series of the merging RBC Indigo Funds will be closed. Please refer to Fund and Series Closures below for further details.\n\nUnitholder approval\n\nThe following RBC Indigo Funds will require unitholder approval to proceed with the merger:\n\nMerging Fund Reason for Seeking Unitholder Approval RBC Indigo Canadian Bond Fund Taxable merger RBC Indigo Canadian Bond Pooled Fund Taxable merger RBC Indigo Global High Yield Bond Pooled Fund Taxable merger and investment objectives are not substantially similar RBC Indigo Canadian Small Cap Equity Pooled Fund Investment objectives are not substantially similar RBC Indigo Small Cap Growth Fund Investment objectives are not substantially similar RBC Indigo Emerging Markets Debt Fund Taxable merger RBC Indigo Emerging Markets Debt Pooled Fund Taxable merger RBC Indigo Chinese Equity Fund Taxable merger For the Institutional Series only, a 1 basis point increase in MER\n\nRBC Indigo intends to call and hold a special meeting for unitholders of the above noted merging funds on April 4, 2025, in Toronto, Ontario to consider and vote upon the proposed mergers. A notice-and-access document will be mailed to unitholders of record or their discretionary advisors as of February 3, 2025, outlining how to obtain a copy of the management information circular containing details of the proposed mergers. The notice-and-access document and the management information circular will also be available on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca.\n\nFor each fund merger in the table above, unitholders of the RBC Indigo Fund (with the exception of the unitholders of the series that will be closed as further described below under Fund and Series Closures) will receive units of the respective continuing RBC GAM Fund noted above based on the continuing fund's net asset value per unit. The merging RBC Indigo Funds will terminate following completion of the mergers. RBC Indigo will cover all costs and expenses associated with each of the mergers.\n\nThe proposed fund mergers were presented to the Independent Review Committee of the Indigo Funds (\"IRC\"). Following careful consideration, the IRC provided their approval or a positive recommendation, as applicable, after determining that the mergers achieve a fair and reasonable result for each of the applicable Funds.\n\nUnits of the RBC Indigo Funds that are merging will no longer be available for purchase effective as of the close of business on April 10, 2025. Purchases under pre-authorized contribution plans may continue depending on the dealer. Investors should consult their dealer for more information. Unitholders of the merging funds may redeem their units up to the close of business on the Effective Date.\n\nFunds to Transition to RBC GAM\n\nThe RBC Indigo Funds transitioning to RBC GAM will continue operating with new names as set out in the table above and will become part of the RBC GAM family of funds, effective on the Effective Date. Certain series of the transitioning RBC Indigo Funds will be closing. Please refer to Fund and Series Closures below for further details. RBC GAM will become the manager and trustee of the transitioning Funds and these Funds will be incorporated into the RBC Funds Amended and Restated Master Declaration of Trust. The Funds will be incorporated into the RBC Funds Simplified Prospectus in the next renewal.\n\nIn contemplation of RBC GAM becoming manager and trustee, RBC Indigo intends to terminate HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited and HSBC Global Asset Management (Singapore) Limited as sub-advisors of the RBC Indigo International Equity Index Fund and RBC Indigo Indian Equity Fund, respectively, as of the Effective Date. It is anticipated that RBC GAM will appoint a new sub-advisor to be announced at a later date for the renamed RBC International Equity Index Fund and will appoint RBC Global Asset Management (Asia) Limited as sub-advisor for the renamed RBC India Equity Fund.\n\nThe operating expenses of the Funds will change from a floating operating expense to a fixed administration fee. The fixed administration fee is calculated and accrued daily on the net asset value of each series of units of a fund and may vary by series of units and by fund. The administration fee paid to RBC GAM by a fund in respect of a series may, in any particular period, exceed or be lower than the operating expenses paid by RBC GAM for that series of the fund.\n\nThe material service providers of the transitioning Funds will change as described below, thereby aligning with the RBC GAM family of funds' service providers:\n\nService Existing Service Provider New Service Provider Custodian CIBC Mellon Trust Company RBC Investor Services Trust Registrar Royal Bank of Canada and International Financial Data Services (Canada) Limited Royal Bank of Canada, RBC Investor Services Trust and RBC GAM Valuation and/or Administrative Services CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company RBC GAM\n\nThe change in service providers will take effect as of the Effective Date, except for the change in Registrar, which will take effect as of the close of business on April 11, 2025. Unitholders of the transitioning Funds will be sent written notice of these changes at least 60 days before the change in service providers takes effect.\n\nFund and Series Closures\n\nOn the Effective Date, certain RBC Indigo Funds noted in the table above will be closed. To simplify the line-up, certain series of merging or transitioning RBC Indigo funds will also be closed on the Effective Date. Please refer to the Summary of Fund Changes table for details.\n\nThe securities of the closing RBC Indigo Funds will be liquidated to cash up to 10 days prior to the Effective Date and, after paying or making adequate provisions for the liabilities of the closing Funds, distribute the cash proceeds to the unitholders of record on the Effective Date. The closing RBC Indigo Funds will make a distribution of income and capital gains prior to the Effective Date.\n\nUnitholders of the closing RBC Indigo Funds and closing series will receive at least 60 days' notice of the closure. Units of the closing RBC Indigo Funds and closing series will no longer be available for purchase effective as of the close of business on April 10, 2025. Purchases under pre-authorized contribution plans may continue depending on the dealer. Investors should consult their dealer for more information. Unitholders of the closing Funds and closing series may redeem their units up to the close of business on the Effective Date, after which time any remaining units will be automatically redeemed.\n\nPlease visit rbcindigo.com for further details.\n\nPlease consult your advisor and read the prospectus or Fund Facts document before investing.

Last year, the best-performing stocks on the list included HubSpot , CrowdStrike and HealthEquity , which respectively gained 31%, 22% and 17%. As 2025 kicks off, RBC's updated list includes several additions, including ConocoPhillips and MSCI . Energy stock ConocoPhillips, which slumped nearly 15% last year, replaced Canadian Natural Resources in RBC's Top 30 list. Analyst Scott Hanold's $135 price target implies that the stock could surge nearly 34% from here. \"The depth, quality, and diversity of COP's global inventory sets it apart from E & P peers, and its strong balance sheet and low WTI breakeven point position it to fund its maintenance capital and dividend and increase shareholder value through commodity price cycles,\" RBC wrote. A less compelling setup for Canada's energy sector in 2025 contributed to Canadian Natural Resources' removal from the bank's top stocks list, the bank said. Within financials, MSCI replaced Intercontinental Exchange on RBC's list. Analyst Ashish Sabadra's $675 price target implies a potential upside of 12% for the stock. \"We think MSCI is well positioned to deliver high-single-digit revenue growth and 50+ bps margin expansion in 2025 with the benefit of improving Financial Services budgets, normalizing sales cycles, and normalizing pricing,\" the bank said. Shares of MSCI ended 2024 6% higher. Pinterest was one returning member of RBC's best ideas list. The social media platform slipped 22% last year, but is already up 13% in 2025. While the stock trades at a premium versus its peers, analyst Brad Erickson said this was justified given the company's fast-growing margins. Erickson's $48 price target is approximately 55% above where shares of Pinterest closed on Friday. \"Our price target is attributable to confidence in: the 3p ad partnership ramping more quickly than expected; higher ad load not negatively impacting engagement; and direct links and better relevance driving ROAS higher,\" he wrote. Other members of RBC's top stock ideas for 2025 include clean energy player First Solar and software platform Gitlab .",

            "content": "St Kitts and Nevis is a stunning tropical island paradise, famous for its friendly locals, pristine white sands and turquoise Caribbean waters.\n\nIt\u2019s also a popular jurisdiction for offshore trusts and its citizenship-by-investment (CBI) program for those seeking lifestyle and tax benefits.\n\nAnyone deciding that the warm weather, storied history and laid-back lifestyle in St Kitts is for them will be joining a vibrant and supportive expat community.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re interested in a second passport through its CBI program or simply want residence to live and work in the idyllic island nation, one of the first steps is to open a bank account.\n\nTo do that, you need to know how banking in St Kitts and Nevis works, including which banks are the easiest to access for foreigners and what documents are required.\n\nThe in-depth guide covers it all below, but if you want to learn more about moving offshore and saving taxes with a second citizenship or if you need help sorting your paperwork, preparing immigration documents and setting up foreign bank accounts, simply get in touch with our expert team.\n\nWhy Bank in St Kitts and Nevis?\n\nTucked away in the Eastern Caribbean\u2019s Leeward Islands chain, St Kitts and Nevis is a nation of two islands, each with its own unique allure.\n\nWith around 53,000 residents speaking English, this picturesque country gained independence from Britain in 1983. The capital, Basseterre, is the lively heart of the nation.\n\nAs far as banking and the local economy goes, St Kitts and Nevis uses the East Caribbean dollar (XCD), a currency shared with seven other neighbouring countries.\n\nThis currency is managed by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, conveniently located right in Basseterre. The bank plays a key role in ensuring the financial stability of the islands.\n\nOther factors that contribute to the security of banking in St Kitts and Nevis include its membership of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) which promotes economic harmonisation with nearby countries.\n\nWho Needs to Open a St Kitts and Nevis Bank Account?\n\nAside from applicants to the St Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment program, regular expatriates and retirees looking to relocate to these tropical islands will also benefit from local banking services.\n\nAs with many former colonies in the region, the traditional main driver of the economy was the country\u2019s now-defunct sugar industry.\n\nAfter the government shut down the last of its national sugar production plants in 2005, it started running up high levels of debt.\n\nTo offset this, the government began competing strongly to attract wealthy investors through its citizenship-by-investment program.\n\nBut before enjoying the perks of the program, which include a favourable tax regime and a passport offering visa-free travel throughout the EU and the UK, you will need to open a St Kitts bank account.\n\nTypes of Bank Accounts in St Kitts and Nevis\n\nThere are five types of bank accounts available in St Kitts and Nevis:\n\nSavings account: These can offer either a term deposit or a fixed deposit and can be opened for a duration of three, six or twelve months. With a regular savings account, you can earn interest payable each quarter. With a target savings account, you can set up an automatic transfer at set intervals. This will transfer money from another bank account into your savings account until a set target has been reached.\n\nCurrent account: You can also open a current account, making it easier to accept payments, transfer money in and out of the account, and set up auto payments to pay bills by direct debit. This can be set up automatically and managed by online banking. You also have overdraft and debit card functionality.\n\nEscrow account: Escrow accounts are used specifically for buying property. The payment is agreed upon in advance with a property developer and then held in escrow. The payment is only transferred to the developer once all contractual obligations have been met, and is then sent from the escrow account to the seller of the property by bank transfer.\n\n\n\nEscrow accounts are used specifically for buying property. The payment is agreed upon in advance with a property developer and then held in escrow. The payment is only transferred to the developer once all contractual obligations have been met, and is then sent from the escrow account to the seller of the property by bank transfer. Merchant account: A special type of account for companies who wish to make and receive electronic payments, including credit card payments.\n\nForeign currency account: St Kitts banks also allow you to open accounts in the following currencies:\n\nAustralian Dollar (AUD)\n\nBritish Pound Sterling (GBP)\n\nCanadian Dollar (CAD)\n\nEuro (EUR)\n\nHong Kong Dollar (HKD)\n\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n\nSingapore Dollar (SGD)\n\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n\nUAE Dirham (AED)\n\nUS Dollar (USD)\n\nOnline Banking\n\nOnline banking and mobile banking services are widely available in St Kitts and Nevis though exact features may vary. Therefore, you are advised to discuss it with the bank in advance to ensure their service fits your specific needs.\n\nBanking Options in St Kitts and Nevis\n\nUnlike some other offshore jurisdictions, there aren\u2019t as many international banks in St Kitts. Indeed the overall number of financial institutions in the country is quite low when compared to the Cayman Islands, for example.\n\nAs mentioned, all banks in St Kitts and Nevis are regulated by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in Basseterre.\n\nHere are the main banking options in the country:\n\nBank of Nevis (BON): Founded in 1985, Bank of Nevis Ltd. is a member of the Caribbean Association of Banks. It offers both personal and business banking, including wire transfer and online banking services. In 2019, it entered into an agreement to take over banking operations for both the Royal Bank of Canada and RBTT Bank of Trinidad and Tobago within the country.\n\nCIBC Bank: Also known as First Caribbean International Bank, it\u2019s part of Canada\u2019s CIBC group. The bank was formed in 2002 when the CIBC Group\u2019s regional subsidiary merged with its Barclay\u2019s Caribbean counterpart. It has branches throughout the Caribbean, including one in St Kitts. It offers personal and business banking, as well as corporate and investment banking services.\n\nHamilton Reserve Bank: This bank was named after Nevis-born Alexander Hamilton, who became one of the founding fathers of the United States. It offers a range of personal, business and private banking services. It also offers escrow accounts and foreign currency accounts, plus fast international money transfers, making it popular with international investors and other foreign customers.\n\nRepublic Bank: This is a Caribbean bank with operations in six locations throughout the region, including St Kitts and Nevis. In 2018, the group took over the Eastern Caribbean operations of the Canadian banking group Scotiabank. In 2022, the company upgraded its online banking services. It offers a range of account types, including chequing, savings and foreign currency accounts.\n\nSKNA: Is the abbreviation for St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla-National Bank. Founded in 1971, it is the oldest national bank in the country. It\u2019s also the largest bank in St Kitts and Nevis and offers both personal and commercial banking services. As a national bank, it\u2019s known for providing business development loans.\n\nHow to Open a Bank Account in St Kitts and Nevis\n\nTo open a bank account in Saint Kitts and Nevis you will need to provide a form of ID and a proof of address\n\nYou will also need to complete an application form.\n\nFor ID, you can use an official national photo ID, but we always recommend you use your passport.\n\nYour proof of address can be a utility bill or some other form of official correspondence ideally with a postmarked envelope.\n\nOther Bank Requirements\n\nThe bank may also ask you to provide additional documents to ascertain exactly why you wish to open a bank account in St Kitts and Nevis.\n\nFor example, if you are applying for citizenship by investment, they will require full details about the nature of your investment and how much you have to invest. You may also be asked to provide references to show that you are of good standing.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to bring some recent bank statements. These help demonstrate that you are a person of means and may also be accepted as proof of address.\n\nPreparing and compiling documents to open a bank account can take time. And that time can add up, getting in the way of what matters.\n\nBut as a Nomad Capitalist client, you don\u2019t have to sweat the small stuff because we do all the legwork for you.\n\nBanking in St Kitts and Nevis: FAQs\n\nCan foreigners open a bank account in St Kitts and Nevis? Yes, foreigners are allowed to open new accounts, though it does depend on the bank in question. Nevis Cooperative Credit Union, for example, is one of the local financial institutions which only allows locals to join and limits foreign transfers. How many banks are there in St Kitts and Nevis? Currently, there are at least 15 banks, including both local and international banks, present on the island nation. How do I open a bank account in St Kitts? To open a bank account in St Kitts, you\u2019ll need a current passport or government-issued photo ID, proof of residential address and a completed application including your statement of purpose for the account. Banks can request other documentation, however, depending on the type of account you are opening. Do banks in St Kitts and Nevis accept cryptocurrency? No. Banks in St Kitts and Nevis do not accept cryptocurrency. While crypto is accepted as a source of funds, it cannot be used as currency to purchase items or open a bank account.\n\nIs St Kitts and Nevis the Right Choice for You?\n\nIf you plan to live or work there, banking in St Kitts and Nevis offers plenty of advantages, from a stable financial environment to strong confidentiality policies.\n\nThese features make it an attractive destination for those seeking to diversify their financial holdings or gain a foothold in the Caribbean market.\n\nBut how do you know if opening a bank account or pursuing citizenship here aligns with your goals?\n\nAt Nomad Capitalist, our team can guide you in assessing your personal and financial goals to determine if St Kitts and Nevis is the right choice.\n\nWhether you\u2019re considering the benefits of local banking or exploring the popular citizenship-by-investment program, we\u2019re here to provide expert insights tailored to your unique situation.\n\nWe\u2019ve successfully assisted thousands of seven- and eight-figure entrepreneurs in making strategic financial decisions and are confident we can help you navigate the process.\n\nTo explore how St Kitts and Nevis might fit into your financial future, reach out today.",

            "content": "Canada's top execs rake in 210 times the annual pay of their average worker, think tank laments\n\nA report on Canada\u2019s 100 highest-paid CEOs said the country's top business execs pocketed $13.2 million, on average, in 2023.\n\nThe Top 100 were paid 210 times more than the average worker\u2019s wage that year, the progressive think tank Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) reported.\n\nBy the first working day of the year, Jan. 2 at 10:54 a.m., the 100 CEOs had already earned, on average, $62,661 \u2014 the equivalent of the average Canadian worker's salary for the entire year.\n\nThe CCPA said it has been tracking CEO pay since 2007, pushing for fairer taxes as one tool to reduce the extreme pay gap between CEOs and the average worker.\n\nOver the past 25 years, the think tank said that gap has been growing. In 1998, the ratio of CEO salary to worker salary was 104 times. It was closer to 150 times in 2009 and now is over 210 times, the think tank says.\n\nWhere are all these well-compensated CEOs based?\n\nThe CCPA report lists CEOs with companies with head offices based in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Montreal, Halifax, Hamilton, Ottawa, and even a few in Cambridge, Waterloo and Guelph.\n\nThe CEO at the top of the list is Patrick Dovigi, 45, the chief executive of Vaughan-based GFL Environmental Inc. His waste management company has a large curbside pickup contract with the City of Toronto.\n\nIn the other top spots are held by the CEOs of Loblaw, auto parts giant Magna and Restaurant Brands International, which operates Tim Hortons, Burger King and other quick-service restaurants.\n\nBelow are the CEOs from Toronto-area companies who made the CCPA's Top 100 list.\n\n(The CEOs' total compensation includes salary, share based awards, option based awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, pension value, and all other compensation.

            "content": "Mrs. T and I are working toward financial independence by investing in dividend stocks and index ETFs. Our plan is to live off dividends by having between $60,000 to $70,000 in dividend income. We may also do some part time work to supplement our dividend income. Because of that, we are always on the lookout for great dividend stocks to invest in. What are some of the best Canadian dividend stocks?\n\nWhen it comes to picking dividend stocks, it is important to not just look at the dividend yield alone. Many dividend investors fall into the dividend yield trap by only looking at stocks with high dividend yields. We certainly fell into the trap in the past. It is always important to consider the dividend payout ratio to determine whether the dividend payout is safe or not.\n\nOther factors like dividend growth rate, earning history, company revenue growth, return on equities, and cash flow are also important to monitor.\n\nTotal return matters. I\u2019d rather have a dividend portfolio yielding 3% and have my principal growing consistently each year than a dividend portfolio yielding 8% but my principal shrinking each year.\n\nPer our dividend portfolio, we own quite a number of Canadian dividend stocks. We own more Canadian dividend stocks not because of home bias, it\u2019s mostly due to the added cost of exchanging CAD to USD.\n\nWhich stocks made my best Canadian dividend stocks list?\n\nTop 13 Canadian Dividend Stocks\n\nHere are my best 13 Canadian dividend stocks for 2025. These picks are based on total return- a combination of dividend growth and stock price appreciation.\n\n1. Alimentation Couche-Tard (ATD)\n\nAlimentation Couche-Tard doesn\u2019t have the highest dividend yield but its dividend growth rate over the last ten years has been fantastic. ATD also has had some fantastic revenue growth and strong cash flow. The strong growth is attributed to the 14,000 convenience stores across the globe.\n\nSector: Consumer Defensive\n\nConsumer Defensive Dividend Yield: 0.93%\n\n0.93% Dividend Payout: 13%\n\n13% PE Ratio: 18.44\n\n18.44 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 21.2%\n\n21.2% Dividend Increase Streak: 13 years\n\nDespite the low dividend yield, ATD has been growing its dividends at an impressive rate. For those investors with long time line, ATD is a great pick for total return and compounding dividends. Furthermore, the defensive nature of the business makes ATD a great pick if you\u2019re worried about recessions.\n\nATD is one of those stocks that the share price just keeps climbing over the last five years. Again, I think it\u2019s an excellent choice for total return.\n\n2. Equitable Group (EQB)\n\nEquitable Group serves a growing number of Canadians through Equitable Bank. Equitable Bank has grown over the years to become the seventh largest independent Schedule I bank by assets in Canada.\n\nEQB offers Canadians the chance to earn high interest rates with their money and not pay fees for everyday banking. Positioning themselves differently than traditional banks, EQB has more than 290,000 customer base in Canada and growing.\n\nSector: Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services Dividend Yield: 2.05%\n\n2.05% Dividend Payout Ratio: 16%\n\n16% PE Ratio: 8.76\n\n8.76 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 20.6%\n\n20.6% Dividend Increase Streak: 1 year\n\nIn recent years, EQB has announced some pretty hefty dividend increases. If you\u2019re looking for a high dividend growth Canadian stock, EQB would be the one to consider\n\n3. National Bank (NA.TO)\n\nNational Bank is the sixth-largest bank in Canada with Quebec contributing 62% of its revenues. While the majority of National Bank\u2019s revenue comes from Quebec, the bank is expanding quickly in the rest of Canada.\n\nNational Bank has raised dividends for 13 straight years and has had solid total returns compared to its peers.\n\nSector: Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services Dividend Yield: 3.84%\n\n3.84% Dividend Payout Ratio: 44%\n\n44% PE Ratio: 11.66\n\n11.66 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 9.7%\n\n9.7% Dividend Increase Streak: 13 years\n\nNational Bank recently announced they have received final approval to proceed with the acquisition of Canadian Western Bank. As a shareholder, I do like the acquisition because National Bank would be able to expand their footprint in Western Canada.\n\n4. Brookfield Asset Management (BAM.TO)\n\nBrookfield Asset Management is a leading global alternative asset manager with over $850 billion of assets under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity and credit.\n\nSector: Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services Dividend Yield: 3.38%\n\n3.38% Dividend Payout Ratio: 21%\n\n21% PE Ratio: 8.69\n\n8.69 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: n/a\n\nn/a Dividend Increase Streak: n/a\n\nPlease note, since BAM is a newly formed entity, some of the financial parameters are not yet available.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management had declared that it plans to pay 90% of its profits and grow the dividend payout every year. This makes BAM very attractive for dividend investors.\n\nI picked Brookfield Asset Management over Brookfield Corporation because of the higher dividend yield. BAM is more suitable for dividend investors looking for income.\n\nNow, if you are looking for higher total returns, you may want to consider Brookfield Corporation (BN).\n\n5. Intact Financial (IFC.TO)\n\nIntact Financial is Cana\u2019s largest provider of property and casualty insurance. The company has over 16,000 employees and insures more than five million individuals and businesses through its insurance subsidiaries.\n\nSector: Financial\n\nFinancial Dividend Yield: 2.21%\n\n2.21% Dividend Payout: 58%\n\n58% PE Ratio: 26.23\n\n26.23 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 9.3%\n\n9.3% Dividend Increase Streak: 18 years\n\nIntact Financial was one of the first dividend paying stocks that we purchased and it has done very well over the years compared to Manulife and Sun Life.\n\nIts stellar return is probably the number one reason why the PE ratio is so much higher compared to Manulife and Sun Life.\n\nEnbridge is one of the leading North American infrastructure companies with a vast network of pipelines. In fact, Enbridge owns an extensive network of about 192,000 miles of natural gas and NGL pipelines across North America and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSince our reliance on natural gas and crude oil isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, we will need to continue to rely on Enbridge\u2019s pipelines to transport these valuable assets across North America. Environmental concerns and the inability to build new pipelines mean Enbridge\u2019s existing pipeline network is even more valuable than before.\n\nSector: Energy\n\nEnergy Dividend Yield: 7.67%\n\n7.67% Dividend Payout Ratio: 190%\n\n190% PE Ratio: 18.8\n\n18.8 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 7.3%\n\n7.3% Dividend Increase Streak: 27 years\n\nThe Enbridge management expects a 5-7% dividend growth rate moving forward. Given the high initial yield, this is a very solid dividend growth.\n\nDespite being known as a pipeline company, transporting natural gas and oil across North America, Enbridge is working to increase its renewable footprint.\n\nEnbridge announced it plans to acquire a trio of US companies to create North America\u2019s largest natural gas utility franchise. While the market didn\u2019t like this announcement, as a shareholder, I like Enbridge\u2019s plan to be more like a utility company. Given TC Energy\u2019s recent announcement on splitting the company into two, I suspect Enbridge will plan to do something similar in the near future.\n\nFor investors looking for income, Enbridge is a great choice. It definitely falls under the high yield low dividend growth category.\n\n7. Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO)\n\nCanadian Natural Resources is a natural gas and heavy crude oil producer that operates primarily in Western Canada.\n\nSector: Energy\n\nEnergy Dividend Yield: 3.98%\n\n3.98% Payout Ratio: 53%\n\n53% PE Ratio: 14.21\n\n14.21 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 23%\n\n23% Dividend Increase Streak: 22 years\n\nCNQ has shown consistently that it can weather the storm. It managed to keep the same dividend payout throughout the pandemic instead of cutting dividends like many Canadian energy companies. Recently CNQ announced an impressive 11% dividend payout increase to reward its shareholders.\n\nCNQ\u2019s management also told investors that it expects to hit $10B in net debt in Q1 2024, which means special dividends are on the table for 2024.\n\n8. TD Bank (TD.TO)\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank is a Canada-based bank, which operates in North America. TD is one of the largest banks in Canada and the 5th largest bank in North America. It is an online financial services firm, with over 14 million online and mobile customers. Its segments include Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, Wholesale Banking and Corporate.\n\nSector: Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services Dividend Yield: 5.06%\n\n5.06% Dividend Payout Ratio: 50%\n\n50% PE Ratio: 12.38\n\n12.38 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 8.7%\n\n8.7% Dividend Increase Streak: 12 years\n\nTD doesn\u2019t just generate its income from the Canadian market. In fact, TD gets more than 30% of its net income from the US division which has 1,160 retail locations in the US. Overall, TD has a very large retail presence in North America with more than 2,200 retail locations across the continent.\n\nDo you know people who switch banks regularly? Probably not too many.\n\nBecause people don\u2019t change banks regularly, TD should continue to benefit from its large client base. Many young adults are TD clients because their parents bank with TD. Once these young adults have kids, it\u2019s very likely they will set their kids up with TD for financial service. Who doesn\u2019t like a perpetual client base?\n\nGiven that TD has an initial yield of around 5% right now, I believe at current share price level, TD is very attractive as a long term holding.\n\nTD share price has stumbled due to the the money laundering investigation in the US. TD will need to pay a hefty fine but for long term investors I think this provides a good buying opportunity.\n\n9. Canadian National Railway (CNR.TO)\n\nCanadian National Railway Company has a network of approximately 20,000 route miles of track that spans Canada and mid-America, connecting approximately three coasts, including the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico and serving the cities and ports of Vancouver, Prince Rupert (British Columbia), Montreal, Halifax, New Orleans, and Mobile (Alabama), and the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary, Chicago, Memphis, Detroit, Duluth (Minnesota)/Superior (Wisconsin), and Jackson (Mississippi), with connections to all points in North America.\n\nSector: Industrials\n\nIndustrials Dividend Yield: 2.08%\n\n2.08% Dividend Payout Ratio: 43%\n\n43% PE Ratio: 20.31\n\n20.31 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2%\n\n12.2% Dividend Increase Streak: 27 years\n\nCNR is a very diversified company. No one particular product line accounted for more than 25% of the total revenues. And the company has one of the lowest operation ratios of all American railway companies that are publicly traded.\n\nCanadian National Railway has a pretty low dividend yield, but the key here is its high dividend growth rate over the years. The company currently has a 20 year dividend growth rate of 16.3%. Needless to say, CNR shareholders get rewarded when holding the stock for the long term.\n\nAlthough rail is not frequently used for passenger travels here in North America, rail is still one of the most cost-efficient ways of transporting goods. Canadian National Railway\u2019s large rail network will allow the company to provide transportation services in North America and bring profits to shareholders.\n\nFortis is a Canada-based electric and gas utility holding company. The Company\u2019s segments include Regulated Utilities and Non-Regulated Utilities. Fortis serves many different regions, including Arizona, BC, Alberta, New York, Newfoundland, Ontario, PEI, and the Caribbean.\n\nSector: Utilities\n\nUtilities Dividend Yield: 4.55%\n\n4.55% Dividend Payout Ratio: 83.7%\n\n83.7% PE ratio: 16.74\n\n16.74 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 6%\n\n6% Dividend Increase Streak: 50 years\n\nWho doesn\u2019t like the 49 years of dividend increase streak?\n\nFortis is one of the few Canadian dividend paying stocks that can be called the Canadian dividend aristocrats. With a dividend yield of over 4% and a solid dividend growth history, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to create a dividend portfolio without Fortis in it.\n\n11. Royal Bank (RY.TO)\n\nRoyal Bank is the largest bank in Canada. If we look at Royal Bank\u2019s earnings, 45% came from personal & commercial banking, 24% came from capital markets, 19% came from wealth management, 7% came from insurance, and 5% came from investor & treasury services.\n\nRoyal Bank medium term financial performance objectives\n\nRY serves personal, business, public sector and institutional clients in Canada, the United States and approximately 40 other countries.\n\nDespite being the largest bank in Canada, Royal Bank set out a plan in 2018 to attract new Canadian banking clients. So far they\u2019re on track to meet this target.\n\nSector: Financial Services\n\nFinancial Services Dividend Yield: 4.14%\n\n4.14% Dividend Payout Ratio: 47.7%\n\n47.7% PE Ratio: 12.45\n\n12.45 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 7.3%\n\n7.3% Dividend Increase Streak: 12 years\n\nRoyal Bank has been paying dividends since 1870 and has never missed a dividend payment since. Let that sink in! The 150 year of dividend payment streak is pretty darn impressive if you ask me.\n\nRoyal Bank\u2019s share price has been depressed the last year so it may be a good time to load up and wait for the stock price to recover.\n\nTelus is one of the big three Canadian telecommunication companies based in Vancouver BC. The Company provides a range of telecommunications services and products, including wireless and wireline voice and data. Telus has around 11 million subscribers and they have increased its dividend nearly every year since 2002.\n\nSector: Communication Services\n\nCommunication Services Dividend Yield: 6.94%\n\n6.94% Dividend Payout Ratio: 176%\n\n176% PE Ratio: 37.54\n\n37.54 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 6.6%\n\n6.6% Dividend Increase Streak: 19 years\n\nSince the launch of smartphones and data plans, more and more Canadians are addicted to these smart devices. This addiction has helped Telus to continue making a massive amount of profit. Telus\u2019 board is very shareholder friendly and has declared that they have a goal to continue increasing dividends by 7 to 10% in future years. Telus usually raises dividend payout twice a year and recently announced a 3.56% dividend payout increase.\n\nLike many telecoms, Telus\u2019 share price has taken a beating lately due to concerns with telecoms\u2019 debt level. While concerning, let\u2019s not forget that telecoms require a lot of investments to improve their infrastructures so it\u2019s normal to see high level of debt. Yes, if the interest rates don\u2019t come down, the the debt and interests will drag the telecoms down. However, I believe interest rates will slowly creep down and the telecoms should recover in the medium term.\n\n13. Granite REIT (GRT.UN)\n\nGranite REIT is a Canadian-based real estate investment trust engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership management of logistics, warehouse and industrial properties in North America and Europe.\n\nSector: Industrial REIT\n\nIndustrial REIT Dividend Yield: 4.71%\n\n4.71% PE Ratio: 7.52\n\n7.52 5 Year Dividend Growth Rate: 3.5%\n\n3.5% Dividend Increase Streak: 12 years\n\nGRT.UN\u2019s portfolio consists of 137 investment properties representing almost 62.9 million square feet of leasable area with an occupancy rate of 96.3%. These numbers are very impressive for REITs. I have come to really like Granite REIT for its global footprint with a focus on institutional-quality assets in key distribution and e-commerce markets.\n\nAs online shopping gets more popular, online retailers like Amazon and Wayfair need to have warehouses in major cities to store merchandise. GRT.UN should benefit from this shopping trend.\n\n13 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks \u2013 Final Thoughts\n\nHere you have it, my picks for the best Canadian Dividend Stocks. I picked these stocks from different sectors to help build a diversified dividend portfolio. For the most part, investing in Canadian banks, Canadian utilities, and Canadian telecoms is a very easy and straight forward way of DIY investing and receiving juicy dividends.\n\nWant to learn to construct your own dividend investing portfolio and start investing in dividend paying stocks? I went through several methods on how I shortlist and screen dividend paying stocks. You may also want to take a look at this Canadian Dividend Calendar to see when the Canadian dividend all stars pay out dividends.\n\nSome of you might wonder if preferred shares have a place in your portfolio. This is a very personal question and totally depends on whether your aim is total return or dividend income. Personally, I think there are too many preferred shares available and it can be very confusing looking at preferred shares from the same company and understanding all the different jargon. Therefore, if you\u2019re considering holding preferred shares in your portfolio, it might be a good idea to utilize one of the best preferred share ETFs in Canada and let the professionals manage it for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this post, you are probably managing your own portfolio and may not want to use an ETF and pay the management fee, is there a way to do that? Fortunately, some smart folks created Passiv to do that for you automatically. With Passiv, the tool can put your portfolio on autopilot. You can build your own personalized index, invest, and rebalance all through a click of a button. Passiv can even calculate and execute the trades needed to keep your portfolio balanced. Essentially, Passive makes investing super simple! A community user account is free to sign up for. The elite member account is $99 per year\u2026but it\u2019s free for Questrade clients! Make sure to check out Passiv.\n\nIn case you\u2019re curious, for diversification outside of Canada, we hold a handful of US dividend paying stocks. In addition, we utilize one of the low cost ex-Canada ETFs like XAW to diversify our portfolio internationally.\n\nDo you already own dividend stocks and want to create a spreadsheet to track your portfolio? Take a look at my Google Spreadsheet Dividend Portfolio Template.\n\nThe dividend-growth lovers over at Million Dollar Journey have their own list of Canada\u2019s best dividend stocks, which focuses heavily on earnings-per-share, and forward earnings-per-share as their main dividend stock valuation metrics. This again, makes intuitive sense from a dividend-growth perspective, as companies that have a lot of free cash flow \u2013 plus a history of raising their dividends \u2013 should be ideally positioned to keep those dividends growing far into the future.\n\nIs it better to purchase one of these top Canadian dividend stocks, or purchase lesser known Canadian dividend stocks with lower yield and higher dividend growth? This is a personal decision you need to make yourself. Personally, I believe a mix of both.\n\nNote: This blog post represents my opinion and not an advice/recommendation to purchase these stocks. Before you buy any stocks, please consult with a qualified financial planner.",

            "content": "As we approach the end of the year, there\u2019s a new deadline to keep in mind for your tax and investment planning: FHSA contributions. The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) offers another great opportunity for Canadians to save and invest with tax advantages.\n\nThe deadline\n\nThe annual contribution period for the FHSA is January 1st to December 31st. This means that you must contribute before December 31st to have your contribution amount deducted from your taxable income for 2024. Note that this is different from the deadline for your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Unlike RRSPs, any contributions you make to an FHSA in the first 60 days of the year can\u2019t be deducted from the previous year\u2019s income.\n\nGet to know the FHSA\n\nNow that the deadline is on your radar, let\u2019s review the basics of the account. Launched in April 2023, the newest registered plan is designed to help more people get into the housing market. It allows eligible Canadian investors to deposit up to $40,000 over a 15-year period. From a tax perspective, it combines the advantages of two existing registered plans \u2014 the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and the tax-free savings account (TFSA). Like an RRSP, contributions to an FHSA can be used to reduce your taxable income. Like a TFSA, if you are making a qualifying withdrawal, you won\u2019t pay tax on that withdrawal (including the principal amount and any potential investment growth).\n\nYou can contribute up to $8,000 per year to an FHSA, up to a lifetime maximum of $40,000. Unused room can be carried over to the next year (to a maximum of $8,000). Remember, the carry-forward amounts start accumulating only after you open the account. You can open multiple FHSAs, but the annual and lifetime contribution limits apply to the combined accounts, so be careful with your contributions. There is a one-per-cent tax applied to over-contributions for each month the excess amount stays in the account.\n\nYou have 15 years to save within an FHSA. If you decide not to buy a home during that time, you can transfer the money you\u2019ve saved (and any investment income earned) directly to an RRSP or a RRIF without penalty or tax at the time of transfer. Keep in mind that funds transferred from an FHSA to an RRSP or RRIF account may be taxable when withdrawn.\n\nTo get more details about the benefits of the FHSA, read 9 Questions Answered About the New First Home Savings Account or watch the video below.\n\nSave for your first home, tax-free The new First Home Savings Account is here Learn More\n\nDisclaimers Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Mutual Funds Inc.

            "content": "The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution limit will be $7,000 in 2025, matching the 2024 amount. Every year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) declares the annual TFSA contribution limit, which is indexed to inflation and then rounded to the nearest $500. What else should you know? Read on.\n\nWho can open a TFSA?\n\nIf you\u2019re a Canadian resident with a Social Insurance Number (SIN) who is at least 18 (or the age of majority in your province of residence) you can qualify to open a TFSA account.\n\nHow do I use the limit to calculate my TFSA contribution room?\n\nTo calculate the total room in your TFSA available for contributions, you can add this year\u2019s contribution limit to any unused contribution room from previous years, plus any amount withdrawn in the previous year.\n\nNote: generally, your contribution room starts accumulating from the time you turn 18, or in 2009* (when the TFSA was introduced), whichever is later. So, if you open a new TFSA in 2025 and have never contributed to a TFSA elsewhere, you could have total available contribution room of $102,000, up from $95,000. You can find your TFSA contribution room by logging into My Account on the CRA website, although it doesn\u2019t reflect any contributions already made in the current year. It\u2019s important to double check your contribution room each year as CRA charges penalties for over-contributing.\n\nWhy is the TFSA limit important?\n\nIf you make contributions that exceed your room, you can be taxed 1 per cent per month on that amount. It\u2019s also important to know what counts as a contribution. For example, transferring money between TFSAs in different institutions when done correctly will not affect your contribution room. However, if you withdraw the funds and then contribute them to another TFSA, it qualifies as a new contribution and could result in an over-contribution penalty.\n\nWhat is the TFSA Contribution Deadline?\n\nYou can contribute to your TFSA at any time of year since any unused contribution room carries forward to the next year. Unlike a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), there is no tax deduction with a TFSA contribution, so your deposits don\u2019t need to coincide with tax time. However, for the purposes of managing your contributions and withdrawals, and knowing your TFSA limit, Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 are significant dates. Your contribution room is based on the calendar year ending Dec. 31, and your new TFSA limit for the year comes into effect on Jan. 1.\n\n\n\nYour TFSA can be a powerful and tax-efficient tool when investing for short-term and long-term goals. Find out more about TFSAs here.\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

In 1998, the ratio of CEO salary to worker salary was 104 times. It was closer to 150 times in 2009 and now is over 210 times, the think tank says.\n\nWhere are all these well-compensated CEOs based?\n\nThe CCPA report lists CEOs with companies with head offices based in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Montreal, Halifax, Hamilton, Ottawa, and even a few in Cambridge, Waterloo and Guelph.\n\nThe CEO at the top of the list is Patrick Dovigi, 45, the chief executive of Vaughan-based GFL Environmental Inc. His waste management company has a large curbside pickup contract with the City of Toronto.\n\nIn the other top spots are held by the CEOs of Loblaw, auto parts giant Magna and Restaurant Brands International, which operates Tim Hortons, Burger King and other quick-service restaurants.\n\nBelow are the CEOs from Toronto-area companies who made the CCPA's Top 100 list.\n\n(The CEOs' total compensation includes salary, share based awards, option based awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, pension value, and all other compensation.

This marks the fifth consecutive cut to rates in 2024, and the second consecutive 50-basis-point cut.\n\nWith lower borrowing rates comes the likelihood of more robust activity throughout the winter months and an earlier-than-normal spring market, leading to upward pressure on home prices.\n\nAccording to the Royal LePage 2025 Market Survey Forecast, the aggregate price of a home in Canada is set to increase 6.0% year over year to $856,692 in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the median price of a single-family detached property and condominium projected to increase 7.0% and 3.5% to $900,833 and $605,993, respectively. Sidelined buyers are being encouraged back to the market\n\nThis latest significant rate cut will help to sustain activity throughout the winter months, typically the slowest period for real estate transactions in Canada,\u201d said Phil Soper, president and CEO of Royal LePage. \u201cBuyers have woken up to the reality that property prices are rising again, and more will feel an urgency to act before affordability erodes. As a result, we are anticipating a \u2018pull-ahead\u2019 of activity and an early start to the traditional spring housing market. Adding to this momentum is the change in lending policies that come into effect on December 15th, which we believe will coax more sidelined purchasers to take advantage of their expanded borrowing power.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of Canada will make its next interest rate announcement on Wednesday, January 29, 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s time to buy. Slightly lower rates, decent inventory, get off the fence; if you wait then you will be competing with many more buyers.",

However, this progress has \u201creversed only a fraction of the pandemic-era spike,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt remains extremely difficult for average households to afford a home in the Vancouver area despite significant improvements in the affordability measure [in 2024],\u201d said the report.\n\nRBC\u2019s report said in the third quarter of 2024, 96.7 per cent of the median household income was needed for homeownership in Vancouver. Other Canadian cities required a significantly lower share of household income, such as Calgary (42.2 per cent), Edmonton (33.6), Ottawa (47.3) and Montreal (49.4).\n\nHogue said he expects the Bank of Canada to cut its policy rate again in 2025, further lowering homeownership costs. RBC anticipates a two-per-cent policy rate by mid-2025. The key rate currently sits at 3.25 per cent.\n\nHowever, if Vancouver\u2019s housing market heats up again, any sizable price increases would be a setback, Hogue said in the report.\n\n\u201cExceptionally strained conditions weighed heavily on resale activity in the past two-and-a-half years, hovering near cyclical lows,\u201d the report said of Vancouver. \u201cHowever, signs of renewed vigour emerged this fall, which will be sustained in 2025. Still, with inventories growing and market conditions generally balanced, we see prices staying largely flat in the near term.\u201d\n\nRBC noted an easing of homeownership costs such as mortgage payments, property taxes and utilities. The bank also attributed recent progress to income gains, which it said increased by about 4.4 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nHowever, despite modest improvement, RBC said its affordability index still hovers around its worst-ever levels both nationally and in many big cities.\n\nLooking ahead, RBC said that in addition to lower interest rates, other measures could make a difference. These include regulatory changes such as a new 30-year amortization period (up from 25 years) on insured mortgages taken out by first-time homebuyers.\n\n\u201cThis change would reduce monthly payments by approximately eight per cent on the purchase of a home at the national benchmark price,\u201d the report said.\n\nOverall, RBC is forecasting small price increases, moderately lower interest rates and steadily growing household incomes, a cocktail that could help move affordability a bit closer to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to the reversal of more than a third of the massive deterioration in RBC\u2019s aggregate affordability measure that happened during the pandemic,\u201d said the report.\n\n[email protected]\n\n@JamiMakan",

            "content": "While saving any cash for a rainy day is a good idea, investing that cash is an even better idea.\n\nHow to Get Ready for New 2025 TFSA Changes\n\nWith a new year upon us, Canadian investors get to take advantage of new TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) contribution room. The Canada Revenue Agency increased the 2025 contribution limit by $7,000. The more you can invest tax-free, the more you can compound your wealth over time.\n\nIf you turn 18 years old in 2025, you can only contribute a total of $7,000 to the TFSA. However, if you were born in 1991 or earlier (and were a Canadian resident by 2009), you can contribute a grand total of $102,000!\n\nStart saving regularly for your TFSA\n\nIf you are a new TFSA investor, even $7,000 might seem like a lot. However, if you break your contribution up throughout the year, it is much more tangible. A $585 per month instalment is a lot more tangible contribution than a $7,000 lump sum.\n\nUnfortunately, many Canadians waste their TFSA by treating it as a mere high interest savings account. While saving any cash for a rainy day is a good idea, investing that cash is an even better idea.\n\nYour TFSA can be worth many multiples of your initial contributions if you invest wisely\n\nJust $7,000 compounded by a 10% annual rate of return for 15 years could be worth almost $30,000. When you don\u2019t pay tax, your returns add up more quickly. If that same $7,000 sat in a high interest TFSA account (say earning only 2% annual interest (if you are lucky)), that cash would only be worth $9,421 in 15 years.\n\nThat is more than a $20,000 difference! If you have a long time horizon, investing through your TFSA is a wonderful way to build wealth.\n\nIf you are wondering what kind of stocks to hold, here are two known Canadian companies that have delivered steady 10%-plus average returns over the past many years.\n\nRoyal Bank: Returns better than you might think\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily have to look hard to find great winners for the long run. With a market cap of $243 billion, Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) is Canada\u2019s largest publicly listed company. Yet, it has still delivered really solid returns for shareholders.\n\nIf you add in the dividends it has distributed, it has earned a total compounded annual return of 12.6% over the past 15 years. The bank is very prudently managed. RBC has managed to deliver a consistency that most other Canadian banks have not harnessed.\n\nRoyal Bank has avoided many of the pitfalls that TD Bank has slammed into. As a result, it is quickly taking market share from its largest competitors.\n\nAfter rising 33% in 2024, Royal is not the cheapest bank. However, if you want a quality, reliable company in your TFSA, that is what you will get with Royal.\n\nCPKC: A solid blue chip for the long run\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (TSX:CP) is another blue chip stock worth holding in a TFSA. 2024 wasn\u2019t a great year for its stock. However, the past 15 years have delivered pretty good 10.5% compounded annual total returns.\n\nWhile the past is good, the future could be even better. After Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern Railway, it nearly doubled the size of its railroad network. It also became the only North American railroad that extends across the continent both by length and width.\n\nThe company believes it could grow earnings per share by a strong mid-teens rate for the foreseeable future. With a strong management team, a great network, and many growth opportunities, this stock could deliver very solid returns for TFSA investors in the years ahead.",

With its artistic flair and creative buzz, it\u2019s the kind of place you\u2019ll want to take your time exploring.\n\nThe food\n\nBuffalo has a few famous culinary classics you won\u2019t want to miss on your shopping trip across the border. From wings to hotdogs to pizza, it\u2019s not hard to find regional specialties to fill you up after a long day on your feet.\n\nWings are serious business in Buffalo, and there are some rules to follow. First, and most importantly, don\u2019t call them Buffalo Wings (they\u2019re just \u201cwings\u201d here); request blue cheese instead of ranch, and order them medium. The Anchor Bar is known to have served the first batch and is still a favourite among locals, as is Gabriel\u2019s Gate in Allentown, Nine-Eleven Tavern and Duff\u2019s Famous Wings.\n\nBeef on Weck is Buffalo\u2019s longtime favourite sandwich. This carved roast beef delight on a salted hard roll with caraway seeds is rumoured to be only found in Buffalo. Some of the most popular spots to grab one include Schwabl\u2019s, Bar-Bill Tavern and Charlie The Butcher.\n\nBuffalo Style Pizza is a cross between Chicago deep dish and New York thin slice. You can find floppy, two-handed slices at renowned pizza joints Bob and John\u2019s La Hacienda, Bocce Club Pizza and Imperial Pizza, to name a few.\n\nHot Dogs in Buffalo are grilled on an open bed on charcoal. Ted\u2019s Hot Dogs, with eight locations in the Buffalo area and serving dogs since 1927, is the go-to spot! But plenty of stands crank out classic hot dogs, fries and shakes to satisfy your craving.\n\nFrom glossy malls to creative neighbourhoods, Buffalo doesn\u2019t disappoint as a U.S. shopping destination. Just a hop across the border and a reasonable drive from Toronto, it\u2019s no wonder Buffalo remains a shopping hot spot for Canadians looking for deals \u2014 or just something different.",

            "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s still well up from where it has stood historically,\u201d said David Macdonald, report author and senior economist at the CCPA.\n\nFactors leading to the decline included lower profits in 2023 and workers making wage gains after the most recent bout of inflation, he said.\n\nThe CCPA calculates that by 10:54 a.m. on Jan. 2, the average CEO on the list had made $62,661 \u2014 the average annual income for a Canadian worker.\n\nThe gap between CEOs and regular workers has grown significantly, the report found. The 100 top-paid CEOs earned on average 210 times more than the average worker did in 2023, while in 1998, they earned 104 times more.\n\nThe highest-paid Canadian CEO in 2023 was Patrick Dovigi of GFL Environmental Inc., whose total compensation was $68.5 million.\n\nHe was followed by Joshua Kobza of Restaurant Brands International Inc. at $39.1 million, then R.M. Kruger of Suncor Energy Inc. at $36.8 million.\n\nTop paid names in financial services\n\nManulife Financial Corp.\u2019s Roy Gori was the best-paid exec in financial services, coming in at No. 12, with $19.3 million. Other names on the list are Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s David McKay at $16.1 million; Intact Financial Corp.\u2019s Charles Brindamour with total compensation of $15.2 million; Power Corp. of Canada\u2019s R. Jeffrey Orr at $14.1 million; TD Bank\u2019s Bharat Masrani at $13.4 million; Bank of Montreal\u2019s Darryl White at $12.5 million; Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.\u2019s Connor Teskey at $12.2 million; and Onex Corp.\u2019s Robert M. LeBlanc at $11.5 million.\n\nSalaries were generally not the main source of CEOs\u2019 total compensation, with most of it coming instead from other forms of compensation like share-based awards and option-based awards.\n\n\u201cSalaries make up an ever smaller proportion of their overall compensation,\u201d said Macdonald, adding that sometimes an executive will even take a salary of just a dollar \u2014 including Tobi L\u00fctke of Shopify and Murray Edwards of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., both on 2023\u2019s list.\n\nThe average cash bonus for these CEOs was $2.3 million in 2023, the CCPA said, adding that though in theory bonuses are meant to be tied to the company\u2019s performance, in reality bonuses tend to rise regardless of whether the company is having a good year.\n\nThe three main types of non-salary compensation are direct share awards \u2014 where a person is paid in shares instead of dollars \u2014 cash bonuses, and stock options, said Macdonald.\n\nMost of the CEOs on the list are men, with just three women making the list \u2014 outnumbered by both CEOs named Scott (five) and Michael (four).\n\nBut the report isn\u2019t all bad news, noted Macdonald \u2014 for example, workers\u2019 pay went up substantially in 2023 as it caught up to inflation, he said. As well, those three women on the list made on average more than the Scotts and Michaels.\n\nSince the CCPA has been tracking CEO pay, it\u2019s also been tracking policy changes that could help narrow the gap between executives and regular workers.\n\nOne such change happened in 2024, when the inclusion rate for taxing capital gains was increased to more than 66% (compared with 100% for employment income) for gains above $250,000 for individuals, though this of course didn\u2019t affect CEOs in 2023.\n\nHowever, capital gains don\u2019t apply until stocks are actually sold, noted Macdonald, meaning the tax revenue from the change is potential \u2014 some people might hold on to those stocks in the hopes the policy will change in the future.\n\nAnother such change happened in 2021, when the federal government capped the stock option tax deduction at $200,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the impact on CEO pay\u201d from that change, said Macdonald. \u201cStock options as a means of being paid have been cut in half for CEOs since 2021.\u201d\n\nInstead, there\u2019s a \u201cpretty decisive shift\u201d toward direct share awards, he said.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that the stock options \u2026 were, from a tax perspective, a better way to be paid.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s report also investigated the idea that companies need to offer high compensation to attract top CEOs.\n\n\u201cIn the real world, it\u2019s a much more mundane explanation,\u201d said Macdonald.\n\nHe said in fact, more than three-quarters of the CEOs on the list got the job from within the company, working at their firms for an average of 21 years.\n\nThis \u201creally reveals the bankruptcy of this idea that these insane pay levels are about competition,\u201d said Macdonald.\n\nThe report recommends a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on Canadians worth more than $10 million, which it says could raise $32 billion a year. This is a much more direct approach than addressing stock options or capital gains, said Macdonald.\n\nThe report also recommends higher top marginal tax brackets.\n\n\u201cHistorically speaking, Canada\u2019s marginal tax rate for the richest is low,\u201d the report said, with the top brackets within the 70% range in the postwar years, compared with roughly 50% now.",

I don\u2019t shy away from challenging my teams to think big or set goals that might make them uncomfortable. There has been several times throughout my career where a team member thanked me for stretching them outside of their comfort zone\u2014\u201dKatie, you are tough, but always fair.\u201d It is always a moment of pride to witness the growth in people.\n\nWhat has been your toughest business or professional decision to date?\n\nIn 2016, I left HSBC Bank Canada, where I started my career, to join RBC. It was a tough decision but later proved to be one of the best professional decisions I\u2019ve made. I felt like I grew up in HSBC, an incredible organization who took a chance on me as a fresh university graduate during the financial crisis. HSBC supported my personal development which includes enabling me to complete my MBA degree while working full-time. It felt uncomfortable to leave behind the network, sponsorship and organizational goodwill I built but I\u2019m glad I stepped outside of the comfort zone.\n\nHow do you lead?\n\nI strive to lead by curiosity, empowerment and authenticity. When I was younger, my tendency was to lead from the front, by example and by doing. As I progressively take on more senior roles with larger mandates and responsibilities, I learn to pivot and lead from the back. My leadership style is to give people the tools they need to focus on their most essential work and remove roadblocks within their control. It takes greater discipline, energy and time to empower people to find the answers and make decisions themselves, rather than giving them one.\n\nWhat is the biggest lesson you\u2019ve learned in business?\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to make informed decisions and take calculated risks. Focus on the process, respect the journey. First step in solving any problem is to recognize there is one. Perfection is the enemy of progress.\n\nBest piece of advice ever received?\n\n\u201cTo be fair is not to be equal.\u201d It took me some time and life experience to fully understand the essence of this advice. Once I had that \u201cAha\u201d moment, it has empowered me to be a more inclusive, versatile and collaborative leader, appreciating everyone has their distinctive journey travelling at different paces especially when it comes to adapting and coping with changes. The key is to be reasonably flexible and customize in a way that caters to people\u2019s individuality and unique needs.\n\nWhat is your definition of success?\n\nSuccess to me is to lead a life that is thriving, fulfilling and enriching on all fronts.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about outside of work?\n\nWe have a young family. My daughter is almost three years old and getting into more activities. Outside of my professional work and community involvement, at the moment I do not have much personal time. When I do, I like to spend time in my garden, take the time to cook a homemade meal for friends and family and travel the world. This past summer, as a family, we got to spend some time each weekend working in the garden. It is so gratifying to seeing something grow and working with our hands.\n\nWhat\u2019s left to accomplish?\n\nLots. For starters, with my recent appointment as regional vice-president co-leading commercial and business financial services, it is not lost on me that I now have a larger platform. As DEI is critically important to me, I aim to use this platform to inspire, encourage and empower more youth, women and visible minorities to show up to lead. It is more important than ever to cultivate and nurture the leaders of tomorrow in an intentional and disciplined way.\n\nIs there anyone you would like to thank or acknowledge?\n\nSo many people to thank\u2014I\u2019ve been a beneficiary of mentorship and support from the community. Specifically, I want to thank my immigrant parents who had the courage and tenacity to uproot their life and move our family to Canada, in hope of giving my sister and I a better life and education. I cannot thank my husband, Shawn, enough for being my best champion and supporter. He never doubted what I could accomplish even when I second-guessed myself. Lastly, my boss and coach, Martin Thibodeau. Martin has the unique ability to offer best advice in the most approachable, collaborative way.\n\nA personal motto, favourite phrase or saying that resonates with you?\n\n\u201cSet unrealistic goals and expect to achieve them\u201d\u2014Tim Singh Grover\n\nA philanthropic, charitable or community cause or organization you support?\n\nESG and DEI are two causes I hold near and dear to my heart\n\nWhat do you do to unwind, relax or de-stress?\n\nTake a long bath; sit in front of the outdoor fireplace in our backyard recounting my day with my husband; clean\n\nFavourite place in the province?\n\nAnywhere close to the water\n\nFavourite restaurant(s)?\n\nI actually do not have a favourite restaurant at the moment\u2014I love cooking at home with a nice bottle of wine\n\nA book or podcast you would recommend?\n\nAcquired by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal is a great podcast that tells the story of world\u2019s greatest companies, how they started, their playbooks, etc.\n\nWhat is your best habit?\n\nI am an early riser and I go to bed early\n\nA B.C. business leader you admire?\n\nThe late Robert H. Lee\n\nTell us one surprising or little-known fact about yourself.\n\nMy family plays Euchre like it\u2019s our professional sport",

            "content": "Higher upfront costs can be an obstacle for those looking to buy an electric car, or an \u201celectric vehicle\u201d (EV). money on gas and lowering your carbon footprint is alluring, but fitting an EV into your budget may be hard. Luckily, Canada\u2019s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 means federal and provincial rebates might be available to you to ease the stress of these up-front costs on your wallet.\n\nWhich electric vehicles are eligible for the federal government rebate program?\n\nCanada\u2019s Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program, or iZEV, provides government rebates for \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d. It\u2019s possible to drive these vehicles without emitting any tailpipe emissions (that is, greenhouse gases or other criteria pollutants) into the atmosphere.\n\nOfficially, there are three types of ZEVs eligible for rebates:\n\nBattery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are fully electric, and need an external power source to be recharged. This is considered the most-efficient option. The average driving range of a BEV is around 350 km.\n\nPlug-in Hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are primarily powered by a battery that can be charged by an external power source, just like BEVs. The difference is they also have an internal combustion engine powered by fossil fuels. The battery can power the PHEV for moderate distances, around 60 km on average. It\u2019s worth noting that this type of EV can be more expensive up-front, and its complexity may mean more repairs and maintenance.\n\nFuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are powered by hydrogen gas, a lower-emission alternative to oil that emits only water vapour and warm air. FCEVs may be an attractive option because, unlike other EVs, they take only around five minutes to charge. However, these tend to be the most expensive EV options.\n\nNote: If the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP) of your vehicle is greater than $65,000, you may not receive a federal government rebate on your purchase.\n\nHow much of an EV rebate can I get?\n\nThe amount of the government rebate depends on the type of ZEV.\n\nLong-range EVs , defined as travelling over 50 km solely on the battery, are eligible for up to $5,000 in point-of-sale rebates. That includes fuel cell electric vehicles and battery-electric vehicles.\n\nShorter-range EVs , like plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, are eligible for rebates of up to $2,500 .\n\nMedium and heavy-duty ZEVs (iMHZEV) are vehicles that exceed 8,500 lbs, which include electric trucks, shuttles, minivans and tractors. The incentives for these models range between $10,000 for the smaller vehicles to $200,000 for industrial-sized trucks for businesses.\n\nYou can search Transport Canada\u2019s list of eligible vehicles to see the specific point-of-purchase incentives available, or complete RBC\u2019s Electric Car Cost Calculator to estimate the cost of an EV with rebates in your province.\n\nHow do I receive the federal government\u2019s EV rebate?\n\nThe rebate is applied during the sale of the EV \u2014 you\u2019ll see it subtracted from the total amount on your bill of sale, or the lease agreement. Your dealer will include the purchase taxes and fees before the incentive is applied, but you\u2019ll get the full incentive amount.\n\nIf your EV fails to meet all of Canada\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or if you have already received a government incentive to purchase an EV in the last year, you might not receive the federal government incentive.\n\nAre provincial rebates for EV available as well?\n\nYes! Some Canadian provinces have their own incentive programs that can save you more money on top of the federal rebates already. Check the table below to see if there are provincial-level incentives in your area:\n\nHow long will these incentives be available?\n\nAt a federal level, the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles program continues until March 31, 2025 \u2014 or when the program\u2019s funding is exhausted.\n\nTry the RBC Electric Car Cost Calculator : Calculate the cost to buy and own an EV\n\nThings our lawyers want you to knowThings our lawyers want you to know This article is intended as general information only and is not to be relied upon as constituting legal, financial or other professional advice.

If you\u2019re covered under RBC group benefits or hold an individual policy, this guide will provide essential insights to help you secure the financial support you deserve.\n\nComplete Guide to RBC Long-Term Disability Claims\n\nAbout RBC and Long-Term Disability\n\nRBC is a top Canadian financial institution, offering a broad range of services, including long-term disability (LTD) insurance. With its headquarters in Toronto, RBC supports millions of clients across Canada, the U.S., and globally. Backed by a workforce of over 94,000 employees and an extensive network of financial experts, RBC is a major player in the group and individual insurance market.\n\nRBC Long-term Disability Benefits\n\nRBC\u2019s long-term disability insurance is designed to provide financial support to individuals who are unable to work due to a serious illness or injury. These benefits help replace a portion of your income while you focus on recovery.\n\nRBC offers two primary types of LTD policies:\n\nGroup Insurance Plans : These plans are typically provided by employers as part of workplace benefits packages. Your long-term disability benefits in this plan will depend on the specific terms laid out in the group benefits booklet or certificate of insurance. It\u2019s crucial to review this document, which should be available from your employer or union, to understand the details of your coverage.\n\n: These plans are typically provided by employers as part of workplace benefits packages.

It\u2019s crucial to review this document, which should be available from your employer or union, to understand the details of your coverage. Individual Insurance Plans: This type of plan is tailored for self-employed professionals, business owners, or executives. Individual disability insurance provides customized benefits, and you are responsible for purchasing the policy through an insurance broker. These policies can offer higher coverage amounts and more flexible terms.\n\nRBC\u2019s long-term disability benefits typically kick in after short-term disability benefits or other forms of income support, such as employment insurance (EI), have been exhausted. Whether you\u2019re covered under a group or individual plan, understanding your policy is key to ensuring you receive the financial support you need during a disability.\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\nHow to Apply For RBC Long-Term Disability Benefits\n\nApplying for RBC long-term disability (LTD) benefits is a critical step if you\u2019re unable to work due to illness or injury. RBC\u2019s claims process requires specific documentation to demonstrate your medical condition and inability to perform your job. Whether you are covered under an RBC group benefits plan or an individual policy, understanding the process is essential to avoid delays or denials. Learn how to obtain your LTD policy here.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Applying for RBC LTD Benefits\n\n1. Gather the Required Forms\n\nYou will need to obtain several forms before submitting your LTD claim. These include:\n\nEmployer Statement : This form is completed by your plan administrator (typically your employer). It outlines the details of your employment and benefits coverage.\n\n: This form is completed by your plan administrator (typically your employer).

It provides information about your health, job responsibilities, and how your condition prevents you from working. Initial Attending Physician\u2019s Statement: Your doctor will need to complete this form, which details your diagnosis, treatment, and how your medical condition affects your ability to work.\n\n2. Submit Your Claim\n\nOnce you have the necessary forms completed, you can submit them through RBC\u2019s group benefits login portal or by mailing the physical documents. While RBC allows both methods, submitting online is faster and allows you to track the progress of your claim.\n\n3. The Waiting Period (Elimination Period)\n\nAfter submitting your LTD claim, you will typically have to wait through an elimination period (also referred to as the qualifying period), which can last between 90 to 180 days depending on your policy. During this time, you may continue to receive STD benefits, or other forms of financial assistance, until your LTD benefits kick in.\n\n4. Approval or Denial of Your Claim\n\nRBC usually takes 5 to 20 days to process LTD claims, but it could take longer depending on the complexity of the case or if additional documentation is required. You will be notified by RBC if your claim is approved, or if it has been denied, the reasons for denial will be provided in writing.\n\nDuring this process, you may encounter challenges dealing with adjusters who handle your claim. It\u2019s important to understand how to communicate effectively and handle any difficulties that arise. Learn more about how to manage difficult adjusters here.\n\n5. What to Do If Your Claim Is Denied\n\nIf your LTD claim is denied, don\u2019t lose hope. You have options to appeal the decision, which will be discussed in detail in the RBC Appeal Process section of this guide. You may need to submit additional medical evidence or clarify certain aspects of your condition to strengthen your case.\n\nYou can also get a free consultation with a disability lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP to understand your options.\n\nAdditionally, being on LTD can sometimes raise employment-related concerns, such as how your employer handles your position or benefits during your disability. Find out how employment issues interact with long-term disability claims.\n\nTips for a Successful LTD Application\n\nEnsure Complete Medical Documentation : Incomplete or vague medical records are one of the main reasons LTD claims get denied. Make sure your doctor provides detailed documentation that clearly shows why you are unable to work.\n\n: Incomplete or vague medical records are one of the main reasons LTD claims get denied.

RBC provides monthly payments to replace a portion of your income, helping you cover essential expenses like housing, medical bills, and daily living costs.\n\nHow Much Does RBC LTD Pay?\n\nRBC typically pays between 60% to 80% of your pre-disability gross income. The exact percentage depends on your specific policy and factors such as your salary, the severity of your condition, and the terms outlined in your group or individual plan.\n\nImportant Factors Affecting Payments:\n\nPolicy Maximums : Some policies have a maximum monthly benefit cap. This means that even if 60-80% of your salary would result in a higher payment, your benefit amount will not exceed the policy cap.\n\n: Some policies have a maximum monthly benefit cap. This means that even if 60-80% of your salary would result in a higher payment, your benefit amount will not exceed the policy cap. Taxable vs. Non-Taxable Benefits : The tax status of your benefits depends on who pays the premium. If your employer pays for your LTD premiums, your payments are likely taxable. However, if you cover the premiums yourself, your LTD payments are typically tax-free.\n\n: The tax status of your benefits depends on who pays the premium. If your employer pays for your LTD premiums, your payments are likely taxable. However, if you cover the premiums yourself, your LTD payments are typically tax-free. Offsets and Deductions: RBC may reduce your LTD payments if you receive other sources of income, such as Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefits or severance pay. These are called \u201coffsets\u201d and they can lower the amount you receive from RBC.\n\nWhen Are Payments Made?\n\nRBC makes LTD payments on a monthly basis. The payment schedule typically aligns with the approval of your claim. Once your claim is approved, you should expect to receive payments on a regular monthly cycle. The exact payment date may vary based on your policy, but you can confirm this through your RBC group benefits login or by contacting your RBC disability case manager.\n\nDelayed or Missed Payments\n\nThere may be cases where your RBC LTD payment is delayed. Common reasons for payment delays include:\n\nIncomplete Documentation : If additional medical records or forms are required but not provided, this can cause delays.\n\n: If additional medical records or forms are required but not provided, this can cause delays. Policy Review: In some cases, RBC may conduct a policy review after a certain period (such as two years on LTD), which could temporarily halt payments until the review is complete.\n\nIf your payment is delayed or you miss a scheduled payment, it\u2019s important to:\n\nContact your RBC disability case manager to inquire about the status.\n\nCheck the RBC group benefits portal for any updates or requests for additional information.\n\nLTD Payment Schedule After Two Years\n\nAfter receiving LTD benefits for two years, RBC reassesses your eligibility, as the criteria for continuing benefits change. The switch from \u201cown occupation\u201d to \u201cany occupation\u201d occurs at this point. This reassessment can affect whether you continue receiving payments, which will be covered in more detail in the section about the two-year mark for LTD.\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\nChecking Your RBC Disability Claim Status\n\nKeeping track of your RBC long-term disability claim status is essential to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays or issues with your benefits. Whether you\u2019re waiting for an initial decision or are monitoring your ongoing benefits, there are several ways to check the status of your claim.\n\nUsing the RBC Group Benefits Portal\n\nThe fastest and most convenient way to check your disability claim status is through the RBC Group Benefits portal. This secure online platform allows you to track the progress of your claim, view any correspondence from RBC, and ensure that your payment schedule remains consistent.\n\nHow to Access the RBC Portal:\n\n1. Log into your account: Visit the RBC website and navigate to the Group Benefits login page. If you don\u2019t have an account, you can easily register using your plan number and member ID, which should be provided by your employer or through your insurance documents.\n\n\n\n2. Check claim updates: Once logged in, you can access the \u201cClaims\u201d section to view the status of your LTD application, including whether your claim is being processed, has been approved, or requires additional documentation.\n\n3. Review correspondence: The portal also stores all communications related to your claim, including any requests for additional medical information or updates on the payment process.\n\nContacting Your RBC Disability Case Manager\n\nIf you prefer a more direct approach, or if you have specific questions about your claim, you can contact your RBC disability case manager. This person is responsible for overseeing your claim and can provide updates on its status.\n\nHow to Contact Your Case Manager:\n\n1. Phone: You can reach your case manager by phone. Their contact information should be included in any mail or email communication you\u2019ve received from RBC regarding your claim.\n\n2. Email: We recommend you keep a record of your conversations with your insurer through email communication. Use the address provided by RBC to reach out to your case manager directly.\n\nWhen contacting your case manager, be sure to have your claim number and plan details on hand for quicker service.\n\nWhat to Do If You Can\u2019t Access Your Claim Status\n\nIf you are unable to check your claim status through the RBC Group Benefits login, or if you are experiencing difficulties with your case manager, you can:\n\nCheck your mail or email : RBC typically sends important updates about your claim by mail or email. Ensure that your contact information is up-to-date in their system.\n\n: RBC typically sends important updates about your claim by mail or email. Ensure that your contact information is up-to-date in their system. Contact RBC\u2019s customer service team: You can reach out to RBC\u2019s general customer service department for assistance with account access or claim status inquiries.\n\n\n\nBack To Top\n\nWhat Happens After 2 Years of RBC LTD?\n\nOne of the most significant milestones in your RBC long-term disability claim is the two-year mark. At this point, the definition of disability changes, affecting your eligibility for continued benefits. This is often referred to as the \u201cchange of definition\u201d and is a crucial factor in whether your payments continue or are terminated.\n\nThe Change from \u201cOwn Occupation\u201d to \u201cAny Occupation\u201d\n\nFor the first two years of receiving RBC LTD benefits, the insurer evaluates your ability to perform your own occupation\u2014the specific job or role you held when you became disabled. After two years, however, the definition changes to \u201cany occupation\u201d that you are reasonably suited for based on your education, training, or experience.\n\nThis change makes it more difficult to qualify for continued benefits because RBC will no longer assess your ability to perform only your original job but will look at whether you are capable of doing any job that matches your qualifications.\n\nSEE MORE:\n\n\u2022 Return to Work and Long-term Disability FAQ\n\n\u2022 5 common terms you must know before applying for LTD\n\n\u2022 List of disability insurance companies in Canada\n\nRBC\u2019s Reassessment Process\n\nAs you approach the two-year mark, RBC will conduct a thorough reassessment to determine if you are still eligible for LTD benefits.

Independent Medical Examinations (IMEs): RBC may also require you to attend an IME to further assess your disability. Although these are presented as independent evaluations, they are often used by insurers to dispute or deny claims. If RBC has requested an IME, it\u2019s crucial to get a free consultation with our team to understand your rights and the potential consequences. Learn more about IMEs and long-term disability.\n\nWhat to Expect If Your Benefits Are Cut Off\n\nUnfortunately, many legitimate claims are incorrectly denied or benefits cut off after the two-year mark due to the stricter \u201cany occupation\u201d standard. If RBC determines that you can perform any type of job, your LTD benefits may be terminated.\n\nCommon Reasons for Denial After Two Years:\n\nYou no longer meet the \u201cany occupation\u201d definition of disability .\n\n. Insufficient medical evidence to prove your inability to work in any capacity.\n\nto prove your inability to work in any capacity. Surveillance or vocational assessments that suggest you are capable of working.\n\nthat suggest you are capable of working. Failure to participate in rehabilitation programs if required.\n\nWhat to Do If RBC Cuts Off Your Benefits\n\nIf your benefits are cut off after two years, it\u2019s important not to accept the denial as the final decision. You have the right to challenge this through appeals or legal action. The appeal process will be discussed in detail in the next section, but key steps include:\n\nGathering additional medical evidence to support your case.\n\nto support your case. Seeking free legal advice from a disability lawyer at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP to ensure your rights are protected.\n\nIf RBC is wrongfully denying your benefits, you may still qualify for financial support. It\u2019s crucial to act quickly, as waiting too long could affect your ability to appeal or pursue effective legal action.\n\nBack To Top",

Insured mortgages saw an increase in the allowable purchase price cap, while first-time buyers gained access to 30-year amortizations, offering greater flexibility to enter the housing market.\n\nMeanwhile, the government introduced several new programs, including initiatives encouraging the development of secondary suites in an effort to address housing supply shortages and improve affordability.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of some of the year\u2019s top mortgage stories, rate movements and mortgage-related stock performance.\n\nTop mortgage stories of 2024\n\nRates and housing market movements\n\nThe year of rate cuts : After the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate peak in 2023, 2024 became the year of rate relief. The central bank delivered five consecutive rate cuts totalling 175 basis points, bringing the overnight rate down to 3.25%. These cuts led to a corresponding decline in the prime rate, easing borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgage holders. Fixed mortgage rates also dropped throughout the year, following declines in the 5-year bond yield, providing additional relief for borrowers.\n\n\n\n: After the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate peak in 2023, 2024 became the year of rate relief.

Resilient inflation trends : Inflation fell steadily throughout the year, with headline CPI dropping to 2.0% by November, down from a peak of 8.1% in mid-2022, helping to ease some financial strain on Canadians.\n\n\n\n: Inflation fell steadily throughout the year, with headline CPI dropping to 2.0% by November, down from a peak of 8.1% in mid-2022, helping to ease some financial strain on Canadians. A housing market rebound : Home sales and prices bounced back by year-end, with average prices climbing to $694,411 (+7.4% YoY) as of November.\n\n\n\n: Home sales and prices bounced back by year-end, with average prices climbing to $694,411 (+7.4% YoY) as of November. Mortgage renewal wave : 2024 saw approximately $251 billion in mortgages renew at higher rates, with even more slated for 2025 and 2026. The average monthly payment increase was estimated at between $400 and $500.\n\n\n\n: 2024 saw approximately $251 billion in mortgages renew at higher rates, with even more slated for 2025 and 2026.

A falling base rate is likely to see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. Some analysts predict another interest rate cut in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. Do you have a money story you\u2019d like to share? Get in touch by emailing temie.laleye@gbnews.uk.\n\nA falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies GETTY\n\nWhile many banks and building societies have started to cut savings rates, some are continuing to provide competitive deals. Experts from Moneyfactscompare have compiled a list of the best savings accounts for this week with Nationwide Building Society, NatWest and Virgin Money among the banks making the cut. Rachel Springall, Finance Expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk said: \u201cIt was somewhat expected to be a quiet period for providers to tweak their savings rates over the past week. However, if savers have some free time, it\u2019s a good idea to compare and switch deals as 2024 draws to a close. \u201cChallenger banks continue to offer some of the best returns on the market for fixed rate bonds, but there have been a few cuts within the top rate tables week-on-week. Those savers looking for a guaranteed return on their cash may then wish to act swiftly to secure a top rate. \u201cAs we enter a new year there will be consumers out there looking to overhaul their savings habits and thankfully there are a great variety of deals available to suit different needs. Those looking to build up a pot for summer could open the top regular saver from Principality Building which pays a fixed rate of eight per cent AER for six months on their monthly contributions.\n\n\u201cThose looking for a deal to save towards Christmas would be wise to keep an eye out for any Christmas regular savers on sale in January. \"Elsewhere, easy access accounts remain a firm favourite for savers who need more flexibility, but its essential savers review and switch these regularly if their loyalty is not being rewarded.

            "content": "RBC stock has done incredibly well this year and recently bumped up its dividend. But is this enough for investors?\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) has long been a cornerstone of Canadian dividend stocks, and its current dividend yield continues to make it a compelling option for income-focused investors. With a forward annual dividend rate of $5.92 per share and a yield hovering around 3.3%, RBC stock offers a steady and reliable income stream, especially for those looking to weather market uncertainty. The bank\u2019s track record speaks volumes, recently pumping its quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share. So, is it still a buy?\n\nInto earnings\n\nRecent earnings bolster the case for RBC stock as a strong dividend stock. In its fourth-quarter report released earlier this month, RBC stock reported a net income of $4.2 billion, an impressive year-over-year increase of 18%. This growth was supported by a combination of factors, including strength in personal and commercial banking as well as the integration of HSBC Canada\u2019s operations.\n\nThe acquisition of HSBC Canada, finalized earlier this year, has already started contributing to earnings, with an additional $265 million added to RBC\u2019s bottom line in the fourth quarter (Q4) alone. Total revenue for the quarter climbed 13% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose to $11.25 for the trailing 12 months. Coupled with a return on equity (ROE) of 13.68%, these numbers paint a picture of a bank firing on all cylinders.\n\nRBC\u2019s financial health is further supported by its strong capital ratios. Its common equity tier-one (CET1) ratio climbed to 13.2% in Q4, well above regulatory requirements. This capital strength has allowed RBC to pursue strategic initiatives like share buybacks and dividend hikes without compromising its stability. Earlier this year, RBC announced plans to repurchase up to 2.1% of its outstanding shares through a normal course issuer bid. For investors seeking both dividends and share price growth, these moves add an extra layer of appeal.\n\nStill valuable\n\nThat said, RBC stock\u2019s current valuation deserves attention. The stock\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits at 15.77. Slightly above its historical average and higher than some of its peers in the Canadian banking sector. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, however, is more reasonable at 13.72, suggesting that analysts expect continued earnings growth. While RBC stock may not appear undervalued at current levels, its premium valuation reflects its status as a high-quality, low-risk investment. Investors often pay a slight premium for companies like RBC. Those that offer stability, consistent dividends, and strong long-term growth potential.\n\nAnother factor to consider is RBC stock\u2019s relatively low beta of 0.84, which indicates that the stock is less volatile than the broader market. This makes RBC stock an attractive option for conservative investors looking to mitigate risk while still earning solid returns. The bank\u2019s five-year average dividend yield of 3.88% is slightly higher than its current yield of 3.3%. This suggests that the stock is trading at a premium relative to its historical valuation.\n\nHowever, given RBC stock\u2019s consistent dividend growth and solid earnings trajectory, the slightly lower yield today may be justified by expectations of future increases. With a payout ratio of just under 50%, RBC also has ample room to continue raising its dividend, even if earnings growth slows in the coming years.\n\nBottom line\n\nIn conclusion, RBC stock remains a top contender for investors seeking reliable dividend income and long-term growth. Its recent earnings highlight impressive financial strength, while the HSBC Canada acquisition is already proving to be a value-add. Although the stock trades at a premium valuation, this reflects investor confidence in RBC\u2019s stability, capital strength, and ability to grow its dividend.\n\nFor income-focused investors, RBC stock\u2019s combination of steady payouts, strong earnings, and low volatility make it an excellent core holding. While there may not be significant upside in the near term, the bank\u2019s proven track record and commitment to shareholder returns make it a worthy candidate for those looking to buy and hold. If you\u2019re prioritizing consistency and income, RBC stock\u2019s dividend story continues to shine.",

            "content": "When it comes to choosing between two strong banks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) and Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) are two strong options.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between two strong banks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) and Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) are two strong options. The decision hinges on a combination of recent performance, strategic outlook, and overall financial stability. Both banks are among Canada\u2019s largest financial institutions, making them strong contenders for any long-term portfolio. But which comes out first?\n\nInto earnings\n\nRBC stock recently reported its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, showcasing a net income of $4.22 billion, up from $3.94 billion a year earlier. This marked an impressive improvement of around 7%, driven largely by strength in its personal and commercial banking divisions as well as gains in wealth management. RBC stock\u2019s acquisition of HSBC Canada was a significant contributor to this growth, adding nearly 780,000 new clients to its platform and reinforcing its market dominance. The wealth management division alone saw net income rise to $969 million. Thanks to higher fees and improved market conditions.\n\nCIBC also delivered a strong fourth quarter, with adjusted net income reaching $1.9 billion, representing an impressive 24% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 22% to $1.91, helped by reduced provisions for credit losses. This dropped by 22.5% to $419 million. This reduction suggests improved economic stability and a healthier loan portfolio. While CIBC\u2019s performance is commendable, it lacks the transformational strategic moves that have characterized RBC stock\u2019s recent success. Instead, CIBC remains focused on steady organic growth, improving operational efficiency, and managing credit risk. These are positive signs of stability. Yet, that may not translate into the same level of growth potential that RBC stock is currently demonstrating.\n\nValue and income\n\nValuation metrics provide additional context. CIBC\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 12.95, compared to RBC stock\u2019s slightly higher 15.77. This difference suggests that RBC stock commands a premium. This can be interpreted as investors paying more for its earnings potential and growth opportunities. While a lower P/E ratio might indicate that CIBC is undervalued, RBC stock\u2019s premium reflects the bank\u2019s stronger long-term strategic positioning. RBC also maintains a higher price-to-book (P/B) ratio at 2.13 compared to CIBC\u2019s 1.65. Further reinforcing the market\u2019s confidence in RBC\u2019s superior earning power and broader market reach.\n\nDividends are an essential consideration for long-term investors, and both banks offer generous payouts. CIBC provides a forward annual dividend rate of $3.60 per share, yielding 4.02% at writing. This makes it particularly attractive for income-focused investors. RBC stock\u2019s quarterly dividend recently increased to $1.48 per share, or $5.68 annually, resulting in a yield of 3.23% at writing. While RBC\u2019s yield is lower, the bank has a history of steady dividend growth and a lower payout ratio of 48.98% compared to CIBC\u2019s 51.66%. A lower payout ratio indicates that RBC retains more of its earnings to reinvest in growth, which supports its long-term expansion strategy.\n\nOther considerations\n\nRBC stock\u2019s recent acquisition of HSBC Canada is a game-changer for its future outlook. RBC stock is strengthening its presence in key markets, especially among high-net-worth clients and international businesses. This acquisition positions RBC as not just a domestic leader but also as a competitive force on the global stage. In contrast, CIBC\u2019s strategy remains more conservative, focused on internal improvements and risk management rather than bold growth initiatives.\n\nIn terms of financial health, RBC stock\u2019s total cash position stands at an impressive $732 billion. Far surpassing CIBC\u2019s $263 billion. RBC\u2019s scale not only supports its ability to weather economic uncertainties but also provides it with flexibility for further acquisitions and investments. The bank\u2019s return on equity (ROE) of 13.68% is higher than CIBC\u2019s 12.37%, a key measure of profitability and management efficiency. This highlights RBC\u2019s ability to generate superior returns for shareholders, further strengthening its investment appeal.\n\nBottom line\n\nUltimately, while both banks are well-suited for long-term investment, RBC stock stands out as the superior choice. Its recent performance, strategic initiatives like the HSBC acquisition, and consistent ability to deliver strong shareholder returns make it a more compelling option. For investors looking to balance stability with growth, RBC stock offers the best of both worlds, making it a strong pick in the Canadian banking landscape.",

First Carolina Financial Services, which owns fast-growing, saidbefore fees and expenses by selling shares at $35.\n\nplan to buy BM Technologies of Radnor, Pennsylvania, for $67 million. That deal is expected to close in January. The fundraising follows First Carolina\u2019sof Radnor, Pennsylvania, for $67 million. That deal is expected to close in January.\n\nThe new investment comes from 200 individual shareholders, including 75 who hadn\u2019t previously owned First Carolina stock, CEO Ron Day said in an interview. Overall, the company formed in Rocky Mount in 2012 has about 850 shareholders, mostly from North Carolina but now including investors living near the bank\u2019s offices in Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia. Shares originally traded for $10.\n\nBM Technologies is a digital banking platform that provides financial aid disbursement services for more than 700 campuses, including Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh and Georgia State University in Atlanta. First Carolina has been its exclusive provider of deposit accounts since December 2023, with about 300,000 students holding First Carolina checking accounts and total deposits of about $500 million, Day says. That represents about 12% of the students enrolled in the disbursement program nationally.\n\nThe BM Technologies deal \u201cis the most unique thing I\u2019ve ever had an opportunity to work on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a limitless customer development opportunity, in our view.\u201d\n\nFirst Carolina wants to sign up more students in the program and offer added services, particularly for those students living near the bank\u2019s branch offices.\n\nAs a relatively new bank, First Carolina didn\u2019t have an established branch network with lots of retail deposits. The BM Technologies operation will help boost deposits, helping the bank fund loans. Day cites the example of a new resident coming into Wake County who deposits $10,000 for a checking account and then seeks a $1 million home mortgage. \u201cThis is one way we are solving\u201d that mismatch, he says.\n\nInvestors paid for shares at a price representing about 140% of First Carolina\u2019s tangible book value. Shares of well-run community banks often sell for about 200% of book value, Day notes.\n\nIt was the company\u2019s 11th private placement since its inception. The largest, for $115 million, was completed in March 2022.\n\n\n\nDay worked for Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s N.C. business before helping start First Carolina. First Carolina Bank has total assets of $3.1 billion and offices in Rocky Mount, Raleigh, Wilmington, Cary and Reidsville; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe bank hasn\u2019t charged off a soured loan in eight years, Day says. That isn\u2019t because of a lack of growth; lending surged 20%, or about $400 million, in the past year. A substantial share of First Carolina\u2019s loans are made to shareholders, who have an incentive to pay their debt, he notes.\n\n",

            "content": "Going into 2025, the Canadian banks might still have a rough road ahead. But which one might offer the smoothest path?\n\nCanadian bank stocks have always been a pillar of stability for investors. These offer a blend of steady growth, reliable dividends, and a resilient track record that has earned them a special place in portfolios. However, the economic environment is changing, and the future of these financial giants is now at a crossroads. Shaped by interest rate changes, mortgage renewals, and lingering uncertainties around global markets. The question of whether these banks are a buy, sell, or hold requires a look at their recent performance, future outlook, and how they compare against each other.\n\nRecent performance\n\nRecent earnings reports have painted a varied picture across the sector. Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY), Canada\u2019s largest bank by market cap, posted stronger-than-expected profits, supported by growth in its personal banking division and diversified income from wealth management and investment banking. It remains a fortress of stability with its strong domestic market position and continued dominance in capital markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM) surprised analysts with its solid quarterly profits, thanks to reduced loan loss provisions and solid performance in its core Canadian retail banking business. CIBC has often been seen as the underdog among the Big Five, but its recent focus on risk management and a steadier loan portfolio has paid off.\n\nOn the flip side, Bank of Montreal (TSX:BMO) and its results were more sobering. BMO missed profit expectations, driven by a substantial increase in provisions for credit losses, particularly in its U.S. segment. This move reflects a cautious stance as the bank anticipates higher risks from potential defaults, particularly in the commercial loan space.\n\nToronto Dominion Bank (TSX:TD), another heavy-hitter, also faced headwinds this quarter. Regulatory issues in the U.S., including a costly anti-money laundering settlement, weighed heavily on its earnings. These challenges have put a dent in its long-term U.S. growth plans, which have historically been a bright spot for TD\u2019s strategy.\n\nFinally, Bank of Nova Scotia (TSX:BNS) continued to struggle with its international investments. The bank reported earnings below estimates after taking a significant impairment charge related to its Chinese investments, a move that underscores the risks associated with its strategy of international diversification.\n\nStrong history\n\nLooking back, the Big Five have built a legacy of outperformance during uncertain times. Canadian banks weathered the 2008 global financial crisis and the pandemic with relatively minor scars, largely due to their strong capital positions and prudent regulatory environment. RBC, in particular, has remained a leader with diversified operations that balance risk across multiple revenue streams.\n\nScotiabank has leaned into its \u201cinternational bank\u201d identity with deep roots in Latin America and the Caribbean, but that strategy hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. In contrast, TD and BMO have spent the last decade expanding aggressively into the U.S. market, where they\u2019ve found both opportunity and, at times, volatility. CIBC has maintained a steadier focus on Canadian retail banking, occasionally criticized for being more conservative but now reaping the rewards of its risk-averse approach. So, which is the best bank moving forward?\n\nBottom line\n\nAmong the Big Five, CIBC emerges as the most compelling buy. Historically viewed as the quieter player, CIBC has demonstrated effective risk management and solid Canadian operations. These have insulated it from some of the challenges its peers face abroad. Its stock performance has also been resilient, outperforming expectations this year. For investors seeking both growth and dividend income, CIBC offers an attractive blend of stability and upside potential, especially given its lower valuation relative to its peers.\n\nUltimately, the Canadian banking sector continues to be a cornerstone for any diversified investment strategy. While challenges exist, the resilience of the Big Five makes them difficult to bet against. CIBC\u2019s recent momentum and strong fundamentals make it an especially appealing choice for investors looking to capitalize on the opportunities emerging in Canada\u2019s banking landscape. In a world where economic uncertainty remains the norm, the solid foundations of Canadian banks provide a reassuring anchor for both income seekers and growth-oriented investors alike.",
