            "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.42%) has changed a lot in recent years. In 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell International replaced ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and RTX, respectively, and in February 2024, Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance. Last November, Nvidia booted out Intel, and Sherwin-Williams replaced chemical company Dow.\n\nAdding many tech-focused companies has shifted the balance of the Dow toward growth and away from value and income. Many growth stocks are selling off this year, and investors may be wondering if it was a good idea to revamp the Dow.\n\nAfter all, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 2.27%) is in a correction -- which is a drawdown of at least 10% from a recent high. Tech-focused Dow stocks -- like Nvidia, Amazon, and Salesforce -- have been selling off, too.\n\nRead on to learn why changes to the Dow help the index better represent the U.S. stock market. I'll also discuss how to view the Dow, compared to the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.76%) and Nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow's major makeover\n\nAdding tech-focused companies has altered the composition of the Dow. But so has the outperformance of the financial sector.\n\nThe Dow is a price-weighted index -- meaning that stock prices, rather than market caps, impact the weightings. The stock prices of many financial stocks have gone up as the financial sector was one of the top-performing areas in 2024. But none of these companies have issued stock splits in recent years, giving financials a higher weighting the Dow.\n\nAt over $560 a share, Goldman Sachs is currently the highest-weighted Dow component. Visa is the seventh-highest weighted, American Express is 15th, Travelers Companies is 12th, and JPMorgan Chase is 14th. Combined, these five financial companies make up 23.9% of the index, which is higher than the combined weighting of Microsoft, Salesforce, International Business Machines, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Cisco Systems, which make up 22.2%.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia underwent stock splits before being added to the index. Although Nvidia and Amazon are two of the most valuable companies in the world, they both hold below-average weightings in the Dow.\n\nStill, there's no denying that the Dow is more growth-focused than in years past. The strong performance of financial stocks has stretched their valuations, so the Dow isn't as value-focused, either.\n\nThe Dow's growth focus could make it more volatile\n\nDuring a growth-fueled stock market sell-off, investors would typically expect the Dow to hold up a lot better than the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite. This is because during market sell-offs, investors are more likely to scrutinize valuations and pay less for potential earnings growth, especially if an economic downturn may delay that growth.\n\nFor example, in 2020, the Dow fell less than 10%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite had far worse sell-offs, as you can see below.\n\nHowever, so far this year, the Dow is down, even though sectors typically associated with the Dow (like healthcare, financials, consumer staples, and industrials) are all up in 2025.\n\nThe Dow and the broader economy\n\nWhen scanning the stock market, it's easy to get bogged down by sector labels or classifying a stock as growth, income, or value. The same can happen with indexes. In the past, the Nasdaq was typically seen as the tech-focused growth index, the S&P 500 was the balanced index representing large-cap companies across all sectors, and the Dow was all about value and income.\n\nThat mentality made more sense when the largest U.S.-based companies by market cap were names like General Electric and ExxonMobil. But today, 9 out of the 10 largest U.S.-based companies by market cap are tech-focused. The only one that isn't is Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nTechnology has become a bigger part of the U.S. economy, so it makes sense that the S&P 500 and Dow are becoming more tech-focused. Apple is arguably a modern-day consumer staple company since smartphones are integral to everyday life. Similarly, advertisers are spending more and more on Alphabet's Google search and YouTube or Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, which have taken market share from more traditional outlets.\n\nIn many ways, changes to the Dow merely reflect how the economy is evolving. Nvidia is worth nearly 30 times more than Intel, which is why it's a better fit to represent the semiconductor industry. Amazon represents e-commerce in a way that a brick-and-mortar retailer could not.\n\nIn sum, it's a good idea to continue modernizing the Dow. However, investors need to be aware of index changes so they don't assume the Dow is immune from a growth-stock-led sell-off in the broader market.",

            "content": "Mod\u00ed, a new restaurant in the Salesforce Transit Center, describes its cuisine on Resy as \"Spooky Italian.\" Illustration by Steven Boyle/S.F. Chronicle\n\nBabe, what are you in the mood for tonight? Sushi? Thai? Spooky Italian?\n\nI was recently browsing Resy, searching for a last minute table for a party of four, when I stopped mid-scroll. The restaurant that had caught my eye was Mod\u00ed, a new spot in the Salesforce Transit Center. I\u2019d been meaning to pay it a visit ever since my colleague Mario Cortez wrote about its birria lasagna and nopales Parmesan, dishes reflecting a unique Mexican-Italian concept.\n\nBut on Resy, the field describing the type of cuisine didn\u2019t read \u201cMexican-Italian,\u201d but rather \u201cSpooky Italian.\u201d What\u2026did that mean? My mind conjured \u201cSuspiria,\u201d the Borgia clan, that statue of St. Bartholomew in Milan\u2019s Duomo where he\u2019s wearing his own skin like a pashmina.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nA screenshot of Mod\u00ed\u2019s Resy page taken on March 10. MacKenzie Chung Fegan/S.F. Chronicle\n\nI arrived at the Salesforce tower ready for a very haunted dining experience \u2014 perhaps some fettuccine afraido or boocatini. Instead I got charming hospitality from a genial Italian server who \u201cbella,\u201d \u201cbello\u201d and \u201cbelli\u201dd us all evening, and food that didn\u2019t quite live up to the creativity splashed all over the menu. There is, perhaps, a reason tiramis\u00f9 is not traditionally made with churros. I have nothing but praise, however, for the \u201crisotto Milano Mexico DF,\u201d an extremely cheesy, saffron-scented risotto crowned by roasted bone marrow, which is scraped on top of the rice tableside. Bones aside, the only thing frightening about it was how quickly it vanished, spectre-like, into our fearsome maws.\n\nI called Mod\u00ed (emphasis on the second syllable; it\u2019s named for the painter Modigliani, not the prime minister of India) to see if I could get some clarification. Matteo Avallone, one of the managers and partners in the restaurant, picked up the phone. \u201cSorry, what are you calling about?\u201d he asked confusedly after I had launched into my line of questioning. \u201cSpooky Italian,\u201d I repeated. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201coh, hang on, he did this.\u201d\n\nThe \u201che\u201d in question is Davide Tringali, another manager and partner. As he was setting up Mod\u00ed\u2019s account on Resy, he browsed the available cuisine descriptors and found himself dissatisfied. \u201cFusion\u201d was a possibility, as were \u201cMexican\u201d and \u201cItalian,\u201d but perhaps unsurprisingly, \u201cMexican-Italian\u201d did not appear in the dropdown. That\u2019s when he saw \u201cSpooky Italian\u201d was an option. Why not? \u201cIt\u2019s just me being excessive,\u201d he explained.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe al pastor pizza at Mod\u00ed in San Francisco. MacKenzie Chung Fegan/S.F. Chronicle\n\nResy does take requests to customize the cuisine field, although most don\u2019t bother since they would rather be shown in search results for popular genres of food. My guess is that once one restaurant puts in a customization request, their new category is available to all other Resy clients. That would explain, for example, how there are five restaurants in the United States that describe themselves as serving \u201cFrench-American and Japanese\u201d fare \u2014 oddly specific, no? I\u2019m sure one business worked with Resy to fine tune that designation, and four others later thought, \u201cSure, that mostly works.\u201d\n\nIt also solves the Spooky Italian mystery. Foul Witch in New York opened nearly two years before Mod\u00ed, and in his review for the New York Times, Pete Wells wrote, \u201cAccording to the restaurant\u2019s website, \u2018Foul Witch offers spooky Italian fare and an uninhibited natural wine list in an intimate gothic setting.\u2019\u201d Sure enough, it is the only restaurant in the country currently listed as \u201cSpooky Italian\u201d on Resy. That\u2019s right \u2014 since my booking, Mod\u00ed has changed its category to \u201cFusion.\u201d\n\nI asked Tringali about the switch, and he was caught unawares. \u201cIt\u2019s not Spooky Italian anymore? I\u2019m going to change it back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad",

Truist highlights Salesforce\u2019s valuation as attractive, with an enterprise value to calendar year 2026 estimated free cash flow multiple of 17.5x and a de-risked revenue outlook, forecasting stronger growth in FY26\u2019s second half and beyond.\n\nThe firm praises Salesforce\u2019s capital allocation strategy and strong balance sheet, which support investments in key growth areas, positioning the company to capitalize on its diverse portfolio and potentially accelerate its trajectory in a competitive market.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) shares climbed $4.84, or 1.72%, to $285.51 in early Monday trading, reflecting investor enthusiasm following a bullish assessment from Truist Securities. The firm upheld its \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on the $270 billion market cap company, setting a $400 price target that signals robust confidence in Salesforce\u2019s future. Truist\u2019s optimism hinges on a constellation of growth drivers \u2013 Data Cloud, AI/Agentforce, and an enhanced Marketing Cloud \u2013 that analysts believe could propel the company\u2019s trajectory through fiscal year 2026, with momentum expected to surge in the second half, and even more significantly into fiscal year 2027.\n\nThe valuation case for Salesforce, as articulated by Truist, rests on a compelling enterprise value to calendar year 2026 estimated free cash flow (EV/CY26E FCF) multiple of 17.5x, a figure that suggests the stock remains attractively priced relative to its projected cash generation. This metric, paired with what the firm describes as a \u201cde-risked and macro-adjusted revenue guidance,\u201d underscores a narrative of stability amid economic uncertainty\u2014a rare asset in today\u2019s volatile tech landscape. Salesforce\u2019s diverse portfolio stands out as a key differentiator, with innovations like AI/Agentforce poised to tap into the growing demand for intelligent automation, while Data Cloud and Marketing Cloud enhancements signal the company\u2019s ability to adapt and capture market share across enterprise software segments.\n\nBeyond growth prospects, Truist highlights Salesforce\u2019s capital allocation strategy as a pillar of its investment appeal, bolstered by a strong balance sheet that affords flexibility for strategic investments and shareholder returns. This financial resilience positions Salesforce to not only weather potential headwinds but also to double down on high-potential areas like AI and data analytics, which are increasingly critical for enterprise clients. The analyst\u2019s projection of stronger growth in FY26\u2019s latter half, extending into FY27, reflects a belief that these catalysts will compound over time, potentially revitalizing Salesforce\u2019s trajectory after a period of recalibration. At $285.51, the stock\u2019s 1.72% uptick mirrors market approval of Truist\u2019s outlook, though the journey to $400 \u2013 40% higher from the stock\u2019s currently levels \u2013 will depend on Salesforce translating these drivers into tangible results amidst a competitive tech ecosystem.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

All three were expected to draw more investment over the next two years.\n\nIn a separate ranking of the top 10 finance technologies that respondents expect to attract the \u201chighest future investment,\u201d it is the seemingly perennially buzzy generative artificial intelligence along with machine learning that were ranked first and second, respectively, with cloud ERP earning a spot on that list in third place.\n\nCloud ERP technologies that have already been adopted by many companies may draw some of the uptick in investment as companies update them with AI, Gartner said in a release. \u201cNew self-service AI and data analytics capabilities being rolled out by cloud ERP vendors are providing an incentive for finance functions to upgrade, so they can better provide insights to the business in real time and at scale,\u201d Gartner said in a release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe findings come as the number of U.S. companies investing $10 million or more in artificial intelligence is expected to nearly double next year, even as many companies are jeopardizing its potential by failing to invest in needed infrastructure to support it, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nCRM offerings are increasingly being used by CFOs to analyze sales forecasts using historical data to assess the likelihood of future sales being inked, according to Mike Helsel, senior director analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt\u2019s where the customer master lives, which is critical to finance processes of collections, cash applications and credit among other finance functions. CRM was also among the highest in adoption/utilization,\u201d Helsel said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nWhile AI is already often embedded in other applications, the race is on by companies to add more AI to existing offerings. For example, based on current trends and the survey results, by 2027 62% of ERP spend will be on ERP applications with GenAI capabilities, up from 14% in 2024.\n\nThe findings from the 2025 Finance Technology Bullseye report are based on responses provided in October from 383 finance executives that included CFOs as well as other finance technology experts, Gartner said.",

            "content": "At first glance, enterprise software giant Salesforce (CRM) seems like a dubious investment. While there\u2019s no denying its relevance, broader economic challenges have cast a dark shadow over the wider tech innovation space. Nevertheless, with Salesforce suffering a sizable drop over the past few months, the smart money appears to be moving in via astute options strategies. Therefore, I am bullish on CRM stock.\n\nCRM Stock Offers Relevance Despite Economic Turmoil\n\nLast year, investors couldn\u2019t get enough of the latest innovations, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computers. This year, the general appetite for advanced tech remains robust. At the same time, more investors recognize the harsh realities of the moment. In particular, the Trump administration tariffs and subsequent trade wars with key economic partners have deflated valuations for growth-oriented businesses.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly troublesome for CRM and its ilk is skyrocketing gold demand. While it may be a precious metal, that\u2019s all gold is \u2014 a metal or commodity. By itself, the asset generates no earnings nor pays dividends. Investors speculate that its market value will be higher tomorrow than it is today. Such an attitude at scale is not conducive to the tech ecosystem, which rises on the belief of the forward impartation of productivity.\n\nInvestors tend to opt for gold when they anticipate something terrible will happen. Despite this overhang, CRM stock is intractably relevant. First and foremost, the underlying company dominates the customer relations segment through its pioneering cloud-based platform. Thanks to Salesforce, enterprises can more easily track customer interactions, manage sales pipelines, personalize marketing, and streamline customer service.\n\nFurther, Salesforce delivers convenience. With its expanded suite of enterprise tools, the company offers marketing, customer support, commerce, data analysis, and workflow communication solutions. Even better, the scalable offerings allow Salesforce to soak up market share from small startups to Fortune 500 giants.\n\nNot surprisingly, Wall Street analysts anticipate steady growth over the next two years. For the current fiscal year, they\u2019re targeting sales of $401 billion, up almost 8% from the prior year\u2019s tally of $38 billion. And in the following year, experts see the top line reaching $45 billion, up 9.3% from projected FY2026 revenue.\n\nStill, CRM stock hasn\u2019t been exempted from broader economic challenges. On a year-to-date basis, the equity slipped more than 15%. Notably, though, a silver lining is that CRM\u2019s top-line multiple has declined to 7.21x trailing 12-month (TTM) sales. A little more than one year ago, this metric stood at 8.15x.\n\nThe Smart Money Anticipates a Floor in Salesforce Stock\n\nAnother element to consider regarding CRM stock is its underlying unusual options activity. Generally speaking, the derivatives market represents the arena for sophisticated investors \u2014 the professional or institutional class. Therefore, aberrant trades in this space may tip off future trends in the open market. In other words, even if you don\u2019t trade options, monitoring what the big banks are doing is always useful.\n\nWhat I particularly found interesting was the high volume of sold or written put options that began earlier this year and has continued into the current month. Puts provide holders the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at the listed strike price. This is significant because on the other end of the transaction, put sellers are underwriting the risk that the security will not materially decline.\n\nIf the stock in question falls below the breakeven threshold, put buyers will likely exercise their options at some point. This action would force the put writers to buy the stock, a process known as \u201cassignment.\u201d\n\nBecause of this backdrop, we can infer two things about CRM stock. First, institutional investors believe that CRM\u2019s volatility is potentially overdone, which is why they\u2019re willing to risk assignment in exchange for receiving income (or the premium paid to buy the put options). Second, the put strike price minus the premium received essentially represents the price at which put sellers are comfortable buying CRM.\n\nCurrently, the smart money is buying call options, many with strike prices above the current market price. That\u2019s a bullish signal because buying out-the-money (OTM) calls indicates a belief that the security will move higher. With smart money betting that CRM stock won\u2019t drop materially lower and simultaneously betting that it will swing higher, the prospect for upside looks enticing.\n\nOne aggressive idea to consider is the 290/300 bull call spread for the options chain expiring May 16 this year. This transaction involves buying the $290 call and simultaneously selling the $300 call. The proceeds from the short call partially offset the debit paid for the long call. Should CRM stock hit the $300 short strike price at expiration, the maximum payout clocks in at nearly 147%.\n\nIs Salesforce a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nOn Wall Street, CRM stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buy, eight Hold, and two Sell ratings over the past three months. CRM\u2019s average price target of $375.58 per share implies approximately 32% upside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nOptions Strategies Offer Most Capitalization Potential\n\nWhile broader economic pressures have deflated the tech sector, Salesforce could potentially rise above the muck thanks to its extraordinary relevance. The company basically owns the enterprise-level customer relations market, a segment that will likely only continue to grow in importance.\n\nPerhaps the most significant bullish catalyst for CRM stock comes from the smart money. Options data indicates that major traders anticipate both a floor in the security and a future upward trajectory. Retail traders can front-run this dynamic with an aggressive options strategy.\n\nDisclosure.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks insiders were piling into recently.\n\nAfter a turbulent week, stocks began recovering on Monday, with all three major indexes posting gains. The broader market index rose 0.64%, blue-chip stocks gained 0.85%, and the NASDAQ Composite, still in correction territory, closed 0.31% higher.\n\nEarly Tuesday, stocks began to decline again as investors focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting starting today. The key announcement for traders will come Wednesday when the Fed announces its interest rate decision, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Since September, the Fed has cut interest rates three times and still, the broader market entered a correction.\n\nDespite uncertainty from President Trump\u2019s shifting tariff policies and geopolitical strategies, some analysts remain optimistic about AI\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe retain our view that there is more to go in stocks, and we keep our conviction in the long-term opportunities in stocks linked to both the artificial intelligence and power and resources transformational innovations,\u201d UBS chief investment office said in a note Monday, according to CNBC.\n\nAmid turbulence and uncertainty on Wall Street, looking at recent insider trades can provide valuable insights, as executives often have a deeper understanding of their companies. For example, when a CEO or CFO buys company stock, it may indicate strong confidence in the business\u2019s future.\n\nHowever, insider selling doesn\u2019t always signal a lack of confidence. It could be due to personal financial needs or a desire to diversify investments. These sales are often made through pre-arranged plans, like 10b5-1 plans, to avoid any appearance of improper timing.\n\nWhile insider activity can be informative, it\u2019s important to consider it alongside the company\u2019s financial health, market trends, and industry developments.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener to analyze recent trading activities in several popular stocks. For each stock, we noted the number of insiders who recently acquired shares and the company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nOur research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds, focusing on insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Insiders Buying: 1\n\nMarket Capitalization: $269.80 billion\n\nSixth on this list of 10 recent insider purchases is a designer and developer of cloud-based enterprise software for customer relationships, Salesforce. The San Francisco-based company offers applications focused on customer service and support, market automation, analytics, sales force automation, and e-commerce, while also providing industry-specific solutions. It is also one of the 10 best software stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nSalesforce Agentforce is a platform that enables organizations to build, customize, and deploy autonomous AI agents for various business functions, including service, sales, marketing, and commerce. Some experts are bullish on the stock mostly because of Agentforce and recent positive projections on the future adoption of AI technologies.\n\nAmong the recent company\u2019s development Singapore Airlines\u2019s incorporation of Agentforce, Einstein in Service Cloud, and Data Cloud into its customer case management system, enabling it to deliver more consistent and personalized service to its customers.\n\n\u201cThe rise of digital labor, powered by autonomous AI agents, is not just reimagining the customer experience \u2014 it\u2019s transforming business,\u201d stated Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Singapore Airlines, a trailblazer in this AI revolution, to elevate their already outstanding customer service to unprecedented heights, augment their employees and collaborate on groundbreaking AI solutions for the airline industry. With our deeply unified digital labor platform, we\u2019re bringing humans together with trusted, autonomous AI agents, unlocking new levels of productivity, innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $9.44 billion, up 8% year-over-year. In December, the company\u2019s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share.\n\nRecently, Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, commented on the stock saying \u201cSalesforce\u2026.is a huuuuuuge buy.\u201d\n\nOn February 28, one insider bought $499,355.48 worth of Salesforce shares at a price of $294.61 per share. Year-to-date, the stock dropped 16.03% and is now trading at $280.75. Over the past 12 months, Salesforce shares lost 6.58%.\n\nThe consensus rating on Salesforce stock from 42 analysts is \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d according to MarketBeat. The average price target of $364.14 suggests a 29.67% upside.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 6th on our list of stocks insiders were piling into recently. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires",

            "content": "We recently published a list of Did Jim Cramer Get These 23 Stocks Right?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 12 months ago.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the markets ending another volatile week that ended after a massive $4 trillion selloff on the flagship S&P 500 since the post-election week at the start. He outlined that one of the reasons that the week was tumultuous was that the President was \u201ccreating pain\u201d and then saying that he was sorry that there was pain. Cramer described Trump as gratuitous and added that the President\u2019s comments had killed the stock market\u2019s rally.\n\nCramer added that Trump \u201ctook stocks that had been going up and reversed them.\u201d Cramer\u2019s \u201cstill trying to figure out where the playbook gets us,\u201d with the playbook being the President\u2019s comments about the economy and the stock market. Following this, co-host Carl Quintanilla asked Cramer his thoughts on rumors that the President was trying to drive the bond market down but the strategy didn\u2019t seem to be working. In response, Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cWell I mean we had that auction yesterday, that didn\u2019t go well. People are kind of so on edge, but it\u2019s not a flight to quality on edge. It\u2019s more of a flight to cash. I mean you know this idea of a flight to quality does include that there\u2019s part of the curve you wanna be on. Now when I was a hedge fund manager, there were these moments where you\u2019d hear flight to quality and that meant that you really wanted to be in 30-day paper. We\u2019re kind of back to that. Because that\u2019s safe. 30-day\u2019s very safe. It\u2019s safe from the President. And, look, I, the President\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s intriguing. But I never really felt that we were in a moment where stocks should go down. When I was close to President Biden, when he would ride the train and I\u2019d see him in Washington. . .I would have the page [inaudible] stock price, he would come over [inaudible] I don\u2019t care about any of those. Well the President does. He wants them lower! He\u2019s creating a sale. I mean I\u2019ve never seen a sale mandated before. No one was thinking that he was going to bend when he did that gratuitous tweet.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Was Jim Cramer Right About These 23 Stocks? and Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & Says People Don\u2019t Understand Tariffs\n\nHe also shared his thoughts on the President\u2019s latest round of tariffs on expensive alcoholic beverages:",

The total addressable market for cloud services is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% between 2024 and 2030. A significant driver of this growth is generative AI, which could contribute between $200 billion and $300 billion in cloud spending as investment spreads beyond major tech firms and AI model providers.\n\nThe Head of Research further explained that cloud computing growth will begin with the infrastructure layer, which will then drive expansion in platforms and applications. He estimates that Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) will represent $580 billion, or 29% of the cloud market by 2030. Meanwhile, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is projected to grow to $600 billion (30% of the market), and SaaS is expected to contribute the largest share at $780 billion, accounting for 41% of total cloud spending.\n\nTheir research also suggests that the initial beneficiaries of cloud adoption will be infrastructure providers, as seen with the AI revenue surge among hyperscalers. This will be followed by growth in the platform and application layers. There is a natural interdependence between PaaS and SaaS\u2014platform solutions are essential for enabling next-generation applications, while the true value of the platform layer cannot be realized without compelling applications driving demand. The software sector, which has experienced three years of slowing growth, now has the potential to re-accelerate as cloud adoption and AI-driven innovations continue to evolve.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on this trend, SaaS stocks represent a strong long-term opportunity. As cloud adoption continues to expand, leading SaaS companies are well-positioned to benefit from rising enterprise demand, AI integration, and increased digital transformation across industries. With SaaS projected to be the dominant cloud computing segment by 2030, investors may find significant value in high-growth SaaS stocks that are shaping the future of software solutions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 10 best SaaS stocks to buy according to billionaires, we first compiled a list of SaaS-focused stocks by reviewing ETFs and financial media reports. We specifically selected companies with significant exposure to the SaaS business, excluding enterprise and application software firms with relatively low SaaS exposure (which are covered in a separate article). From this refined list, we analysed Insider Monkey\u2019s database of billionaire holdings to determine which SaaS stocks were most favoured by billionaire investors. We then ranked the top 10 stocks in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors holding positions in each company as of Q4 2024. Additionally, we also provide data to assess hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, utilizing data from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database to provide deeper insights into institutional investor trends.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on March 15.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 23\n\nBillionaire Holdings: $9.0 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its cloud-based platform provides solutions for sales, service, marketing, and commerce, enabling businesses to build stronger customer connections using the power of data and AI. Salesforce\u2019s AI-driven tools, including Einstein, offer predictive insights and automation to boost productivity.\n\nSimilar to its February announcement of $500 million investment in Saudi Arabia, the company recently announced a $1 billion investment in Singapore over five years to drive digital transformation and promote Agentforce, aiming to address labour shortages in essential sectors. On the financial front, Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) continued to perform strongly as visible from its FY 2025 results. The company reported $37.9 billion in revenue (up 9% YoY), $63.4 billion in RPO (up 11% YoY), and a 31% rise in free cash flow to $12.4 billion. However, FY 2026 revenue guidance of $40.5-$40.9 billion fell modestly below the $41.5 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThe street remains largely positive on the stock. On March 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan reiterated his Buy rating on the company with a price target of $400, indicating a robust 43% upside potential. A day earlier, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow also reaffirmed a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $425.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 1st on our list of best SaaS stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "NEW YORK and LONDON, March 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investment banks have long struggled with CRM systems. Many firms turned to Salesforce and similar platforms, expecting to streamline dealmaking, improve data capture, and build institutional memory. The reality? Low adoption rates, minimal deal impact, and a clunky user experience that forces bankers back to email, Excel, and Word. As a result, valuable knowledge remains scattered and siloed, blocking firms from building sector and subsector intelligence that could set them apart in a hyper-competitive market.\n\nNavatar recognized the core issue: solving the wrong problem. Efficiency alone does not drive better dealmaking. That's why Navatar shifted focus-from process automation to intelligence, relationships, and automation with purpose. Their mission? Eliminate manual work, deliver immediate value, and transform Salesforce from an administrative burden into a strategic engine that adds real context to high-stakes dealmaking-without getting in the way.\n\nTurning Relationships into Intelligence\n\nNavatar's platform captures proprietary intelligence from every banker interaction-consolidating knowledge about companies, people, leads, sponsors, mandates, sectors, and even niche subsectors. This intelligence becomes actionable, enabling smarter decisions, better prioritization, and a sharper competitive edge.\n\nIn today's M&A advisory landscape, industry expertise is the ultimate differentiator. Capturing and organizing every ounce of intelligence at the subsector level is now table stakes-and Navatar makes it effortless. On a recent episode of Navatar's A-Game podcast, CEO Alok Misra and Peter Stefanovich, Managing Partner at Left Lane, highlighted how Left Lane competes-and often outperforms-global powerhouses like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citi in supply chain M&A by leveraging specialized knowledge and cutting-edge tech.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWhy Investment Banks Have Struggled with Salesforce\n\nInvestment banking is relationship-driven, nonlinear, and long-term. Deals evolve unpredictably, with shifting strategies, multiple stakeholders, and overlapping mandates. To adapt, banks often hire professional services firms to \"build out\u201d Salesforce, mapping out every deal stage, compliance flow, and data model.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result? Over-engineered systems that drown bankers in complexity. Layers of automation that don't match how dealmakers work. And a CRM platform that require hours of manual input-with little to no return in actionable insight.\n\nHere's the reality: Even a CRM that perfectly mirrors their business process will fail-dealmakers will never have time or patience for rigid procedures, if they see no immediate benefit.\n\nNavatar's Counter-Intuitive Fix: Simplify Everything\n\nWith two decades of experience partnering with Salesforce, Navatar took a bold approach: leverage Salesforce's flexibility to dramatically simplify the user experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo more manual data entry - information is automatically captured and categorized by companies, people, deals, sectors, topics, and more.\n\n- information is automatically captured and categorized by companies, people, deals, sectors, topics, and more.

            "content": "In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries, cybersecurity stands at a crossroads \u2014 both as a leverage and a challenge. While attackers utilise AI to launch sophisticated exploits, and defenders must tap on the technology to stay ahead.\n\nMayank Upadhyay, vice president of engineering, Google Cloud Security spoke to TechCircle recently about the evolving landscape of security, the role of AI, and the importance of cybersecurity talent in India. An industry veteran, Upadhyay leads the Google Cloud\u2019s platform security controls and products.\n\nAI-powered cybersecurity race\n\nWith the massive investments in AI, every organisation is looking for ways to leverage this technology. As Mayank points out, while AI offers tremendous potential, companies are still figuring out the right guardrails to ensure safe and ethical use.\n\n\"Just like attackers are getting a boost from AI, defenders have to use it to safeguard themselves\u2014it\u2019s part of the game,\" he explained. AI-generated exploits are becoming a reality, allowing cybercriminals to automate attacks, generate malicious payloads, and bypass traditional defenses.\n\nHowever, AI also empowers defenders. AI-driven security tools can analyse vast amounts of security logs, identify potential threats, and even automate responses. \"AI can take over monitoring while security teams focus on the next actions. It helps in investigation, troubleshooting, and eliminating false alarms,\" Mayank added.\n\nUpadhyay, who has been with Google for 20 years, emphasises the company\u2019s long-standing commitment to security. \u201cGoogle has been investing in security for years. We\u2019ve consistently been about five years ahead of the industry in many security innovations,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle introduced Zero Trust (ZT) security at scale, phishing-resistant authentication with FIDO security keys, and redefined security operations (SecOps). In 2010, the company underwent a complete architectural overhaul, implementing ZT security measures, among others to protect its infrastructure from modern attackers.\n\n\u201cIn security, you can\u2019t rest on your laurels. Attackers are innovating quickly with AI, and we have to continuously raise the bar,\u201d Upadhyay stated.\n\nFurther, AI is expected to play a major role in addressing the acute talent shortage problem in cybersecurity. Large enterprises generate overwhelming amounts of security alerts, making it impossible for human teams to analyse everything manually. AI can process these alerts, identify anomalies, and provide a first layer of defense, allowing security teams to focus on critical threats, Upadhyay said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of security training material available, but AI is the way to truly scale up cybersecurity capabilities,\u201d he added.\n\nIndia\u2019s Role in the Global Cybersecurity Ecosystem\n\nIndia has become a key player in Google\u2019s global cybersecurity strategy. The company has established robust engineering teams in Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad, working across security operations, platform security, and infrastructure protection.\n\n\u201cOur teams in India are self-sustained and work on core security features across all our products,\u201d Mayank highlighted. \u201cGoogle first set up a security presence in Bengaluru 20 years ago, and now our newest center in Pune is also growing rapidly.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, this year, Google established its 1.6 million square foot campus \u2018Ananta\u2019 in Bengaluru, making it the company\u2019s largest office in the country.\n\nGoogle also operates two cloud regions in India, located in Delhi and Mumbai, with three availability zones each. According to Upadhyay, these regions can help businesses be compliant with local data residency mandates such as the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA).\n\n\u201cAt the crux of it, this is why cloud companies build regions in different locations. Customers can specify where their data is stored, and we ensure it stays there.\u201d Google\u2019s Data Residency Guarantee ensures compliance with local regulations, making cloud adoption more secure for businesses operating in India, he added.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Wiz acquisition\n\nIn related news, this week Google announced its largest acquisition to date by agreeing to purchase cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion in an all-cash transaction. This acquisition is expected to bolster Google\u2019s cloud security capabilities and cybersecurity posture in the AI era. This deal comes after previous negotiations in 2024, where a $23 billion offer was declined by Wiz's leadership, who anticipated greater future value and a possible IPO.\n\n\u201cWiz is the estimated market share leader in the Cloud Native Application Protection platform market. This is also where Google Security Command Center Enterprise focuses, but Wiz provides both more extensive and complete capabilities (filling more needs for enterprises) and much more complete coverage of Azure,\u201d said Charlie Winckless, VP analyst at Gartner.\n\nWiz\u2019s capabilities will give Google better coverage in the rapidly growing cloud market. For reference, Google Cloud trails behind its two major competitors AWS and Microsoft Azure, capturing about 12% of the market share.\n\nWinckless added that Google has been expanding its presence as a security provider for some time. They have had internal security features in Google Cloud including offerings such as Google SecOps (formerly Chronicle), Google Mandiant Cyber Defense (acquired in 2022), and in 2024 expanded their GCP-focused Google Security Command Center Enterprise to provide support for AWS (and limited support in Azure).",

She said AI will help in getting better resolutions using data as well as reduce human errors.\"There is a need to lean into the change and not resist,\" Bhattacharya said.The former SBI chairperson also said that humans and AI can together deliver far greater efficiency and productivity.\"It is better to benefit from the change rather than resist it. The nature of jobs will change and there will be better business resolutions using data. Human errors will reduce,\" she said.\"There is a need for people to reskill themselves. The issue is how to be a part of the change. Data has to organised and accessed,\" Bhattacharya said.AI has passed through a phase of innovation, she pointed out.\"First, AI was using structured data, which was its predictive age. Then came language processing leading to generative AI. The next wave will be the robotic age ,\" Bhattacharya said.Salesforce started operations in India in 2005 with its first centre of excellence in Hyderabad. It has also collaborated with Bandhan Bank to improve efficiency of the private lender's loan originating systems for housing and commercial advances.\"Salesforce has spread to six locations in India with an annual revenue of USD 1 billion with a workforce of 13,000. We are seeing consistent growth in India,\" she said.\"West Bengal is a rising horizon. Companies here are digitising to improve efficiency and productivity There is a lot of demand originating from Bengal and the east relating to AI products,\" she added.",

            "content": "More than half of Salesforce\u2019s most strategic suppliers \u2014 based on the amount the $38 billion software company spends on goods and services \u2014 have agreed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions as part of binding provisions in their contracts.\n\nThose clauses are part of the Salesforce Sustainability Exhibit, introduced four years ago, in May 2021, as an amendment to the company\u2019s standard contact language.\n\nAmong other things, the exhibit requires Salesforce business partners to set science-based emissions reduction targets within two years of signing, figure out the amount attributable to doing business with Salesforce and come up with a plan to deliver those goods or services in a carbon-neutral way. The contract calls upon suppliers to invest in some sort of remedy \u2014 such as investing in renewable energy or planting trees \u2014 if it can\u2019t deliver emissions cuts.\n\nThe initiative is part of Salesforce\u2019s high-level pledge to cut the carbon footprint of its supply chain in half by FY2031. The company has committed to an absolute reduction of 50 percent for all emissions by 2030.\n\n\u201cThese are the things that we need from our suppliers in order for us to be able to make progress against these commitments,\u201d said Louisa McGuirk, sustainable procurement director at Salesforce.\n\nOne-on-one interactions overcome reluctance\n\nSalesforce prioritized its biggest contractors during renewals to introduce the Sustainability Exhibit, with procurement managers reaching out personally to explain the rationale behind the change, address potential objections and come up with ways to address them. Common themes:\n\nMany suppliers needed their legal teams to review the exhibit paperwork because it was novel.\n\nSome companies had no sustainability strategy in place and the concept of setting emissions reduction goals was completely new.\n\nMost suppliers needed buy-in at the leadership level.\n\nOthers were concerned about the costs associated with creating, measuring and managing an emissions reduction target.\n\nAlong the way, Salesforce adjusted certain requirements; for example, instead of setting a specific year by which all suppliers needed to come up with their strategy, it adjusted the deadlines to accommodate individual business needs. \u201cWe do an annual review and make sure things still align,\u201d McGuirk said.\n\nThe company also created a net-zero toolkit outlining the process of setting commitments. And it offered coaching to smaller companies to help them come up to speed on core concepts related to emissions reductions and guide them through the process of creating an initial greenhouse gas inventory. Salesforce also helps cover the costs of submitting data to EcoVadis, which tracks disclosures.\n\nCompliance as a business differentiator\n\nVisions Management, a small, woman-owned firm that handles facilities management, knew little about net zero before it was approached by Salesforce. \u201cWhen the contract was first presented, I was overwhelmed,\u201d said Visions founder and CEO Amy Garber. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it all meant. I was afraid of failure.\u201d\n\nPositive reaction from Visions\u2019 employees convinced the company to make the push. It received coaching from Salesforce to assist with the transition and used interns from a local high school to gather data and research viable options for purchasing carbon credits.\n\nVisions had its science-based targets for emission reductions approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in early 2025. It discusses that status with current and prospective customers. \u201cI feel like we have won deals because of this. It\u2019s another piece that adds to the value of our services,\u201d Garber said.\n\nProcurement as an adoption driver\n\nAdoption of the Sustainability Exhibit as a percentage of the Salesforce\u2019s spending with outside suppliers will slow on an annual basis, McGuirk said, because it started with its biggest contractors.\n\nThe reason Salesforce targeted contractors by spending \u2014 rather than on their emissions \u2014 was because progress was easier to track using existing carbon accounting methods, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from a handful of suppliers that without Salesforce\u2019s nudge, or the Exhibit, that they wouldn\u2019t have set targets or it would have taken a lot longer to set those targets,\u201d McGuirk said.\n\nMany large companies actively encourage suppliers to reduce emissions through science-based targets \u2014 and some even offer educational resources and technical assistance to help \u2014 but Salesforce remains unique in codifying those commitments as part of its procurement process, according to sustainability consultants. That said, software maker Zendesk, itself a Salesforce supplier, introduced a similar set of contract clauses in December.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s adoption numbers are impressive, considering how long it can take to train corporate procurement teams to have these conversations and the reluctance to alienate key suppliers, said Emily Damon, chief growth officer at consulting firm ClimeCo. \u201cIf it comes from your sustainability team, it\u2019s cute. If it comes from procurement, it is serious.\u201d\n\nA benefit of these programs is that help large companies gather more specific metrics surrounding the full extent of their Scope 3 emissions, getting more accurate data than the estimates they are typically forced to use, said Cooper Wechkin, founder and CEO at RyeStrategy, which is coaching some of Salesforce\u2019s suppliers.\n\nBest practices\n\nAccording to the experts consulted for this story, companies interested in shaping programs similar to that of Salesforce should:",

            "content": "Thanks to rising recession fears exacerbated by multiple trade wars. Investors have turned to alternative avenues to protect their wealth, from purchasing gold to bidding up real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, the smart money has an even bolder idea: rotate back into heavily deflated technology firms such as cloud-based software giant Salesforce Inc CRM.\n\nTo be completely upfront, the idea of betting on Salesforce\u2019s stock is a contrarian and therefore risky one. Aside from the tariffs that could impose macroeconomic pressures against Salesforce's primary revenue drivers, the company didn't do itself any favors when it released its fourth-quarter earnings results late last month.\n\nHeadline figures came in mixed, with the highlight being earnings of $2.78 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.61. Unfortunately, revenue in the quarter landed at $9.99 billion, missing the consensus view of $10.03 billion (though it was an improvement of nearly $9.3 billion from the same quarter last year).\n\nSee Also: US Home Sales Jump In February, Median Price Nears $400,000\n\nStill, the real story at the time was management's guidance for fiscal year 2026 revenue, which ranges from $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion. In contrast, analysts were expecting revenue to reach $41.375 billion. Subsequently, Salesforce suffered conspicuous volatility.\n\nRecently, though, a floor appears to have developed around the $270 level \u2014 and the show support may have fundamental justification. Last week, Salesforce committed to invest $1 billion in Singapore's artificial intelligence sector, an effort to promote the adoption of the company's AI product Agentforce.\n\nFurther, analysts are generally optimistic about Salesforce stock, rating the equity a consensus Buy. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in particular remarked that while the \"geopolitical poker\" game has caused some anxieties, the expert isn't hitting the panic button. Specifically, Ives named Salesforce as one of the potential winners of the so-called AI Revolution.\n\nSmart Money Senses An Opportunity\n\nParticipating in the equities market can be a humbling experience, in large part because the influence of opinions is grossly uneven. While retail investors may think a certain way, ultimately, money talks. Therefore, when institutional players \u2014 the entities that actually matter \u2014 dig into a particular enterprise or asset, it's always worth paying attention.\n\nDuring the midweek session, Benzinga's options scanner identified generally bullish activity. In terms of dollar volume, the most optimistic transaction was for sold (or written) $240 puts with an expiration date of Oct. 17, 2025. Essentially, the trader(s) underwrote the risk that Salesforce share prices won't drop materially below $240 by expiration. For the risk, they are receiving the premium (bid) of $11.40 or $1,140 per every 100 shares represented by one option contract.\n\nNevertheless, from a swing trader's perspective, the most intriguing transaction could be the long $260 calls expiring April 17. At the time, the ask on these calls stood at $25.15. Adding this figure to the strike price results in a breakeven threshold of $285.15. With a little less than a month to expiration, CRM stock is within striking distance of this target.\n\nOf course, Wall Street players aren't in the business merely to break even. No, the smart money anticipates that there are profits to be made, which implies that CRM stock could move much higher. Determining the magnitude of a possible upswing is where the statistical data comes into view.\n\nImage by author\n\nUsing pricing information from January 2019, a long position held for any given eight-week period has a 57.41% chance of being profitable, a clear upward bias.\n\nRight now, Salesforce\u2019s stock is enjoying modest momentum, with shares up roughly 2% in the trailing five sessions. Under similar circumstances, a subsequent eight-week-long position has a nearly 65% chance of being profitable.\n\nThroughout the eight weeks and assuming the positive scenario, traders may assume a median return between 9.24% to 9.77%.\n\nSetting Up a Strategic Play on Salesforce Options\n\nWith the market intelligence above, aggressive traders can front-run an anticipated recovery with a multi-leg options strategy called the bull call spread. This particular approach is appealing because it effectively discounts a net long position.\n\nFor the previously mentioned April 17 expiration date, a tempting idea is the 280/290 bull spread. This transaction involves buying the $280 call (at a time-of-writing ask of $940) and simultaneously selling the $290 call (at a $480 bid). The proceeds from the short call partially offset the debit paid for the long call, resulting in a net debit paid of $460.\n\nShould Salesforce\u2019s stock hit the $290 short strike price at expiration, the trader collects the difference between the strike prices (multiplied by 100 shares per option contract) and the net debit paid, or a maximum reward of $540 per each spread. This translates to a max payout of over 117% on what is approximately a 4% move in the open market.\n\nTo be clear, if CRM stock doesn't cooperate, the trader is at risk of losing the entire net debit paid since the long call is currently out the money (OTM). However, it's impossible to realize such massive rewards in a large-capitalization enterprise like Salesforce unless there's significant volume involved. That's the power of leverage, which makes options trading risky but incredibly tempting.\n\nNow Read:\n\nImage: Shutterstock",

            "content": "Let's talk about the popular Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$360 and falling to the lows of US$272. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$279 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Salesforce\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nIs Salesforce Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $410.82, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Salesforce\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from Salesforce?\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth March 20th 2025\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 60%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.",

            "content": "The topic of stock trading by the members of Congress or other highly ranked officials has been widely discussed by investors and market enthusiasts for many years, driven by the perception that lawmakers\u2019 trades might offer insights into upcoming market-moving policies or future legislation. This ongoing scrutiny has even led to the creation of thematic ETFs that track the disclosed trades of US legislators and weigh the stocks by their popularity among the members of the Congress. This allows retail investors to replicate congressional investment strategies and potentially profit. Anecdotal portfolios of individual Congress members or high rank officials emerged as well, some of which even managed to outperform the broad US market. These products highlight how public attention has evolved from merely ethical considerations to practical investment opportunities, reflecting investors\u2019 belief in Congress members\u2019 informational advantage or superior market timing.\n\nWhile it is clear that any US administration has publicly positioned itself against stock trading by high-ranked public officials and members of the Congress, the reality is often much more complex and difficult to enforce. It is even more difficult to prove whether a public official did use non-public information in making his/her investment decisions \u2013 particularly because the official may invoke the Mosaic approach, arguing that their trades were based on many pieces of publicly available information and personal analysis and reasoning. The key takeaway for investors is that we may never witness a perfect world in which members of the Congress do not own and profit from their stock investments.\n\nMost recently, in December 2024, President Biden publicly endorsed a full ban on stock trading by members of Congress, asserting that lawmakers should not be able to profit from the stock market while serving in office. The newly inaugurated President Trump has had a similar stance for many years, as he famously stated the following:\n\nMembers of the US Congress have historically been permitted to own and actively trade stocks, a practice frequently scrutinized and critiqued for potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns related to insider trading. Although this issue has periodically surfaced in public debate, significant legislative action took place with the introduction of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2012, which explicitly prohibited members of Congress and federal employees from using non-public information for personal profit and required prompt disclosure of stock trades. Nevertheless, the enforcement of the act has been unclear, as numerous lawmakers have drawn criticism for late or incomplete reporting of transactions.\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Members of Congress Own . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the stocks that members of Congress own.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe believe that monitoring the trades of lawmakers may be especially useful during times of rapid change, such as a drastic regime change during which the views of the new administration significantly diverge from those of the old one. The Trump 2.0 administration has given investors vertigo so far, as it becomes more and more difficult to predict the next moves related to tariffs, immigration, public spending, healthcare budgets and defense. We believe such periods of massive change would bring significant opportunities for people knowing (or inferring using the Mosaic approach) the next moves of the US administration: for instance, any sudden cuts in Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement policies may drastically hit the Healthcare sector, favoring thematic put options; Defence stocks may witness uplift if President Trump shifts his stance regarding the continuation of military aid to Ukraine; government contractors and consultants, which are currently beaten down, may witness a surge in stock price if the new Government announces any major new projects. All in all, we advise to exercise cautiousness when interpreting congressional trading data, as inferring actionable insights from lawmakers\u2019 investments may lead to misleading conclusions or overlooked risks.\n\nIs Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) a Stock That Members of Congress Own?\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Periodic Transaction Reports that US politicians are obliged to file, as well as thematic ETFs to pick the most widely owned stocks by the members of the US Congress. We then compared the list with Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of hedge funds\u2019 ownership as of Q4 2024 and included in the article the top 10 stocks with the largest number of hedge funds that own the stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software, providing businesses with tools for sales, marketing, customer service, and analytics. Its platform includes Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Commerce Cloud, helping organizations manage customer interactions and business processes. The company also offers AI-driven insights through Einstein AI and low-code application development with Salesforce Platform.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has made remarkable progress in integrating AI solutions, with its Agentforce platform standing out as a sophisticated tool that merges technology from the Airkit acquisition with in-house developments. The company reported significant success with 5,000 Agentforce deals in Q4, of which 3,000 were paid contracts. The platform has shown outstanding performance, enabling customers to achieve up to 50% resolution rates, while Salesforce itself recorded an impressive 84% deflection rate, requiring human intervention in only 2-3% of cases. Central to CRM\u2019s AI strategy is its Data Cloud, which provides a seamless way for clients to consolidate data from various sources without heavy IT investments. This foundational technology has been implemented with notable speed, as exemplified by large enterprises like Saks Fifth Avenue deploying agents in under 10 days.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is also shifting to a universal credit system for AI services, offering clients greater flexibility to expand their applications beyond traditional CRM use cases. Unlike basic automation tools, the company\u2019s AI initiatives are centered on advanced reasoning capabilities and the ability to address complex scenarios across various functions, including sales, marketing, commerce, and customer service. Implementation support is readily available through self-service channels, system integrators, and AI-assisted setups that simplify the configuration and testing process. Furthermore, the platform is highly adept at working with unstructured data, enabling organizations to better understand their customers and enhance the precision of their marketing campaigns. These advancements solidify the company\u2019s position as a leader in delivering AI-driven business solutions. With at least 162 hedge funds owning the stock, CRM is also one of the stocks owned by Congress.\n\nOverall CRM ranks 5th on our list of the 10 stocks that members of Congress own. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks To Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

Salesforce offers a number of upskilling opportunities, including an AI certification, Martinez said.\n\n\"I do think this is going to be a personal advantage,\" Martinez said. \"Those people that are leaning in, understanding that skill in and of itself, of human and AI or human and Agent interaction, and getting more and more experience.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

The analyst highlights CRM shares as having the potential for \u201cquality growth at a reasonable price.\u201d He reiterated a Buy rating and a $400 price target, representing a potential 43.51% upside for CRM stock.\n\nSills points to Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce artificial intelligence (AI) platform as the reason for the bullish stance on the stock. He says this could see 2% incremental growth in the second half of 2025 based on Salesforce Data Cloud. The analyst also notes that Salesforce intends to introduce a new pricing model for Agentforce. This will prevent additional pressure on margins by charging tokens based on problem complexity.\n\nSills isn\u2019t the only analyst to weigh in on CRM stock recently. Five-star Stephens analyst\n\nBrett Huff initiated coverage of the company yesterday with a Hold rating and a $311 price target, representing a potential 11.58% upside for the shares. While Huff admits Salesforce is right to bet on AI, he points to its reliance on legacy technology as an issue that will affect its growth. The analyst also argues that the company\u2019s AI efforts are already baked into its share price.\n\nCRM Stock Movement Today\n\nCRM stock is up 0.79% on Wednesday after falling 0.72% yesterday. The stock is also down 16.63% year-to-date and 8.55% over the last year. The stock went through a rough period earlier this year when the AI sector was rocked by the DeepSeek reveal. While many companies have recovered since then, CRM isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIs CRM Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, the analysts\u2019 consensus rating for Salesforce is Moderate Buy based on 30 Buy, eight Hold, and two Sell ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $375.58, a high of $440, and a low of $243. This represents a potential 34.75% upside for CRM stock.\n\nSee more CRM stock analyst ratings\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

Own had more than 7,000 customers at the time.\n\nAmong the changes are Salesforce expanding its data mask ability with Own Accelerate seeding, allowing for secure, representative test data in sandbox environments. This summer, Salesforce will allow users to set dynamic data masking policies in its Data Cloud offer, according to the vendor.\n\nOwn Secure has been integrated into Salesforce Shield and Security Center for better monitoring, detection and protection. Users have a centralized view of field history tracking and the ability to see which fields are ready for encryption, according to the vendor.\n\nThe new Security Center adds better risk identification and remediation and the ability to automatically identify high-risk users for fast compliance.\n\nOwn Recover has become Salesforce Backup & Recover, bringing continuous data protection for Salesforce users. Backup & Recover can capture and visualize data and metadata changes in real time and send alerts for anomalies and accidental deletions.\n\nData is recoverable at the minute and field level and Backup & Recover works with ServiceNow and Microsoft Dynamics 365 data, according to Salesforce.\n\nThe new Salesforce Discover gives developers and administrators insight into historical data in a secure time-series format. Discover integrates with Salesforce subsidiary Tableau, Salesforce Data Cloud and the vendor\u2019s Agentforce artificial intelligence agent platform.\n\nDiscover automatically tracks data in backups and can feed predictive models such as propensity to buy, according to Salesforce.\n\nThe Archive tool promises to optimize data storage spend by archiving inactive records and allowing automated archival policies and custom retention periods to fit regulations. Users can make archived data visible to users in production but inaccessible to Agentforce if they want, with an easy unarchiving capability.",

This would imply an average annual margin expansion of 100 basis points from fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe primary driver of margin improvement is expected to come from sales and marketing efforts.\n\nTo achieve this, Sills highlights the importance of the sales and marketing to incremental revenue ratio as a key metric.\n\nAccording to the analyst, there is significant potential for further improvement through several initiatives, such as reducing the ratio of account executives to accounts, leveraging partnerships, enhancing product packaging and using Agentforce internally within the company.\n\nThe analyst explains that the continued development of Agentforce is expected to result in negative research and development leverage, which will partly counterbalance the positive leverage from sales and marketing efforts mentioned earlier.\n\nPrice Action: CRM shares are trading lower by 0.89% to $278.74 on Tuesday.\n\nNow Read:\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock",

The long-term outlook includes a dominating position in the AI services industry driven by new products, including Agentforce, and advances in existing AI technology, including Data Cloud. The two are driving a robust influx of new contracts, a multi-billion dollar revenue stream that has only begun to flow. Is AI still in its earliest stages? Of course, it is; the data center infrastructure to build all the models and support all the apps is still being built. Salesforce is ahead of the game in developing the technology and driving its adoption.\n\nAI services and automation are serious opportunities for this company. The AI software services market value is estimated at $98 billion for 2024; the annual recurring revenue for Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud and AI at the end of Agent Force\u2019s first quarter of availability was $900 million. That\u2019s about 1% of a market forecast to grow at a 30% CAGR, in which Salesforce takes a share. CRM\u2019s AI and Data Cloud ARR is up 120% year-over-year on client wins and penetration, expected to remain solid in 2025. Regarding the AI software services market, it is expected to sustain a 30% CAGR through 2030 and grow 4x in that time.\n\nGet Salesforce alerts: Sign Up\n\nAdoption is the key to AI\u2019s success, and Salesforce's plans to invest $1 billion in Singapore are evidence of its leadership position. The company plans to spend the money over five years as it aids the country's transition to an automated, AI-assisted model. The plan is to expand architecture, align with Singapore\u2019s data residency regulations, and work with educational facilities to develop awareness, increase proficiency, and drive the adoption of Salesforce products across industry verticals. Likewise, Singapore Airlines, which uses Salesforce products to deliver consistent, personalized services, is partnering to develop new CRM AI tech for the airline industry.\n\nAnalysts Reset Price Targets: Long-Term Outlook Is Intact\n\nThe response from the analysts following the Q4 release is bearish at first glance, but a deeper dig reveals several interesting details. Not only is the group firm with its Moderate Buy rating and belief the stock can rise by at least 30% this year. The post-release activity includes numerous price target reductions, sufficient to put the stock on MarketBeat\u2019s list of Most Downgraded Stocks.\n\nSalesforce Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$364.14\n\n31.21% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 41 Analyst Ratings Current Price $277.53 High Forecast $450.00 Average Forecast $364.14 Low Forecast $236.00 Salesforce Stock Forecast Details\n\nStill, the revisions align with the consensus, and many are leading to the high-end range. The consensus implies a 30% upside, and the high-end range adds double-digits to it. The risk is that analysts will continue to lower their targets this year, but that is unlikely.\n\nThe critical takeaway from the analyst's reports and commentary is that the guidance is cautious. The company prudently invests in growth, preparing to scale profitability as demand grows. The likely outcome is that Salesforce will exceed its guidance and issue guidance improvements as the year progresses, creating a catalyst for analysts and the broader market.\n\nAs it is, the company is forecasted to sustain a high-single-digit revenue CAGR despite the generally more robust forecast for AI services growth, putting it at only 10x its 2035 earnings forecasts. The stock could rise by 200% to 300% over the next few years in this scenario.\n\nSalesforce Pulls Back Into a Buying Opportunity\n\nSalesforce stock pulled back following the FQ4 release because there were no catalysts to drive traders into action. However, numerous catalysts drive investors, so the price decline presents an opportunity for them.\n\nThe risk is that Salesforce's stock price will pull back further before bottoming. The critical support level is near $280 in mid-March and may be broken before the month\u2019s end. The market for CRM stock could fall to the $255 level in that scenario, providing an even deeper value.\n\nBefore you consider Salesforce, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Salesforce wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Salesforce currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "Unity Environmental University has established itself as the first higher education institution in the United States to deploy Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, introducing an AI-powered agent named \u201cUna\u201d that promises to revolutionize student engagement and streamline administrative operations.\n\nA recent briefing held during TDX 2025 revealed how this Maine-based institution is leveraging Salesforce\u2019s technology stack to address critical challenges facing higher education today, from student recruitment to retention and operational efficiency.\n\nReimagining the Student Experience\n\nDr. Melik Peter Khoury, President of Unity Environmental University, explains that Una represents a fundamental shift in how students interact with the institution: \u201cAs we integrate Agentforce into our workflows, we can quickly address standard questions like financial aid details or class registration while freeing our team to engage more deeply with students.\u201d\n\nIn our exclusive interview with Dr. Khoury last November, he shared a more comprehensive vision for Una that extends far beyond typical chatbot functionality: \u201cI want to replace the request for information page on our website. I want to get beyond \u2018fill out this form and we\u2019ll send you stuff.\u2019 I want the student to be able to come to our website, speak to our agent, and anything that they could possibly be emailed, mailed, sent, called or talked to\u2014I want the agent to be able to have that conversation.\u201d\n\nThe immediate implementation focuses on prospective students, guiding them through admissions and program selection. Perceval Inkpen, Digital Experience Analyst at Unity Environmental University, notes: \u201cRight now, Una is designed for prospective students, guiding them through the application process, helping them find programs that match their career goals, and showcasing the Unity experience.\u201d\n\nBeyond Chatbots: The Agentic Advantage\n\nWhat distinguishes Una from traditional chatbots is its ability to act rather than simply retrieving information. During the press conference, Margo Martinez, VP & GM of Education at Salesforce, emphasized this distinction: \u201cUnity\u2019s students will now have access to a deeply knowledgeable, contextually aware AI agent that can provide personalized support, 24/7 throughout their entire university experience.\u201d\n\nDr. Khoury had previously shared with us the challenge his team faced in developing Una: \u201cThe biggest challenge in developing Una wasn\u2019t programming it with pre-defined answers but teaching it to understand our institutional knowledge. We approached it like onboarding a new staff member\u2014providing comprehensive documentation and allowing the AI to develop its own understanding rather than limiting it to a set of scripted responses. This is what fundamentally separates Una from traditional chatbots.\u201d\n\nUnified Data Architecture as Foundation\n\nUnity\u2019s implementation is built on a comprehensive Salesforce architecture, combining Agentforce with Education Cloud and Data Cloud to centralize student data on a single platform. This integrated approach aims to reduce advisor workload by approximately 25% and shorten class registration to under 20 seconds\u201412 times faster than previous methods.\n\nIn our November interview, Dr. Khoury described his technology strategy as \u201cSalesforce-first,\u201d explaining: \u201cIf it can be done in Education Cloud, it should. If it can\u2019t, then can it be integrated into it? We are able to start working towards a centralized data structure from prospect to planned giving.\u201d\n\nThe university expects significant efficiency gains, with recruiters potentially saving an estimated 17 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. This aligns with Dr. Khoury\u2019s prior statement about his institution\u2019s approach: \u201cWe created this enterprise model with shared services and centralization around finance, HR, IT, and then created verticals that are obvious and product-related to allow maximum differentiation pedagogically.\u201d\n\nLooking Beyond Initial Implementation\n\nDr. Khoury\u2019s ambition extends far beyond the current deployment. In our interview, he outlined a vision where Una evolves into a lifelong companion for students: \u201cOur vision is for every student to have their own dedicated AI agent from day one at Unity. This agent will support them throughout their entire educational journey and beyond graduation. The true power lies in continuity\u2014the agent retains their complete academic history, enabling it to provide relevant guidance as alumni transition to careers and continue their lifelong learning.\u201d\n\nDuring the press conference, he reiterated how Una bridges technology and human connection: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about automation, it\u2019s about fostering more meaningful interactions and ensuring every student feels supported and valued throughout their journey at Unity.\u201d\n\nImplications for Higher Ed Technology Strategy\n\nFor Salesforce architects and developers in the higher education space, Unity\u2019s implementation represents a significant case study in enterprise agility applied to education. When asked directly if that was his approach, Dr. Khoury confirmed: \u201cI want people to think of Unity like Yamaha\u2014the company makes both pianos and motorcycles, but they\u2019re not using the same engineers for both product lines. Similarly, our faculty teaching in-person courses aren\u2019t the same ones teaching online. We\u2019ve created an enterprise shared services model with centralized corporate expertise and specialized vertical divisions that allow us to adapt without disrupting the entire organization.\u201d\n\nUnity\u2019s experience suggests that institutions willing to embrace AI agents may gain significant competitive advantages. As Dr. Khoury noted in our interview: \u201cThis is the higher education equivalent of Netflix versus Blockbuster. Most institutions are still operating like Blockbuster\u2014forcing students to come to a physical location, follow rigid procedures, and pay penalties for not following the rules. Netflix offered Blockbuster a partnership for $50 million and was laughed out of the room. We know how that story ended.\u201d\n\nA Model for Future Implementation\n\nFor Salesforce architects considering similar implementations, Unity\u2019s approach offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of deploying AI agents in higher education. Dr. Khoury recommends starting small: \u201cChoose one manageable project and learn from it. In education, we often claim to value continuous improvement and iterative approaches but then contradict ourselves by wanting everything perfected before launch. You need to be willing to learn and adjust as you go.\u201d\n\nUnity\u2019s deployment of Agentforce represents a significant step toward transforming higher education through technology. As Dr. Khoury concluded in our interview: \u201cViewing AI merely as a productivity tool for existing processes is shortsighted. The real opportunity lies in developing digital partners for your employees that fundamentally transform how work gets done and how students experience education.\u201d\n\nThis pioneering implementation may serve as a blueprint for other institutions seeking to enhance student experiences and operational efficiency through AI-powered agents, ultimately reshaping what it means to be a truly modern educational institution.",

            "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Software Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other best software stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nThe software industry has firmly established itself as one of the most resilient and fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. As digital transformation continues to expand across various industries, businesses are increasingly relying on software solutions to enhance efficiency, support seamless growth, and foster innovation. The rising focus on automating workflows, improving customer experiences, and leveraging data-driven insights has sustained the high demand for software products.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Software Growth\n\nEric Compton, an equities strategist for Morningstar Research Services, underscored artificial intelligence and digital transformation as major drivers for growth in his Industry Outlook published on March 11. He projected consistent revenue and margin growth for the software sector, with total industry revenue anticipated to rise at an annual rate of 11% through 2029. Key factors supporting this growth include high customer retention due to switching costs, significant initial investments that translate into steady revenue streams, and sustained demand for digital transformation. Compton also identified AI adoption, increasing data requirements, and the shift to cloud-based solutions as central drivers for growth, while cautioning against potential challenges like higher interest rates, economic uncertainties, and regulatory issues.\n\nThe Morningstar strategist further emphasized that despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term demand for software remains strong, particularly in database software and customer experience applications, which are expected to grow at the fastest rate. Software companies gain an advantage from substantial upfront investments in R&D and customer acquisition, which lead to long-lasting, high-value client relationships. Compton also underlined the fact that most firms in the sector possess strong competitive advantages, or \u201cmoats,\u201d primarily due to switching costs and network effects. Once a company adopts a software solution, shifting to a competitor is complex, ensuring a stable revenue stream. Although IT spending has normalized following the pandemic, ongoing automation, AI-driven advancements, and customer-oriented software solutions are expected to fuel sustained growth in the sector.\n\nOpportunities in the Software Market\n\nRecent performance in the global software industry has been marked by volatility. Jason Hunter, JP Morgan\u2019s Head of Technical Strategy, shared insights in a January interview with CNBC, highlighting trends in the software and semiconductor sectors. He noted that while semiconductor stocks led market growth in 2024, the software sector gained momentum later in the year but underperformed in December. This pullback brought the valuation ratios of both large- and small-cap software stocks back to their breakout levels relative to semiconductors, offering a more favourable risk-reward scenario for software investments.\n\nIn conclusion, despite recent volatility and macroeconomic risks, the software sector remains an attractive space for investors due to its promising long-term outlook. Ongoing investments in cloud technology, AI, and digital transformation are expected to drive growth, with segments like database software, customer experience tools, and cybersecurity anticipated to expand at a faster pace. Companies that adapt to emerging technological trends, maintain strong customer retention, and use AI to drive innovation are likely to achieve the greatest success in the future.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the 10 best software stocks to buy according to billionaires, we shortlisted the top 10 enterprise and application software stocks most favoured by billionaire investors, leveraging Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database on billionaire holdings. We then arranged the shortlisted stocks in ascending order based on the number of billionaire investors holding stakes in each company as of Q4 2024. Additionally, we provided insights into hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, using data from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of hedge funds.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of market close on March 14.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 23\n\nBillionaire Holdings: $9.0 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a global leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its cloud-based platform provides solutions for sales, service, marketing, and commerce, enabling businesses to build stronger customer connections using the power of data and AI. Salesforce\u2019s AI-driven tools, including Einstein, offer predictive insights and automation to boost productivity.\n\nOn March 12, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced its plan to invest $1.0 billion in Singapore over the next five years. The company aims to accelerate Singapore\u2019s digital transformation and promote the adoption of Agentforce. With Singapore\u2019s labor force growth slowing due to an aging population and lower birth rates, Agentforce offers a solution to quickly strengthen the workforce in essential service and public sector roles. Similarly, in February, the company had announced a $500 million investment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn late February, the company reported strong FY 2025 (FY ending in January) revenue of $37.9 billion, reflecting a 9% year-over-year increase. Total remaining performance obligation (RPO) rose 11% YoY to $63.4 billion, while free cash flow grew a robust 31% to $12.4 billion. However, revenue guidance for FY 2026 was slightly below expectations, with an anticipated range of $40.5-$40.9 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $41.5 billion. Despite this, the street maintains a positive long-term outlook on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), with consensus forecasts suggesting an upside potential of 43%.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 2nd on our list of best software stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "BizTips: An arsenal of tools is at the ready to help you find the ideal customer\n\nAn ideal customer is someone who benefits the most from your products or services and is most likely to buy from you repeatedly. Identifying this customer requires thorough research and analysis.\n\nAccording to HubSpot (2022), defining an ideal customer\u2019s persona involves considering demographics (age, gender, location, income level, education and occupation), psychographics (values, interests, lifestyle and personality traits), behaviors (shopping habits, brand loyalty and social media engagement), and pain points (challenges they face your business can address).\n\nConduct Market Research \u2014 Market research provides the data necessary to refine your ideal customer profile. Small-business planners can use both primary and secondary research methods to gather insights.\n\nPrimary Research involves collecting new data directly from customers. Methods include: Surveys and Questionnaires \u2014 Online or in-person surveys help businesses understand preferences and pain points. According to a report by Qualtrics (2021), 89% of businesses use customer feedback surveys to enhance their offerings. Interviews and Focus Groups \u2013 Speaking directly with customers provides qualitative insights into their emotions and motivations. Observation and Customer Interactions \u2013 Analyzing in-store or online behavior can reveal buying patterns and preferences.\n\nSecondary Research uses existing data from credible sources, such as: Industry Reports \u2013 Reports from firms like Nielsen, McKinsey, and Statista offer deep market insights. Competitor Analysis \u2013 Studying competitors' customer base can reveal market gaps. Social Media and Online Reviews \u2013 Monitoring online discussions helps identify common customer concerns and trends.\n\nUtilize Customer Segmentation - Customer segmentation divides a broad audience into smaller groups based on shared characteristics, enabling more personalized marketing strategies. Demographic Segmentation \u2013 Targeting customers based on age, gender, income, etc. Geographic Segmentation \u2013 Differentiating customers by location. Psychographic Segmentation \u2013 Grouping customers by lifestyle, interests, and values. Behavioral Segmentation \u2013 Identifying customers based on their purchase history and brand interactions.\n\nAnalyze Customer Behavior Understanding how customers make purchasing decisions is crucial. Several models help businesses comprehend customer behavior: The Buyer\u2019s Journey \u2014 Customers typically go through three stages: Awareness, Consideration, and Decision. Businesses should tailor content to each stage. Customer Feedback and Reviews \u2013 Direct feedback through online reviews, testimonials, and support interactions provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction. Data Analytics \u2013 Tools like Google Analytics and CRM software track customer interactions, allowing businesses to refine their strategies.\n\nBuild Customer Relationships Long-term success depends on fostering strong relationships with customers. Key strategies include: Personalized Communication \u2013 Using customer data to personalize emails, recommendations, and offers. Excellent Customer Service \u2013 Providing responsive and helpful support builds trust and loyalty. Community Engagement \u2013 Engaging with customers through social media and events strengthens brand connections. Loyalty Programs \u2013 Rewarding repeat customers increases retention rates. A Harvard Business Review (2022) study showed that 65% of a company\u2019s business comes from existing customers.\n\nLeverage Technology to Understand Customers. Modern technology provides powerful tools for gaining deeper customer insights. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems \u2013 Platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot store and analyze customer data, helping businesses predict buying patterns. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning \u2013 AI-driven tools analyze customer behavior and predict future trends. Social Listening Tools \u2013 Platforms like Hootsuite and Sprout Social track brand mentions and customer sentiment online.\n\nFor any business to thrive it has to have a product or service that the market demands, has demonstrated differentiation and has customers willing to buy. Sellers need to develop deep insights into their customer base to meet their needs, wants and desires. How? (1) Apply data collection tools to gather demographic information, understand purchasing patterns and their behavior trends, (2) Use customer surveys and feedback loops to gain insight: short focused surveys, offer incentives and regularly request customer feedback, (3) Tap into social media listening to identify customer sentiments, observing their preferences and directly engage with the customer base, (4) Analyze purchase and behavior data and (5) Observe the customer journey by mapping to identify touchpoints, pain points and opportunities for engagement.\n\nPierre Herubel recommends five ideal customer principles any small business can follow: Focus on one ideal customer \u2013 you cannot be everything to everybody, Listen actively to your customers \u2013 find multiple ways to listen and learn, Understand WHY your ideal customers buy \u2013 understand their behavior and what motivates them to buy, Collect the right information about them \u2013 ask the right questions about their role in driving your revenue steams and Understand how they buy \u2013 what is their process for solving their pain points.\n\nUnderstanding your ideal customers requires continuous research, segmentation, behavior analysis, and relationship-building. Businesses that invest in these areas can create targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve long-term profitability. By leveraging data, technology, and personalized engagement, companies can build stronger connections with their ideal customers, leading to sustained success.\n\nContributed by Marc L.

They did not give any further details on what this may look like.\n\nAgentforce, an AI system that automates specific tasks, will help streamline SIA\u2019s customer service operations.\n\nThe integration of Data Cloud, a hyperscale data engine within Salesforce, allows Agentforce to aggregate and analyse relevant data, enabling AI agents to offer better support.\n\nSIA will also harness Einstein\u2019s generative AI capabilities within Service Cloud.

            "content": "As an adult, however, they're status symbols.\n\nEvery store seems to have a designated aisle for travel cups. I've also seen countless teens carrying Owala tumblers, and readers regularly want to discuss the Stanley craze with me.\n\nThe top contender at the moment comes from Bink. If you haven't already, you're sure to see the brand's silicone-covered glass bottles all over Instagram and at Pilates classes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI know I have. So, I tried one myself and am here to share that the product, unfortunately, didn't change my life.\n\nIt's just a slightly better bottle than the last one I used daily.\n\nBusiness Insider USA\n\nWhat's attracting people to Bink? A few things.\n\nI purchased Bink's most popular product, the 27-ounce Day Water Bottle with a flip cap, at Target. They're normally priced at $38 each, though I got mine on sale for $24.99.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the week I tested it, I found a handful of things to like, including its silicone case. It made the bottle comfortable to hold and eased any worries about damaging the glass.\n\nThe latter was important to me, as I was previously gifted a 40-ounce Stanley and used it throughout 2024. No matter how careful I was, the stainless-steel bottle seemed to dent on every outing.\n\nThat isn't an issue with Bink.\n\nBusiness Insider USA\n\nWhen I used the bottle at home, I also appreciated its compact size. I could loop my finger around its moveable strap and bring it wherever needed \u2014 without feeling like I was lifting a gym weight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI had the opposite experience with Stanley. The brand's tumbler was so large that it felt too heavy to lug around, even from room to room. Its square-shaped side handle was also big and always in the way.\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, a representative for Stanley 1913 noted that its 40-ounce bottles have lifetime warranties and \"convenient handles.\"\n\n\"We're consumer-obsessed at Stanley 1913,\" the representative said. \"These intentional design details resonate with those who have come to know and love our brand.\"\n\nThe Bink bottle isn't perfect\n\nSome users have complained on TikTok about Bink bottles spilling and not keeping drinks cold for hours, and sure, they don't work like Stanley cups in those ways. Still, neither complaint was a dealbreaker for me.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat frustrated me more is that, in my experience, Bink bottles can be a headache to travel with.\n\nIts wide shape is too bulky to fit in any car cupholder I tried, and I didn't want a full water bottle rolling around my passenger seat. I had to balance it atop the console and hope it didn't fall.\n\nIn an email to BI, Bink's cofounder, Ben Parfitt, said the brand now sells an $18 accessory that allows its 27-ounce bottles to fit in car cupholders and a slimmer 21-ounce cup that fits on its own.\n\nThough I wouldn't spend more to make the bottle I have work, I would consider trying the latter.\n\nBusiness Insider USA\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere's also the fact that you need to refill your bottle three times to drink the recommended 84.5 ounces, as directed by its hydration markers.\n\nParfitt told BI that the bottle was intentionally designed to \"hold a decent amount of water while not being too heavy and cumbersome.\"\n\nIn that area, I think the brand succeeded. It's why I liked using it at home and preferred it to my Stanley in terms of size. I just found it a little frustrating when I was out between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and didn't have a place to refill.\n\nA more minor issue was that the silicone sleeve quickly collected pet hair and other particles, which felt a little gross. I constantly found myself wiping it off.\n\nYou can wash Bink bottles via dishwasher with or without the sleeves. If you choose the latter, though, Bink fans on TikTok say you'll have a tough time getting it back on.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response, Parfitt said Bink sleeves are now \"slicker\" on the inside and easier to take on and off.\n\n\"The best way to put the silicone sleeve back onto the bottle is by feeding the glass through one of the side cutouts in the sleeve,\" he said.\n\nBink bottles are trendy but not a necessary purchase\n\nWhen I first covered Bink in February, numerous friends and colleagues told me they wanted to try the bottle themselves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey loved how it looked and, as they had before with Stanley and Owala, thought that this could be the perfect bottle for them.\n\nThat might be the case, but I can't widely encourage them or anyone else to give in to the temptation of this new fad.\n\nI wanted to love Bink's bottle, but I didn't. I certainly don't hate it either. It's simply just a bottle.",

            "content": "With the Nasdaq Composite down more than 13% from all-time highs reached in late 2024, this market sell-off is creating some potentially nice long-term buying opportunities in the technology sector.\n\nLet's look at five growth stocks investors might want to consider scooping up during this dip.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA 5.27%) is the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, where its graphic processing units (GPUs) help provide the processing power needed to train AI models and run inference. The company's growth has been spectacular, with its revenue more than doubling in both its fiscal years 2024 and 2025 (ended in January).\n\nAs long as AI infrastructure spending continues to grow, Nvidia is set to continue to be the biggest beneficiary. Currently, the best way to advance AI models is through more processing power. So, as the AI race continues, companies are committing more and more money to build out AI data centers.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, has created a wide moat in the GPU space through its CUDA software platform, helping it take about a 90% market share. The company got about a 10-year jump on the software side against its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and the CUDA moat is alive and well today, making Nvidia a great growth stock to buy.\n\nNvidia stock is trading down nearly 22% from all-time highs reached in early January, but it still has plenty of growth potential, and that makes its price even more of a bargain.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nWhile Nvidia owns the mass-merchant GPU market, Broadcom (AVGO 2.18%) is carving out a nice niche with custom AI chips. Given Nvidia's high prices, more companies are turning toward Broadcom to help develop customer AI chips that can be used in conjunction with GPUs. These custom chips take time to develop but tend to perform better and be more cost-effective when used for a very narrow set of tasks.\n\nBroadcom currently has three main AI chip customers, which it says combined have a serviceable addressable market of between $60 billion to $90 billion for its fiscal 2027. In addition, it has recently added four more newer customers, including Apple. While Broadcom won't capture all of this spending, with some inevitably going to Nvidia, it still is a big opportunity for the company.\n\nThe recent sell-off (the stock is down about 23% from all-time highs set in December 2024) lets investors get into the stock at a nice price.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.68%) (GOOG 1.75%) is the market leader in digital advertising through its Google search and YouTube streaming platforms. The company also operates the third-largest cloud computing business and is also a leader in the emerging fields of quantum computing and autonomous driving (Waymo).\n\nWhile some investors worry about the impact of AI on its search business, there has been no meaningful effect on its growth thus far. Meanwhile, the company's huge user base, long history of search data, and an extensive client list of advertisers give it a nice advantage. AI should become a good opportunity for the company, as it should be able to create new ad formats that can help monetize the AI Overviews it now generates. Traditionally, Google has only served ads on about 20% of its search results, so this could be a big new untapped market.\n\nIn addition, the company is seeing great growth with its cloud computing unit, which saw revenue climb 30% last quarter and segment income soar 142%. The company was the first to develop a custom chip with the help of Broadcom, giving it a nice cost advantage moving forward as it builds out its data center infrastructure to help meet soaring demand. The recent sell-off (the stock is down about 21% from highs set early last month) is a great time to get into the stock for the long term.\n\n4. Salesforce\n\nAs AI continues to develop, Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) is looking to become the leader in agentic AI, in which AI agents will perform tasks at a user's behest without the need for much supervision from humans. This has a lot of real-world applications for businesses because these agents could handle customer service issues or analyze market data to help optimize marketing campaigns.\n\nSalesforce leads the way in agentic AI with the launch of Agentforce, which includes several out-of-box AI agent solutions. Customers can also customize agents through the use of no-code and low-code tools built into the platform while placing guardrails on what the agents can and cannot do. Meanwhile, the company recently launched its AgentExchange marketplace with over 200 partners to expand its use cases.\n\nAgentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per interaction, so the opportunity for Salesforce is huge. Thus far, customers have been flocking to try the product, with the company gaining 5,000 Agentforce customers, including 3,000 paying, since its introduction in October. The recent drop in the stock's price (down nearly 26% since December 2024) opens up a nice opportunity to jump into the name.\n\n5. GitLab\n\nTrading off about 31% from early February highs, GitLab (GTLB 4.20%) is a fast-growing DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform that helps customers develop software while integrating cybersecurity throughout the process. This is a high-margin subscription business that is benefiting from AI.\n\nGrowth is being driven by customers upgrading to its higher-tier Ultimate platform, which now represents about half of its annual recurring revenue (ARR). Meanwhile, its Dedicated solution, which is only offered on the Ultimate platform, has also been gaining strong traction. Dedicated offers customers data isolation and regional data residency. In addition, its AI-powered GitLab Duo add-on offering, which helps programmers complete their assignments by offering coding suggestions and automation, has also been helping drive revenue.\n\nThis is helping GitLab both boost its number of new customers and grow within its existing customer base. Last quarter, it saw its number of enterprise customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more climb 29%, while its dollar-based net retention was a robust 123%. Numbers over 100% indicate that existing customers spent more with the company than the year before (including the impact of any churn). Overall, its revenue rose 29% last quarter, marking its sixth straight quarter of between 29% to 33% revenue growth.\n\nThe sell-off is a great opportunity to pick up this high-growth stock.",

            "content": "Silicon Valley is excited about AI agents. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that agents will \u201center the workforce\u201d this year. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella promises that they will replace certain scientific jobs, and Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff is aiming to make his company \u201cthe leading provider of digital workforces\u201d through its \u201cagent\u201d services. But there\u2019s one big problem: no one knows exactly what an AI agent even is. What is an AI agent anyway?\n\nWhat is it anyway AI agent? In recent years, the tech industry has been loudly proclaiming that AI agents\u2014the latest buzzword\u2014will change everything. Just like chatbots like ChatGPT, changing the way we get information, agents are set to revolutionize the way we work. But before that happens, it would be good to at least agree on what the term means. Right now, \u201cagent\u201d has become another one of those AI-related words\u2014like \u201cmultimodality\u201d or \u201cAGI\u201d\u2014that is losing meaning through overuse.\n\nThe different faces of AI agents\n\nOpenAI says agents are \u201cautomated systems that autonomously perform tasks on behalf of users.\u201d Their Operator, for example, can book concert tickets or order groceries online. Microsoft sees them as \u201cnew applications for the AI-powered world,\u201d tailored for specific professional tasks, while assistants merely help with general tasks like writing emails. Salesforce, however, offers a broad definition: agents are systems that understand and answer customer questions without human intervention, and are divided into six categories, from \u201csimple reflex agents\u201d to \u201cutility-based agents.\u201d\n\nAnthropic, an AI lab, tries to clear up the confusion by stating that agents can be defined in many ways\u2014from fully autonomous systems that operate over long periods of time to systems that follow predefined workflows. But even that doesn\u2019t help much, as definitions continue to vary from company to company. What is an AI agent anyway?\n\nWhy such confusion? What is an AI agent anyway?\n\nPart of the problem is that AI agents, like AI itself, are vague and constantly evolving. OpenAI recently launched Operator, Google Project Mariner, and Perplexity Shopping Agent\u2014all with different capabilities. Ryan Salva, a senior director at Google, told TechCrunch that he \u201chates\u201d the word \u201cagent\u201d because the industry has misused it to the point where it\u2019s become meaningless. OpenAI\u2019s Leher Pathak even said at the X Network that she sees \u201cassistant\u201d and \u201cagent\u201d as interchangeable terms, adding to the confusion.\n\nIDC's Rich Villars says that tech companies have long been shirking strict technical definitions, more interested in what they can achieve. Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.ai, blames marketing: \"The concept of AI agents used to have a technical meaning until about a year ago when it was taken over by marketers and big companies.\"\n\nWhat do AI agents actually do?\n\nDespite the confusion, an AI agent can be defined as an autonomous system that uses artificial intelligence to perform tasks. Simple examples include virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa that manage schedules or send messages. More advanced agents are emerging in smart cities, where they optimize traffic flows, or in the financial sector, where they detect fraud. In healthcare, they can automate eligibility checks for services, and in e-commerce, they help find prescriptions and fill shopping carts, as Google\u2019s Project Mariner does.\n\nOpportunities and challenges\n\nJim Rowan of Deloitte sees this ambiguity as both an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, it allows for flexibility \u2013 companies can tailor agents to their needs. On the other hand, it leads to \u201cmisaligned expectations\u201d and makes it difficult to measure the value of these projects. Without at least internal standardization, it is difficult to assess performance or ensure consistent results.\n\nIf the evolution of the term \u201cAI\u201d is any indication, it seems unlikely that the industry will reach a consensus on the definition of an \u201cagent\u201d anytime soon. Maybe never. But that\u2019s not stopping companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Salesforce from investing billions in this technology, promising that it will transform the way we work and live.\n\nConclusion: A future without definition?\n\nWhat is an AI agent? AI agents may be the future, but for now they remain a mystery \u2013 even to those who build them. As the technology evolves, we may have to accept that \u201cagent\u201d is more of a vision than a precise concept. And perhaps that vagueness is their power: their ability to adapt to endless needs and challenges. But until we\u2019re all on the same page, the question \u201cWhat is an AI agent?\u201d will continue to baffle users and experts alike.",

            "content": "The world\u2019s top CEOs seem to be preparing for the upcoming AI and robotics revolution.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently offered a glimpse into the future of work, a future where the lines between human and digital labor blur. He declared that he would be the last Salesforce CEO to manage only humans, highlighting the transformative impact of AI and robotics on the workforce. His comments, which touched upon the \u201cdigital labor revolution,\u201d a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and the rise of \u201cagents\u201d and robots, offer a provocative look at the evolving relationship between humans and technology in the workplace.\n\n\u201cThe digital labor revolution,\u201d Benioff explained, \u201cis this three to twelve trillion dollar opportunity. It involves agents and digital agents and the agentic age, but it also beholds a robotic age. And in the robotic age, who is going to make the robots? I think that that\u2019s very impressive what the Chinese have been able to do with this robotic age. So the robots, the agents, AI \u2013 this is all part and parcel of the future.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the implications for the workforce, Benioff responded, \u201cThe robotic age means for the workforce that we are going to work hand in hand with agents and robots. I\u2019ve told my employees, my customers, I\u2019ll be the last CEO of Salesforce who only managed humans.\u201d\n\nBenioff\u2019s statement is not just a prediction; it\u2019s a recognition of a rapidly approaching reality. His reference to a \u201cthree to twelve trillion dollar opportunity\u201d underscores the immense economic potential of AI and robotics, while his acknowledgment of China\u2019s progress in robotics hints at the global competition in this transformative field. The concept of an \u201cagentic age,\u201d where AI agents act autonomously, further emphasizes the shifting dynamics of the workplace.\n\nThe implications of Benioff\u2019s pronouncements are profound. The integration of AI and robots into the workforce will not merely augment human labor; it will fundamentally reshape it. This transformation will require a significant shift in mindset, both for workers and for leaders. Employees will need to adapt to collaborating with AI-powered agents and robots, acquiring new skills to remain relevant in a changing job market. Companies, meanwhile, will face the challenge of integrating and managing a hybrid workforce, ensuring seamless collaboration between human and digital workers. Ethical considerations surrounding AI and job displacement will also need to be addressed proactively. Benioff\u2019s words serve as a wake-up call, urging us to prepare for a future where humans and machines work side by side, ushering in a new era of productivity and innovation.",

            "content": "Alice Steinglass, Salesforce (Zoom screengrab)\n\nWe hear a lot about how the advent of AI agents is going to fundamentally change how applications are built, most of it focused on the automation that generative AI brings to the development process. Clearly, this will bring big changes, reducing the time and effort required to do everything from coding and testing to deployment and monitoring. But what I find even more intriguing was what I heard in the course of last week's Salesforce developer conference, TDX25. It's not only how you build that's going to change \u2014 what you build is changing, too. Developers no longer have to build the entire app. They just have to create all the building blocks and guiderails, and then let the agent figure out how to join it all together at runtime. In a pre-briefing ahead of the event, Alice Steinglass, EVP and GM, Salesforce Platform, outlined this new approach:\n\nWith agents, I'm actually doing it differently. I'm breaking it down into smaller chunks and saying, 'Hey, here's what I want to do in this scenario, here's what I want to do in this scenario.' And then the agent, at runtime, is able to dynamically compose these individual pieces together, which means the individual instructions, they're much smaller. That makes it easier to test. And it also means that I can bring in more flexibility and understanding so my agent can interpret some of those instructions. I could have a policy document that explains them instead of hard coding them with if-then statements.\n\nThis week, I had a chance to meet up with Steinglass and explore further what this means in practice. How easy, I wonder, is it going to be for the people who build apps to adjust to this new way of doing things? It sounds like a huge shift, similar in scale to the shift from web apps to mobile and all of the change that went along with that. While agreeing that it's a big change, she points out that it's going to take a while to roll out, and there will be stepping stones along the way. She explains:\n\nIt's a sea change in the way we build applications. I don't think it's going to happen all at once. I think you break down the problems \u2014 people will move over piece by piece, but the result's going to be a fundamentally different way of building applications.\n\nDifferent building blocks\n\nOne reason why the change is going to be gradual is that most of the agents and applications that enterprises build with agentic AI are still going to include traditional, deterministic functions that work in the same way as before. What's going to be new is how these existing building blocks are joined together with other building blocks based on generative AI. Rather than having the business logic hard-coded in a predetermined set of steps, the AI is able to adapt on-the-fly to new policies, rules and goals as they are introduced. She gives an example from customer service:\n\nWhat AI allows us to do is to break down those processes into components. And we can say some of them will still be deterministic. Let's just take a service agent for example. I want to use AI for the ability to talk to a human. I want to use AI to be able to understand what they're saying and what their intent is. I want to be able to execute some of the things with AI that they're asking me to do because it's flexible. It can read the policy document. It's easier to change and adapt as things change going forward. Some of the things that it's asking me to do, like maybe issue a return, I want to do deterministically, so that they're done exactly the same way every time, and that it connects to my ERP system in exactly the right way, that the inventory is ordered, that it connects out to FedEx, all of the different pieces that need to happen. This chunk is a well known, well defined piece of the work [that] doesn't change very much. You could also think about the deterministic pieces being the pieces that are very high in compliance. The sort of things we automated in the past, because we could automate them because we did them frequently, they have a very strict set of rules. We can scale the operations because we can run them en masse. But then there's a whole set of work that we never automated because it required a little bit more human thought, because it changed more often. It wasn't worth putting all the if-thens in, because it moved so quickly that it was just so much overhead to be able to fully document this process in code. You could have, but you didn't. Now what we can do is, we can glue these different pieces together.\n\nAnother example comes from sales. Salesforce provides a Sales Development Representative (SDR) agent to do prospect outreach and qualification. This too uses a combination of deterministic and non-deterministic elements. For example, the definition of who the SDR agent makes contact with is largely deterministic, based on factors such as value or how difficult they are to reach. But composing the outreach is more likely to call on non-deterministic processes, grounded in what is known about the contact and then handling the interaction, where the flexibility of generative AI comes to the fore. Finally, the deterministic processes come back into play when it's time to move the prospect from lead to opportunity. Many enterprise processes follow a similar pattern, as she elaborates:\n\nThere's a lot of business processes that happen within organizations that are very similar, where you have a deterministic input that comes in, then there's work that needs to happen \u2014 approval processes, quote-to-cash \u2014 because there's just so many back-end processes that happen in organizations where being able to implement the AI as part of that process can make it more flexible, more future-proof, faster to code, give it more flexibility in the way it can handle the input from the customer. Then you can still have the deterministic pieces that allow you to do it in a trustworthy way within the organization.\n\nConnections to existing systems\n\nLast week saw the introduction of an Agentforce API, which will be instrumental in many of these connections to existing systems, often via MuleSoft or other integration middleware. This allows an agent to act autonomously in response to events or other asynchronous triggers, rather than waiting for a human-in-the-loop instruction to come via a chat or co-pilot interface. Many of these interactions will be deterministic calls to and from systems outside of Salesforce.\n\nBut what about non-deterministic interactions with autonomous agents running in other systems, where a richer protocol will be needed to pass over enough context for the external agent to take the most appropriate action? Steinglass says that some partners are starting to introduce actions in the new AgentExchange marketplace that connect to their own agents \u2014 she cites Copado as an example, which connects to agents running on its own LLM. But it's still early days for the emergence of standardized protocols such as Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). She comments:\n\nI think there are pieces that will go through APIs. There are pieces that go through events, the same way you do handoff between different systems today, with events and APIs. There's also a need for a richer level of communication that we want to have agent-to-agent communication. MuleSoft has already built out AI support for the Model Context Protocol. I think these protocols are evolving, and we are part of partnerships with other organizations to evolve richer agent-to-agent communication protocols. I think those are going to come out next year. You're going to see more and more. It's one of those things that's evolving quickly, because everybody's figuring out right now, how do we enable that rich communication between these different agents?... We're dedicated to keeping the system open and connected, as protocols emerge to other systems, and making agents communicate.\n\nBut even as new protocols emerge, these will take their place alongside more traditional deterministic calls. She goes on:\n\nEven when we have these richer communications, it's similar to the models today. You're going to have synchronous models, where you need synchronous, rich back-and-forth communication, where you're passing context and more information between the agents that are working together. You're going to have other kinds of communication between them, which are more like \u2014 even in the future, I would assume \u2014 API-type communication of the same way you do today. 'Hey, can you go get this thing done for me?' and the agent over here will take it and interpret it and get it done in its own context. I don't need to pass all my knowledge. I don't need to pass additional context. It's really, you know, 'I just need this order returned via FedEx. Can you get that done?'\n\nAgent maturity map\n\nSo how will Salesforce developers and admins adapt to these new ways of building apps and agents? It takes a while for organizations to move along this journey, says Steinglass, and Salesforce uses an agent maturity map to help guide customers. The first stage is building a simple knowledge agent. That can itself require a lot of groundwork to make sure that the answers will be relevant to the organization's context \u2014 its own processes, its customers, its industry, and so on. She goes on:\n\nMaking sure it's actually able to answer questions about my data with my information, that's step one. Step two is, you want it to be able to take an action. That's where you go from an AI Q&A bot to real agentic capability. You start with one action, and then you move into multi actions, and you build these standalone agents that are able to take multiple actions across your organization. Step three is being able to take actions outside, across the organization, being able to leverage the different capabilities, and then you move into a orchestrated, multiple-agent... digital workforce. How do I have many, many agents in my organization, augmenting different roles, different capabilities, and interacting with each other?\n\nWhere Salesforce gives customers a real advantage compared to other platforms, she believes, is the strength of its low-code tooling, tied into a comprehensive DevSecOps toolkit. She explains:\n\nSalesforce has always been strong at low code, and that's about... letting the people who are close to the business, be able to build the processes, the workflows and the apps that you're using in your organization. I think AI brings us even closer in that direction. As we've looked at our agentic tooling, I think we have real differentiators in low-code agentic tooling that are accessible to that business owner .\n\nThis extends through to observability, she adds, both at a detail results level and when looking at broader business outcomes. She explains:\n\nIf I sent an email, did somebody reply to it? If I gave a chat, did they abandon the chat? So there's that internal, very close, was it accurate? And then there's a larger loop, which is, is it driving the business outcome that I was hoping to get? Salesforce is very connected into those business outcomes. We've been driving those. We have those. We've been measuring those for years, right? So if what I'm trying to do is drive revenue, we've got the dashboards on whether or not they're driving revenue. We're extending all of that to support agentic observability... I think Salesforce is well positioned because our apps are already at those places that drive revenue. We're in the business processes that drive revenue, that drive opportunity for companies. And so when you apply agents into sales, into service, into marketing, into commerce, you're driving real end-user numbers on the business.\n\nMy take\n\nI think there are several important takeaways here for enterprises. The one that intrigues me most is how the concept of composability \u2014 a recent tech trend that has been somewhat overshadowed by all the excitement about agentic AI \u2014 is actually fundamental to how these agents and agentic applications are built. To give agents the flexibility they need to react to different conditions, they have to be able to select from multiple different resources. There are new elements in this composable architecture, in particular the provision of guidelines and goals that agents use to decide on the right response, but it's essentially the concept of Tierless Architecture that we've been discussing for the past several years.\n\nSecondly, the roadmap towards a fully rounded agentic AI enterprise landscape is still being built, so enterprises need to tread carefully. There are currently no generally accepted standard mechanisms for linking together autonomous agents that are native to different enterprise application platforms \u2014 they're still being defined. In the meantime, any connections that are built are going to have to be hand-crafted, with all the technical debt downsides that implies. This means that it's probably best for now to focus on agents that operate on a single platform to deliver quick wins from specific automations, rather than aiming to build complex, multi-platform processes. Every enterprise vendor, Salesforce included, has plenty enough to offer on their own platform to keep your teams busy for now.\n\nThe final takeaway, still, is that this is a fast-moving technology, where the landscape of what's possible will change rapidly not only from year to year, but from quarter to quarter. There's a risk therefore that if you move too fast, you'll simply invest in automating processes that will become redundant in the next few years as the tech delivers entirely new ways of achieving the same results with far less effort. This technology transition is a marathon and it's far too early to start sprinting for the finish line.",

Now, Agentforce, the product described by Salesforce as its \u201cdigital labor platform\u201d, has just been updated.\n\nAgentforce 2dx comes with a host of new capabilities that embed the power of agentic AI into any workflow. In this article, we\u2019ll explain those features, what the impact could be on customer value, and how it reflects on Salesforce\u2019s position within the AI industry.\n\nWhat to Expect?\n\n\u201cBy extending digital labor beyond CRM, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for businesses to embed agentic AI into any workflow or application to handle routine tasks, augment employees, and connect with customers,\u201d said Adam Evans, EVP and GM of Salesforce\u2019s AI Platform.\n\nIn a nutshell, Agentforce 2dx sees the technology expand beyond the reactive, where humans trigger outcomes, to the proactive, where changes in data cause them to occur autonomously. These proactive capabilities can be integrated into any workflow or data system.\n\nThis functionality is being delivered on the strength of a new Agentforce API which enables triggered actions to be integrated into backend processes and third-party apps and systems. Within Salesforce, these features are being delivered through Agentforce Invocable Actions, while the company has also released dedicated Agentforce embedding tools for dedicated applications including Slack and MuleSoft.\n\nWith the new updates, Salesforce is also providing users with a richer, multimodal experience. This is being delivered through several new features that specify and optimize how agent responses are delivered to customers, in context.\n\nBeyond this, the update includes the release of various low-code and pro-code tools for agent prototype testing and configuration as well as Agentforce Developer Edition, a free developer environment for both Agentforce and Data Cloud. The new apps include AI Assist for development, configuration, and troubleshooting, Testing Center, support for CLI and VS code, a DX inspector, and Agentforce Interaction Explorer, for deeper analytics and reporting.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nFinally, Salesforce has launched AgentExchange, its dedicated Agentforce marketplace and community. AgentExchange is launching with over 200 partners and hundreds of \u201cready-made actions\u201d that help organizations across many industries and sectors develop and deploy agents more quickly.\n\nCustomer Impact\n\n\u200cThe introduction of easier integration and orchestration will ultimately lead to more widespread and scalable deployments. This goes a long way to delivering the kind of company-wide digital workforce Salesforce has promised.\n\nNew testing tools and environments will lead to faster deployments, as will the introduction of Salesforce\u2019s AgentExchange. As with any other marketplace, the availability of off-the-shelf templates and actions save businesses a great deal of time while boosting the presence and revenue of partners.\n\nOne company already heavily invested in Agentforce is the global talent provider Adecco Group. \u201cAgentforce is completely transforming our recruitment process,\u201d said Greg Shewmaker, Senior vice president of global operations and AI at The Adecco Group. \u201cBy automating resume screening and using AI to engage with millions of candidates, we can connect with every applicant and make sure they feel valued and informed.\n\n\u201cThis not only improves the experience for candidates but also frees up our recruiters to focus on building meaningful relationships, all while boosting our efficiency and scalability.\u201d \u200c\u200c\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWhile developments in agentic AI are coming fast, they tend to arrive as a steady trickle. That can\u2019t be said for Salesforce\u2019s updates to Agentforce.\n\nThe company was already steaming ahead with its agentic AI platform, but the breadth of improvements that Agentforce 2dx brings are groundbreaking. With these latest agentic AI enhancements, Salesforce has taken a leap, living up to the promise of an autonomous workforce.\n\nWhile the shift from reactive to proactive agentic AI was certainly in progress, the combination of ready-to-use integration and orchestration tools and enhanced applications for faster testing, development, and deployment has supercharged the company\u2019s position, and likely that of its customers.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis\n\n.",

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has lost 10.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSalesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.42 indicates a change of +11.6% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property \u2014 developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm \u2014 will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower\u2019s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman & Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\n\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\n\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland & Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and massive foreclosure lawsuits against office landlords winding through Cook County court.\n\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago\u2019s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world\u2019s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren\u2019t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report cited by the outlet shows.\n\nMoody\u2019s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\n\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.",

An undefined opportunity management process coupled with aggressive sales goals and little supporting Salesforce structure resulted in inaccurate data, particularly post opportunity closure.\n\nThe inefficient use of Salesforce resulted in unreliable data and inconsistent workflows. This was further complicated by challenges with complex pricing, renewals, quotations, and referral management. Additionally, low user adoption indicated a systemic failure to effectively utilize Salesforce, which hindered the organization\u2019s ability to optimize its sales processes.\n\nThe solution: A collaborative approach\n\nThe company embarked on a journey to implement CPQ from the ground up in 2024. This meant not just configuring the cloud-based software, but also understanding their unique sales processes, designing a scalable solution, and ensuring smooth user adoption. (This is no small feat, especially when juggling other critical business initiatives.)\n\nAtrium\u2019s strategy and advisory team conducted user interviews and transformed the insights gathered from those sessions into tangible process maps implemented into CPQ. The goal was to streamline the sales process end-to-end by configuring each step directly in CPQ.\n\nDuring the company\u2019s transition to a new CPQ system, Atrium\u2019s Elevate team played a crucial supporting role. Recognizing that the customer was still actively utilizing their Sales Cloud platform, the Elevate team provided essential enhancement and maintenance services. This ensured that their existing sales operations remained efficient and effective throughout the CPQ implementation process, minimizing disruptions and supporting a seamless transition. As a result, the company benefited from continuous improvement and solution optimization for their Sales Cloud org.\n\nThe process: Simultaneous implementation and iteration\n\nThe CPQ implementation kicked off with a deep dive into our customer\u2019s sales processes. The consulting team worked closely with them to understand their specific needs and design a CPQ solution that aligned with their business objectives.\n\nOur Elevate team was initially assigned to address outstanding technical debt, to assist with the opportunity sales path cleanup process, and to aid the CPQ implementation team by making necessary enhancements to the Salesforce core base layer to ensure the project\u2019s success.\n\nOften, when an organization takes on a major project like a CPQ implementation, other lower-priority initiatives fall by the wayside because resource capacity is limited. By engaging Atrium in both a new implementation capacity and a managed services capacity, the company was able to expand their reach while simultaneously enhancing multiple areas within Salesforce/CPQ, resulting in continuous impact across their Salesforce ecosystem.\n\nHypercare and handover: Ensuring a smooth transition\n\nThe process of onboarding a new team during the implementation of a new system and the subsequent transition to a support and iteration model can be a long and challenging endeavor. It can cause delays in a team\u2019s ability to support quick follow enhancements and create issues in the most critical period following a release.\n\nAs a result of Elevate\u2019s continuous involvement throughout the CPQ implementation program, this handover was seamless and extremely efficient, requiring minimal time for knowledge transfer and ramp. Once the initial implementation and Hypercare period were completed by the project team, the Elevate managed services team was immediately positioned to continue providing post-project system monitoring, issue resolution, and enhancements.\n\nContinuous improvement: The power of iteration\n\nThis customer\u2019s success story doesn\u2019t end with the initial implementation as many \u201cnormal\u201d projects do. They embraced the concept of continuous improvement by working with Atrium\u2019s Elevate team to iterate on the CPQ org and sales processes overall, enhancing its functionality and optimizing its performance. This iterative approach is crucial for any Salesforce/CPQ implementation.\n\nAs an example of an iterative approach, Elevate has improved the company\u2019s processes by implementing and enhancing the following:\n\nSlack approvals for opportunities and quotes\n\nUpdates to discounts and pricing\n\nQuote approval template updates\n\nOrder form updates\n\nAdjustments to billing frequency\n\nCPI and ARR calculation automations\n\nProduct rule additions and adjustments\n\nFlat dollar vs percentage discounts\n\nNew and adjusted email alerts\n\nAccount team automations\n\nCode coverage and apex cleanup\n\nUpdates to code susceptible to SOQL injection\n\nLessons learned from a successful CPQ implementation\n\nWhile every project and customer is unique, there are some key takeaways from this project that can apply to any company considering Salesforce CPQ (or other products that are new to their org):\n\nEmbrace managed services: Leveraging Atrium\u2019s Elevate managed services can provide the expertise and support needed to successfully maintain and enhance a complex CPQ system. Managed services can be engaged throughout an ongoing project and post implementation. The most successful managed services engagements we have seen have been long-term partnerships that span multiple project engagements.\n\nLeveraging Atrium\u2019s Elevate managed services can provide the expertise and support needed to successfully maintain and enhance a complex CPQ system.

Prioritize collaboration across multiple teams: Close collaboration between Atrium\u2019s Consulting Project team, Atrium\u2019s Elevate team, and our customer\u2019s internal stakeholders was essential for the engagement\u2019s success and ongoing adoption.\n\nClose collaboration between Atrium\u2019s Consulting Project team, Atrium\u2019s Elevate team, and our customer\u2019s internal stakeholders was essential for the engagement\u2019s success and ongoing adoption.

            "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the \u201creal urban experience of living in San Francisco,\u201d which he didn\u2019t associate with the city\u2019s traditional high-end neighborhoods on the north side of town. Instead he went into SoMa, \u201ceyes wide open,\u201d buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n\n\u201cNo surprises,\u201d he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. \u201cWe knew everything\u2014all the good and the challenges that we were in for\u2014and saw some real improvements along the way.\u201d\n\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\n\n9 Bernice Street via Daniel Lunghi\n\n9 Bernice Street via Daniel Lunghi\n\n9 Bernice Street via Daniel Lunghi\n\n9 Bernice Street via Daniel Lunghi\n\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to replicate what\u2019s been done here,\u201d according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it\u2019s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n\n\u201cYou really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,\u201d he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is \u201cbaked in\u201d to the asking price.\n\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP\n\n\u201cNot everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,\u201d said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk\u2019s work for Mitchell.\n\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn\u2019t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today\u2019s \u201cvalue-driven buyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,\u201d Haze said.\n\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The \u201cperfect fit\u201d would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\n\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women\u2019s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\n\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has \u201cflirted with\u201d the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can\u2019t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n\n\u201cThey want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.\u201d",

            "content": "As every major tech company grapples to claim a stake in the ever-evolving AI landscape, it's increasingly becoming difficult to determine who will be the winner (or if there will be one anyway).\n\nSo far, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic have shown great promise in the space. Even Apple with its delayed strategy briefly scaled to the top, becoming the world's most valuable company ahead of Microsoft and NVIDIA with over $3 trillion in market valuation.\n\nOver the past few months, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has shared interesting insights about Microsoft's AI efforts. The executive claimed Microsoft has done a\"tremendous disservice\" to the industry while referring to Copilot as the new Microsoft Clippy, further suggesting it doesn't work or deliver value.\n\nMore recently, Salesforce's CEO was recently featured in an interview with Motley Fool host Dylan Lewis, discussing Agentic AI and the company's next chapter. The interview kicked off with Benioff indicating that Agentforce isn't the company's \"first AI rodeo.\"\n\nAccording to Benioff:\n\n\"We've been doing AI for more than a decade at Salesforce, predictive AI, machine learning, machine intelligence. Our Einstein platform is probably the largest most important enterprise platform for AI in the world. We deliver about a trillion enterprise AI transactions every single week. The generative revolution has just been incredible. What we've seen happening with these large language models over the last two years is really astonishing.\"\n\nSalesforce touts AI lead over Microsoft\n\nSalesforce logo. (Image credit: Getty Images | NurPhoto)\n\nAs you'd expect, the executive didn't pull any punches to criticize Microsoft's AI efforts. \"But I think for a lot of our customers, they've been very disappointed with a lot of the solutions that have been given them or even shoved at them,\" Benioff added. \"Even Microsoft has really disappointed so many of our customers with what they call Copilot.\"\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe executive outlined that the company is following a different approach with Agentforce. He further indicated that it helps develop the largest and most important transformation of the entire tech industry \u2014 touting it as the digital labor revolution.\n\nSalesforce's AI efforts are seemingly turning the company into a profitable venture:\n\n\"We've never seen a product or technology take off at this level. We just reported our quarterly results. As you know, we just had our first $10 billion quarter. We're the second largest software company in the world behind Microsoft, and the fastest-growing product that we have in our product line is Agentforce. Now, we probably did about 5,000 different types of Agentforce transactions in the quarter, 3,000 of which were paid transactions, and we did about nine digits in total contract value in Agentforce.\"\n\nThe executive outlined how Agentforce is gaining broad adoption across the world. It supports consumers by making work easier as they navigate the internet, researching and shopping for stuff.\n\nSalesforce CEO admits they are not the only ones exploring new and innovative feats in the AI space. However, the executive says Salesforce stands out with its products, claiming it has transformed and changed the conversation.\n\nAs you can see that before it was about a Copilot and they repackage and resell ChatGPT as their AI solution. They don't really make one yet. They're trying to make one. They're basically an OpenAI reseller. I think the problem is that for a lot of the customers, they've had to DIY that into what is a complex enterprise architecture, and it has not exactly worked. Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff\n\nBenioff suggested Microsoft was in \"panic mode\" after announcing its plan to add support for creating autonomous agents to Copilot Studio, potentially giving Salesforce's Agentforce a run for its money following Benioff's comments. He claimed Copilot is a flop because Microsoft lacks the data to create real corporate intelligence while touting Agentforce's excellence in the field.\n\nAside from Salesforce's AI efforts, Benioff also commented about the company's conundrum about hiring software engineers in 2025. While the executive didn't outrightly disclose the company's plans to replace software engineers with AI, he admitted that the technology helped enhance productivity at work and boosted revenue.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Communication Officer Frank X. Shaw recently addressed Benioff's jabs toward the software giant, claiming they are \"all about marketing, less about truth or substance.\" Shaw further claimed that Marc doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nThe executive echoed Microsoft CVP of Business & Industry Charles Lamanna's sentiments about the company's success in the AI landscape/ For context, over \"100,000 organizations\" had used Copilot Studio to create AI agents by October 2024.",

            "content": "At the TDX 2025 developer conference in San Francisco, Salesforce executives presented its Agentforce agentic AI technology as a \u201cwhole system\u201d approach, where large language models (LLMs) are less significant than a \u201ctrinity\u201d of data, applications and agents. Relatedly, they consistently disparage \u201cDIY\u201d artificial intelligence (AI) programmes.\n\nPaula Goldman, the supplier\u2019s chief ethical and humane use officer, said: \u201cI think a lot of the public discourse about AI has been about [large language] models. But if you think about Agentforce, it\u2019s a whole system. There\u2019s a foundation model, and then there\u2019s a series of smaller models that go into our Atlas system, and there are workflows that are automated that people can draw on. We\u2019ve got used to talking about AI as models over the past few years, but I think we need to be talking about systems.\u201d\n\nDavid Schmaier, president and chief product officer at Salesforce, said the supplier\u2019s entire technology stack, including Slack and Tableau, comes into play with Agentforce. He also pointed to its Data Cloud platform as central to its AI offer.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a computer without a microprocessor; you need storage and RAM and a display and an operating system around it. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We have our data cloud, which harmonises hundreds of thousands of systems. It gives you the data, the metadata and the semantics. That\u2019s why we can outperform an LLM by itself. LLMs have hallucinations, they have bias, toxicity. An LLM is necessary but insufficient. We add to the LLM. Our view is the data powers the AI and then the AI powers the customer experience of the future,\u201d he said.\n\nAn LLM is necessary but insufficient. We add to the LLM. Our view is the data powers the AI and then the AI powers the customer experience of the future David Schmaier, Salesforce\n\n\u201cWe call it the \u2018holy trinity\u2019. We have the Data Cloud, then we have our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud apps \u2013 which is how we got the name Salesforce \u2013 as well as Slack, Mulesoft and Tableau. And now we have Agentforce on top of all that. That\u2019s how we can turn on 10,600 customers over three days with agents. It\u2019s because we are using the same platform as we have for 25 years. So, with a healthcare company, for example, that has workflows it has bult in its Salesforce deployment, it can make all those available for [virtual] agents,\u201d Schmaier added.\n\nHe believes too many organisations are doing DIY AI. \u201cMost people are just trying to take whatever apps they have, whether it\u2019s Salesforce or SAP or Workday, and just buying ChatGPT and trying to plug it in. No other competitor has what we have, in terms of agents. We think we have a real lead in this agentic field. We\u2019ve sold to 5,200 customers since launching at Dreamforce [in September 2024]. Now, we have 200,000 customers, and most don\u2019t use Agentforce today,\u201d he said.\n\nRahul Auradkar, executive vice-president and general manager of Unified Data Services and Einstein at Salesforce, made a similar argument about what the provider calls DIY AI.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing with agents is an entire system. We\u2019re not shipping a model, an app or a copilot. We\u2019re shipping an AI system on a deeply unified platform. What that system allows our enterprise customers, who don\u2019t want to do the DIY, to do is surface customer-centric analytics and workflows, and listen to the customers to feed back to the system so the agents get better. Copilots are a narrow sliver of what AI can be,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a DIY AI and an enterprise using [our] system is that the enterprise can focus on things that they are good at, which is plenty of things. They have their data. The have their transactions. They have their engagement data. They have their AI policies, their workflows, their automations. We bring all that together within a deeply unified platform and drive value for our customers,\u201d added Auradkar.",

We also do extremely advanced artificial intelligence development,\" he added.\n\n\"We have dozens of... the very best AI engineers in the world here in our Singapore research center.\"\n\nSalesforce noted that Singapore \"has been dealing with a slowing growth rate of the labor force, contributed by an aging population and declining birth rates\".\n\nIn a separate joint announcement, Salesforce and Singapore Airlines said the carrier would use Agentforce to \"streamline its customer service operations\".\n\n\u00a9 2025 AFP",

I've been doing models for a long time in AI, and they're constantly leapfrogging each other. We're trying to leapfrog everyone ourselves. It's a fun game that we play in the tech industry. But the large language model game has been won by nobody yet. This idea that the model that's successful today is going to be the model that's going to be successful tomorrow is not true.\n\nMary Long: I'm Mary Long and that's Marc Benioff. He's the co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. Salesforce helps other companies manage their relationships with customers through a number of different Cloud-based software offerings. Recently, Salesforce has added something called Agentforce to that suite of offerings. The idea behind Agentforce is that autonomous AI agents take action on behalf of customers and employees. Listen to any Salesforce earnings call, and you'll hear Benioff talk a lot about this concept of Agentforce and agentic AI. On today's show, my colleague Dylan Lewis catches up with Benioff. They have a conversation about this move from generative to agentic AI and what that transition means for companies and consumers and employees. They also talk about building versus buying and how Benioff feels about the acquisition of Slack and Tableau in hindsight. Plus, they talk about reckless predictions and where Benioff thinks the AI race is headed next.\n\nDylan Lewis: I'm excited to have you on because you are one of the most authoritative people on one of the biggest themes out there in the market right now. AI was the theme of 2024. It is continuing to be the theme, although it's shifting a little bit. I think we've seen things move from a real focus on strictly generative AI to a little bit more of a focus on agentic AI, and that is where Salesforce is really living right now. Can you walk us through that transition and what you're seeing in terms of development there?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, Dylan you already know, this is the most exciting time I've ever had in my career. This is also not our first AI rodeo. We've been doing AI for more than a decade at Salesforce, predictive AI, machine learning, machine intelligence. Our Einstein platform is probably the largest most important enterprise platform for AI in the world. We deliver about a trillion enterprise AI transactions every single week. The generative revolution has just been incredible. What we've seen happening with these large language models over the last two years is really astonishing.\n\nBut I think for a lot of our customers, they've been very disappointed with a lot of the solutions that have been given them or even shoved at them. Even Microsoft has really disappointed so many of our customers with what they call Copilot. Instead, we have a different approach, which is the next generation of our platform that we call Agentforce. The idea that you can really take and create something that we believe is going to be the largest and most important transformation of the entire tech industry, which is the digital labor revolution. The digital labor revolution is like a $3-12 trillion opportunity. It's really different for people in my industry.\n\nWe're mostly people who just help companies manage and share their information. We do that really well, customer information, all kinds of apps that we have to help companies manage their information. Now we're really stamping out digital workers at scale and giving companies the ability to manage digital employees alongside their human employees. That is very different, very exciting and really the next level of our entire technology industry. This is a moment that none of us will ever forget.\n\nDylan Lewis: I want to dig into those digital employees and the idea of these digital agents. As you guys are rolling out Agentforce and having more conversations with your customers around it, what are you seeing in terms of adoption and what are you hearing back from your customers in terms of what's useful and what's not so useful?\n\nMarc Benioff: We've never seen a product or technology take off at this level. We just reported our quarterly results. As you know, we just had our first $10 billion quarter. We're the second largest software company in the world behind Microsoft, and the fastest-growing product that we have in our product line is Agentforce. Now, we probably did about 5,000 different types of Agentforce transactions in the quarter, 3,000 of which were paid transactions, and we did about nine digits in total contract value in Agentforce. Now, why it's important is we're already starting to see customers deploy it. It's getting deployed at a much faster rate than we've seen other products. Even this morning I was buying some new shoes from Vans. I went to Vans.com on my phone. Here's my phone right here as a point of evidence. [LAUGHTER] I could probably bring up the site. It's probably still on there.\n\nI'm getting ready and I wear really wide shoes. I just got on there and there's five icons at the bottom of the Vans site now and the middle icon is the Agent icon. You click on Agent and you have Agentforce, and that is deeply connected through the whole company. I'm very interested in, hey, what are the wide shoes and which shoes are going to be the most comfortable for me? Also, hey, I need support on returning shoes that I just bought and I need help here, I need help there, and the Agent is able to work out and resolve all of these things for me. That is what is really cool and exciting. Hey, what can I say? This is happening faster than I expected. I didn't know that was going to happen. The CEO of Vans, somebody I've known for a long time, used to be the CEO of a tech company. It's a company called VF Corp, their amazing company.\n\nI'm like, \"Wow, this is unbelievable.\" He said back to me, \"Well, people are telling me this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened on our site.\" I'm like, \"It's hard to put it in context what is happening because instead of having to call some advance, someone to email someone advance, I'm able to work with a very intelligent digital worker who's helping me to complete my transaction to get the customer service and support and all the things that I need.\" That is very exciting. That is what I am motivated by every single day now. I've got so many customer stories and that one I just found randomly this morning when I got up. I'm like, let's just keep going. It's so cool.\n\nDylan Lewis: As someone who wears a 12 EE, I'm appreciative of everything that you're doing through my shoe-buying experience.\n\nMarc Benioff: You should go and try them. You'll see they've got a really nice, cool, wide shoe on their site.\n\nDylan Lewis: Earlier you mentioned Microsoft, and I'm going to take the bait there. You're not alone in pursuing this type of technology. They are also announcing that they have agents out there. They are trying to work that into a lot of the software they bring to their customers. When you think about these offerings, what do you see as the differentiators and what are you really competing on?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, I think there you know, obviously, we've transformed, changed the conversation, as you can see that before it was about a Copilot and they repackage and resell ChatGPT as their AI solution. They don't really make one yet. They're trying to make one. They're basically an OpenAI reseller. I think the problem is that for a lot of the customers, they've had to DIY that into what is a complex enterprise architecture, and it has not exactly worked. You can talk to the customers because likely we have a stream of customer stories now. I think that the reason that's happening is we've just extended our core platform. We're not really asking customers to add anything new. We're just asking them to turn it on.\n\nI was with one of our largest customers an airline in Singapore, Singapore Air, we've all heard of it and the CEO Goh is amazing and they've been a customer for a long time, great relationship with a client. They're like, \"Yeah, we're just turning this on. This is amazing. We now have the agentic layer around the entire airline. We can do sales, we can do service, we can do marketing, we can do all of these things.\" That is really cool and really gives us this ability to augment their workforce, and they're shocked at how fast they can install it and get it going because they're just flipping a switch and turning it on. This is different than that Microsoft approach, the Copilot approach. First, Microsoft Copilot and we talk about that, customers realize it's not just one Copilot. They have a dozen Copilots on all their different product lines, none of them are connected together. It's not one source of data. It's not this one piece of enterprise code. It's a real hodgepodge approach. That's why it's failed. I think our approach is much simpler, easier and more successful. With real customer success because of the architecture. I think it's the architecture that's making it difference. That ability to deliver that, high-quality semantic layer on the data that's really giving us this capability with AI.\n\nDylan Lewis: I think with artificial intelligence, one of the big things we've had to acknowledge a lot in the last couple of years is it is going to change the way that a lot of businesses work and the way that a lot of companies work. I saw that Salesforce isn't planning on hiring engineers this year. How do you see agentic AI playing into the way that work gets done for you guys, but also for a lot of your customers?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, I have a lot of software engineers, probably more than 10,000, maybe close to 12,000 now, and they're a huge part of our workforce. We have 75,000 employees, but I've noticed they are just so much more productive using these next generation of tools. The so many new next-generation productivity tools. In that same way, humans will be augmented. In the example of Gucci, we took our technology and we applied it to a call center in Florence, Italy. We augmented the call center, and it's really incredible what happened. All of a sudden, we were like, OK, are they going to need less support agents? It turned out revenues went up 30% in the call center because the support agents were able to sell products, market products. They could understand products that before they did not have or understood. That was awesome and incredible that we could make their revenues go up and make them more profitable.\n\nWe've seen the same thing happen in a company in Miami called Lennar. They're a huge home builder in the United States, maybe the largest or one of the very largest, and they have two great co-CEOs, Stuart and Jon, who I've been talking to because their team came to Dreamforce which is our annual Powwow Lapa Balza conference concert. We have like 40, 50,000 people come to San Francisco for that one. Their team came. They've been a customer for eight years. They do sales and service and marketing, they do all these amazing things. The team came back to Miami and they ran a hackathon to look at how could they use Agentforce inside Lennar. What they found was that there are five critical use cases. If they could do it, they could potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars of more profit, huge amounts of revenue and basic things like being able to provide an agentic layer on all of their home sales that are 24/7, lead management, selling new products to existing customers like insurance or mortgages. You can not have to have a very big fantasy to see, wow, there's a lot of things these agents could do because it's just hard for them to hire more workers. They're really extending their human workforce with these digital workers, and it's a digital labor revolution.\n\nFor a Lennar or for any of these companies that I mentioned, it's an extension. In some ways, it is a transformation. Another company in Florida that we work with very closely is Disney and for Disney, of course, it's augmenting not just like the Disney Plus call center, but it's also really providing a different interface for, first of all, the employees. They're cast members. The products at Disney are so complex and so deep and they have so many that when cast members are trying to understand all the products and trying to communicate to the customer, they need tools to do that. That's number 1. But the second thing is the ability to deliver an agent that can talk directly to the customer on a complex product configuration. Like for example, I'm coming to Disney World. I want to have a really incredible hotel room. I also want to have a restaurant reservation. I have an allergy. I need to make sure that the restaurant knows that when I get there. I also want to make sure I have all the accompaniments for the park when I get there, the right park pass, the right promotion, the right additional Disney Guide, all of the different products of Disney, they start to get bundled together into a SKU for this client who's coming to the park on vacation with their kids. Wow.\n\nThey're humans, they do have a hard time putting it all together. The agents can help and the agents can talk directly to the customer and then you can see this even on our own website any moment the customer, boom can move over to a human agent. Then a human agent gets a screen because we're all operating in the same app, the same dataset. It's that same Trinity. Then the human is looking at, oh, yeah, I can see, here's the client, here's the allergy, here's the hotel, here's this. This is not something that I'm just making up on the fly. This is something that we've built that I've seen getting deployed, that I'm excited about that this can be really is possible and maybe a year or two year ago, it was not possible.\n\nWe really have made huge strides. Whether it's that hospitality or media company or financial services company or consumer product goods company or airline or a clothing company or tech company. Every single company can benefit from this technology, and that is why this is going so fast.\n\nDylan Lewis: You just talked about how this was something that you guys built. I know historically, Salesforce has been a mix of you guys home grow some stuff. You acquire companies that look interesting and make sense as part of your overall suite. In the AI zone, is that something where you guys want to focus more on home growing, or are you still looking out there and seeing what opportunities might be there in the market for you?\n\nMarc Benioff: We believe that there is for a high growth, high-quality tech company, the perfect balance between organic and inorganic innovation. Even in the example of Agentforce, I was able to accelerate it because we already had the vision. We knew what we wanted to do, but we knew we needed to have an extended team. We wanted some technology that we did not have inside. Eight or nine years ago, 10 years ago, I bought a company. It was an amazing company that we integrated deeply into our product that became Einstein. The founders of the company left after about five or six years, and one of them started a company that we invested in. Then about a year ago now, I bought that company, and it was an aqua hire in one level.\n\nThat means just hiring the people. Another level, I like some of the technology they had, but I knew I could simply and quickly extend my platform with it to bring forth our AI in a new way, and that is Agentforce. Acquisitions are important. In other areas, we've entered new markets, and we have critical products like Slack. A lot of people use Slack. It's a huge product. Incredible. He had a huge growth year last year, and one of the reasons why Slack is growing and more relevant than ever is it's an incredible place where agents can live. In fact, I just retweeted, a developer came along this morning and said, Hey, I can see how Slack is going to become this place where all my agents are now operating, I'm communicating with them, and yet they're all collaborating with all the other workers in our company. That's very exciting for us. Slack was an incredible acquisition. Tableau is another one. Now, a lot of folks haven't seen the new Tableau yet. It's called Tableau Next. I have always loved Tableau. It came out of Stanford.\n\nThey did this amazing work in business intelligence and analytics, always wanted to buy the company, and finally had the chance to do that. The product is awesome, but we're moving into the agentic world. I have rewritten it. I rewrote it over the last basically a year. In that case, I don't need to acquire it already had it. But now Tableau has a deeply integrated agentic layer, data Cloud, and app layer, just like we've been talking about when tableau users see this coming up in the new conference, they are going to honestly flip out. They call themselves the DataFam. To see the next generation of Tableau that it could have another decade or two decades of growth ahead of it with a new architecture is really exciting, not just for me, but I think for the entire community. I'm really excited about that, the new Slack, the new Salesforce. I think refreshing our whole product line with this trinity approach, rewriting everything into this architecture. This is transforming our company and our customers, and we're going to see a lot of new exciting deployments this year and refreshed deployments of what was already deployed, getting extended.\n\nDylan Lewis: I'm glad you brought up Slack because I was going to have to ask you about it. It's the biggest acquisition, and Tableau also something that has a lot of brand recognition. We've used at the fool, and I think a lot of people who follow the software space know well. Now that you've had a little time with both those, I'm curious, how would you grade those acquisitions with the benefit of some perspective? What's the work to be done there that you still see?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, number 1 with Slack, I can give you a lot of class on acquisitions. I've done more than 60 acquisitions. It's 25 years of Salesforce, more than 60 acquisitions, and so there's a lot of lessons, but I think the Slack, number 1, when we bought the company, great brand, great product, great team. I think that the team that we acquired had a slightly different vision of the future than we did and why we bought it. They were struggling, competing against Microsoft. They didn't understand how to differentiate themselves. There were issues, which is why we were able to buy it. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to buy it because it was incredible. I think they were on their way from one billion, on their way to two billion. Now the thing is on its way 2 billion to 3 billion, and there aren't that many $3 billion products in enterprise software, Slack is one. These products have grown, they've been refreshed, rebuilt.\n\nBut sometimes you have to rebuild the team. They have to realize they're part now of a different company Salesforce. It's a different culture. We have a different vision, we have a different architecture, and they're going to benefit from being part of our architecture because they want to be part of our DataCloud. They want to be part of Agentforce, and that's what gives our customers this incredible value because now, let's take any one of those stories that I just went through, but let's say you are in Singapore Airlines and you do have Salesforce as your platform and you have these agents and you have this agentic layer and you are doing sales and service and marketing and commerce and all these things. Now you also have Slack, your employees are collaborating and that's all working together, and that is what is cool, and that's why I love the new Slack, what we've done with it. We're showing that off today a trail head DX, for example, customers are loving it, tweeting about it, we're showing off some of the work. This is what gets us excited is to innovate, to create, to conceptualize the future.\n\nWhat I love is you can take some of these brands that they may not have a clear trajectory without us, but then you bring them into our architecture, and it transforms them and gives them not only an expanded customer base to sell to because all of our salespeople now are selling Slack, for example. We have a huge Salesforce selling Slack where before Slack only had a couple of hundred people selling Slack. Hey, if you're going to compete with Microsoft, you need a company like Salesforce who, A knows how to market and position against Microsoft but B can sell directly to customers. I was just talking with one of our largest customers yesterday, the CEO of a large pharmaceutical company, a great company. I use their products myself. I wear contacts. I use our contacts. He's a huge Slack user, running his company. I was telling him how excited I was about the new Slack and what I thought was going to happen and what he could do now that he could not do before. I was really happy about it.\n\nDylan Lewis: As we wrap up here, we've spent a lot of time talking about AI, generative AI, agentic AI, I'm going to ask you to peer into your tech crystal ball a little bit. Do you have a reckless prediction on the direction or the development of AI, whether it's in how customers will use it, how businesses will use it over the next five years?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, I think we see a few exciting things happening in the industry, and I think people need to reframe how they're thinking about this. Number 1, you see these companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into these data centers, not just one. You, Dylan, could probably list five or 10 of them on your own, without even notes in front of you. I could, too, and I am driving my cost down. By moving my platform to work on as many of these as I can because I can take advantage of a lower-cost infrastructure. I want to be a software hyperscalar. I don't want to be a hardware hyperscalar where we have to build these data centers.\n\nI want to have a portable platform that works across all of these data centers. That's a huge priority for me, and I think that's a tremendous prediction for the future, which is everything is going to be a lot lower cost to deploy. That's super powerful that you have companies putting so much of their capital, and I don't want to impact my balance sheet and income statement by doing this, so I'll take advantage of the investments that these companies are making and partner with them. That's number 1. Number 2 is you can really see, I've said this quite a few times, and I think initially people didn't feel it was true. I think now they get it. These large language models are mostly commodities right now and have been. I've been doing models for a long time in AI, and they're constantly leapfrogging each other. We're trying to leapfrog everyone ourselves. It's a fun game that we play in the tech industry. But the large language model game has been won by nobody yet, and this idea that the model that's successful today is going to be the model that's going to be successful tomorrow is not true. You can see, for example, I'm getting ready to delete Open AI and ChatGPT off my phone which is something that I would never have even thought of six months ago. But now all I'm using is this Grok app, and it's fun.\n\nIt's got this crazy edgy voice capability. Elon Musk has transposed his personality into the way he's divided up the voice platform. I don't know if you've tried that Grok-3. It's crazy. Everyone's got a crazy story. I did a demo yesterday for a friend of mine. They couldn't believe it. Like this unhinged mode and storyteller mode and all kinds of other crazy modes. I'm like, Well, this is just better right now and more accurate and more fun than the ChatGPT app. Maybe I'm going to delete that off my phone. Why am I paying $20 a month for that? I'd rather be paying for this. I probably have six or seven of these things on my phone, and I'm getting ready to pair them down. Then, is Grok going to be the best app a year from now? I don't know.\n\nMaybe I'll end up putting the ChatGPT back on. Maybe I'll be using you.com as a great one. Maybe I'll be using Perplexity. I have no idea what's coming. I couldn't have told you this is what was going to happen a year ago. That's a commodity part of the infrastructure. The LLM, it's like disk drives. Disk drives and RAM and the computer. These are all commodity infrastructure components that are being made by large tech teams competing with each other, and that's how we drive our costs down. That is something that I think is very important that, yes, you have a new commodity part of the infrastructure, the large language model. When I look at those things, I think the third piece is everyone saying, Hey, AGI is coming, but nobody exactly can define it. Nobody can describe it. No one we can seem these movies, our futurist Peter Schwartz was a key writer on Minority Report and war games and Deep Impact. It's like, let's say AGI is coming and that we're all going to be talking to how and saying, Hey, I'll open the doors and, no, I don't want to open the doors. But the doors, that's not how my doors are working right now. Maybe that's coming but it's not here yet. I'm like, I'm willing to be optimistic on AGI, but I also realized like, what does AGI really mean? I think that for those LLMs, they're great, but we know they don't have 100% accuracy either.\n\nThey're like, we have the highest accuracy, and the highest we've seen with some of our customers is in the 90s. We're in the mid-80s ourselves right now on our own deployment. We're going to try to get into the 90s. But we're not going to get to 100 because the way that the thing is architected with these words are all hooked up with each other, and then they turn into these spider, neural network words, and these ideas aren't going to give us 100% accuracy. New models will have to come with new AI ideas, and nobody's going to want an AGI that's only 50% accurate. That's going to cause chaos. Maybe AGI is just going to mean 100% accuracy, and when will we get there? I don't know. There's some fantasy of what the next generation is going to be. Maybe it's going to be a multi-sensory model, a world model. It's a three-dimensional rendering model. But those are the three things I would say. One, much lower cost infrastructure that we're all going to be able to ride on, two commodity LLMs and three, yes, these future states that are very exciting. I hope that we get there. The future is definitely coming, and we've seen the movies, and we all want that to happen. It's going to be exciting.\n\nDylan Lewis: Well, Mark, if your game in a year, we'll have you back on to see which phone app you are using and also the progress that you're making on Agentforce.\n\nMarc Benioff: It's great to see you, Dylan.\n\nMary Long: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The agents also use a sophisticated reasoning and learning engine, dubbed Atlas, to continuously adapt and improve their capabilities.\n\nThe key to Atlas\u2019s capabilities lies in its architecture, including the use of specialised embeddings models that enable Agentforce agents to understand the nuances of different business processes, data formats and industry-specific requirements. This allows the agents to operate seamlessly within the customer\u2019s existing workflows and systems.\n\nSingapore Airlines will also leverage the Einstein generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in Service Cloud to summarise customers\u2019 previous interactions with the airline. It can also provide guidance on assistance, enabling customer service representatives to better understand and anticipate customer needs. This will reduce average response times, facilitating more efficient and proactive customer service.\n\nGoh Choon Phong, CEO of Singapore Airlines, said: \u201cAs the world\u2019s leading digital airline, Singapore Airlines is committed to investing in and leveraging the relevant technologies to enhance customer experiences, improve operational efficiencies, drive revenue generation, and boost employee productivity.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the airline has been an early adopter of GenAI, developing more than 250 use cases over the past 18 months and implementing around 50 initiatives across its operations. These include the use of GenAI-powered bots to understand and address customer queries and perform tasks such as bookings and cancellations on its Pelago travel experiences platform.\n\nTogether [with Salesforce], we will co-create AI solutions that drive meaningful and impactful change and set new standards for service excellence in the airline industry Goh Choon Phong, Singapore Airlines\n\n\u201cSalesforce is a pioneer in agentic AI.

This ensures agents only have access to the data and business processes that are appropriate for their designated responsibilities, preventing unauthorised access to sensitive information.\n\nTo help customers better manage the lifecycle of AI agents and deploy Agentforce at scale, Salesforce introduced an AI agent lifecycle management tool in November 2024 to test the different ways a customer may pose a question or interact with an agent, as well as monitor and observe the behaviour of AI agents to improve their performance and accuracy, among other capabilities.",

This investment underscores Salesforce\u2019s support for Singapore\u2019s National AI Strategy 2.0 and the nation\u2019s vision as a driver of global AI innovation.\n\nSpurred by a USD $6 trillion digital labor market, thousands of customers around the world are investing in Agentforce, Salesforce\u2019s digital labor platform, to build and deploy agents that can reason, decide, act, and drive meaningful outcomes 24/7. Singapore has been dealing with a slowing growth rate of the labor force, contributed by an aging population and declining birth rates. Agentforce delivers Singapore an opportunity to rapidly expand its labor force in many key service and public sector roles.\n\nThis investment will help support Singapore enterprises as they build limitless digital workforces, bringing humans together with trusted autonomous Agentforce agents to unlock new levels of productivity, innovation, and growth. As Agentforce adoption accelerates, it has the potential to drive significant impact across Singapore\u2019s industries, startups, and the public sector.\n\nMr Jermaine Loy, Managing Director of the Singapore Economic Development Board said: \"Singapore welcomes Salesforce's investment, which will boost our ongoing efforts to build a vibrant hub for AI innovation and adoption across our economy. Salesforce's initiatives in AI research and workforce development will strengthen our ecosystem by catalysing innovation for key industries and corporates based in Singapore.\u201d\n\n\"We are in an incredible new era of digital labor where every business will be transformed by autonomous agents that augment the work of humans, revolutionizing productivity and enabling every company to scale without limits,\u201d said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce. \u201cSingapore is at the forefront of this shift, and as the world\u2019s largest provider of digital labor through our Agentforce platform, Salesforce is thrilled to expand our work with the business community and our longtime partners in the region to drive innovation, productivity and growth.\u201d\n\nDriving global Agentforce innovation from Singapore\n\nSalesforce has been investing in Singapore for nearly two decades and has established a thriving customer base and partner ecosystem in the region. Customers of all sizes, including industry leaders like Singapore Airlines, Grab, M1, FairPrice Group, Ocean Network Express and PRISM+ are using Salesforce AI technologies to drive efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and unlock new revenue streams.\n\nSingapore plays a crucial role in driving Agentforce innovation for Salesforce. In 2019, Salesforce expanded its AI Research team internationally, choosing Singapore as its first overseas AI Research hub location. Since then, the hub has significantly contributed to the global development of AI for the industry. This includes development of industry leading models such as multimodal language-vision foundation models (BLIP), and time-series foundation models (Moirai). The AI Research hub has contributed to product innovations such as AIOps Agents that help Salesforce achieve highest levels of site availability and in-house code LLMs for helping customers optimize their code for performance. Their work has resulted in over 100 research papers and patents being published.\n\nThis continued investment will not only drive Agentforce innovation through the research hub but also support Salesforce\u2019s expanding customer base in the region.\n\nIn fact, Singapore Airlines and Salesforce today announced that the Airline is incorporating Agentforce, Einstein in Service Cloud, and Data Cloud into its customer case management system, enabling it to deliver more consistent and personalized service to its customers.\n\nThe two companies also plan to co-develop AI solutions for airlines at the Salesforce AI Research hub in Singapore, aiming to provide greater value and additional benefits to the industry.\n\nBringing local data residency for Agentforce to Singapore\n\nSalesforce is expanding its services on Hyperforce, Salesforce\u2019s trusted next-generation platform architecture, in Singapore to provide data residency for Data Cloud, Agentforce, and Unified Marketing Applications (UMA) by next month.\n\nThis will empower Singapore businesses to capitalize on Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce and data offerings while adhering to local data residency regulations, an imperative for regional and global organisations in regulated industries such as the government, financial services or telecommunications. This helps align with data privacy regulations, enhancing data security and fostering trust among customers and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to compliance.\n\nSalesforce first introduced Hyperforce in Singapore in 2021.\n\nBuilding an Agentforce-ready workforce\n\nSalesforce is refreshing its Singapore office with a new space to enable customers to transform their workforce with digital labour. The space will include Agentforce activations space and a demo pod to provide hands-on experience building and deploying trusted, autonomous AI agents through Agentforce. The new space will also be used for upskilling initiatives for the ecosystem of partners and the community.\n\nSalesforce remains committed to investing in workforce development by upskilling in Agentforce, ensuring the workforce is equipped for the jobs of the future.\n\nThe company is partnering with Institutes of Higher Learning such as Singapore Management University, Institute of Technical Education, and Ngee Ann Polytechnic to equip students with in-demand CRM and AI skills through training and certifications, as well as connection to opportunities for employment in the Salesforce ecosystem.\n\nLeveraging Trailhead, Salesforce\u2019s free training platform, these initiatives equip individuals with the skills essential for thriving careers in the digital economy.\n\nSalesforce commitment to giving back\n\nAn important part of Salesforce\u2019s culture is the belief that business is the greatest platform for change, reflected in the company\u2019s 1-1-1 model of corporate philanthropy, which dedicates 1% of the company\u2019s equity, 1% of its employees\u2019 time and 1% of its products to giving back.

Norene Lew \u201996, \u200bDirector, Cross Functional Strategic Initiatives\u200b\u200b,\u200b remembered reaching out to a UC Law SF classmate after transitioning away from her first job.\n\n\u201cThe legal community is quite small, so you\u2019ll run into people. Getting to know folks and networking is really key to finding your next opportunity,\u201d she said. Lew spent seven years as a commercial legal attorney at Salesforce before her \u200bchief of staff \u200b\u200b\u200brole.\n\nMachtmes told the students not to put too much pressure on themselves to have an identified destination \u2013 advice he also gave to his own college-age daughter. \u201cMy career has been one where I explored new things and learned new things about myself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might explore and change course and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nAs the company\u2019s General Counsel, Machtmes has had to identify a balance between finding business solutions that stimulate growth while also protecting the company. \u201cThe twin roles that are unique to the legal profession as in-house lawyers make it interesting,\u201d Machtmes said. \u201cWith enough empathy and creativity, you can find ways to get things done.\u201d\n\nHelping clients understand these challenges and seeing their perspective is essential for Matt Ton\u200bn\u200ber \u20191\u200b3\u200b\u200b, \u200bSenior Director, AI Legal. He similarly has to balance business opportunity with legal risk, making sure clients understand the consequences of certain paths. With product legal and AI legal, \u201cthere\u2019s a big relationship management component to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re trusted advisors to the business.\u201d\n\nFrancesca Montesano \u201908, Senior Director, Commercial Legal, emphasized the importance of making sure clients know the legal team is there to support them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to know your clients\u2019 motivation and what they\u2019re worried about,\u201d she said. Her clients are salespeople with a laser focus on what targets they need to hit, and part of her job is to explain the legal side in lay terms and present options for moving forward. \u201cEmpathy is incredibly important when I\u2019m working with my clients,\u201d she said.\n\nMachtmes, Lew, Ton\u200bn\u200ber, and Montesano, along with other UC Law SF alumni working at Salesforce, mingled with students and answered questions in small groups after the panel. It\u2019s a partnership that leverages the College\u2019s powerful alumni network and proximity to top companies.\n\n\u201cSalesforce and its attorneys have been long-term partners of the school through not only this program, but through mentoring students, conducting mock interviews and offering internship opportunities,\u201d said Amy Kimmel, assistant dean for the Career Development Office (CDO). \u201cWe are very grateful for this partnership and that our students have access to such generous and accomplished alumni.\u201d\n\nThe CDO worked in partnership with the Business Law Society, Technology & Law Society, and the Intellectual Property Association to put on the panel and introduce students to the work of in-house attorneys.\n\n\u201cThe event offered students irreplicable insight into in-house work and the many roads one can take to get there,\u201d said Matthew Wallace, director of professional development for the Business Law Society. \u201cUC Law SF is fortunate to have Salesforce and its attorneys volunteer their time to help students better understand the realities of the field before entering it.\u201d\n\nThe Bay Area offers many opportunities for students to explore business, technology, and intellectual property law. \u201cThe insights shared at the event were crucial to our understanding of the work in-house counsel does, both inside such a cutting-edge company and also in the context of the greater technology ecosystem in the Bay Area,\u201d said Isabel Samayoa, director of mentorship for the Technology & Law Society.\n\nSungmin Kim, external vice president of the Law & Intellectual Property Association and director of alumni relations for the Technology & Law Society, said, \u201cFor anyone interested in intellectual property law or technology law, the event highlighted the myriad, significant and exclusive opportunities that come from connecting with Salesforce and other esteemed trailblazers here in the Bay Area.\u201d",

            "content": "Nonprofits are tasked with tracking and managing a variety of programs as their funding and organization grow. However, organizations can experience extreme inefficiency with their initiatives due to information silos and/or insufficient data management.\n\nPrograms and benefits can be created in Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud to support, track, and manage an organization\u2019s initiatives, along with the activities or services that are part of those programs. Benefit types and units of measure are used to give you the ability to categorize and easily report on how many or how much of a type of benefit is delivered across various programs.\n\nBefore creating programs and benefits in the Salesforce environment, an organization should first clearly define and outline their programs. Identify the specific goals and objectives, target recipients, and key activities of each program. This is the foundation to determine the units of measure and benefit types needed to track progress and outcomes. Being strategic and laying out the groundwork before you begin helps to ensure the units of measure and benefit types are appropriately aligned to your program goals and activities, which will provide more accurate data collection and analysis.\n\nStep One: Enable Program & Benefit Management\n\nTo get started, enable the setting to create and manage programs, benefits, and goals. This is found in setup: Program and Case Management Settings > Program and Benefit Management Settings\n\nStart with creating units of measure and then create your benefit types. Once these are set up, add your programs and create their benefits.\n\nStep Two: Create Units of Measure & Benefit Types in Salesforce\n\nNote that fields may vary depending on your organization\u2019s specific needs and setup.\n\nCreate a Unit of Measure\n\nClick the app launcher, then search and select Units of Measure from the app navigation results. Click the New button, complete the applicable fields, and save your work. Enter a name for the unit of measure. Examples include hours, percentages, pounds, kilograms, number of classes or people, etc.\n\nUnder Unit Code, enter an abbreviation for the unit of measure.\n\nIf needed, enter a description or select a type.\n\nCreate a Benefit Type\n\nIt is important to determine what type of a benefit is being delivered in the program. Use benefit types in conjunction with units of measure to report on how many or how much of a type of benefit your organization delivers across programs. Examples include classes, goods, services, meal services, counseling, etc.\n\nClick the app launcher, then search and select Benefit Types from the app navigation results. Click the New button, complete the applicable fields, and save your work. Enter a name for the benefit type.\n\nSelect Program Management as the process type.\n\nSelect a type and a unit of measure.\n\nIf needed, enter a description and/or a category.\n\nStep Three: Create Programs & Benefits in Salesforce\n\nCreate a Program\n\nPrograms represent initiatives offered by your organization. Each program is represented by a separate program record and can be linked to several benefits.\n\nClick the app launcher, then search and select Programs from the app navigation results. Click the New button, complete the applicable fields, and save your work. Enter a name for the program.\n\nMark the status to Active.\n\nSelect the start date.\n\nIf applicable, enter an end date, summary, or additional context.\n\nCreate Benefits\n\nBenefits represent the activities or services that a program offers.\n\nClick the app launcher, then search and select Benefits from the app navigation results. Click the New button, complete the applicable fields, and save your work. Enter a name for the benefit.\n\nSelect a Benefit Type.\n\nSelect a Unit of Measure.\n\nSelect a Program.\n\nMark the status to Active.\n\nEnter applicable Benefit Options, such as Start/End Dates, and Minimum/Maximum Benefit Amounts, or include additional context.\n\nThe Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud for program solutions helps nonprofit organizations run their programs more effectively to drive greater impact. It enables them to efficiently define, plan, deliver, and track their programs.\n\nOrganizations can map out what they want their programs to achieve, plan all the steps to get there, and track progress along the way. They can see in real time\u2014and in one place\u2014how the programs are running. Salesforce reports and dashboards give visibility to what is working well and where you need to make improvements.\n\nProfessional Assistance\n\nLeveraging Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud for your organization\u2019s customer relationship management (CRM) system can help support your nonprofit\u2019s impact.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other big-cap stocks that are plunging so far in 2025.\n\nThe market has been reversing its gains earlier in the year, so much so that the S&P 500 is now down 1.5% year-to-date. The past two years have seen the same index post stellar gains back-to-back, and those gains were mostly spearheaded by big-cap stocks.\n\nHowever, historically speaking, the market delivering a third year of such returns would be unprecedented. Investors believe that 2025 will likely be a year when the market starts to cool off, and recent events have started a trend toward just that.\n\nBig-cap stocks are now leading the way down as tariff and AI-related fears hurt them the most. Many big-cap companies have invested significantly in these tech trends, which investors have now soured on.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on the big-cap losers year-to-date. Many of them have declined enough to open up buying opportunities.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, I screened the worst-performing big-cap stocks year-to-date.\n\nI will also mention the number of hedge fund investors in these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nWhy Salesforce Inc (CRM) Is Plunging So Far in 2025?\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 162\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides cloud-based customer relationship management software and enterprise products.\n\nThe stock is down significantly so far in 2025 due to Salesforce reporting Q4 fiscal 2025 revenue of $9.99 billion, which came in below consensus estimates of $10.04 billion.\n\nEPS exceeded expectations at $2.78, and the slower-than-expected adoption of its AI-powered Agentforce platform weighed on results. Moreover, the FY2026 guidance projected revenue growth to stabilize in the high single digits and fell short of market expectations.\n\nAlso, Salesforce announced that Robin Washington would assume the combined role of President and Chief Operating and Financial Officer. Since then, investors expressed concerns over consolidating two critical roles, which traditionally have been separate.",

Weaver is the President and Chief Financial Officer at Salesforce and previously served as Chief Legal Officer for the Fortune 500 company.\n\nIn a letter to Direct Relief employees, Mark Linehan, Chair of the Board of Directors, wrote, \u201cAmy is a truly accomplished professional and an outstanding human being. In selecting Amy, we sought a leader with the caliber, passion, and experience to guide Direct Relief through the accelerating scale and complexity of the humanitarian challenges that lie ahead. She is widely known for being a deeply strategic and deliberate thinker\u2013a force for change who always puts people first.\u201d\n\nWeaver brings a unique professional background spanning business, law, finance, and operations.

She began her legal career as a clerk on the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWeaver follows Thomas Tighe who led the organization with distinction for 24 years, expanding Direct Relief\u2019s reach to become the fifth-largest charity in the United States and among the largest providers of charitable medications within the U.S. and globally. Dr. Byron Scott will continue to serve as the interim Chief Executive Officer until May 4, after which he will continue to serve as the interim Chief Operating Officer until the COO position has been filled and onboarded to ensure a seamless and smooth transition.\n\n\u201cOver the past 75 years, Direct Relief has established a powerful legacy of delivering meaningful impact to those in need,\u201d said Weaver. \u201cI\u2019m honored and excited to build on that foundation and help shape the future of humanitarian response. As global challenges grow more urgent and complex, Direct Relief has a responsibility not just to meet the demand for medical aid, but to lead the way in reimagining how we respond to a rapidly changing world. I\u2019m inspired by the dedication and expertise of this incredible team, and I look forward to working together to drive innovation and make an even greater difference.\"\n\nWeaver is a longtime advocate for affordable housing and disaster response.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to warn users to not trust billionaires. His remarks built on an earlier show, where he had shared that \u201cyou can\u2019t make money listening to a billionaire because they already have made money.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Cramer outlined that billionaires often share the sentiment that it\u2019s hard for others to become as rich as they are. \u201cThey close the door,\u201d he commented and added: \u201cWell they\u2019re always negative.\u201d Cramer also believes that luck might play a large role in making someone a billionaire. According to him: \u201cWe never, we never grade them because if they\u2019re billionaires we think that they have to be genius. We never think about luck. We just think, well they might have had really great trade.\u201d\n\nIn response, co-host David Faber pointed out that the one key trait that he has observed in most billionaires is their relentless drive. Cramer responded by sharing that billionaires are \u201ctiresome.\u201d He also felt that President Biden\u2019s goodbye speech about oligarchs was \u201ccompletely ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, Cramer also commented on how using ChatGPT was proving troublesome. He outlined:\n\n\u201cI use ChatGPT like, probably maybe fifty times a day. I do it text and I\u2019m continually let down by the lack of rigor of what I get. I mean I\u2019ll say tell me everything I need to know about [a pharma company \u2013 BMY]. And it won\u2019t even have the patent cliff. Doesn\u2019t mention the patent. . . I mean it just doesn\u2019t get the story at all.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 26th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other cheap software stocks.\n\nThe software industry is changing at an unparalleled rate, with significant advances in programming languages, structures, frameworks, techniques, and other technologies. More specifically, the industry has benefited greatly from the growing need for digital transformation. Until recently, growth prospects have been attractive due to the rising use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), which offers a flexible and cost-effective distribution mechanism for apps. It also reduces deployment time compared to traditional systems. In that regard, the global SaaS industry was valued at around $3 trillion in 2022, marking the end of a decade of strong development, with McKinsey estimating that it might reach $10 trillion by 2030. However, McKinsey contends that the rapid emergence of generative AI (GenAI) has altered the software industry more drastically than the shift to SaaS. A notable example is ChatGPT\u2019s introduction in late November 2022, which sparked a surge in investment. By 2023, large software firms had already invested over $15 billion in GenAI solutions, accounting for roughly 2% of the global corporate software industry. In contrast, it took SaaS spending four years to get the same market share.\n\nAt the same time, IT executives are turning to technology consolidation to address global economic concerns such as inflation, recession, and supply chain disruptions. According to Canalys\u2019 IT Opportunity report, global IT investment would increase by 8.3% to $5.44 trillion in 2025. This builds on the rapid growth in 2024, which is expected to climb 7.7%, the fastest pace since the post-COVID technological boom of 2021. In that same vein, The Business Research Company predicts that the global software products market will rise from $1.8 trillion in 2024 to over $2.0 trillion in 2025, representing an 11.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nWhile challenges exist on the path to growth, the bigger concern for the software industry at the moment is DeepSeek, a Chinese company that claims to produce artificial intelligence software at a fraction of the expense of large US software corporations. DeepSeek\u2019s cheaper price should have forced US companies to reduce subscription costs and investments. However, this has had minimal effect on market sentiment towards American firms. In fact, AI income still accounts for a modest portion of their total revenues, and their supremacy remains largely intact. Furthermore, DeepSeek\u2019s danger doesn\u2019t seem to be immediate, as major US software companies have spent years improving and growing their corporate products.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of cheap software stocks to buy according to analysts, we used stock screeners to select firms with an average analyst upside potential of at least 20% greater than their current stock price. According to Wall Street experts, these equities are undervalued compared to their actual potential. All of these stocks have PE ratios below 25, as of March 7.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nForward P/E Ratio: 23.89\n\nAnalyst Upside: 26.61%\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), headquartered in San Francisco, California, is an American cloud-based software firm that specializes in customer relationship management. The firm offers custom software and solutions built for a variety of areas, including sales, marketing automation, and analytics.\n\nOn February 27, BMO Capital Markets lowered its price target for Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to $367 from $375, while keeping an Outperform rating. The firm\u2019s analysts commented on Salesforce\u2019s Q4 performance, stating that the company presented a strong yet unremarkable report. According to BMO Capital, the company\u2019s year-over-year rise in computed billings and free cash flow for the January quarter exceeded its expectations, with the company maintaining exceptional gross profit margins of 76.94% and achieving revenue growth of 9.53% over the previous twelve months. In addition, the prediction for fiscal year 2026 subscription revenue increase of 9% year on year on a constant currency basis matched their expectations.\n\nMar Vista Global Quality Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cInvestors cheered a solid fiscal year Q3 performance from Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), with results driven by strength in subscription revenues, current remaining performance obligations (CRPO), and operating margin. Both the Sales and Service Clouds returned to double-digit growth, fueled by strong adoption of multi-cloud and vertical-specific solutions. These results highlight Salesforce\u2019s ability to address diverse customer needs and sustain growth across its core offerings. Management expressed significant excitement about Agentforce, an organically developed generative AI product that is garnering enthusiasm from both system integrator partners and customers alike. This innovation underscores Salesforce\u2019s commitment to delivering innovative solutions that enhance customer engagement and drive productivity. While Agentforce\u2019s contributions to subscription revenues and CRPO bookings are still immaterial for now, the growing pipeline provides a solid foundation for optimism around Salesforce\u2019s ability to productize and monetize its generative AI offerings.\u201d\n\nOverall CRM ranks 7th on our list of the cheap software stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

While autonomy has advanced significantly through powerful generative models, controllability has become a focal point for machine learning researchers. Text-based control has become particularly important as natural language offers an intuitive interface between humans and machines. This approach has enabled remarkable applications across image editing, audio synthesis, and video generation. Recent text-to-data generative models, particularly those employing diffusion techniques, have shown impressive results by utilizing semantic insights from extensive data-text pair datasets. However, significant barriers arise in low-resource situations where obtaining sufficient text-paired data becomes prohibitively expensive or complicated due to complex data structures. Critical domains like molecular data, motion capture, and time series often lack adequate text labels, which restricts supervised learning capabilities and impedes the deployment of advanced generative models. These limitations predictably result in poor generation quality, model overfitting, bias, and limited output diversity\u2014revealing a substantial gap in optimizing text representations for better alignment in data-limited contexts.\n\nThe low-resource scenario has prompted several mitigation approaches, each with inherent limitations. Data augmentation techniques often fail to accurately align synthetic data with original text descriptions and risk overfitting while increasing computational demands in diffusion models. Semi-supervised learning struggles with the inherent ambiguities in textual data, making correct interpretation challenging when processing unlabeled samples. Transfer learning, while promising for limited datasets, frequently suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously acquired knowledge as it adapts to new text descriptions. These methodological shortcomings highlight the need for more robust approaches specifically designed for text-to-data generation in low-resource environments.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Salesforce AI Research present Text2Data which introduces a diffusion-based framework that enhances text-to-data controllability in low-resource scenarios through a two-stage approach. First, it masters data distribution using unlabeled data via an unsupervised diffusion model, avoiding the semantic ambiguity common in semi-supervised methods. Second, it implements controllable fine-tuning on text-labeled data without expanding the training dataset. Instead, Text2Data employs a constraint optimization-based learning objective that prevents catastrophic forgetting by keeping model parameters close to their pre-fine-tuning state. This unique framework effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to maintain fine-grained data distribution while achieving superior controllability. Theoretical validation supports the optimization constraint selection and generalization bounds, with comprehensive experiments across three modalities demonstrating Text2Data\u2019s superior generation quality and controllability compared to baseline methods.\n\nText2Data addresses controllable data generation by learning the conditional distribution p\u03b8(x|c) where limited paired data creates optimization challenges. The framework operates in two distinct phases as illustrated in the figure below. Initially, it utilizes more abundant unlabeled data to learn the marginal distribution p\u03b8(x), obtaining optimal parameters \u03b8\u0302 within set \u0398. This approach exploits the mathematical relationship between marginal and conditional distributions, where p\u03b8(x) approximates the expected value of p\u03b8(x|c) over the text distribution. Subsequently, Text2Data fine-tunes these parameters using the available labeled data-text pairs while implementing constraint optimization to keep the updated parameters \u03b8\u0302\u2019 within the intersection of \u0398 and \u0398\u2019. This constraint ensures the model maintains knowledge of the overall data distribution while gaining text controllability, effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting that typically occurs during fine-tuning processes.\n\nText2Data implements its two-phase approach by first using all available data with NULL tokens as conditions to learn the general data distribution. This allows the model to optimize p\u03b8(x|\u2205), which effectively equals p\u03b8(x) since the NULL token is independent of x. The second phase introduces a constraint optimization framework that fine-tunes the model on text-labeled data while preventing parameter drift from the previously learned distribution. Mathematically, this is expressed as minimizing the negative log-likelihood of conditional probability p\u03b8(x|c) subject to the constraint that the marginal distribution performance remains close to the optimal value \u03be established during the first phase. This constraint-based approach directly addresses catastrophic forgetting by ensuring the model parameters remain within an optimal set where both general data representation and text-specific controllability can coexist\u2014essentially solving a lexicographic optimization problem that balances these competing objectives.\n\nIt implements classifier-free diffusion guidance by transforming the theoretical objective into practical loss functions. The framework optimizes three key components: L1(\u03b8) for general data distribution learning, L\u20191(\u03b8) for distribution preservation on labeled data, and L2(\u03b8) for text-conditioned generation. These are empirically estimated using available data samples. The lexicographic optimization process, detailed in Algorithm 1, balances these objectives by dynamically adjusting gradient updates with a parameter \u03bb that enforces constraints while allowing effective learning. This approach uses a sophisticated update rule where \u03b8 is modified based on a weighted combination of gradients from both objectives. The constraint can be relaxed during training to improve convergence, recognizing that parameters need not be an exact subset of the original parameter space but should remain proximal to preserve distribution knowledge while gaining controllability.\n\nText2Data provides theoretical underpinnings for its constraint optimization approach through generalization bounds that validate parameter selection. The framework establishes that random variables derived from the diffusion process are sub-Gaussian, enabling the formulation of rigorous confidence bounds. Theorem 0.2 delivers three critical guarantees: first, the empirical parameter set within the confidence bound fully encompasses the true optimal set; second, the empirical solution competes effectively with the theoretical optimum on the primary objective; and third, the empirical solution maintains reasonable adherence to the theoretical constraint. The practical implementation introduces a relaxation parameter \u03c1 that adjusts the strictness of the constraint while keeping it within the mathematically justified confidence interval. This relaxation acknowledges real-world conditions where obtaining numerous unlabeled samples is feasible, making the confidence bound reasonably tight even when handling models with millions of parameters. Experiments with motion generation involving 45,000 samples and 14 million parameters confirm the framework\u2019s practical viability.\n\nText2Data demonstrates superior controllability across multiple domains compared to baseline methods. In molecular generation, it achieves lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for all properties compared to EDM-finetune and EDM, particularly excelling with properties like \u03f5LUMO and Cv. For motion generation, Text2Data surpasses MDM-finetune and MDM in R Precision and Multimodal Distance metrics. In time series generation, it consistently outperforms DiffTS-finetune and DiffTS across all evaluated properties. Beyond controllability, Text2Data maintains exceptional generation quality, showing improvements in molecular validity, stability, motion generation diversity, and distribution alignment in time series. These results validate Text2Data\u2019s effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while preserving generation quality.\n\nText2Data effectively addresses the challenges of text-to-data generation in low-resource scenarios across multiple modalities. By initially utilizing unlabeled data to grasp the overall data distribution and then implementing constraint optimization during fine-tuning on labeled data, the framework successfully balances controllability with distribution preservation. This approach prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generation quality. Experimental results consistently demonstrate Text2Data\u2019s superiority over baseline methods in both controllability and generation quality. Though implemented with diffusion models, Text2Data\u2019s principles can be readily adapted to other generative architectures.\n\nCheck out the Paper and GitHub Page.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI stocks making big moves today.\n\nWhat is the biggest security risk in artificial intelligence? According to CPPCC member Zhou Hongyi, co-founder and chairman of internet security firm Qihoo 360, it is to fall behind.\n\nThe Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body in China and a key component of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s united front system.\n\nUnlike former President Joe Biden\u2019s stance on AI, which was supportive but cautious, current AI leaders, including President Donald Trump, and political advisors in Beijing, are against overregulation in the AI industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Monitoring and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now\n\nThe Trump administration has since reversed Biden\u2019s AI executive order and launched the Stargate project, reflecting on his pro-innovation stance instead. Likewise, Beijing\u2019s political advisors have made remarks ahead of the country\u2019s annual parliamentary meetings, advising against overregulating artificial intelligence companies amid a growing debate about the emerging technology.\n\n\u201cWe should neither exaggerate nor ignore security issues related to AI. Some leading AI companies in the US exaggerate the security issues of AI as an excuse for not having open-sourced products as they seek a monopoly, so the latecomers cannot catch up.\u201d\n\nZhou cautioned that China must \u201ccorrectly understand\u201d the security risks in AI.\n\n\u201cFalling behind in [AI] development is the biggest security risk. We must seize this opportunity of AI to improve productivity and let everyone benefit from the fruits of the inclusiveness of science and technology\u201d.\n\nZhang Yi, a senior partner at King & Wood Mallesons and CPPCC member, advised that China needs to develop its own AI rules to ensure stable development but at the same time, needs to be aware that \u201coverly strong legal intervention might become a rope that strangles the development of AI as global competition intensifies\u201d.\n\nIn a race towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, Beijing is working hard and has signaled that it will act cautiously on regulation of the sector. According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, legislation on artificial intelligence is going to be rolled out in an \u201corderly\u201d way in response to proposals from the CPPCC.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.",

This follows similar changes brought by Google and Facebook-parent company Meta.As per a report by Bloomberg, the San Francisco-based software company also removed previous language highlighting diversity and inclusion as a \u201ccore value\u201d and references to executive compensation being tied to \u201cemployee diversity measures\u201d.\u201cWhile we are not specifying representation goals, we remain committed to our core value of equality,\u201d a Salesforce spokesperson stated in its annual financial disclosures, as per Bloomberg.The company's updated financial filing reflects a shift in language, emphasising compliance with federal law and promoting a \u201cfair and inclusive environment\u201d while upholding \u201cprinciples of equality, dignity, and respect for all.\u201d\u201cOur approach to equality is firmly rooted in compliance with federal law as a US company. By adhering to these laws, we uphold a fair and inclusive environment where our employees can do the best work and teaming of their careers, reinforcing principles of equality, dignity and respect for all,\u201d Salesforce wrote in new language included in the filing.This decision comes in the wake of Trump's executive orders targeting diversity initiatives. One order seeks to eliminate diversity hiring within the federal workforce and among government contractors, including Salesforce, a major software vendor to the US government.Another order directs the government to pressure companies into ending their diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) programs.Salesforce's move aligns with a broader trend of companies, such as Google and Meta, scaling back their DEI initiatives.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff , known for his vocal advocacy on social issues, has previously supported initiatives like a San Francisco tax increase to address homelessness and threatened to withdraw investment from Indiana over a discriminatory law.",

            "content": "Salesforce (CRM) is talking down the potential 2025 sales impact of its AI agents after its earnings release.\n\nThe software giant's stock dropped nearly 5% to $292.80 in premarket trading on Thursday after it issued a disappointing earnings outlook for 2025. The company's ticker page was the second most active on Yahoo Finance behind Nvidia (NVDA) following the AI giant's own earnings report.\n\nSalesforce stock had run up 16% in the six months prior to the earnings release, thanks to optimism around the financial impact of its artificial intelligence agent platform Agentforce. But disappointing revenue forecasts sparked worries that the tool's adoption is slowing down.\n\nSalesforce executives told analysts on a post-earnings call that Agentforce \u2014 its latest software innovation for businesses \u2014 would have a \"modest\" contribution to revenue this year. A more \"meaningful\" contribution is forecast for 2026.\n\nSalesforce's CEO Marc Benioff told me (video above) that the company could deliver upside on its operating margin guidance for this year. Benioff \u2014 who is also co-founder and chairman \u2014 noted the guidance for Agentforce is prudent, given the company's recurring revenue model and it being the product's early days.\n\n\"We'll have a great year,\" Benioff said.\n\nSalesforce said it has closed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, more than 3,000 of which are paid. Annual recurring revenue from data cloud and AI more than doubled year over year.\n\nListen: What Snowflake's CEO thinks about DeepSeek\n\nHere is what Wall Street is saying about Salesforce's quarter and outlook.\n\nStifel analyst J. Parker Lane\n\nRating: Reiterated Buy\n\nPrice Target: $375, reiterated\n\n\"Salesforce's much anticipated fourth quarter print delivered quarter over quarter current performance obligation (CRPO) acceleration (ex-FX [foreign exchange]), a bevy of AI disclosures that underscore the early momentum of Agentforce, and healthy 1Q CRPO and fiscal 2026 subscription revenue outlooks relative to expectations.\n\n\"While some moving parts related to FX and professional services impacted the overall revenue outlook, we view the after-hours pressure on shares as an overreaction to a quarter/guide that aligned with our positive view of Salesforce's positioning around agentic AI and its ability to drive sustainable growth with margin/free cash flow expansion.\n\n\"Management set modest expectations for Agentforce revenue in fiscal 2026, but suggested that the momentum should pick up throughout the year and position fiscal 2027 as a year of more meaningful benefit. In the meantime, the halo effect of Agentforce is driving momentum across \"non-AI\" components of the business, and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2026.\"\n\nD.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria\n\nRating: Reiterated Neutral\n\nPrice Target: $275, lowered from $307\n\n\"Sales can't force Agentforce adoption. While Salesforce continues to push Agentforce and data cloud adoption, management is assuming only modest contributions in fiscal 2026, in-line with our prior commentary. Fourth quarter top line results were slightly below expectations and the initial fiscal 2026 guidance calls for 7%-8% revenue growth (inclusive of a 0.5% FX headwind), down from 9% in fiscal 2025 as professional service and marketing + commerce cloud headwinds likely offset positive data cloud momentum and ramping AI tailwinds.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill\n\nRating: Reiterated Buy\n\nPrice Target: $425, reiterated\n\n\"Salesforce delivered a solid print as CRPO growth 9% and operating margin 33% both matched Street numbers. Fiscal 2026 guidance of 9% constant currency subscription growth and 34% operating margin also hit Street estimates. Guide assumes modest revenue from Agentforce, as momentum builds through the year. We continue to believe Salesforce can deliver double digit percentage top line growth while driving margins higher to the mid/high 30s over time.\"\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne\n\nRating: Reiterated Outperform\n\nPrice Target: $420, reiterated\n\n\"Not a huge surprise to see a \u2018prudent\u2019 guide [guidance] given the imminent CFO transition and between F/X, leap year, and professional services weakness \u2014 bears can take a victory lap on the first quarter revenue guide.\n\n\"But in general, we think the story remains more or less the same \u2014 namely that the key to 2025 for Salesforce is going to be showing accelerating growth over the year, increasing adoption of Agentforce and further upside to the operating margin guide.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy\n\nRating: Reiterated Overweight\n\nPrice Target: $380, reiterated\n\n\"We maintain our view that Salesforce operates a business model that is bending, but not breaking, even within a challenging macro-economy that has affected all software companies, and we continue to see eventual upside from current levels as the company pivots to an efficiency playbook and balances slower growth with profitability and free cash flow generation while infusing generative AI capabilities into its clouds.\n\n\"We view free cash flow per share as the appropriate lens for the company and believe the thesis should remain intact as Salesforce continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate, and show meaningful operating margin expansion, which should be tracked by free cash flow margin over time.\"\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nProgramming note: I will be live with a special Nvidia-themed episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET.

(NYSE:CRM). Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cThis happens now. We own Salesforce. We started buying it when it was at eight bucks. It\u2019s had a big run. I don\u2019t blame you one bit for feeling like, \u2018Ouch, that one\u2019s down a lot.\u2019 All I can do is say, and I\u2019ll say it on Thursday, is this: it\u2019s worth buying more and getting a better average. Why? Because I think the company\u2019s going to have a blowout quarter.\u201d\n\nSalesforce\u2019s latest quarterly results were mixed. It reported revenue of $9.99 billion, missing estimates by about $50 million. For Q1, the company forecasts a year-over-year growth between 6% and 7%. For FY 2026, Salesforce expects total revenue between $40.5 billion and $40.9 billion, reflecting a 7%-8% year-over-year growth. This implies a 1 percentage point deceleration in growth compared to FY 2025.

Using distillation to achieve cheaper and more efficient AI models, this AI startup has ignited a fierce race in the artificial intelligence world ever since the birth of ChatGPT.\n\nSuch has been the intensity of competition that in recent news, it has come to light how Tencent Holdings has displaced DeepSeek as the most downloaded free app in China\u2019s iOS App Store. Tencent\u2019s Yuanbao has taken the top spot in the free app list on Monday, with DeepSeek in second place and ByteDance\u2019s Doubao in fourth, the South China Morning Post noted.\n\nLaunched in May last year, Yuanbao gained popularity after Tencent\u2019s move to integrate DeepSeek\u2019s R1 reasoning model in February, providing users with an alternative to the tech giants\u2019 Hunyuan model.\n\nDevelopments like these illustrate how intense the global race in artificial intelligence is becoming.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other good stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nWhen seeking investment opportunities, individual investors often look to hedge funds for guidance. Hedge funds are known for their sophisticated investment strategies, high-level expertise, and significant market influence. Hedge funds are massive players in the global investment landscape, managing trillions of dollars in assets. According to Preqin, as of Q3 2024, hedge funds manage approximately $4.87 trillion in assets globally. This significant amount of capital means that hedge funds have substantial market power. When they invest in certain stocks, their actions can impact stock prices, drive market trends, and influence broader economic sentiment. As such, their decisions are followed closely by institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nA key reason hedge fund stock picks are worth paying attention to is their wide diversification across various sectors and strategies. Multi-strategy hedge funds, which allocate capital across various investment strategies, have gained prominence. According to WealthBriefing from 2017 to the third quarter of 2024, the number of multi-strategy fund launches grew at an annual rate of 4%.\n\nHedge Funds\u2019 Dual Investment Strategy (Long and Short Positions)\n\nHedge funds are also known for using a dual approach\u2014investing in both long and short positions. This allows them to profit from rising and falling markets, giving them a comprehensive view of market dynamics. According to data from BarclayHedge, hedge funds that employed a long/short strategy in 2024 saw returns of around 9%.\n\n\u200bHedge funds have increasingly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sectors, adjusting their portfolios to capitalize on emerging opportunities. According to a Goldman Sachs report analyzing 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion in gross equity positions at the start of Q1 2025, there has been a notable shift in investment strategies. The report indicates that hedge funds have become more selective within popular sectors and themes. Notably, they have incrementally added positions to AI Phase 3 companies with AI-enabled revenues. Companies like Salesforce are ranked among the \u201cRising Stars,\u201d reflecting a significant increase in hedge fund popularity during the last quarter. \u200b\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a consensus-based approach by using opinions from financial websites like Forbes Advisor, Motley Fool, and Morningstar to first compile a list of good stocks to invest in right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.",

Weaver is the President and Chief Financial Officer at Salesforce and previously served as Chief Legal Officer for the Fortune 500 company.\n\nIn a letter to Direct Relief employees, Mark Linehan, Chair of the Board of Directors, wrote, \"Amy is a truly accomplished professional and an outstanding human being. In selecting Amy, we sought a leader with the caliber, passion, and experience to guide Direct Relief through the accelerating scale and complexity of the humanitarian challenges that lie ahead. She is widely known for being a deeply strategic and deliberate thinker-a force for change who always puts people first.\"\n\nWeaver brings a unique professional background spanning business, law, finance, and operations. In her nearly 12 years at Salesforce, Weaver led the global finance organization as Chief Financial Officer, the global legal and corporate affairs organization as Chief Legal Officer, and oversaw many different functions across the business including Global Communications, Real Estate and Workplace Services, Corporate Development, Accessibility, Government Affairs, Audit, and Ethics & Compliance. Prior to Salesforce, Weaver was an EVP and General Counsel at Univar and SVP and Deputy General Counsel at Expedia Group.\n\nAn attorney by trade, Weaver has worked around the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in private practice in both the United States and Hong Kong, and as a legislative aide to a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. She began her legal career as a clerk on the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWeaver follows Thomas Tighe who led the organization with distinction for 24 years, expanding Direct Relief's reach to become the fifth-largest charity in the United States and among the largest providers of charitable medications within the U.S. and globally. Dr. Byron Scott will continue to serve as the interim Chief Executive Officer until May 4, after which he will continue to serve as the interim Chief Operating Officer until the COO position has been filled and onboarded to ensure a seamless and smooth transition.\n\n\"Over the past 75 years, Direct Relief has established a powerful legacy of delivering meaningful impact to those in need,\" said Weaver. \"I'm honored and excited to build on that foundation and help shape the future of humanitarian response. As global challenges grow more urgent and complex, Direct Relief has a responsibility not just to meet the demand for medical aid, but to lead the way in reimagining how we respond to a rapidly changing world. I'm inspired by the dedication and expertise of this incredible team, and I look forward to working together to drive innovation and make an even greater difference.\u201d\n\nWeaver is a longtime advocate for affordable housing and disaster response. She served on the Board of Directors for Habitat for Humanity International, provided on-the-ground volunteer support to Habitat in Kenya, Poland, and Puerto Rico and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.",

            "content": "Dive Brief:\n\nSalesforce President and CFO Amy Weaver will step into the CEO role for humanitarian aid provider Direct Relief, effective May 5, the company said in a Friday press release. The announcement follows approximately a month after Salesforce announced it would be combining its CFO and chief operating officer roles \u2014 a decision coming after Weaver informed the company of her intent to depart in August, according to a company filing at the time.\n\nRobin Washington, who presently serves on Salesforce\u2019s board of directors, will step into the newly-created \u201cCOFO\u201d role effective March 21, CFO Dive previously reported. In the combined role, Washington will succeed Weaver and will step in on the operational side for Salesforce COO Brian Millham, who will retire from his position after a 25-year career at the company.\n\nWeaver\u2019s departure from the software provider occurs as Salesforce leans into the growing \u201cAgentic AI\u201d trend, having launched a suite of agents aimed at helping employees perform workforce tasks, CFO Dive previously reported.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSalesforce\u2019s decision to combine its CFO and COO roles is part of a growing trend, as more CFOs absorb operational responsibilities at their organizations. As well as Salesforce, payments giant PayPal announced its CFO, Jamie Miller, would take on the additional role of CFO and chief operating officer late last month.\n\nWeaver\u2019s appointment to the CEO seat at Direct Relief also comes at a time when more and more businesses are looking to finance chiefs \u2014 who are steadily becoming responsible for operations and strategy, as well as other areas such as IT and legal as well as finance \u2014 as potential successors to the CEO seat.\n\nWhile the percentage of CFOs who saw promotions to the CEO role dipped in 2024, overall, finance chiefs are becoming more common choices for CEOs, according to the latest Volatility report by Crist | Kolder Associates. The percentage of sitting CEOs who took the position directly from a CFO position was 7.4% last year, compared to 8.4% in 2023, according to the report.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing CFO\u2019s who have broad backgrounds such as Amy\u2019s positioned to take the jump to CEO,\u201d Josh Crist, co-managing partner for Crist | Kolder Associates, told CFO Dive via email. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more of this, and companies are preparing for it as they add diverse responsibilities to their incumbent CFO\u2019s remit.\u201d\n\nAn attorney by training, Weaver already has experience in both legal and financial roles. She logged an 11-year tenure at the San Franscico, California-based Salesforce, serving in a variety of key executive roles, including as president and chief legal officer before taking on the role of president and CFO in June 2021, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nWeaver began her career as a research associate for Harvard Business School, before serving as a Judicial Clerk in the U.S. Court of Appeals. She currently serves as a member of the board of directors for McDonalds.\n\nA \u201clongtime advocate for affordable housing and disaster response,\u201d Weaver has also served on the board of directors for Habitat for Humanity International and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Direct Relief said in its Friday press release.\n\n\u201cIn selecting Amy, we sought a leader with the caliber, passion, and experience to guide Direct Relief through the accelerating scale and complexity of the humanitarian challenges that lie ahead,\u201d Mark Linehan, chair of the board of directors for the non-profit, said in a letter to employees included in the Friday press release. \u201cShe is widely known for being a deeply strategic and deliberate thinker \u2014 a force for change who always puts people first.\u201d\n\nOne of the country\u2019s largest providers of humanitarian aid, Direct Relief \u2014 which operates in all 50 U.S. states as well as in 80 countries globally \u2014 the company distributed $1.8 billion, wholesale value, in medicine and supplies for its fiscal 2023, according to its annual report.\n\nWeaver\u2019s appointment follows after Direct Relief\u2019s CEO, Thomas Tighe, announced he would step down from his role after a 24-year span as the non-profit\u2019s top executive, according to a company press release. In January, the non-profit appointed Byran Scott \u2014 its interim COO \u2014 as interim CEO while it searched for a permanent successor, the company said.\n\nScott will transition back to the interim COO position once Weaver assumes the CEO role on May 4, \u201cuntil the COO position has been filled and on-boarded to ensure a seamless and smooth transition,\u201d the company said.\n\nDirect Relief did not detail Weaver\u2019s compensation as its incoming CEO in its Friday press release. For its fiscal 2023, former CEO Thomas Tighe received $652,610 in total compensation, comprised of a $605,893 base compensation, $14,500 in retirement and other deferred compensation and $32,217 in nontaxable benefits, according to the IRS Federal Form 990 for the year filed by the organization.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024 as president and CFO for Salesforce, Weaver received total compensation of approximately $12.2 million, comprised of a $1 million base salary, $1 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation, and approximately $10.2 million in stock awards, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy report.\n\n\u201cI love that Amy is moving into the non-profit sector. She\u2019s clearly done very well, and has been very fulfilled, during her time in the corporate world,\u201d Crist said when asked about Weaver\u2019s move to the seat. \u201cI love that she\u2019s looking to do something that may be a passion play for her.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers dominate the market with large investments in leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. These investors have large capital and they like to invest in established companies rather than betting on underperformers.\n\nHow\u2019s the Stock Market Performing in 2025 So Far?\n\nThe S&P 500 index has reached its all-time highs, achieving returns of over 20% for the second consecutive year post-COVID. Billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett made a bold move in 2024, selling a record $134 billion of net stock. Buffett\u2019s move has raised concerns for investors and analysts. Historically, when Buffett\u2019s firm becomes a net seller, it\u2019s often followed by below-average market performance. Many believe that this could be a signal of stock market underperformance in 2025.\n\nThe stock market has already taken a hit in 2025 following the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. Almost $1 trillion was wiped away from the U.S. stock market in January 2025. Now, the market is reacting to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy, as the U.S. initiates 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\n\u201cTariffs increase the odds of a negative feedback loop in the economy. Nobody believed they would be implemented,\u201d said Dennis Debusschere, founder of 22V Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 has been underperforming its global peers in 2025 so far, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico all racing ahead. S&P 500 has slid nearly 1.90% year-to-date, as of March 4. Whereas, the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index has dropped over 4% so far this year.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte, equity positioning dropped significantly in the week ended February 28, plunging back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump.\n\nBillionaire investor Leon Cooperman in an interview during the Squawk Box show on CNBC recently said that the president is on the right track, but he is doing things in a very destabilizing manner. The president is focusing on reducing the deficit, which is the right thing to do, Cooperman added.\n\nThe transition phase seems to have a much bigger impact on the broader market, coupled with the tariff policy. Ironsides Macroeconomics\u2019 Barry Knapp expects the Fed to cut a full percent this year, with the first cut projected in May. Knapp added that the economy needs to shift from government spending to capital spending for a better environment for business.",

This adaptability makes Salesforce our pick for the best customer relationship management (CRM) platform for customization. Thumbs Up Pros Salesforce CRM is highly customizable; with time, you can modify almost every element to fit your specific business needs.\n\nThe lowest-priced plan includes advanced features, such as AI-powered Einstein Activity Capture, customizable reports and dashboards, products and price books, email templates and mass emailing.\n\nSalesforce offers an extensive selection of support materials, videos and tutorials, as well as a helpful online community. Thumbs Down Cons Due to the sheer volume of customization and automation options, setup can be time-consuming and will likely require training for your in-house marketing team and administrators.\n\nCustomizing specific elements within Salesforce requires knowledge of Cascading Sheets Style (CSS), HTML and other coding languages.\n\nWith numerous products, options and paid add-ons, selecting a Salesforce plan \u2014 and sticking to your budget \u2014 can be challenging.\n\nEditor's Rating 9.5/10\n\nTo succeed, businesses must convert leads successfully while managing and growing customer relationships. Salesforce CRM offers numerous customization options to achieve these goals, empowering businesses of all sizes \u2014 and across various industries \u2014 to understand and support prospects and customers better. You can adapt nearly every aspect of the software\u2019s interface and performance to help sales, marketing, customer service and technical support teams reach their goals.\n\nSalesforce CRM includes thousands of fully integrated apps, plug-in scripts and a robust application programming interface (API) to help businesses build a flexible, customized solution.

We were particularly impressed by how Salesforce handles workflow automation and by its pioneering integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in CRM customization. Notably, Salesforce was one of the first CRM platforms to open itself to third-party developers, giving it more apps and customization options than any other provider. If Salesforce doesn\u2019t have a built-in function you need, there\u2019s almost certainly an app to compensate. If not, a developer can create and deploy a tailored solution. Salesforce CRM\u2019s initial setup requires time and information technology (IT) expertise and its learning curve is steeper than that of many other CRM providers we reviewed. However, it delivers flexible CRM software designed to accommodate custom processes and adapt to your business\u2019s changing needs. For all these reasons and more, Salesforce is our top CRM choice for customization. Salesforce CRM\u2019s pipeline management feature provides a comprehensive view of your sales opportunities.

Here are some notable ease-of-use factors we discovered: Straightforward navigation: We like that Salesforce keeps the navigation process simple. The upper tab-style layout is common across business and personal software, making it easy to grasp; categories like \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cContacts,\u201d \u201cAccounts,\u201d \u201cLeads,\u201d \u201cTasks,\u201d \u201cReports\u201d and \u201cOpportunities\u201d need no explanation.

You can even integrate enterprise resource planning (ERP) software with Salesforce to build a system similar to the ERP platform described in our review of Oracle NetSuite CRM. We also like how Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange categorizes apps into 10 top categories, including finance, human resources, sales, customer service, marketing and analytics. Tip Bottom line Salesforce is an excellent solution for companies looking to improve customer service performance. Read our Salesforce Service Cloud review to see how it helps supervisors and teams manage ongoing customer relationships. Customization We were impressed by Salesforce CRM\u2019s vast customization capabilities, which truly stand out among the competition. While many CRMs we reviewed offer options for customizing deal and contact fields, email templates and dashboards, Salesforce lets you do much more. Here are some of our favorite customization options: Page customization: You can change how pages look and function to suit your needs. Use CSS settings to adjust spacing between page elements, colors and fonts. You can also modify customer records to display only the lists, sections and fields specific co-workers need to see, improving employee collaboration.\n\nYou can change how pages look and function to suit your needs.

Object control: Salesforce CRM\u2019s object control is superior to that of other CRMs we tested. Objects are fields within databases, such as name, address and email. Salesforce makes it easy to add objects to capture exactly the information you need on accounts, contacts and leads. You can set permissions on records and fields to control who can view and edit them. You can even make objects actionable by adding buttons, actions, triggers and links to streamline processes such as adding a new customer, supplier or co-worker to the database.\n\nSalesforce CRM\u2019s object control is superior to that of other CRMs we tested.

Developer console to create custom apps: We liked Salesforce\u2019s developer console. Many businesses hire freelance developers to create custom functions within Salesforce and the platform provides a developer console where they can write, test and debug code for custom applications. We found the inclusion of Apex triggers particularly helpful, as they can shorten development cycles in most cases. A developer sandbox and an app builder are included with every plan. Sales managers can customize their dashboards with specific objects. Source: Salesforce Integrations and Add-ons We like that CRM users can build customizable systems and integrate their favorite business apps via the Salesforce AppExchange store. Other CRM software companies we reviewed have similar online stores for add-ons, but Salesforce\u2019s is far more comprehensive, with over 5,000 available integrations. The AppExchange\u2019s offerings have grown to encompass a broad range of solutions, including the following:\u200b Apps: AppExchange apps are direct, preprogrammed plug-ins that interact with Salesforce.

(Freshworks has similar tools; read our Freshworks CRM review to learn more.) Once implemented, sales and marketing teams and managers can easily build workflows, assign and track tasks and manage permissions.

There\u2019s also an extensive members-only forum for direct communication with other admins and CRM users, as well as a comprehensive Trailhead learning platform featuring product-related courses, upskilling opportunities and official Salesforce certifications.\n\nSalesforce Pricing Given Salesforce\u2019s extensive offerings, we\u2019ll focus on the Sales Cloud plans, where most CRM functionality resides. Note that the Starter Suite plan is available on a month-to-month basis; other tiers require annual payment.\u200b Plan Price Features Starter Suite $25 per user, per month (billed monthly or annually) Account, contact, lead, task and opportunity management\n\nAI Einstein activity capture\n\nWeb-to-lead capture\n\nLead management, assignment and routing\n\nEmail blasts\n\nEmail templates\n\nCampaign management\n\nSalesforce mobile app access\n\nCustomizable reports and dashboards\n\nProducts and price books Pro Suite $100 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Starter Suite, plus:\n\nEnhanced customization and automation\n\nOffline mobile functionality\n\nSales quoting and forecasting\n\nReal-time chat\n\nTopics and recommendations\n\nLightning App Builder\n\nAppExchange access\n\nContracts and orders Enterprise $165 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Professional, plus: Opportunity splits and scoring\n\nAI Einstein Conversation Insights\n\nPipeline inspection\n\nWaterfall chart\n\nApproval process\n\nAdvanced reporting\n\nOne partial sandbox Unlimited $330 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Enterprise, plus: Advanced pipeline management and deal insights\n\nSales engagement and conversation intelligence\n\nPremier Success Plan\n\nAgentforce\n\nLead scoring\n\nAI Einstein Relationship Insights\n\nBuyer Assistant\n\nDeveloper Pro sandbox Einstein 1 Sales $500 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Unlimited, plus: Generative AI\n\nPerformance management\n\nUnified data\n\nSales planning, programs and collaboration\n\nKnowledge base\n\nSales Elevate with Slack While the Starter Suite is reasonably priced, add-ons and customizations can increase costs, making Salesforce one of the pricier CRMs we\u2019ve reviewed.

Tip Bottom line Check out Salesforce competitors like monday CRM and HubSpot if you're looking for a more affordable solution.\n\nOnboarding and Implementation Implementing CRM software always takes care and patience. However, due to its breadth of customization options, Salesforce CRM\u2019s implementation process can vary drastically, taking anywhere from a few days to several weeks. While that may seem alarming, users will see quickly that this CRM is worth the effort once set up. Keep the following in mind: Implementation assistance: Salesforce and third-party agencies can manage your initial implementation and launch. However, this assistance comes at an additional cost, depending on your company size, number of employees, data volume and complexity, third-party integrations and customization level.\n\nSalesforce and third-party agencies can manage your initial implementation and launch.

When we contacted Salesforce during our testing, we experienced a delayed response. However, when we did connect with representatives, they were highly knowledgeable and provided helpful guidance. They used real-life scenarios to explain the product\u2019s features and answer our questions. Their explanations were clear and they offered multiple solutions to enhance our understanding. Salesforce has an A-minus rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) but isn\u2019t an accredited BBB business.\n\nLimitations Salesforce CRM is an excellent solution; however, we did identify some limitations: Complex customizations: Salesforce\u2019s biggest strength \u2014 its customization capabilities \u2014 is also a potential downside. Setting up a fully customized CRM tailored to your business\u2019s specific sales funnel, structure and workflows requires time and, ideally, a dedicated IT team.

            "content": "Remember six months ago when payment platform Klarna caused a stir and won itself a lot of media attention when its CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski declared that it was switching off Salesforce and that Workday wouldn\u2019t be far behind? In comments made to analysts that found their way into the public domain via the SeekingAlpha website, Siemiatkowski stated:\n\nWe just shut down Salesforce. Within a few weeks, we will shut down Workday. We are shutting down a lot of our SaaS providers, as we are able to consolidate.\n\nWhat was going to replace both of these? All together now - AI, of course. (Go on, admit it, you'd guessed that one, hadn't you?) Klarna had earlier in 2024 revealed an AI-powered assistant for customer service, developed in partnership with OpenAI, that it claimed could perform the work of 700 customer service agents, reducing the average resolution time from 11 minutes to two, which in turn had boosted average revenue per human staffer by 76%. That being so, who needs traditional CRM and HCM systems, eh?\n\nOn the eve of both Salesforce\u2019s Dreamforce and Workday\u2019s Rising annual conferences, these were not exactly helpful comments being thrown into the conversational zeitgeist. Both companies actually maintained a dignified stance on the issue, choosing to throw questions back onto the mix rather than engage directly.\n\nFor his part, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed that he was aware of the remarks and had reached out to try to find out what was going on, but was still in the dark. This caused him to ask:\n\nHe hasn't said where he's managing this data. How is he managing and sharing this information? How is he achieving compliance governance of his company? What is his institutional memory? Does he have a new type of data management system that he's using a new type of applications? How is he doing this? I thought it was so interesting, but there's no other data. I just know from my own perspective at Salesforce, I need to know who all my employees are and who all my customers are and all their transactions. I think that there's a broad misunderstanding of Artificial Intelligence, how it relates to data management and applications. You know, humans aren't going away\u2026this is a moment where the technology is awesome, but it's about humans with AI driving customer success together.\n\nMeanwhile at Rising, Workday Co-President Sayan Chakraborty, who plays an integral role in Workday's AI strategy, said bluntly of the Klarna commented:\n\nIt's a specious misunderstanding of what actually ERP and HCM systems do to say, 'I'm going to replace it with AI.' Beyond the AI parts of these technologies, we do a lot under the covers to do that. Have we seen lots of companies build and maintain their own HCM systems and their own financial systems through the decades? Absolutely. There's dozens of homegrown HCMs. What we've seen in the history of humankind is increased specialization and focus on what you do really well. I'm not sure, if I was on an advisory board of a company like that, that I would say, 'You should be diverting your software resources to recreating HCM, CRM, ERP' - and you are going to have to build it for yourself. The AI is not going to build the system for you... I don't think there's an existential threat of people throwing out their their HCM, CRM or ERP for ChatGPT.\n\nWhat really happened...\n\nSince then, it\u2019s been radio silence all round on the situation, until this week when Siemiatkowski suddenly chose to raise the subject again to clarify that while Klarna did indeed shut down Salesforce, this didn\u2019t spell the end for the firm. In fact, he suggested, it might be just the opposite. In a lengthy thread on X, he explained that Klarna had decided to explore the potential of AI and Large Language Models, being open to \u201ctesting all things that seemed to be trending\u201d.\n\nNow, as a strategic direction that might smack rather of chasing the silver ball across the floor and seeing where you end up. But Siemiatkowski appears to suggest he was not in favor of top-down \u2018parenting\u2019, but rather encouraging the \u2018kids\u2019 to set their own agendas and boundaries:\n\nWe encouraged all employees to do it allowed them to pursue ideas organically rather than following \"management direction\" on what they should build.\n\nAt which point I rather shudder as I\u2019ve spent long hours in cafes, on trains and in public spaces with spoilt brats kids who were brought up in such a 'progressive' way. But regardless of that negative comparison, there were apparently some valuable lessons learned, according to Siemiatkowski:\n\nIn the early days of ChatGPT, we heard a lot, \u2018This tool allows you to feed all your PDFs, all your data sources to a LLM!' However, the old universal truth of data scientists still holds true, even in AI: \"shit in, shit out.\u201d Feeding an LLM the fractioned, fragmented, and dispersed world of corporate data will result in a very confused LLM. Instead we explored a few key concepts: What of our data was actually valuable? What data was duplicative, incorrect, or contradicting? Why was it like that? While people nowadays can criticize Wikipedia, we also reflected on the fact that it is a remarkable achievement\u2014having over 20,000 people collaborate on the largest graph of knowledge that is of high quality, accessibility, and accuracy. What could we learn from this?\n\nAt some point in all this, Klarna met Neo4j and it was magic! The Swedish graph database firm introduced Klarna\u2019s teams to its tech and encouraged exploration of data modelling, ontology, vectors and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Being exposed to all this seems to have moved Klarna\u2019s thinking on. According to Siemiatkowski\n\nWe store knowledge of Klarna in SaaS, why and what (docs), plans (slides, tickets), performance (sheets), relations (CRM), people (ERP, HR) \u2014all siloed different, creating an unnavigable web of knowledge that requires tons of Klarna specific expertise to operate and utilize. We also recognized that enterprise software has some set of features that are vital for it to operate\u2014features such as audit, versioning, access and edit management, and similar universal needs. Important but further fragmentation that adds friction, admin overhead, and more.\n\nBut what did you actually do with Salesforce and Workday?\n\nSo does all of that mean Klarna did indeed try to ditch proven market-leading SaaS solutions with an LLM? Siemiatkowski says:\n\nWe started consolidating; put things together, connected our knowledge, removed the silos. The side consequence of this [was] liquidation of SaaS\u2014not, but a lot of them. Not for the license fees, though those savings are nice, but for unification and standardization of knowledge=data. So no, we did not replace SaaS with an LLM,. Storing CRM data in an LLM would have its limitations. But we developed an internal tech stack, using Neo4j and other things, to start bringing data/knowledge together. Ultimately, we found this very interesting, but more importantly starting seeing serious productivity gains. We allowed our internal AI to use this knowledge, and we realised with the help of [code editor] Cursor AI, we could quickly deploy new interfaces and interactions with it.\n\nThat's a somewhat more nuanced version of events than \u2018look at us, we\u2019re chucking out Salesforce and Workday\u2019 than the scuttlebutt that emerged last August. How did everyone get the wrong idea then? Not down to us, guv, protests Siemiatkowski.\n\nI discussed with one of my board members, should we share this publicly? We decided not to. We hold no grudge against SaaS (not true - I hate some, but won't tell you which). But we are a neo bank, there is limited value for us to share this externally. However, Klarna, being a bank, holds investors earnings call, and in passing I mentioned that we had removed some SaaS software, including Salesforce. Turns out that the recording was leaked to SeekingAlpha and they put out a news post about it. And from there, it went crazy.\n\nNow that the position has been made clear, what then can we all learn from this? Siemiatkowski postulates:\n\nWill all companies do what Klarna does? I doubt it. On the contrary, much more likely is that we will see fewer SaaS consolidate the market, and they will do what we do and offer it to others. Those are likely to be your next SaaS. And it is very likely that Salesforce will be one of those companies. As highlighted many times, they do so much more than CRM today and hence have the opportunity to become that hub of knowledge that modern companies will seek.\n\nBut he warns the SaaS veterans with the confidence only a challenger brand can muster:\n\nThere are also risks for them. They suffer from a fallacy. They started with a clear opinion of how to do things, but over time, as they try to satisfy every whim of any random person working at any large enterprise, they become a glorified database and lose their opinion.\n\nHis final thought (for now):\n\nJust like when mobile came along, we talked about mobile-first, now you need to be AI-first. SaaS will need to learn adopt and evolve. But if they do there is tremendous opportunity ahead.\n\nMy take\n\nSuddenly, Benioff was asked on stage why Klarna was leaving Salesforce. I was tremendously embarrassed.\n\nNot embarrassed enough to clear things up six months ago, but there ya go\u2026.\n\nI said at the time all this fuss broke out:\n\nAs for Klarna, good luck to it. I suspect it\u2019s going to need it. Buy now, pay later, as it were.\n\nFor his part, Siemiatkowski gives no indication of regretting the direction Klarna took - and maybe why should he? It\u2019s a feisty, up-and-coming enfant terrible of a company. We should be encouraging exploration and innovation and daring to confront sacred cows.\n\nAs to why, six months on, he\u2019s decided to provide some clarity on what happened, the clue may lie in scuttlebutt that Klarna is gearing up to go public very soon. It\u2019s going to need total transparency around its finances and spending and not scare the investor horses by allowing the impression to be had that it\u2019s in some way gambling with potentially reckless anti-SaaS adventuring.",

            "content": "The spate of layoffs in the tech sector galloped to new heights in February, which seems to be one of the worst months in the last six months for tech professionals. Meta, HP, and Workday were some big names to axe a massive chunk of their workforce.\n\nFebruary saw 46 companies lay off 15,994 employees, according to layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. When compared to January, layoffs surged in February, resulting in a staggering 184 per cent increase in the number of affected employees. Last month, 25 companies were reported to have fired 5641 of their employees.\n\nMeta\u2019s massive move\n\nAt the beginning of the month, it was reported that Meta is conducting layoffs that could impact around 5 per cent of its workforce, which is about 3,600 employees. These layoffs have been described as \u2018performance-based cuts,\u2019 and they began on February 10 with notifications planned to be delivered throughout the following week.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nEarlier in January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had informed his staff that he planned to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. \u201cWe typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year,\u201d he stated in an internal memo, but added, \u201cNow we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d However, following the announcement, it was reported that some employees with strong performance reviews were also affected.\n\nHP axes over 2000 jobs\n\nOn February 27, tech giant HP announced that it was going to cut up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring plan. Reportedly, the company currently has a strength of around 58,000 workers across 59 countries. The company is hoping to save about $300 million by the end of October 2025 with the cuts. However, the company may reportedly also incur about $150 million in restructuring costs. HP had introduced its restructuring plan named \u2018Future Now\u2019 in November 2022 with a goal of cutting 7,000 jobs. With the fresh round of layoffs, the total number under the plan would come to 9,000. With the latest job cuts, the tech giant expects to save $1.9 billion through the plan, with a total restructuring cost of about $1.2 billion. All of this comes after the company saw stronger financial gains in the first quarter. The company reportedly saw increased demand for AI-powered PCs.\n\nMore layoffs\n\nBeyond Meta and HP, companies like Salesforce, Workday, and Autodesk handed the pink slip to a sizable chunk of their workforce. On February 4, it was reported that Salesforce will be cutting over 1,000 jobs from various departments as it was restructuring to prioritise its AI initiatives. This also comes at a time when the company was on a hiring spree for sales roles to meet the needs of their primary AI offering\u2014Agentforce. Similarly, Workday laid off 1,750 of its staff, which is about 8.5 per cent of its workforce. The company reportedly cited its plans to invest in AI, global expansion, and office space reductions. Later in February, Autodesk announced a 9 per cent work force reduction, which would likely impact 1,350 employees as part of its strategy to focus on core business areas, including AI.\n\nWhy are big tech companies laying off staff?\n\nBased on a broader view, there are numerous factors that drove the mass layoffs in February 2025. Uncertainty about the future of the economy has been a persisting concern, coupled with rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. These aspects have been pushing businesses to reassess their financial strategies. Most companies have cited economic volatility as a major driver for their cost-cutting initiatives. Also, overhiring during the pandemic has left many organisations overstaffed, prompting them to reduce unnecessary roles amid a decline in revenues.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother major factor is the increasing adoption of AI solutions rendering many jobs redundant, especially the likes of customer service, HR, marketing roles, etc. In some cases, mergers and acquisitions have also forced companies to restructure, resulting in overlapping roles and further job cuts. Waning investor confidence is also a reason, as many companies are facing stock price declines due to lower-than-expected revenue projects. This has pushed many companies to cut costs to maintain their profitability.\n\nWhen compared, January saw significant job cuts, although fewer than February. Major layoffs in January included Amazon, which carried out large-scale layoffs, though the exact number was undisclosed. January\u2019s layoffs were seen in sectors like e-commerce, finance, and tech media, reflecting continued adjustments following the holiday season. On the other hand, December 2024 reported a slightly different pattern, with layoffs in aerospace, finance, and energy sectors. Lilium, an aerospace company, laid off 1,000 employees, effectively cutting its entire workforce. The trend in December suggested an industry-wide shift toward downsizing, anticipating economic challenges in early 2025.\n\nFor now, there seems to be no slowing down for layoffs. However, some analysts have predicted the layoff wave could slow down by mid-2025; some believe continued economic uncertainty may spell more job cuts. With businesses increasingly adapting to changing market conditions, the workforce will need to stay agile.",

That\u2019s according to Scott Alfieri, the global leader of Accenture\u2019s massive Google Business Group that consists of tens of thousands of employees dedicated to driving Google sales for the $71 billion company. \u201cYou are now able to select Gemini from [Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce]\u2019s drop-down so that when you\u2019re building AI agents\u2014let\u2019s say it\u2019s in the contact center, which is where a lot of our work is\u2014you\u2019re now using the generative AI engine and R&D investments that are realized around the world from Google to allow agents to be utilizing the best LLMs that exist in the marketplace that are multimodal,\u201d said Alfieri. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited for customers.\u201d Agentic AI represents a $2 trillion market opportunity, according to a recent study from Salesforce. From Google Workspace with Gemini benefits to more easily providing AI agents to Accenture\u2019s massive customer base in more than 120 countries, Alfieri is bullish that the teaming of Salesforce and Google will be a boon for solution providers in the AI era. [Related: Salesforce Launches AI Agents Marketplace] \u201cYou\u2019ve now got this extensibility that will happen between Salesforce and Google with Vertex AI and then the other platforms that come with Google Cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we think about where Salesforce plays and where Google plays in the market, it\u2019s just this beautiful complementary matchup.\u201d Accenture is investing heavily in AI in 2025. This week alone, Accenture acquired AI provider Halfspace, which helps businesses leverage and scale AI to make better, more-informed decisions. Accenture also this year invested in Aaru, the creator of a leading AI-powered prediction engine that simulates consumer behavior and preferences. Accenture is a 20-time Google Cloud Partner of the Year award winner, thanks in part to Alfieri\u2019s leadership, which includes over 30 years working at Accenture. In an interview with CRN, Alfieri explains why Accenture and the channel should be bullish about Google Cloud and Salesforce\u2019s new $2.5 billion partnership in the AI era.\n\nGoogle Cloud And Salesforce Is An Agentic AI Home Run Salesforce and Google Cloud\u2019s $2.5 billion deal over the next seven years will see the two tech companies integrate their AI and CRM tools, linking the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure with Salesforce's AI-powered Agentforce assistants, CRM software and Data Cloud capabilities. Salesforce is adding Gemini to its Agentforce platform, meaning all Salesforce customers can begin using Gemini to power their AI agents. Alfieri said Accenture will be leveraging Google\u2019s Gemini models on Agentforce, allowing agents to work with images, audio and video and handle more complex tasks using Gemini\u2019s multimodal capabilities and two-million-token context windows. \u201cWe\u2019re now taking both of our kits, if you will, to bring those together to now create acceleration positions in these initial movements between Google and Salesforce,\u201d he said. With the offer using real-time insight and answers grounded in Google Search with Vertex AI, Accenture will help clients capitalize on this partnership by providing packaged accelerators to drive growth and reinvent business workflows and customer experiences. \u201cWhat matters is those first client meetings where you\u2019re talking about how Google and Salesforce will work together and how Accenture can bring them through to a business reinvention journey,\u201d he said. Google\u2019s Gemini models will also be available for prompt building and reasoning directly within Agentforce.\n\nOne Boosted Use Case: Real-Time Voice Translation Salesforce\u2019s customer service platform, Service Cloud, is now more tightly integrated with Google\u2019s own Customer Engagement Suite. This will enhance AI-enabled contact center capabilities including real-time voice translation, personalized agent recommendations and AI-driven conversational insight across all channels. Alfieri said Google Cloud\u2019s AI in Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud will enable real-time voice translation that breaks down language barriers. \u201cAllowing translation capabilities is very important. So that\u2019s a unique differentiator for Google in terms of the language translation that you\u2019re able to bring forward that\u2019s enabled with Gemini and Vertex AI,\u201d said Alfieri. For example, he said customer care representatives can receive AI-powered assistance in multiple languages and automated case summarization. \u201cAnother example for health care, you can be building agents and then call Gemini. Then from there, Google has their medical large language model\u2014MedLM\u2014you can now be using that in specific medical or health-care-specific use cases or industry and functional positions.\u201d In addition, new agent assist features within the Service Cloud desktop will analyze tone of voice and audio cues for deeper customer sentiment understanding.\n\nGoogle Cloud Marketplace Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, Data Cloud and Customer 360 apps will run on Google Cloud infrastructure, with access to new regions and simplified procurement through the Google Cloud Marketplace. This means that organizations can begin deploying Salesforce offerings through Google Cloud Marketplace. Alfieri said this synergy on Google\u2019s online marketplace opens the door to new possibilities for global businesses to optimize their investments across Salesforce and Google Cloud with Accenture. \u201cThe Marketplace allows [customers] to capture the innovation of the world,\u201d Alfieri said. \u201cThrough the marketplace, we\u2019re publishing specific Accenture intellectual property-controlled agents for both industry and function\u2014all built on Google Cloud.\u201d Alfieri said with customers\u2019 ability to procure and deploy Salesforce solutions via Google\u2019s online marketplace, it \u201cjust makes it easier for everybody.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just excited to do much more around the Google Cloud Marketplace as we go through 2025,\u201d he said.\n\nWorkspace Gemini Adoption With Slack Google Cloud and Salesforce said they are creating better ways to integrate Slack and Google Workspace products, like Google Chat, to easily communicate across platforms. The two companies are exploring the ability for users to use enterprise search in Slack to access and act on files in Google Drive. Another goal is the ability to more easily share information between Gmail and Slack, enhancing communication and knowledge sharing. Alfieri said this will enable Salesforce customers to leverage the power of Gemini and Workspace after Google Cloud this year made Gemini available free of charge for clients with Business and Enterprise subscription plans. \u201cWorkspace and Gemini are now all one,\u201d said Alfieri. \u201cWe had built a value accelerator of how generative AI can impact a client in the Workspace world, but now it\u2019s just one motion. So it\u2019s actually a more efficient and singular conversation with a client.\u201d Accenture is particularly excited to leverage Workspace\u2019s digital sovereignty technology for its Salesforce customers. \u201cFor Workspace, it\u2019s not just about collaborations, it\u2019s about how can this be about business reinvention and business change,\u201d Alfieri said.",

Is it a seamless engine for growth, or a clunky, outdated system that\u2019s constantly requiring bandaids and workarounds?\n\nIf you\u2019re starting to question whether your current system is truly serving you, you\u2019re not alone. Many financial services firms are finding that their existing CRMs \u2014 whether it\u2019s Microsoft Dynamics, an older Salesforce version, or something else entirely \u2014 just aren\u2019t cutting it anymore.\n\nAnd I get it, the familiar can be comforting. You know the quirks, the workarounds, the limitations. Re-doing your CRM feels daunting, like climbing a mountain. But what if that climb led to a breathtaking view, a clear path to greater efficiency, and a launchpad for unprecedented growth?\n\nInvesting the time and effort to modernize your CRM isn\u2019t just about changing software; it\u2019s about realigning your priorities, driving ROI, and putting real value back into your business. It\u2019s about ditching the duct tape and building a solid foundation for the future. It starts with asking the right questions.\n\n1. Is my current system truly client-centric, or just data-centric?\n\nThe data model for Salesforce Financial Services Cloud (FSC) is architected for the nuances of financial relationships, seamlessly connecting households, accounts, goals, interactions, and even life events in a way that feels intuitive and, more importantly, actionable. Think of it as moving from a complex spreadsheet to a dynamic, interactive client portal. Does your current CRM offer this level of insight?\n\n2. Am I leveraging the power of automation, or am I still drowning in manual processes?\n\nFSC offers robust automation tools, from streamlined workflows for onboarding new clients and managing compliance tasks to intelligent triggers for personalized follow-ups and proactive service. Imagine automating your KYC/AML checks or proactively reaching out to clients based on significant life events \u2013 that\u2019s the power of FSC. Is your current CRM automating these critical tasks?\n\n3. Can my technology seamlessly scale with my growth, or is it becoming a bottleneck?\n\nSalesforce\u2019s cloud-based infrastructure offers unparalleled scalability and flexibility. Whether you\u2019re onboarding new advisors, expanding into new markets, or experiencing organic growth, FSC can handle the increasing demands without missing a beat. Can your current system say the same?\n\n4. Am I getting the actionable insights I need to make informed decisions, or am I buried in data that isn\u2019t actionable?\n\nFSC, combined with Tableau, provides robust reporting and analytics dashboards that deliver a clear, concise picture of your business performance. From client segmentation and portfolio analysis to revenue forecasting and regulatory reporting, you\u2019ll have the data you need at your fingertips, presented in a way that facilitates informed decision-making. Is your current CRM providing this level of business intelligence?\n\n5. Is my technology fostering true collaboration, or are we working in silos?\n\nFSC facilitates seamless collaboration between advisors, support staff, portfolio managers, and other stakeholders. Imagine real-time access to client information, shared task lists, integrated communication tools, and secure document sharing \u2013 all within a single, unified platform. Does your current CRM break down silos or reinforce them?\n\nWhy Salesforce stands out\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m partial to Salesforce. Having worn many hats in this industry \u2014 from client-side user, sales executive, and eventually CRM product owner to consultant \u2014 I\u2019ve seen firsthand what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the robust trust layer, the feature-rich platform aligned with industry standards (we\u2019re talking banks, credit unions, wealth management firms, asset management, and more!), or unparalleled customizability. It\u2019s about having a CRM that truly understands the complexities of financial services, offering a solid foundation for growth and innovation.\n\nAnd Salesforce\u2019s commitment to AI \u2014 especially agentic agents \u2014 is game-changing. This isn\u2019t just about chatbots; it\u2019s about intelligent assistants that can revolutionize how you connect with clients, automate tasks, and gain a competitive edge. In my experience, this focus on cutting-edge technology makes Salesforce the rocket ship you want to be on.\n\nPlugging into the power of the ecosystem\n\nBeyond the core functionalities of FSC, integrating other Salesforce solutions creates an unstoppable combination: Data Cloud unifies all your client data, Agentforce leverages generative AI to empower advisors, and Tableau transforms raw data into compelling visualizations.\n\nTogether, these tools boost productivity, decrease costs, and dramatically improve the user experience. Many users are tired of constantly patching and fixing legacy systems. A move to FSC represents a fresh start, a chance to implement best practices and drive real value.\n\nNavigating the two most common challenges when migrating to FSC\n\nMoving to Salesforce FSC can be a transformative journey for financial services firms. While every migration has its unique challenges, the long-term benefits are substantial. The two most common hurdles I have experienced are user adoption and issues with data migration. With a solid plan in place, both are challenges that you can easily manage to ensure you get the most value out of the time spent transitioning.\n\nUser adoption: Even with the best technology, success hinges on your team embracing the change. Team members are often comfortable with familiar systems, even with limitations. They may resist change or struggle with the initial learning curve of a new platform. To achieve a smooth transition and build a change-adaptive workforce, prioritize comprehensive training programs, personalized onboarding, and ongoing support. Empower key team members as \u201csuper users\u201d who champion the new system and encourage others. Celebrating early wins and highlighting success stories can build momentum and demonstrate the value of FSC.\n\nData migration: Your data is one of your most valuable assets. Cleaning, mapping, and consolidating data from various sources requires meticulous planning and execution. Partnering with a specialized Salesforce implementation partner can be invaluable for ensuring data accuracy and integrity. Develop a comprehensive data migration strategy that includes data cleansing, mapping, and validation. Customizing FSC to align with your specific business needs also demands careful consideration and collaboration.\n\nBy proactively addressing these challenges, firms can unlock the full potential of FSC. The rewards of a well-executed implementation are significant. Firms often report streamlined operations, improved client communication, and access to valuable business insights.\n\nThese organizations are not only able to keep pace with industry innovation but, in many cases, even become leaders in adopting new approaches and best practices. The initial hesitancy from team members often gives way to enthusiastic support as they experience the tangible benefits of the new platform.\n\nChoose an implementation partner with industry experience\n\nChange can be unsettling, but it doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming. The key to a successful transition to FSC? It\u2019s all about the how and selecting the right partner to help guide you.\n\nFinding a trusted partner like Atrium can make all the difference. Atrium is a specialized Salesforce implementation partner that brings a wealth of knowledge and best practices to the table. We take a customer-centric view, understand your business outcomes, and can set you up for a future powered by AI. We\u2019ll guide you through the process, minimize disruption, and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not quite ready to dive headfirst into AI, it\u2019s essential to choose a platform and a partner with the future in mind. Atrium understands the power of AI to transform financial services, whether they be a bank, credit union or wealth management shop. We can help you leverage AI-powered solutions like Agentforce to enhance client experiences, automate tasks, and gain valuable insights. AI is transforming the financial services landscape, and having a CRM that can adapt and evolve with these advancements is crucial for long-term success.\n\nRemember, a successful transition requires a strategic approach. Focus on the long-term benefits, plan for a phased rollout with strong change management, and ensure accurate data migration.

            "content": "He also recounted Hackman's movies that he liked and commented on the contrast with the movies that Hackman actually liked. Cramer stated:\n\n\"Yeah I was a great friend of Gene for a very long time. He did move on. Uh from when he was a great partner of mine at my hedge fund. And he was a quiet genius. You'd learn from him every time. He came into my office one day. I happened to be a huge Gene Hackman fan. And he was in the lobby, and he said, can I see you, and I said listen nobody's the wizard. But he was so thoughtful and great by the way in so many things that he did. For instance, he did a painting of me that I've always kept, that he did in early 2000. But a remarkable man, a kind man, obviously a great actor. One of the most humble people I've ever met. Never in a million years, I remember one time when my eldest said to him you are a great basketball coach and he said, no you see, that was a movie.\"\n\nWhen co-host David Faber pointed out that the output from most AI chatbots has to be cross-referenced with each other, Cramer countered and pointed out that the process was too time-consuming. \"But by the time I'm finished with that, I could have hand-counted it,\" shared the CNBC TV show host.\n\n\"They are so bad because I got caught using it for something I'm writing. And it was so wrong. It was the 'return on Meta' and it was like 'Meta's return since it came public was 17%' and that was not even the CAGR it was just like 17%. 17%. I was like no, and I went back and said I think that's wrong. And it said you're right, its 300%.\"\n\nCramer added that ChatGPT \"was dumb; it was more stupid than Alexa.\" He also shared specific examples of where ChatGPT failed to meet his expectations. According to him:\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on how he's facing trouble using ChatGPT. In his. In previous remarks about OpenAI's software, Cramer shared that he used ChatGPT regularly to research stocks before his programs. While he maintained that \"I use ChatGPT all the time,\" he added that \"it was really bad yesterday.\"\n\nWe recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & Shares ChatGPT's Flaws . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"It's funny cause the movies that he loved, I told him I loved obviously Conversation, you know, I loved French Connection. The ones that he loved were very different. He loved Royal Tenenbaums, he loved things where he played . . . .but the best thing he ever said to me was, I was in a couple of deals, and he said, and they backfired, and he said, Jim, sometimes you just get had. Simple man, great man.\"\n\nCycling back to the trade tensions between the US and China, he added the market is wondering what \"the President going to do about China?\" While admitting that \"China's not as important as it was, but it doesn't matter,\" Cramer added: \"Because everybody in the end is concerned about what the President's going to do.\"\n\n\"I mean there are 18 friendly countries that are allowed unlimited selling. And they're saying look, maybe that is arbitrary, and they're to go over the President's people about, how, to change those midnight rules that were put together by the Biden Administration right at the end of his term. So be aware that there's a lot of moving parts, in NVIDIA, no moving parts in Snowflake.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on February 27th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (CRM): Agentforce AI Platform Shows Strong Early Momentum\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 162\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the largest players in the customer relationship management software industry. It has been a standout firm in the AI era primarily because of its AI platform Agentforce. In his previous comments about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Cramer has been positive about Agentforce. The firm's shares fell by 4% in February after its $9.9 billion in revenue and $1.78 in EPS missed analyst estimates of $10 billion and $2.61. Here's what Cramer said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM):\n\n\"Look, Marc is, what he's saying basically is look, the future is going to be, this [inaudible] of Agentforce. I mean stop thinking so small. Stop thinking about what would happen without Agentforce. I mean he did talk about Stuart Miller from Lennar. And what Lennar was doing with it and how they're moving people who are kind of doing skunk work into more important things. And that's, that's what happening. But it's not easily understood. I think that the use cases are going to come again and again. You know what was really the most interesting, and I don't mean to rain on the Agentforce parade, but, they're working very closely on a healthcare vertical. Uh that goes against Veeva. Which does healthcare tests. They do contract research, they make . .and they got Pfizer. Which is the single biggest account out there. They got Pfizer. And lost in the shuffle of Agentforce, I mention it only because Agentforce is such a big deal and Mark, I had to bring up Pfizer.\"\n\nOverall CRM ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This shift comes amid a growing backlash against DEI initiatives, particularly after President Trump signed executive orders to end these programs within the federal government and among its contractors. Thus, CRM being a major vendor to the U.S. government, has adjusted its policies to comply with these regulations.\n\nAmong the key changes, the company has removed specific hiring targets for underrepresented groups in its workforce. This includes previous goals to increase the representation of women and minority groups.\n\nAlso, Salesforce\u2019s annual report previously included a section dedicated to \u201cEquality, Diversity and Inclusion,\u201d and executive compensation was tied to achieving these goals. However, in the latest 10K, the section is titled \u201cEquality,\u201d and focuses on compliance with equal-pay and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nDEI Rollback Started Before Trump-Era\n\nConservative activists such as Edward Blum and influencer Robby Starbuck drew attention to DEI policies in the months before Trump returned to office. Importantly, social media campaigns by Starbuck criticizing \u201cwoke\u201d corporations pushed companies like Deere (DE), Harley-Davidson (HOG), and Lowe\u2019s (LOW) to modify or drop DEI efforts.\n\nFurther, Trump\u2019s executive orders accelerated the trend, with Walmart (WMT) halting race and gender-based supplier contracts. Meanwhile, tech giants like Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) followed suit, scaling back their DEI policies.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, over 30 companies have scaled back these programs since mid-2024.\n\nIs CRM a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, CRM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells assigned in the last three months.

            "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the #1 AI CRM, today announced Agentforce 2dx, the newest version of Agentforce, its digital labor platform for bringing trusted, autonomous AI agents into the flow of work. In this release, Agentforce is expanding beyond the reactive, user-initiated world of chat interfaces and enabling proactive AI agents to work behind the scenes, without constant human oversight, to unlock new customer and employee workflows of any kind. Organizations can now seamlessly integrate autonomous agents into their existing data systems, business logic, and user interfaces, enabling agents to anticipate business needs and dynamically take action \u2014 improving efficiency, agility, and scale.\n\nAgentforce 2dx also marks the release of a new set of low-code and pro-code tools for Salesforce developers to confidently configure, test, and deploy Agentforce faster, paired with advanced analytics to help teams monitor, debug, and optimize agent performance with real-time data and guidance. To experiment with these tools, Salesforce now offers the Agentforce Developer Edition, a completely free environment where developers can prototype agents using Agentforce and also explore the capabilities of Data Cloud, Salesforce\u2019s hyperscale data engine.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce announced AgentExchange, the trusted marketplace and community for Agentforce that is built into Salesforce, opening up new opportunities for partners to participate in the rapidly expanding $6 trillion digital labor market opportunity. AgentExchange will accelerate Agentforce deployments with a library of ready-to-use templates and actions, saving businesses time and resources while enabling partners to list their components for sale and capture their share of the growing AI agent market. AgentExchange launches with more than 200 initial partners and hundreds of ready-made actions \u2014 each having passed a rigorous security review and backed by customer reviews \u2014 to quickly create and deploy AI agents across multiple professions and industries.\n\nAgentforce 2dx, paired with the new developer tools and AgentExchange, launches with the Agentblazer community, an inclusive group for Salesforce admins, developers, CTOs, CIOs, and other IT leaders who can share best practices and learn skills on Trailhead to create agent-first companies.\n\n\u201cCompanies today have more work than workers, and Agentforce is stepping in to fill the gap. By extending digital labor beyond CRM, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for businesses to embed agentic AI into any workflow or application to handle routine tasks, augment employees, and connect with customers. With deep integrations across Salesforce\u2019s digital labor platform, CIOs, IT leaders, and developers can seamlessly build agents and automate work wherever it happens, driving efficiency, fueling innovation, and unlocking new opportunities in the $6 trillion digital labor market.\u201d \u2013 Adam Evans, EVP and GM of Salesforce\u2019s AI Platform\n\nWhy it matters: 96% of developers believe AI agents will positively reshape the developer experience. Agentic AI represents the next evolution of automation, where AI-driven agents operate independently to execute tasks, make decisions, and optimize workflows without constant human oversight. Unlike traditional AI chatbots, which require manual prompts or rigid programming, agentic AI dynamically responds to live data and evolving business needs. Salesforce's latest agentic AI enhancements represent a major leap in how organizations integrate agents into daily operations. By embedding AI seamlessly into apps, workflows, and processes, enterprise-ready AI agents won\u2019t just assist \u2014 they\u2019ll act.\n\n\u201cOpenTable is partnering with Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce Platform to help OpenTable\u2019s customer service agents better serve our restaurants and diners. Three weeks in, it is handling 73% of all restaurant web queries. This is a 50% improvement from our previous tool and we expect this number to further increase once Agentforce is launched to the general audience.\u201d \u2014 George Pokorny, Senior VP of Global Customer Success at OpenTable\n\nWhat\u2019s new\n\nOrchestrate Agentforce across any experience or system\n\nDeploying autonomous agents for every customer and employee interaction used to require a complex implementation strategy. Now, admins and developers have even more capabilities to embed Agentforce anywhere and tailor for every use case with new tools like:\n\nAgentforce API: Integrate Agentforce in back-end processes, other systems, and directly into applications with the new Agentforce API. For example, customers can trigger an agent when an ERP order is created or kick off a loan application process automation to verify whether documents have the required information.\n\nAgentforce Invocable Actions: Agentforce can now be embedded within Salesforce business logic, like Flow and Apex. This allows customers to blend classic workflow automation with agentic reasoning. For example, customers can trigger an agent when an opportunity moves to a certain stage to reason over the best next steps, and kick off email updates or approvals accordingly.\n\nMuleSoft for Agentforce: MuleSoft Topic Center allows developers to use natural language to create Agentforce topics and actions from MuleSoft APIs. The MuleSoft API Catalog simplifies AI agent development by centralizing access to diverse APIs from MuleSoft, Salesforce, and Heroku within Agentforce. It provides a secure, governed hub for admins to quickly expand agent capabilities with pre-built topics and actions from across their ecosystems. The MuleSoft Agentforce connector allows developers to integrate Agentforce into existing workflows, enabling APIs and integrations to trigger agents for data enrichment and action execution across systems.\n\nAgentforce Steps in Slack Workflow Builder: Enables developers to embed Agentforce into no-code automations in Slack. Trigger Agentforce from Slack events, and pass Slack conversational context back to Agentforce without needing to rely on user-initiated action.\n\nAgentforce Employee Template: Easily deploy Agentforce for employee use cases across Slack and Salesforce with a new Agentforce template. Agentforce Employee Template allows customers to create multiple employee agents that can be configured and deployed across any line of business.\n\nAgentforce Surfaces: Intelligently deliver rich content within Agentforce across all Digital Engagement channels. Intelligently add dynamic, interactive components and media that are channel and device specific to better customize how Agentforce shows up across channels.\n\nAgentforce Cards: Embed Lightning web components within the response of Agentforce actions. Reuse existing Salesforce components to give more context, information, and functionality to Agentforce.\n\nTableau Semantics: Create clear and organized data structures \u2014 semantic models \u2014 that Agentforce can take advantage of. Tableau enriches agents with real-time business context, so they can provide more accurate insights and answers.\n\nConfidently configure, test, and deploy with new tools\n\nAgentforce includes new pro-code and low-code tools to help admins and developers ideate, build, deploy, and supervise their Agentforce across their organization. These tools are part of the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, so they are fully integrated into the workflows developers use every day, like DevOps Center and the Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\nAgentforce Developer Edition: A new free environment for accessing Agentforce and Data Cloud to get started on prototyping first use cases. Agentforce Developer Edition includes 10GB of access to Data Cloud, and 150 LLM generations per hour.\n\nAI assistance in Agent Builder: Teams can now put Agentforce into production faster and with more confidence with AI-powered topic and instruction creation to help quickly configure agents that adhere to best practices. AI Assist also helps teams troubleshoot answers that Agentforce provides and give guidance on how to improve the underlying topic and instructions.\n\nTesting Center: Teams can easily test their Agentforce configurations at scale using AI. And they can automatically generate and run test cases in Testing Center in their Salesforce Sandbox. Teams can also evaluate how well Agentforce configurations are adhering to guardrails like faithfulness or context relevance.\n\nCLI and VS Code Support: Developers can now create, update, and test Agentforce configurations using the CLI and VS code. All aspects of Agentforce configurations can be created and updated with pro-code tools, and test cases can be run against these configurations.\n\nDX Inspector: Explore and understand all of the metadata and data used by Agentforce, including agent topics and actions, inside your Salesforce Sandbox. Easily make and track changes to the metadata while configuring agents in Agent Builder through the side panel.\n\nAgentforce Interaction Explorer: Detailed reporting and analytics about how Agentforce is performing, from general trends down to individual session tracing. Understand each user request, the reasoning steps associated with the response, and see AI-powered recommendations to help continuously refine topics and instructions to improve agent performance.\n\nAnalyst perspectives\n\nAgentic AI promises to deliver exponential benefits from AI by automating complex tasks and interactions without human intervention. However, creating agentic AI that can handle complex tasks with acceptable performance has been a challenge. Industry analyst Valoir found using a platform optimized for agentic AI development like Salesforce Agentforce enables organizations to deliver autonomous AI agents an average of 16 times faster than other approaches while increasing accuracy by 75%.\n\nFuturum Research found organizations using Agentforce can achieve ROI up to five times faster and with at least a 20% lower total cost of ownership, enabling them to outpace competitors and streamline operations at scale. Companies using Agentforce have reported 40% faster case resolution times and 25% higher lead conversion rates, directly affecting revenue and customer retention.\n\n\u201c89% of CIOs identify AI and automation as critical to their digital strategy in 2025, yet 60% of AI projects fail to deliver clear ROI. Agentforce bridges this gap with pre-built workflows that deliver measurable impact fast. While DIY agent-based AI projects can take up to a year to implement, Agentforce customers go live in just 4-6 weeks, realizing value 3-4 times faster. As AI agents become embedded across business operations, from engineering to go-to-market, they will fundamentally reshape how teams engage with customers and partners. Instead of siloed interactions across CRM, support platforms, and marketing tools, AI agents can coordinate responses, escalate issues, and optimize workflows in real time. Companies that harness this shift \u2014 especially in their partner ecosystems \u2014 will gain a competitive edge in both performance and market reach.\u201d \u2013 Dion Hinchcliffe, VP and Practice Lead, CIO Insights, Futurum Group\n\nCustomers realize immediate value\n\nAdecco Group, the world\u2019s leading talent company, is harnessing the power of Data Cloud and Agentforce to create a deeply unified platform that redefines the recruitment landscape. By centralizing more than 40 instances of their data using MuleSoft and Data Cloud, Adecco will streamline operations and enhance efficiency.\n\n\u201cAgentforce is completely transforming our recruitment process. By automating resume screening and using AI to engage with millions of candidates, we can connect with every applicant and make sure they feel valued and informed. This not only improves the experience for candidates but also frees up our recruiters to focus on building meaningful relationships, all while boosting our efficiency and scalability.\u201d \u2014 Greg Shewmaker, Senior Vice President of Global Operations and AI at The Adecco Group\n\nEngine, the modern travel platform for business trips and events, aims to achieve nearly $1.9 million in total annualized benefits, shorten average handle time for cancellation requests and email responses by 15%, and manage up to 30% of incoming customer inquiries with agents.\n\n\u201cWith Agentforce, we\u2019ve built multiple AI agents that power various parts of our business, addressing every stage of the customer lifecycle. By managing a significant portion of incoming customer inquiries, Agentforce serves as a vital digital labor platform that enhances our customer service workforce. The AI agents handle cancellation requests end-to-end without needing human escalation, using CRM data to provide accurate responses. This streamlines our operations and allows our teams to focus on high volumes of FAQs across chat, email, and phone calls.\u201d \u2014 Elia Wallen, Founder and CEO at Engine\n\nPrecina, a company transforming healthcare for patients with type 2 diabetes, is using Agentforce to tap into Salesforce\u2019s deeply unified platform to instantly access their medical records, lab results, and prescription history.\n\n\u201cAgentforce has completely transformed the way we support both patients and providers. By automating contracting and providing AI-driven coaching, our providers can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time delivering the care that truly makes a difference. This shift not only enhances patient support but also will help us save an estimated $80,000 each year for every 5,000 patients in reduced administrative overhead.\u201d \u2014 John Oberg, Founder & CEO at Precina\n\nOregon Humane Society, the largest animal welfare organization in the Northwest, is using MuleSoft to streamline their operations, from automating animal meet-and-greet scheduling and donation processes to connecting various systems and apps. By integrating data across their organization, Oregon Humane Society is able to get better insights for fundraising and marketing, reduce manual effort, and save significant time and resources.\n\n\u201cAs an early adopter, we leveraged MuleSoft to seamlessly connect Salesforce and NetSuite.

            "content": "Salesforce and ServiceNow, after a few years of spirited but relatively low-contact sparring, are ratcheting up the competitive intensity as booming demand for AI agents has inspired each to push aggressively into the other\u2019s core business.\n\nMarc Benioff recently indicated that Salesforce is jumping into the ITSM space, a category that ServiceNow created and still leads today, while ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott has ready to go all-in on CRM, a sector that\u2019s been synonymous with Salesforce throughout its 25-year history.\n\nFor business customers, these moves are significant for a few reasons:\n\nThe Rise of Agents: Business executives are confident that agentic AI will live up to its enormous potential, and are hearing every big software company in the world promise to be able to make all their agent dreams come true. And since those customer-side executives are learning quickly that agents must operate end to end to deliver desired outcomes, many of the Cloud Wars Top 10 companies are using this opportunity to spread their wings (and their aspirations) with expansive new strategies for agents.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nThe Rise of Data: As the big applications companies evolve into platform vendors focused on AI solutions powered by rich data sources and access, they are also looking to seize new market opportunities via the mountains of business data they\u2019ve accumulated over the past few decades. The competition among these companies is becoming a bit less about simply \u201capplications\u201d and more about the related data and its ability to fuel agents and other AI technologies. The Fall of Siloed Processes: Businesses are \u2014 to their great advantage \u2014 beginning to knock down the internal silos that led to fragmented processes, fragmented data sources, and diminished marketplace opportunities. Instead, they are re-imagining their business models by placing the customer at the center of everything and building new and integrated processes around that customer core.\n\nMcDermott: \u2018CRM is ServiceNow\u2019s fastest-growing business\u2019\n\nServiceNow\u2019s CEO outlined his company\u2019s plans for the massive CRM space on the company\u2019s recent Q4 earnings call.\n\n\u201cServiceNow and Microsoft are expanding our alliance to accelerate disruption in the CRM category,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cThis is built on Microsoft Copilot and ServiceNow AI agent collaboration, leveraging the unique strengths of both platforms. So this is a good time to remind you that CRM and industry workflows is ServiceNow\u2019s fastest-growing business.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason for that: ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to take action and fully automate workflows across the enterprise. We have a key differentiator at the architectural level because we don\u2019t have to try to translate between our AI models and some third-party system. We sell, fulfill, and service on one platform, one architecture, and one data model,\u201d McDermott said.\n\n\u201cOther software vendors need to communicate across multiple systems and stitch them together to make their software work, resulting in poor customer experiences, saddled with technical debt. With just a front-end AI agent, a customer is limited in their ability to take action across the enterprise to drive the ticket to resolution.\u201d\n\nBenioff: New ITSM Solution Makes Debut This Week\n\nLate last month, Salesforce announced its first $10 billion quarter, representing a vast market presence that will not be displaced easily. And that\u2019s exactly why McDermott is looking to position his company as the modern alternative to outdated CRM systems, particularly with his evocation of the \u201cone platform, one architecture, and one data model\u201d advantage.\n\nBut the funny thing is that Benioff has been using the exact same language \u2014 unified platform, data, architecture, and agents \u2014 over the past few quarters to articulate his company\u2019s new direction and new opportunities centered on its Agentforce agentic AI portfolio and platform and its fast-growing Data Cloud.\n\nSo in that context of fresh beginnings, new capabilities, and unique opportunities, Benioff has decided to push Salesforce into a category way the heck outside the CRM space: ITSM, aka IT service management. That\u2019s the market segment on which ServiceNow was founded 20 years ago, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence (in fact, I don\u2019t believe in coincidences at all) that Benioff just happened to select one of ServiceNow\u2019s strongest businesses for this foray outside of the traditional bounds of CRM.\n\nOn Salesforce\u2019s fiscal-Q4 earnings call late last month, Benioff dropped this juicy hint about that new adventure for Salesforce during a list of new products and innovations his company will show this week at its Trailblazers Developers Conference in San Fransisco: \u201cYou might even get a glimpse of the new ITSM product that\u2019s coming if you look hard,\u201d Benioff said.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nIt\u2019s great to see the very large and influential and fast-growing software companies within the Cloud Wars Top 10 evolve and transform rapidly to meet the emerging needs of their customers. That\u2019s certainly an element of what\u2019s taking place with ServiceNow going more aggressively after Salesforce\u2019s core business, and Salesforce doing the same to ServiceNow.\n\nBut is it also a bit personal between Benioff and McDermott? Hell yes, it is. Both have been hugely successful, both have been drivers of great innovation within not only their companies but across the entire cloud and AI industry, and both are intensely focused on not just what customers want and need today but what they\u2019re going to need in 2026 and beyond.\n\nAnd this escalating competition between Salesforce and ServiceNow is surely another great example of how, in the Cloud Wars, the biggest winners are always \u2014 always \u2014 the customers.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

            "content": "Salesforce Launches AI Agents Marketplace\n\nDIY AI 'clearly is not working for lots of people,' Salesforce EVP Brian Landsman tells CRN.\n\nSalesforce has launched a new marketplace for its Agentforce AI platform that should allow partners to build and monetize agentic artificial intelligence components.\n\nThe marketplace, AgentExchange, is billed as accelerating AI agent deployment with a library of templates and add-ons meant to save users time and resources, according to the San Francisco-based enterprise applications vendor.\n\nThe marketplace launches with more than 200 initial partners and hundreds of actions. Salesforce announced the marketplace ahead of its TDX developer conference, which runs through Thursday in San Francisco.\n\nBrian Landsman, Salesforce\u2019s executive vice president and general manager of global business development and partnerships, told CRN in an interview that AgentExchange builds on the foundation of Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange marketplace\u2013now about 20 years old with more than 7,000 partners, 9,000 listings and 13 million app installs to date.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on the ability to bring third-party offerings direct ro users to be able to build these agents on a platform that does a lot of the work that you would otherwise have to go DIY, (do it yourself), which clearly is not working for lots of people,\u201d said Landsman, referring to a common criticism Salesforce has lobbed at rival AI vendors, notably Microsoft.\n\n\u201cIt's not working for lots of customers. It\u2019s certainly not working for lots of partners,\u201d he added.\n\n[RELATED: Salesforce Q4 2025 Earnings: CEO Benioff Dismisses Threat To SaaS From Agentic AI]\n\nSalesforce AgentExchange\n\nSalesforce and Microsoft executives have battled publicly over which vendor brings the better AI offer for customers, with Salesforce CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff dismissing wares from Microsoft and other rivals as \u201cfalse agents\u201d and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggesting that humans may not need to interact with software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms such as Salesforce in the agentic era.\n\nAllen Mann, director of the AI Innovation Hub at Salesforce partner Slalom\u2013No. 27 on CRN\u2019s 2024 Solution Provider 500\u2013told CRN in an interview that his company is one of the few global system integrators chosen to be part of Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce Partner Network.\n\nSlalom has been building up its agentic AI expertise for about 24 months, creating \u201ca really meaningful and impactful way for Slalom to show that expertise as industry-focused consultants that can help bring real, pragmatic, agentic solutions to our clients that institutionalize the needs that they have,\u201d Mann said.\n\nSlalom has been doing events for customers to learn more about how to use agents to transform their organizations, talking to hundreds of customers a week. Mann hired up his team to number about 25 people to meet new demand.\n\n\u201cUs being able to build things as a trusted partner in that way and show up to our clients with our level of industry expertise is key,\u201d Mann said.\n\nThe AgentExchange helps bring enterprise-level trust to the agent era, Alice Steinglass, Salesforce\u2019s executive vice president and general manager for developer experience and AppExchange, told CRN in an interview.\n\nAI large language models (LLMs) \u201care fun\u2013everybody can play with them,\u201d Steinglass said. \u201cThe challenge is, how do I take that LLM and connect it to my data in a way that's secure and govern, where I have the right controls and permissions, and when that agent is using the data, they can access all the right data and only the right data. And I don't want to set that up with 5,000 agents separately.\u201d\n\nAll actions have passed a security review are backed by customer reviews, according to Salesforce.\n\nAgentExchange allows partners to sell four types of agentic building blocks. Actions are the jobs Agentforce agents can do, with flows and prompts allowing for industry-specific component tailoring. Topics focus and refine agent behavior, grouping actions and instruction around one task or job so that the agent follows guardrails and delivers consistent results.\n\nAnother building block is prompt templates, which leverage pre-written, reusable prompts for consistent interactions. These templates help agents gather information, assist users and achieve specific goals.\n\nThe fourth building block, agent templates, combines multiple topics and leverages partner-created actions to deliver an AI solution, with metadata and global instructions spanning topics, according to Salesforce.",

            "content": "The founder and CEO of IPO-bound fintech Klarna took to X to once again explain why his company ditched Salesforce\u2019s flagship CRM product about a year ago in favor of its own homegrown AI system.\n\nBut this time, Sebastian Siemiatkowski emphasized that he doesn\u2019t think others will \u2014 or should \u2014 follow his lead. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the end of Salesforce; might be the opposite,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe news that Klarna had developed its own in-house AI system based on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and that it dropped its contract for Salesforce CRM went viral in September. This came after Siemiatkowski spoke about dropping Salesforce during an investor call and discussed how its homegrown ChatGPT-powered customer service bot led to replacing 700 full-time contract employees and a savings of approximately $40 million annually.\n\nSalesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff then expressed skepticism about how, exactly, Klarna is managing its customer data and meeting its compliance needs. \u201cSuddenly, @Benioff was asked on stage why Klarna was leaving Salesforce. I was tremendously embarrassed,\u201d Siemiatkowski wrote.\n\nSo, as news circulates that the company could go public next month \u2014 meaning Klarna\u2019s confidential financial information should be made public soon \u2014 Siemiatkowski is clarifying.\n\nAs a fintech in a highly regulated industry, he doesn\u2019t want the public to think that Klarna is uploading all of its customers\u2019 data into OpenAI. Instead, he said on Monday that the project involved taking the data stored in the many SaaS systems Klarna was using \u2014 including Salesforce \u2014 and consolidating onto its own internally developed tech stack.\n\nWhile Siemiatkowski didn\u2019t detail exactly where Klarna moved all of this data, he did name Swedish company Neo4j and its graph database as a product Klarna is using.\n\n\u201cSo no, we did not replace SaaS with an LLM, and storing CRM data in an LLM would have its limitations. But we developed an internal tech stack, using Neo4j and other things, to start bringing data=knowledge together,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe allowed our internal AI to use this knowledge, and we realised with the help of @cursor_ai we could quickly deploy new interfaces and interactions with it,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis is all the latest iteration of an ancient debate when it comes to enterprise software: build it versus buy it.\n\nSiemiatkowski doesn\u2019t think most companies will opt to build their own next-generation AI-centric software.\n\nBut he still thinks that the SaaS industry is heading for major consolidation. \u201cWill all companies do what Klarna does? I doubt it. On the contrary, much more likely is that we will see fewer SaaS consolidate the market, and they will do what we do and offer it to others,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNote: This story was updated to include a description of the OpenAI customer service bot project.",

            "content": "Salesforce is fundamentally changing its go-to-market strategy by moving from individually positioned applications to a comprehensive suite approach. This shift emphasizes the strength of their platform, highlighting the various applications and the integrations between them.\n\nSalesforce has a broad portfolio of applications that are all available separately. The products can operate independently or through integration with each other. Salesforce initiated the unified strategy years ago aiming to make their products more intertwined and collaborative. Soon, customers will experience this suite approach more prominently, with access to basic versions of all applications under a single Salesforce suite. If customers find value in specific applications, they can extend functionality through different licenses.\n\nSalesforce core platform\n\nSalesforce now thinks and operates much more from the Salesforce core platform. That is the platform on which most applications are based.\n\nHistorically, Salesforce built a portfolio through development and acquisitions. It then used the MuleSoft layout to facilitate integration between applications. That worked well for a while, but does not provide the uniformity, integrations and data quality that organizations need today, let alone for the proper deployment of AI.\n\nThe Salesforce core platform was developed to address these challenges. Sales Cloud and Service Cloud were the first applications based on this platform, followed by other clouds being redeveloped on the same foundation. During Dreamforce, the company announced that versions of Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, and Tableau are now available on this core platform, making it significantly easier for organizations to combine and utilize data across different applications.\n\nNo migrations imminent, but a gradual transition\n\nCurrent Marketing Cloud or Commerce Cloud customers may not have noticed these changes, as they currently apply only to new customers. Eventually, all customers will gain access to the new marketing, commerce, and Tableau applications.\n\nBecause the existing marketing, commerce and Tableau solutions are very comprehensive, completely replacing and migrating them is out of the question for now. Salesforce is opting for a transition transition, with more and more functionality becoming available in the new applications over time. By also significantly improving the user experience in the new applications, customers will increasingly use the new applications. The idea is that in this way, organizations will slowly move the work themselves to the new applications.\n\nWhether this approach will succeed remains uncertain. While it\u2019s understandable that a fully-developed marketing solution cannot be easily replaced with a completely redeveloped solution using a different data stack, having users switch between old and new applications may not be ideal.\n\nNew vs old\n\nWe have watched some demos of old and new applications, and we do see the added value of the newly developed solutions. The user experience is faster, more intuitive, and significantly more user-friendly. This is mainly due to the direct integration with the Data Cloud and other Salesforce solutions. For example, users can make data selections directly from the marketing solution due to improved integration, whereas legacy solutions only allow selection of pre-prepared target groups from Data Cloud.\n\nHowever, in our conversations with Salesforce, it appears that the new Marketing, Commerce and Tableau solutions cannot yet measure up to their predecessors, which simply have many more features. The 2024 versions are more suitable for SMBs than enterprise organizations. Salesforce\u2019s marketing offering is currently based on two software solutions that it has adopted and developed over the years, namely ExactTarget and Pardot. Pardot\u2019s features are already reasonably reflected in the new solutions. But ExactTarget matching in terms of feature set still needs some more time.\n\nIn the near future, however, we will see more and more features becoming available in the new applications. Enterprises will also gradually start using the new applications more and more. The challenge of transferring existing data and workflows without migration tools remains significant. As the new solutions mature, they may be able to automatically take over more tasks, potentially accelerating the transition.\n\nThe word migration is currently something Salesforce is trying to avoid. They see it primarily as a natural transition over several years, with customers moving more and more things on their own. Whether it will work that way, or whether we will be talking about migration in a year or so anyway, the future will have to tell.\n\nTaking a suite approach with the core platform\n\nPreviously, Salesforce sold customers only the Sales Cloud, for example. Customers only had access to the Sales Cloud through their Pro or Enterprise license. If they wanted to work with other Salesforce products, licenses also had to be purchased.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change. Salesforce has developed a new SME portfolio with the introduction of the Salesforce Starter Suite and Salesforce Pro Suite. These SMB products are stripped-down versions of the Enterprise editions. For many smaller customers, this is just enough; others can expand their licenses modularly.\n\nFor existing Salesforce Professional and Enterprise customers, the Salesforce Starter Suite will be available free of charge for all Salesforce products, in addition to their existing Professional or Enterprise license on a particular Cloud application. This will allow customers who only use Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Marketing Cloud, for example, to also use the other Salesforce products for free. This gives access to a limited feature set, but it is sufficient for small operations and a good way to get acquainted with more Salesforce products.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a freemium model through which Salesforce is trying to get customers to use the entire platform of Salesforce products more. As a result, that customer ends up buying more licenses for various other products so that they can use the more advanced features as well.\n\nSalesforce also for SMEs?\n\nSalesforce now also has a clearer proposition for SMEs. These are the familiar Salesforce products, but with a limited feature set. Whether Salesforce is thus really suitable for SMEs or whether it is more a means to get customers excited about the products and eventually convert them to a more expensive Professional or Enterprise license is hard to say. Ultimately, it very much depends on what the customer wants and needs. If the customer cannot settle for the features offered but still wants more,it will have to pay.\n\nIn European countries, the SME offering will only really become available soon. In other countries, it has been available for a while, and we understand from Salesforce that the company is signing up a lot of SMEs there who are opting for these cheaper licenses.\n\nBest-of-suite is the future; SME possibly the next growth opportunity\n\nSalesforce\u2019s shift to a best-of-suite approach offers customers the opportunity to experience different solutions before committing financially. By integrating applications effectively, Salesforce creates a unique platform relevant to various business teams, addressing the challenges of expensive, complex, and time-consuming self-integration as organizations seek faster innovation.\n\nSalesforce is on the right track with its platform. In the coming years, we will see how the newer applications evolve. Finally, there is Salesforce\u2019s revamped SME strategy, which, on the one hand, warms up existing customers to new solutions and, on the other hand, offers huge growth potential.\n\nUltimately, there are far more SMEs worldwide than enterprise organizations. The revamped SME strategy not only introduces existing customers to new solutions but also offers significant growth potential in the much larger global SME market, where Salesforce has less penetration compared to enterprise organizations.\n\nTip!

(CRM) reigns as the premier provider of on-demand CRM software, revolutionizing sales, marketing, customer service, and custom application development. Boasting a market cap of $285 billion, it delivers a powerful technology platform that enables businesses and developers to craft and operate cutting-edge applications.\n\nCompanies worth $200 billion or more are generally classified as \u201cmega-cap stocks.\u201d Salesforce's market cap exceeds the mega-cap threshold, highlighting its size, stability, and influence in the tech sector. Acclaimed for its relentless innovation and commitment to excellence, Salesforce continually delivers state-of-the-art solutions, setting new benchmarks in customer relationship management. The company has transformed the CRM industry with its cloud-based platform, renowned for its affordability, seamless user experience, and exceptional versatility.\n\nActive Investor:\n\nThe software titan hit its 52-week high of $369 on Dec. 4 but has since pulled back 19.3% from that peak. Moreover, shares of Salesforce have dropped 9.8% over the past three months, compared to the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF\u2019s (IGV) 6.6% fall.\n\nDespite the short-term weakness, CRM has gained 15% over the last six months, though it has remained nearly flat over the past year. In comparison, IGV has risen 14.3% in six months and 14.1% over the past year.\n\nCRM has stayed above its 200-day moving average since the end of September but has been trading under its 50-day moving average since early February.\n\nOn Feb. 26, Salesforce reported its fourth-quarter earnings, prompting a 4% drop in its stock the following trading session. While the adjusted EPS of $2.78 exceeded expectations of $2.60, revenue came in at $9.99 billion, which was below forecasts. Despite a 7.5% year-over-year sales increase and a 21.4% rise in adjusted EPS, weaker forward guidance dampened investor sentiment.\n\nThe company posted $900 million in AI and data cloud revenue, reflecting 120% growth. For fiscal 2025, Salesforce projects revenue between $40.5 billion and $40.9 billion, falling short of analysts' $41.4 billion estimate. It also expects a 34% adjusted operating margin and 10%-11% growth in operating cash flow. While the guidance leans conservative, the company's fundamentals remain strong.\n\nSalesforce has been outpacing its main competitor, Adobe Inc. (ADBE), with shares of ADBE plunging 20.5% over the past 52 weeks and down 21.8% over the past six months.\n\nGiven CRM\u2019s solid industry dominance, analysts are very optimistic about the stock\u2019s potential. The stock has a consensus rating of \u201cStrong Buy\u201d from 46 analysts covering it, and its mean price target of $390.53 implies a potential upswing of 31.1% from the prevailing price levels.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.58 per share, indicating a change of +5.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.12 points to a change of +9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.49 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

The company\u2019s AI solutions have already contributed to significant productivity gains and are anticipated to support further margin expansion in the coming fiscal year. The analyst also highlights the increasing adoption of Salesforce\u2019s multi-cloud offerings and the solid performance of its Industry Cloud, which collectively bolster the company\u2019s growth prospects. These factors underpin Saiyi He\u2019s confidence in maintaining a Buy rating for Salesforce\u2019s stock.\n\nIn another report released on February 27, Barclays also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $425.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) recently released its Q4 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal year ending in January), reporting sales of $9.99 billion and earnings per share of $2.78. While earnings surpassed consensus estimates of $2.61 per share, revenue fell short of the projected $10.04 billion. The revenue shortfall can be attributed to slower-than-expected adoption of its AI-powered, Agentforce platform. Furthermore, the company\u2019s forward-looking guidance did not meet market expectations, resulting in a decline in the stock price following the earnings announcement.\n\nCRM stock, with 17% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. But, if you want an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.\n\nHow Did Salesforce Fare In Q4?\n\nSalesforce\u2019s revenue of $9.9 billion in Q4 represents a 7.6% year-over-year growth. The company\u2019s current remaining performance obligations, which represent future revenue under contracts yet to be recognized, reached $30.2 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. Salesforce is seeing benefits from its AI system, Agentforce, and is continuously integrating AI capabilities across its offerings, leading to increased adoption. However, this adoption is growing at a slower pace than anticipated, as enterprises re-evaluate their spending in response to elevated interest rates and uncertain macroeconomic conditions.\n\nSalesforce not only achieved revenue growth in Q4, but also saw its adjusted operating margin increase by 170 basis points year-over-year to 33.1%. This combination of higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.78, representing a 21% year-over-year increase. Looking ahead to Q1, the company projects revenue between $9.71 billion and $9.76 billion, and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.53 to $2.55. These figures fall short of consensus estimates of $9.9 billion for revenue and $2.61 for earnings per share.\n\nWhat Does This Mean For CRM Stock?\n\nCRM stock is expected to trend lower following the downbeat performance and outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the changes in CRM stock have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 28% in 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could CRM face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Salesforce to reflect the latest results, there seems to be some room for growth from here.\n\nAt its current pre-market price near $295, CRM stock is trading at approximately 28x trailing earnings of $10.20 per share, below its two-year average P/E ratio of about 32x. While this valuation compression can be attributed to a conservative outlook and slow Agentforce adoption rates, we believe these concerns are already priced into the stock. Consequently, we see potential upside from the $295 level. Investors should also consider the company\u2019s improving profitability, which increased by 250 basis points in 2024, with management guiding for an additional 100 basis point improvement in 2025.\n\nWhile CRM may have some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Salesforce\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

            "content": "On Wednesday, Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) turned in solid results for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and issued conservative guidance as it looks toward agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to be its next big growth driver. With agentic AI, software bots (the \"agents\") can autonomously go out and complete tasks on your behalf with little human intervention. That developing technology is viewed as being the next big evolutionary stage of the AI revolution.\n\nHowever, Salesforce stock has gotten off to a tough start to the year. It's down about 10% in 2025 as of this writing, and nearly flat over the past 12 months.\n\nSo what do the software-as-as-service (SaaS) company's most recent results suggest about the possibility that the stock can rebound?\n\nAgentic AI\n\nSalesforce is plowing forward with agentic AI through its Agentforce offering, which it introduced back in October. The AI agent solution has seen quick uptake among customers, with the company saying it had closed 5,000 Agentforce deals, including 3,000 paid deals, as of the end of the fiscal quarter on Jan. 31. That was up from the 1,000 deals the company boasted about in a mid-December update.\n\nThrough Agentforce, Salesforce provides its customers with a variety of out-of-the-box AI agents that can handle specific tasks in such areas as customer service, human resources, and technical support. Customers can also use low-code and no-code tools within the platform to create and customize their own AI agents. The company has said if you can describe a task, Agentforce can build an agent to handle it.\n\nSalesforce created Agentforce to help augment the human labor force and increase workers' productivity and efficiency. It's a consumption-based product that costs $2 per interaction.\n\nThe company is also leaning into its partnership network. Management says half of its Agentforce sales and 70% of Agentforce activations have come from its partner ecosystem. It noted that it has 127,000 system-integrated employees trained on Agentforce and more than 1,000 technology partners building and selling agents. It noted that customers can now use Agentforce with Alphabet's Gemini, and its multimodal models and be deployed on Google Cloud. It also noted that Amazon has helped it close a number of large deals.\n\nAs for the fiscal quarter itself, Salesforce's revenue increased by 8% year over year to $10 billion, which was right at the midpoint of its guidance range of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. Subscription and support revenue also rose by 8% to $9.45 billion.\n\nMulesoft revenue jumped 7%, while Slack revenue climbed by 11%. That was an acceleration in growth for both compared to fiscal Q3. Tableau revenue, meanwhile, edged up by 3%.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 21% to $2.78. The company also generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.\n\nSalesforce's current remaining performance obligations (cRPOs) increased by 10% year over year to $30.2 billion. This is a common metric used by SaaS companies to describe their revenue outlooks.\n\nSalesforce forecast that in fiscal 2026, its revenue would grow by 7% to 8%, to a range of $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion, with adjusted EPS of between $11.09 to $11.17. Management also expects subscription and support revenue to grow by about 8.5%. For the fiscal first quarter, it projected that its revenue would grow by between 6% to 7% year over year.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2026 Q1 Guidance Fiscal 2026 Guidance Revenue $9.71 billion to $9.76 billion $40.5 billion to $40.9 billion Revenue growth 6% to 7% 7% to 8% Adjusted EPS $2.53 to $2.55 $11.09 to $11.17\n\nCan Salesforce's stock rebound?\n\nSalesforce trades at a forward price-to-sales multiple of under 7 based on analysts' estimates for its fiscal 2026, while its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is under 27, and its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 0.5. A positive PEG ratio below 1 is typically considered to reflect an undervalued stock.\n\nThat's an attractive valuation if the Agentforce platform can help accelerate the company's revenue growth. As a consumption platform meant to drive cost savings and improve productivity for its users, the opportunity for the product is enormous. Meanwhile, Salesforce's guidance looks conservative; the company has a good chance of beating and raising it throughout the year. That sets the stock up well for the rest of the year.\n\nI would jump on this leading AI SaaS name, given its valuation and the opportunity it has in front of it.",

From brainstorming with peers to indulging in sweet treats, here\u2019s a fun roundup of the Agentforce highlights, and four of the coolest things we checked out at the event!\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wished you could have a one-on-one with someone who\u2019s really in the know, Braindates at Agentforce were your golden ticket. Imagine this: you log into the Braindate platform, see a topic that sparks your interest, and instantly connect with a fellow Trailblazer. The best part? You get to choose your conversation topics, and it\u2019s all about peer-driven learning, solving challenges, and sharing expertise.\n\nBraindates aren\u2019t just about theory, though \u2013 they\u2019re about making genuine connections. Whether you\u2019re keen to brainstorm new ideas or solve tricky problems, these 30-minute conversations could supercharge your Salesforce journey. Plus, you\u2019ll find a Braindate Lounge at the event where the magic happens, with a Learning Concierge to assist in setting up your next exciting chat. With no shortage of experts and thought leaders, this was the ultimate way to learn and network.\n\n2. Build your own agent: DIY AI fun\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a hands-on experience, especially when it involves creating your very own AI agent? The \u201ccampground\u201d at Agentforce was where the magic truly happened. This sensory overload of interactive experiences offered live demos, consultations with Salesforce experts, and the chance to build an AI agent in less than 20 minutes \u2013 now that\u2019s cool!\n\nAI agents are pretty amazing, and understanding how they can help businesses is a game-changer. These agents, which can range from assistive (helping employees with tasks) to autonomous (responding to customer inquiries without human intervention), were a major focus. The coolest part? Attendees were taught how to build these agents using platforms like Agentforce. In a few easy steps, you could design an agent that learns from user interactions, automates tasks, and ultimately makes your life a whole lot easier. Plus, there were plenty of coffee breaks to fuel all that learning!\n\n3. A sweet Gelato Messina story\n\nWhat\u2019s better than indulging in gelato while soaking up cutting-edge business insights? The Gelato Messina truck was a standout feature, offering the perfect combination of treats and thought-provoking conversations. But it wasn\u2019t just about satisfying our sweet tooth. There was a huge takeaway from Gelato Messina\u2019s case study that was truly inspiring.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth from a single store in Darlinghurst to an international brand was a masterclass in scaling up with smart solutions. They shared how tools like Slack helped them communicate seamlessly and leverage tech for more meaningful customer relationships. It reminded everyone that tech isn\u2019t just about efficiency \u2013 it\u2019s about understanding your audience and connecting on a deeper level. Plus, the gelato? Absolutely top-notch.\n\n4. Nedd Brockman. More than a mullet!\n\nOne of the highlights of the day was hearing from Aussie ultramarathoner Nedd Brockmann. From running across Australia to raising millions for the homeless, his journey is one of resilience and purpose. Nedd\u2019s conversation with Sarah O\u2019Carroll, Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Australia, was a masterclass in motivation and grit.\n\nNedd shared his three-prong mantra: Live, Give, and Get Uncomfortable. His small daily choices\u2014like cold showers, avoiding takeaway coffee cups, and using the stairs\u2014helped him build the mental toughness required to run 100km a day during his Australia-wide marathon. But the big takeaway? The \u201cwhy\u201d behind a goal won\u2019t always get you through the tough times\u2014it\u2019s the \u201chow\u201d that counts. Sometimes, the key to success is committing to a decision and cutting off any other options. If you weren\u2019t inspired to smash your own limits after hearing Nedd\u2019s story, we\u2019d be surprised!",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe research preview of the latest GPT-4.5 model from ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been released. The preview, released for Pro users and developers worldwide, will also be expanded for access in the coming weeks. According to the company, it is their largest and best model for ChatGPT yet. It comes with an enhanced ability to recognize patterns, generate creative insights without reasoning, and also show greater emotional intelligence.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now\n\nThe company stated that early testing has shown that GPT-4.5 seems more natural. The model\u2019s broader knowledge base, enhanced ability to follow user intent, and greater \u201cEQ\u201d allow it to be better at writing, programming, and solving practical problems. The company also expects it to hallucinate less than other models.\n\nOpenAI is currently sharing the model as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. CEO Sam Altman has deemed it \"a giant, expensive model,\" revealing how the company ran out of GPU capacity to roll out to user tiers at the same time.\n\n\"We will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week ... this isn't how we want to operate, but it's hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages\u201d.\n\nTencent has also launched an AI model to compete in the AI race. According to Tencent, the model has the ability to answer queries faster than the famous DeepSeek's R1. Known as The Hunyuan Turbo S, the model can reply to queries within a second. This makes it unique from models such as the DeepSeek R1, Hunyuan T1, and other slow thinking models that need to 'think for a while before answering\u201d.\n\nTests have further shown how Turbo S' capabilities have matched DeepSeek-V3 in fields like knowledge, math, and reasoning. The company has also highlighted the usage costs of the new model are many times cheaper than its previous iterations, signifying how DeepSeek's open-source and low-pricing strategy has led other leading companies to follow suit.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).",

And January 2025 was Watershed's \"best month ever as a business\" regarding new revenue, Francis said. He did not disclose a figure.\n\nToday, Francis said his biggest competitors are Salesforce and Microsoft which also offer similar emissions-tracking services. He said his clients include 60 of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\"I feel like that's a problem we've earned our way into recently,\" he said.\n\nBusiness Insider visited Francis at Watershed's 23,000-square-foot office in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood, where his nearly 400 employees are encouraged to come into work.\n\nHe told BI he likes to operate in an \"old school\" way: in person, where people can freely exchange ideas in front of a whiteboard.\n\nFrancis shared how he first pitched his company to investors in 2019 and the challenges he navigates today.\n\nThe interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWas it hard getting companies onboard with Watershed in 2019?\n\nYeah, I mean, 2019 was in the first Trump administration.\n\nIt seemed no one had ever done this before \u2014 getting companies to spend money on software for climate. People had spent money on consultants, they'd spent money on [carbon] offsets. And I think that the mega trend that we are both riding and trying to accelerate is that climate is getting more and more in-the-money for companies.\n\nThat was the pitch at the time \u2014 there's money in pursuing climate initiatives.\n\nHonestly, the first slide of our sales deck was the same in 2019 as it is today. Literally the first slide of the sales deck. It looks better, it's been redesigned, but it still says: \"Software to measure, reduce, and report your carbon emissions, because climate action is good for your business.\"\n\nHere's the thing, I'll say January 2025 was our best month ever as a business.\n\nWhat do you think is happening there?\n\nI think that we are indexed to companies doing the work on climate, not indexed to companies talking publicly about their work on climate.\n\nWe see now that companies are behind the scenes. When you're an enterprise software, you kind of get to see the inside of organizations and whether they're thinking about this in a thoughtful way.\n\nThe companies are going about this with more organizational seriousness now than they did three years ago. They're saying much less about it, but the executive leader who's responsible has shifted from chief sustainability officer to the chief financial officer.\n\nWatershed office in San Francisco, California. Lloyd Lee\n\nWho are your competitors?\n\nMicrosoft and Salesforce. They have these modules. It's nice market validation that they think this is a big opportunity, but there's just a difference in product quality when it's the only thing you do.\n\nA Salesforce spokesperson told Business Insider in an email that sustainability management is \"fundamentally a data challenge\" that requires a unified platform. A Microsoft spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhat's the hardest thing right now?\n\nHonestly, I think it's pretty pedestrian: enterprise software challenges.\n\n\n\nHow do you make it a no-brainer for companies to buy a nice piece of software rather than a module from someone they've already purchased from?\n\nHow do you manage a growing team between San Francisco and London? Two years ago, Watershed was a hundred people, now it's 380 people.\n\nHow do you make sure you're delivering well for companies at the scale of Walmart who have enormous expectations about this sort of thing?\n\nHow many customers do you have now?\n\nI don't know that we've shared that publicly, but we have more than 500 clients now than the 5 clients we had when John Doerr [the Chair of Kleiner Perkins] joined us in 2021.\n\nWhat was your reaction when BlackRock \u2014 a Watershed client with $11.6 trillion in assets under management \u2014 pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative?\n\nWe work with a pretty broad set of the financial sector and I will say that they are doing the work with more seriousness today than when we started working with them.\n\nAnd so I think there just is this talk-action ratio thing, where a bunch of companies around the Glasgow climate conference came out with huge press releases with big bold claims and had not really figured out the data yet.\n\nToday, you see the pullback on the pledges, and companies \u2014 behind the scenes \u2014 know what they're doing. They've got the initiatives that they're prioritizing. So I think the talk-action ratio has flipped.\n\nIs it a good time for climate action in the world right now? No. Obviously the policy pendulum matters and the policy pendulum is not swinging in the right direction. But \u2014 behind the scenes with companies \u2014 I think people are doing more, even though they're talking less.",

            "content": "The spate of layoffs in the tech sector galloped to new heights in February, which seems to be one of the worst months in the last six months for tech professionals. Meta, HP, and Workday were some big names to axe a massive chunk of their workforce.\n\nFebruary saw 46 companies lay off 15,994 employees, according to layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. When compared to January, layoffs surged in February, resulting in a staggering 184 per cent increase in the number of affected employees. Last month, 25 companies were reported to have fired 5641 of their employees.\n\nMeta\u2019s massive move\n\nAt the beginning of the month, it was reported that Meta is conducting layoffs that could impact around 5 per cent of its workforce, which is about 3,600 employees. These layoffs have been described as \u2018performance-based cuts,\u2019 and they began on February 10 with notifications planned to be delivered throughout the following week.\n\nEarlier in January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had informed his staff that he planned to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. \u201cWe typically manage out people who aren\u2019t meeting expectations over the course of a year,\u201d he stated in an internal memo, but added, \u201cNow we\u2019re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.\u201d However, following the announcement, it was reported that some employees with strong performance reviews were also affected.\n\nHP axes over 2000 jobs\n\nOn February 27, tech giant HP announced that it was going to cut up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring plan. Reportedly, the company currently has a strength of around 58,000 workers across 59 countries. The company is hoping to save about $300 million by the end of October 2025 with the cuts. However, the company may reportedly also incur about $150 million in restructuring costs. HP had introduced its restructuring plan named \u2018Future Now\u2019 in November 2022 with a goal of cutting 7,000 jobs. With the fresh round of layoffs, the total number under the plan would come to 9,000. With the latest job cuts, the tech giant expects to save $1.9 billion through the plan, with a total restructuring cost of about $1.2 billion. All of this comes after the company saw stronger financial gains in the first quarter. The company reportedly saw increased demand for AI-powered PCs.\n\nMore layoffs\n\nBeyond Meta and HP, companies like Salesforce, Workday, and Autodesk handed the pink slip to a sizable chunk of their workforce. On February 4, it was reported that Salesforce will be cutting over 1,000 jobs from various departments as it was restructuring to prioritise its AI initiatives. This also comes at a time when the company was on a hiring spree for sales roles to meet the needs of their primary AI offering\u2014Agentforce. Similarly, Workday laid off 1,750 of its staff, which is about 8.5 per cent of its workforce. The company reportedly cited its plans to invest in AI, global expansion, and office space reductions. Later in February, Autodesk announced a 9 per cent work force reduction, which would likely impact 1,350 employees as part of its strategy to focus on core business areas, including AI.\n\nWhy are big tech companies laying off staff?\n\nBased on a broader view, there are numerous factors that drove the mass layoffs in February 2025. Uncertainty about the future of the economy has been a persisting concern, coupled with rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. These aspects have been pushing businesses to reassess their financial strategies. Most companies have cited economic volatility as a major driver for their cost-cutting initiatives. Also, overhiring during the pandemic has left many organisations overstaffed, prompting them to reduce unnecessary roles amid a decline in revenues.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAnother major factor is the increasing adoption of AI solutions rendering many jobs redundant, especially the likes of customer service, HR, marketing roles, etc. In some cases, mergers and acquisitions have also forced companies to restructure, resulting in overlapping roles and further job cuts. Waning investor confidence is also a reason, as many companies are facing stock price declines due to lower-than-expected revenue projects. This has pushed many companies to cut costs to maintain their profitability.\n\nWhen compared, January saw significant job cuts, although fewer than February. Major layoffs in January included Amazon, which carried out large-scale layoffs, though the exact number was undisclosed. January\u2019s layoffs were seen in sectors like e-commerce, finance, and tech media, reflecting continued adjustments following the holiday season. On the other hand, December 2024 reported a slightly different pattern, with layoffs in aerospace, finance, and energy sectors. Lilium, an aerospace company, laid off 1,000 employees, effectively cutting its entire workforce. The trend in December suggested an industry-wide shift toward downsizing, anticipating economic challenges in early 2025.\n\nFor now, there seems to be no slowing down for layoffs. However, some analysts have predicted the layoff wave could slow down by mid-2025; some believe continued economic uncertainty may spell more job cuts. With businesses increasingly adapting to changing market conditions, the workforce will need to stay agile.",

The tech giant is also partnering with healthcare technology company Athenahealth to streamline workflows, such as summarizing patient histories and processing prescription refills.\n\nAmit Khanna, senior vice president and general manager of Salesforce, sat down with MobiHealthNews to discuss the making of Agentforce for Health and highlight what its partnership with Athenahealth will offer clinical teams.\n\nMobiHealthNews: Can you tell me about Agentforce for Health?\n\nAmit Khanna: We are bringing a library of agents, as we call it Agentforce for Health agents, and it is a set of topics and actions that improve efficiencies in healthcare. So, whether you look at access to care, appointment booking, benefits or verifications, things that take time but ultimately do not give time for the provider or the care teams to be in front of the patient, but need to be done.\n\nSo, making sure we simplify and make those processes efficient through our Agentforce platform. So, bringing Agentforce for Health is the one big piece that we are doing, which includes this, plus life sciences auto-matching of patients to clinical trials and also in public health space with home health, where we see, if you look at areas outside U.S., also in home health, they get funding from the government, and they need to find services, and this is a very manual process today. So, we are automating that with Agentforce.\n\nMHN: What are the partnerships Salesforce is announcing?\n\nKhanna: We are announcing three main partnerships. One is with Athenahealth, which is a big EMR in the outpatient space. So, we will bring Athenahealth and Salesforce's Agentforce together in simple scenarios like patient visit summaries.\n\nIf you look at Athenahealth, there could be a big discharge summary, and now with Agentforce, with one click, when the member calls, the patient calls to the call center, we can have a summary right in front of the agent, without their doing swivel chair trying to find out what happened. It gives similarly missed appointments, care gaps, and everything we can connect to Athenahealth, and brings it up front in the call center when you call your provider.\n\nSo, it might be your calling for, \"Hey, can I do a prescription refill?\" Today, you have to swivel a chair, but now, with Salesforce Agentforce, we can just on the Agentforce window, say, order a refill, and with our partnership with Athena, it will land in Athena as a pharmacy order. If Athena queue is a yes, it can be auto-approved, and it will land at their nearest pharmacy, which is preferred by the patient. So that's the level of integration we are doing with Athena.\n\nMHN: Salesforce works a lot in healthcare. How does Agentforce enhance its work in the sector?\n\nKhanna: I would like to first give a difference of generic LLMs. So, as you know, the whole world is about hype with LLM, and AIs will solve the problems. So, yes, we do agree to that, but also AI should be in the flow of work, which is where we come into play. If you look at most of our health plans in the U.S., most of our providers in the U.S. run Salesforce, for example, in a call center.\n\nNow, how can agents or AI help? That's where we are bringing these two things together \u2013 flow of work, understanding of the business process, which we know of as the workflows, and making sure your generative AI is trusted, is bound by the data that you know of and is not giving answers from the internet, basically.\n\nSo, today, if you are, let's say, a health plan that serves members at risk, normally, what you will do is, once they're discharged from the hospital, you will call them and do an assessment. \"How is your health? How was your experience?\" Med management, reconciling meds. Before you do that work, normally, these care managers have to get an insight into what happened. Let's say, if it's me, what is my medical history? I was in the hospital. Am I living alone, or am I with family? So, they try to gather this information, which today takes approximately six minutes to prepare for that call.\n\nNow, imagine a world in which an agent sitting right in that call center application and a human can click and say, summarize Amit's past medical history. Thirty seconds, it goes into Salesforce, it goes into Athenahealth, gets that information, summarizes it, and without doing any clicks, swivel chair, you have a nice summary that you can read. At best, this work will take you one-and-a-half minutes, compared to six to seven minutes. So, for every call, you have saved five minutes. That's the place we are going towards.\n\nMHN: How do you ensure that AI hallucinations are not present within these summarizations?\n\nKhanna: I'll give you exactly how we make it happen. So, in the patient summarization, we are not asking the agent or the AI to randomly pick up content and then summarize it. We are actually guarding it and telling what we call topics and actions, saying when you have this topic of patient summary, you will only do these three actions. You don't have to think. So, we are removing from the AI, the thinking part of what actions I need to take, and we are also grounding it with the data that it should have access to.\n\nSo we are applying the security and sharing rights that Salesforce is known for, and then we allow the agent to go into those datasets with that trust, bring that information back, and when we send it to an LLM model, we actually remove your PHI [protected health information] to create that summary.\n\nLastly, which is very important, we are not doing it without a human in the loop because it's new technology. There will be places where it might hallucinate, even after all the effort we have put in, so we get the summary, but we also have the human so that a human can verify that yes, it is correct, and they don't give the wrong advice and they can have a feedback loop, which says, \"Yes, this is okay\" or \"This is not okay.\" So, yes, we are also learning, but we are putting a lot of safeguards in place to make sure we don't create challenges for our patients and members.",

Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce, Data Cloud, and Customer 360 Apps will also run on Google Cloud infrastructure, with access to new regions and procurement through the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nNo Jitter asked Pri Rathnayake, a Senior Director Analyst in Gartner Research, about the implications of this expanded partnership particularly given Salesforce\u2019s Agentic AI push with Agentforce and the various statements it has made around AI agents becoming a digital labor force that can augment, supplement and potentially replace human agents.\n\nNo Jitter: Can you provide some context for this deal?\n\nPri Rathnayake (Rathnayake): The Salesforce and Google strategic partnership expansion announcement vis-a-vis the contact center space should be viewed against the backdrop of an ongoing convergence in two of the adjacent CX tech market segments \u2013 CCaaS and CRM Customer Engagement Center (CRM-CEC). In recent months we have seen this convergence beginning to accelerate, with several players announcing new and expanding strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\n\nAmong the partnerships, three were noteworthy:\n\nSalesforce Service Cloud (CRM-CEC) and Genesys Cloud CX (CCaaS),\n\nServiceNow CSM (CRM-CEC) and Genesys Cloud CX (CCaaS),\n\nSalesforce Service Cloud (CRM-CEC) and Amazon Connect (CCaaS).\n\nIn this same period, Zendesk (CRM-CEC) just announced the proposed acquisition of Local Measure, a CCaaS provider. There have been other similar partnerships that did not attract the same level of attention from the market for different reasons.\n\nAmong other major developments, Microsoft earlier announced the launch of MS Dynamics365 Contact Center, which natively expands its Dynamics365 Customer Service (CRM-CEC) into the CCaaS space.\n\nThere are two key drivers at the core of these partnerships, acquisitions, and product launches:\n\nThe need to transparently blend voice and digital interaction data in real time to power AI-driven customer engagement. To bring the (external) customer interactions, and the (internal) process orchestrations/automations to a unified environment to frictionlessly deliver automated customer outcomes.\n\nNJ: Is this a push by Salesforce into the broader CCaaS space?\n\nRathnayake: The key strength of CCaaS providers is in managing the external customer interaction, and the longstanding Salesforce partnership with AWS's Amazon Connect, and more recent integration with Genesys Cloud CX, already gave Service Cloud an edge when competing against other CRM-CEC players that didn't have strong voice-routing integration.\n\nThis latest announcement is a further expansion of that advantage to offer buyers that are currently in GCP and Google CCAIP environments for their cloud infrastructure and voice-interaction management. Rather than being a foray into the broader CCaaS space, we interpret this as Salesforce staking a firmer claim to their place in an emerging converged CRM-CEC and CCaaS market.\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: CCAIP is Google\u2019s Contact Center AI Platform. In September 2024, Google launched the Google Customer Engagement Suite, which combines the features of CCAIP with Google\u2019s generative AI technology.)\n\nNJ: What\u2019s the implication for established contact center and CCaaS vendors?\n\nRathnayake: The two key drivers of the convergence motion I discussed above have broad implications for all CCaaS vendors: they must start adding those capabilities to their portfolios, be that through partnerships, acquisitions or natively engineered functionality extensions.\n\nNJ: Any insight into whether Agentforce agents are living up to the hype?\n\nRathnayake: It's too early to comment on Agentforce (and other competitive AI agent products) as most enterprises are still in limited pilots and POCs. We are monitoring the adoption efforts, successes, and failures being reported and will have more concrete data in the next few months.",

It was started in 1999 as a cloud computing and enterprise software company.\n\nSoftware is among the fastest-growing areas in the whole enterprise market, with global purchasing predicted to reach USD 856 billion by 2023.\n\nSalesforce played a significant role in making Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) available to the industry. It offers solutions for B2B, B2C, and B2B2C businesses.\n\nBy focusing on the cloud, customers can direct Salesforce in reducing expensive hardware, servers, and maintenance fees.\n\nSalesforce, meanwhile, has invested in becoming an AI company and launched the Einstein 1 Platform to merge data, AI, CRM, development, and security all within one system.\n\nSalesforce CRM services are offered through cloud-based products like Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud, Analytics Cloud, App Cloud, and IoT Cloud.\n\nThese products help businesses achieve smooth operations through the integration of customer interactions and data into one platform.\n\nMost of Salesforce\u2019s customers fall under different industries like professional services, manufacturing, and banking and financial services.\n\nIn 2013, Salesforce had around 22% of the global CRM market.\n\nSome of the main competitors for this company include SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft as well as small companies offering CRM solutions.\n\nInstead, most smaller businesses prefer different CRM software, which comes with fewer features and a more direct manner compared to Salesforce.\n\nAs CRM technologies evolve and become smarter in assisting businesses understand their clients, the demand for CRM software is expected to increase.\n\nSalesforce trades services alongside Accenture and IBM for the more sophisticated industry-specific solution-engineering process.\n\nSalesforce Revenue\n\n(Reference: backlinko.com)\n\nSalesforce statistics show that in 2024, Salesforce realized a revenue of USD 34.86 billion, up steadily from the previous year\u2019s USD 31.35 billion. It shows the ability of the company to open up new market areas as well as to offer new solutions.\n\nSuch growth has been regular throughout the years for Salesforce, whose revenues had increased to USD 26.49 billion by 2022, crossing USD 21.25 billion in 2021.\n\nThere was an outstanding jump in revenue in 2020, generating over USD 17.1 billion from sales, which improved from USD 13.28 billion in 2019 and over USD 10.54 billion in 2018. This particular time period would be marked as the actual growth period for Salesforce, largely by the efforts of acquisitions and increasing demand for cloud-based CRM solutions.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Salesforce\u2019s revenue had increased from USD 5.37 billion to USD 8.44 billion, thus suggesting the continuous heavy presence in the market of the CRM service provider. There was significant growth witnessed from 2010 to 2014 as its sales turnover amounted to USD 1.3 billion in 2010 and (eventually) to USD 4.07 billion by the end of 2014.\n\nIn 2009, the USD 748.7 million of revenue in 2008 jumped to USD 1 billion due to notable year-on-year growth. Growth in prior years included USD 497.1 million in 2007 and only USD 309.86 million in 2006.\n\nEarly 2000s indicated rapid growth by moving from USD 5.43 million in 2001 to USD 96.02 million in 2004, and over USD 176.37 million in 2005.\n\nThus, the Salesforce revenue story introduces a very long-term growth trend: from a modest USD 5.43 million in 2001, it grew to nearly USD 35 billion in 2024. This story is an example of its ability to control the CRM market and adjust, innovate, and invent business solutions for every world business need.\n\nSalesforce Total Return\n\n(Source: q4cdn.com)\n\nThe information regarding Salesforce statistics is supplied for the case study in which the assets return of Salesforce, Inc. versus the major market indices for the six years covering the period from January 31, 2019 to January 31, 2024 with the base value being USD 100 refers to a benchmark timeframe when return on investment fluctuates, indicating the change in investment.\n\nThe general picture was that Google\u2019s total return increased from USD 100 in 2019 to USD 185 in 2024. In 20 years, 2022, it was clear that the company\u2019s performance was quite progressive as it reached USD 153 until the onset of USD 2023, where it then tumbled to USD 111. However, there was an upward trend in 2024, which was as high as it had ever been.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index began at USD 100 in the year 2019, and it progressed to USD 119 in the year 2020, USD 137 in the year 2021 and registered its highest value at the point of USD 167 in 2022. It then dipped slightly to USD 151 in 2023 despite coming up afterwards to USD 179 in 2024.\n\nThe Nasdaq Computer Index seemed to outpace the other indices where the growth is concerned, starting at USD 100 in 2019 and taking off to USD 144 in 2020, USD 210 in 2021, and USD 264 in 2022.\n\nAfter a sharp fall in 2023 \u2013 it was USD 204, the value increased back up to a very impressive USD 317 in 2024.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index experienced significant growth as well, it appreciated from USD 100 during 2019 to USD 130 during 2020, then USD 187 during 2021 and peaked at USD 216 in 2022, finally it declined to USD 175 during 2023 but rose to USD 248 during 2024.\n\nThe performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the most stable in growth, experiencing an increase from USD 100 in 2019 to USD 113 in 2020 to USD 120 in 2021 and USD 141 in 2022. It even dipped back to USD 136 in 2023 before climbing to retrieve USD 153 during 2024.\n\nThe performance of Salesforce has been on the contrary, more dynamic as over the passage of time, there were several huge jumps followed by a downturn in 2023, and in 2024 again there was a strong jump.\n\nIt is important to note that it has surpassed the performance of S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average but trails behind the Nasdaq Computer and Nasdaq 100, which have exhibited more robust growth in recent years.\n\nSalesforce Net Income\n\n(Reference: statista.com)\n\nAccording to Salesforce statistics, in the year 2024, Salesforce declared a profit amounting to over USD 4 billion.\n\nDefinitely a huge amount of profit, but was not the same figure as the year before, thankfully due to changes in premium cost.\n\nHowever, there was still a significant increase in its profits in comparison to the company\u2019s financial year of 2020, which recorded USD 126 million in net profit.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that despite the decrease in Salesforce\u2019s net earnings relative to the previous year, the company\u2019s overall profitability stood strong in the long run.\n\nSalesforce Customer CRM Worldwide\n\n(Reference: statista.com)\n\nThis CRM of Customer Salesforce is used across different industries across the globe. Take, for instance, 16.7%. This is the share of non-profit organizations that states Salesforce as being instrumental in supporting mission-driven inputs.\n\nThat percentage is a little similar to the banking and financial services industry as well, with 16.7% using the solution because of the more tight regulations governing customer relationship management and compliance.\n\nTransportation is next, with 162.67%. This is the best single-well role of the CRM in logistics and fleet management for customer engagements.\n\nRetail ties some 16.7% of Salesforce users to CRM data management, personalized marketing, and omnichannel selling.\n\nThe field of recreation and leisure activities comes in at 162 or 7%, and that signifies customer management touch points, distributed and managed through CRM-loyalty programs, and operational efficiencies.\n\nYet overall, it is professional services which accounted for 16.7%.\n\nSalesforce Market Share\n\n(Reference: weblineindia.com)\n\nSalesforce statistics reveal that in the global CRM (customer relationship management) market, Salesforce is far ahead with its nearly 21.7% of the market while all other CRM in this sector hardly contain 10% market share.\n\nWhen it comes to ratios, Microsoft, which stands second, holds only 5.9%, which makes the difference between Salesforce and other key players very conspicuous.\n\nMore companies like Oracle also follow with a figure of 4.4% tied with nearly 3.5% from SAP. Still in the CRM space, Adobe takes only 3.4% of the market share.\n\nAll these firms capture much of the CRM activity, but Salesforce\u2019s share is more than the rest of the top 4 competitors combined.\n\nThis strong position underscores the continual expansion of Salesforce, the satisfaction of users as well as technological improvements, all of which together reinforce the stronghold Salesforce has in the CRM sector.\n\nSalesforce Revenue by Product\n\nIn the same year, Salesforce\u2019s principles go around sales and service.\n\nAs per Salesforce statistics from Q3 FY25, the sales services in this category \u2013 Sales Cloud internal revenue service, otherwise called other sales solutions, amounted to USD 6.19 billion.\n\nSlightly more fell within the customer support services income category \u2013 Service Cloud and related products in their offerings reporting between USD 6.2 billion give or take.\n\nThere was also an undisclosed figure realised from gizmos like the platform and any others, USD 5.3 billion.\n\nMore so marketing and similar services such as Commerce Cloud, Consumer Goods Cloud, and Marketing Cloud equally contributed more than half these revenues valued at USD 3.9 billion.\n\nWhereas the remaining money, USD 4 billion, was earned from Integration and analytics platforms like MuleSoft and Tableau.\n\nSuch findings draw attention to the increased variability in the product range, beset with every division contributing towards the overall financial performance.\n\nSalesforce Revenue By Segment\n\n(Reference: demandsage.com)\n\nAccording to Salesforce statistics, Revenue for Salesforce has grown, both with subscription and support services, but also professional services and other segments.\n\nA growth rate in revenue was recorded for the first 6 months of fiscal year 2025, which was registered at USD 17.35 billion and USD 1.11 billion from subscription and support services, and professional services, respectively.\n\nA review of the 2024 year in perspective of the full year found that the revenue of the company had increased with subscription and support services making USD 32.54 billion and USD 2.32 billion made from professional services. This underlines one of the key previous trends, that the subscription and support revenues have been increasing each year.\n\nIn the year preceding fiscal year 2022, these revenues were recorded as USD 19.98 billion, which had gone up from USD 24.66 billion in 2022 to stand at USD 29.02 billion in 2023.\n\nIn this respect, as an illustration, in 2024, the net sales were flat at USD 1.32 billion even though in 2023 it was close to USD 2.33 billion.\n\nSalesforce statistics state that the growth was higher as the revenues were in, 1.84 billion in 2022, 1.28 in 2021 and 1.05 billion in 2020, But ten years ago, in 2015, the revenue collection from professional services and other sources was just at USD 359.82 million, which was extremely high compared to the times back four decades to the last years.\n\nConclusively, overlay of Salesforce\u2019s revenue trajectory in the form of a timeline shows the domination of the company in the market and its future hopeful trajectory.\n\nThe company\u2019s success in recent years is largely attributed to the use of subscription-based business models, which allow for stable financial performance.\n\nBy contrast, there has also been a similar performance by way of professional services and other segments towards boosting the overall revenue of the company.\n\nSalesforce Statistics By Region\n\n(Reference: demandsage.com)\n\nRecent Salesforce statistics relating to the company\u2019s income pertains to revenue generation in different geographical regions, which registers consistent growth in the past fiscal years.\n\nIn the year 2024, the Americas region registered the highest revenue generated, standing at USD 23.29 billion aggregate, followed by the Europe region with USD 8.13 billion and the Asia-Pacific region to be the least at USD 3.44 billion.\n\nThe reason why this rise in the Americas could be significant to Salesforce is the huge volumes of its clients from this region.\n\nComparing annual figures to what had been before the Americas have registered an impressive recovery having increased from USD 6.22 billion in 2017 to over USD 23 billion in 2024.\n\nThus the steep rise in the revenue signifies that Salesforce has attracted new clients and expanded its products in that region. The same is also evident in the European region, where the revenue has grown from USD 1.37 billion in 2017 to USD 8.13 billion in 2024.\n\nThe same increase can be observed in the Asia Pacific region, which, being the least revenue earner, grew by USD 793 million in 2017 to USD 3.44 billion in 2024.\n\nTaking further data regarding the annual changes into account, it can be said that in all regions, especially the Asia-Pacific, has the highest rates of revenue.\n\nAmong all years of analysis, in 2020 the America\u2019s Salesforce revenue was USD 12.05b and it increased to USD 14.73b in 2021, USD 17.98b in 2022, and USD 21b in 2023.\n\nIn 2020, the European market was worth USD 3.43 billion, and by 2024, the figure was in excess of USD 8 billion. The APAC market is booming, it would grow from USD 1.61 Billion to USD 3.44 Billion from 2020 to 2024.\n\nSalesforce Valuation\n\nAccording to Salesforce statistics, in 2024, Salesforce was likely to reach a market capitalisation of around USD 450.95 billion, a marginal increase from the preceding year.\n\nThe company had even reached a record in 2023 with a staggering rise in share price up to USD 4.66 billion or 109.81 percent more than 2022.\n\nIt was flattish growth against the -2.91% of 2022, which took the company\u2019s market cap down to USD 111.74 billion, but for the economic environment getting a little unfavourable, markets gyrating and all. In 2021, Salesforce\u2019s market value increased by 11.55%, closing the 2020 brackets at USD 422.58 billion.\n\nThe same year 2020 showed excellent performance where the market capitalisation reached 328.91 billion dollars, an increase of 28.89%, in contrast to the total sum of 255.0 billion from 2019.\n\nAn increase of 20.40 was observed in 2019 where the market cap came to USD 206.2 billion.\n\nThe rise is also reported in the previous years, with 41.0% posted in 2018 (USD 152.5 billion) and the most massive increase found in the highest version of 2017, which is a 65.9% leap (USD 91.3 billion) from the preceding year to USD 197.2 billion.\n\nThe more recent of these dates would demonstrate an increasing and decreasing period while analysing the poorer rates against previous data, as it shows a growing cycle before disturbances promoted by fiscal constraints or exogenous event forces and increases.\n\nConclusion\n\nSalesforce statistics revealed that Salesforce\u2019s end-of-year performance is key to its existence as a correlating and rivalry company at stake. Its revenue diversification, high correlation to market and redevelopment in AI and in foreign markets are strengths to the emerging company to spur fast growth in its operations.\n\nThere will be distant and worrisome challenges such as poor implementation of new technologies and external economic situations that will still be present, but that much better than before, obviously allows the company to commendably counter its performance in the future.\n\nShared On:\n\n\n\nFAQ .

            "content": "Salesforce\u2019s NYSE: CRM stock price can rebound to new highs in 2025 because its growth trajectory is solid and its valuation is low. The price tag seems fair at roughly 28x the 2026 outlook, but this fails to price in the growth expected by 2030. The company is forecasted to sustain a low-double-digit earnings growth pace that puts the value closer to 18x by 2030, and forecasts are likely low.\n\nSalesforce Today CRM Salesforce $279.76 +8.02 (+2.95%) 52-Week Range $212.00 \u25bc $369.00 Dividend Yield 0.57% P/E Ratio 46.01 Price Target $365.62 Add to Watchlist\n\nWhile the Q4 results were tepid relative to the analysts' revenue forecasts, the margin was much better than expected, driving leveraged growth, bottom-line outperformance, and an improved outlook for future profitability.\n\nGet Salesforce alerts: Sign Up\n\nCritical details from Salesforce\u2019s Q4 and 2024 report include strength in the new Data Cloud and Agentforce segments. Strength was driven by growth in large clients and cross-selling, with the 10 most significant wins being signed on for both services.\n\nThe takeaway is that businesses are leaning more heavily on data-driven insight and AI automation, the two things at which Salesforce excels. The advantage Salesforce gives to its clients is the ability to leverage data-driven insight and apply it using real-time, comprehensive customer information to deliver automated, personalized service across networks.\n\nSalesforce Falls on Tepid Guidance: Analyst Says Guidance Likely Cautious\n\nSalesforce had a mixed quarter and issued tepid guidance, but the news is not bad. The company grew revenue by 7.5% to $9.99 billion and missed the consensus by only $50 million. The growth was driven by subscription and support revenue stream, with strength in both operating platforms. More importantly, the company widened its margin and provided leveraged bottom-line growth, outperforming MarketBeat\u2019s consensus despite the tepid top-line performance. Operating cash flow grew by 28% and free cash flow by 31% and is expected to remain solid in 2025.\n\nSalesforce Stock Forecast Today 12-Month Stock Price Forecast:\n\n$365.62\n\n30.69% Upside Moderate Buy\n\nBased on 41 Analyst Ratings Current Price $279.76 High Forecast $450.00 Average Forecast $365.62 Low Forecast $236.00 Salesforce Stock Forecast Details\n\nThe guidance is tepid relative to the consensus at the time of the release but no less strong. The company forecasts another year of 7% growth, a decent performance for a maturing tech company, and it tends to outperform its estimates.\n\nAdjusted operating margin is expected to widen, which is no reason to sell the stock, and operating cash flow should grow by 10% to 11% so that financial health will be sustained along with the capital return outlook.\n\nThe capital return isn\u2019t robust, but the low payout ratio and net yield, including buybacks, are offset by a robust outlook for distribution growth. The company\u2019s cash-flow positive business, earnings growth trajectory, and ultra-low 15% dividend distribution payout ratio have it set up to sustain annual distribution increases indefinitely at a higher-than-S&P 500 average.\n\nRepurchases are more robust and likely to be sustained at the current levels, sufficient to reduce the count by roughly 1% in F2025.\n\nAnalysts Trim Targets to Align With Consensus: 20% Upside Forecast for 2025\n\nThe analysts\u2019 response to Salesforce\u2019s guidance is mixed, resulting in numerous price target reductions. However, the reductions are narrowly centered on the consensus target, which forecasts a 20% upside for this stock.\n\nThe takeaway from the chatter is that Salesforce\u2019s AI strategy remains on track despite what is widely seen as cautious guidance. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cautions that Agentforce monetization is in the early stages, and the company is wise with its prudent approach to scaling.\n\nThe price action in Salesforce gapped lower after the 2025 guidance but has likely hit its bottom. The market rebounded from the early lows to form a bullish candle, showing buyers overtaking sellers with prices at such low levels. There is a risk that resistance will cap gains near $212, but if this market can get above it, then a move to retest the all-time highs is likely. If not, CRM shares could remain range-bound near current levels until later in the year.\n\nBefore you consider Salesforce, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

Unlike chatbots or search engines, AI agents are proactive and don\u2019t need continual human oversight. They can schedule meetings, execute trades, and even write code.\n\nBenioff added that Salesforce\u2019s mission is to become \u201cthe No. 1 digital labor provider, period\u201d to other companies.\n\nEverything you need to know to start your day.\n\nAI agents are one of the hottest technologies in Silicon Valley. Tech\u2019s biggest behemoths and scrappiest startups are racing to build sophisticated virtual employees.\n\nSalesforce, the leading maker of customer management software, launched Agentforce late last year, enabling companies to delegate responsibilities like handling customer cases and marketing campaigns to AI agents. Almost half the Fortune 100 companies use Salesforce\u2019s AI and Data Cloud products, Benioff said in the earnings call .\n\nBenioff is among the biggest evangelists of AI agents in Silicon Valley. He regularly tweets about the \u201ctrillion-dollar digital labor revolution.\u201d Since the beginning of the year, Benioff has tweeted and retweeted dozens of times about the company\u2019s agents.\n\n\u201cIn the past 90 days on our help service \u2026 Agentforce has managed 380,000 conversations with an 84% resolution rate,\u201d Benioff wrote Wednesday on X. \u201cThousands of Agents collaborate seamlessly with human counterparts, with only 2% of requests requiring human escalation.\u201d\n\nOn the earnings call, Benioff said Salesforce has closed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October and has never seen product growth at this level, calling the last three months the \u201cquarter of Agentforce.\u201d\n\nHe proudly touted Salesforce\u2019s agents while taking a dig at Microsoft, one of the company\u2019s main competitors and a favorite target. \u201cWhere are they delivering agents?\u201d Benioff asked. \u201cDo they have humans and agents working together to create customer success like us?\u201d\n\nOverall, the earnings call provided mixed results for the enterprise software giant, which missed analysts\u2019 expectations for revenues and earnings per share.

            "content": "Salesforce (CRM) stock fell Thursday after the enterprise software maker reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates while revenue slightly missed. Revenue guidance for fiscal 2026 also came in below expectations, despite the ramp of new artificial intelligence products.\n\nThe January-quarter Salesforce earnings report was released after the market close on Wednesday. Salesforce earnings rose 19% to $1.78 per share on an adjusted basis. Also, the San Francisco-based enterprise software firm said revenue climbed 10% to $9.9 billion.\n\nCRM stock analysts expected Salesforce to report earnings of $2.61 a share on sales of $10.04 billion.\n\nWhile AI initiatives are underway, revenue growth slowed for core products, noted Jefferies analyst Brent Till in a report. In Q4, \"Sales Cloud\" sales growth slowed to 9% year-over-year from 11% in the October quarter, while \"Service Cloud\" sales growth slowed to 9% from 10%.\n\nOn the stock market today, Salesforce stock fell about 3% to near 298.\n\nSalesforce Stock: Fiscal 2026 Guidance\n\nA key financial metric, current remaining performance obligations, known as CRPO bookings, edged by views. In Q4, CRPO rose 9% to $30.2 billion vs. estimates of $30.125 billion. CRPO bookings are an aggregate of deferred revenue and order backlog.\n\nFor full-year fiscal 2026, Salesforce said it expects revenue of $40.7 billion at the midpoint of guidance, up 7.5%, versus estimates of $41.39 billion, or 9% growth.\n\nThe software maker didn't provide a CRPO outlook for fiscal 2026.\n\nBefore the Salesforce earnings release, CRM stock was down about 7% so far this year.\n\nSome analysts expected conservative guidance amid management changes.\n\nIn January, Salesforce named Robin Washington as its new chief financial officer. Washington has been a member of Salesforce's board of directors since 2013. She had been CFO of Gilead Sciences (GILD) from 2008 to 2019.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Product Ramp\n\nSalesforce offers access to business software applications based on a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. In addition, the company has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce.\n\nAnalysts do not expect revenue growth related to artificial intelligence product upgrades to kick in until calendar 2026.\n\nFurther, Salesforce said it has closed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid Agentforce deals.\n\n\"The company expects Data Cloud to be a tailwind to fiscal 2026 subscription and support revenue growth, with Agentforce also contributing modestly to results and building throughout the year,\" said Terry Tillman, a Truist Securities analyst in a report. \"In fiscal 2027 we assume a more meaningful contribution from Agentforce in reported results.\"\n\nIn late 2024, Salesforce and other software makers began shifting marketing strategy away from generative AI \"copilots\" to autonomous, goal-driven AI \"agents.\"\n\nCopilots, basically conversational chatbot interfaces, aim to improve worker productivity but rely on human prompts. Agents execute multistep tasks on behalf of users by solving problems and taking action.\n\nSalesforce Stock Technical Ratings\n\nSalesforce is incorporating AI agent technology into its broad array of customer management, customer service and marketing automation products.\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, CRM stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D-minus. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSalesforce saw rising enterprise adoption of its AI offerings, company executives said Wednesday during an earnings call for the final quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31.\n\n\"This was the quarter of Agentforce,\" said CEO Marc Benioff , referring to the company's agentic AI offering and its 3,000 paying customers . Equinox, OpenTable and Jacuzzi are among the organizations leveraging Agentforce .\n\nThe company ended the year with $900 million in annual recurring revenue for its Data Cloud and AI segment, up nearly 120% year over year , said President and CFO Amy Weaver . The company reported $37.9 billion in earnings during the fiscal year.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSalesforce went all in on agentic AI last year, introducing a collection of agents in August to automate customer service tasks. Other IT vendors have also rolled out autonomous AI applications, including Microsoft, Google and ServiceNow.\n\nSince late October, the company signed 5,000 customers to use its Agentforce platform, with 3,000 of those paying customers.\n\n\"In Q4, we closed 25 transactions over $1 million, including three that were more than 10 million,\" said President and CFO Brian Millham during the Wednesday earnings call. \"We're starting off FY '26 in an incredible position with a highly accomplished and technical leadership team ready to guide us through this pivotal moment in AI and agents.\"\n\nIn December, the company announced plans to hire up to 2,000 sales workers to support AI tools, including Agentforce.\n\nAgentforce adoption is also driving expanded use of the rest of the Salesforce suite, according to Millham, a longtime executive who is set to retire in May.\n\n\"We are seeing this halo effect with our core technology,\" said Millham. \"It is making every single one of our core apps better as they deliver intelligence underpinning these applications.\"\n\nDespite early agentic AI wins across the provider landscape, enterprise leaders are grappling with governance and data readiness concerns before adopting agentic AI.",

The stock had run up 16% in the six months prior to the earnings release on optimism around the financial impact of Salesforce's new Agentforce technology.\n\nThe stock's after-hours slide quickened a bit when executives told analysts on the earnings call that Agentforce would have a \"modest\" contribution to revenue in 2025. A more \"meaningful\" contribution is forecast for 2026. A stronger US dollar is expected to weigh on sales by $200 million this year.\n\nSalesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told me the company could deliver upside on its operating margin guidance for this year. He noted the guidance for Agentforce is prudent given the company's recurring revenue model and it being the product's early days.\n\n\"We'll have a great year,\" Benioff said.\n\nSalesforce said it has closed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, more than 3,000 of which are paid. Annual recurring revenue from data cloud and artificial intelligence more than doubled year over year.\n\n\"Not a huge surprise to see a \u2018prudent\u2019 guide [guidance] given the imminent CFO transition and between F/X, leap year, and professional services weakness \u2014 bears can take a victory lap on the first quarter revenue guide,\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne wrote in a client note. \"But in general, we think the story remains more or less the same \u2014 namely that the key to 2025 for Salesforce is going to be showing accelerating growth over the year, increasing adoption of Agentforce and further upside to the operating margin guide.\"\n\nEarnings overview: Beats where it matters\n\nNet sales: $10 billion (+8% year over year) vs. $10.04 billion estimate (guidance: $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations: $30.2 billion (+9% year over year) vs. $30.12 billion estimate\n\nAdjusted operating margin: 33% (vs. 31.2% a year ago) vs. 32.8% estimate\n\nDiluted earnings per share: $2.78 (+21.4% year over year) vs. $2.61 estimate (guidance: $2.57 to $2.62)\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff speaks during Salesforce's Dreamforce on Sept. 17, 2024, in San Francisco, Calif.

            "content": "It was the moment during the Salesforce earnings call on Wednesday when the needle scratched across the record.\n\nAmy Weaver, Salesforce president and CFO, was talking about Agentforce and said:\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly excited about the customer momentum we are seeing. However, the adoption cycle is still early as we focus on deployment with our customers. As a result, we are assuming a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal \u201926. We expect the momentum to build throughout the year, driving a more meaningful contribution in fiscal \u201927.\u201d\n\nOverall, Salesforce earnings were a disappointment, as was the company\u2019s guidance for the 2026 fiscal year. And the markets are responding as markets do to such news \u2014 unkindly.\n\nHowever, the idea that Salesforce customers are uninterested in Agentforce doesn\u2019t hold water, at least not yet. There\u2019s a lot of work to do before businesses trust AI agents to talk to customers and supply employees with accurate information.\n\nFor Salesforce customers, that work is being done by Data Cloud.\n\nThe Salesforce earnings release did not show that its customers are shying away from Data Cloud or AI in general.\n\nData Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue were up 120% year-over-year to $900 million.\n\nNearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI and Data Cloud customers.\n\nAll of Salesforce\u2019s top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.\n\n5,000 Agentforce deals closed since October, and 3,000 were paid.\n\nIt\u2019s that last point that failed to live up to the hype.\n\nDig waaayy deeper: Ask our MarTechBot anything about Salesforce Agentforce\n\nAI agents using bad data is a bad idea\n\nAs you likely know, there are more than 14,000 martech tools on the market. As anyone I\u2019ve talked to in the last couple of months will tell you, the tools get a lot of attention, but I believe the data does all the work.\n\nWithout quality data, the tools just deliver junk. Feed them bad data, and they deliver more junk.\n\nNow imagine AI agents with access to bad data and little human oversight. Does this sound fun? No, it does not.\n\nLast week, I spoke to Gabrielle Tao, Salesforce\u2019s senior vice president of product management. Tao has a long history in the CDP space and currently works on Data Cloud at Salesforce.\n\nI asked how Salesforce customers and prospects are preparing their data for a world where AI agents can be trusted to do their thing.\n\nTao said many businesses she talks to have unified data. That\u2019s a good start.\n\n\u201cThe problem is actually their disconnect between their unified data and their front-end business user and applications,\u201d Tao said. \u201cA sales rep will never log into any back-end data warehouses where the unified data architecture is constructed. A marketing user creating a campaign will also never log into a data warehouse. So, how do you serve all of the greatness of the unified data to these business applications and users, and by extension, the agents? That unified meta-data-level connection is what Data Cloud provides.\u201d\n\nThis is a process for many organizations. And Salesforce was one of them.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s app for its Dreamforce conference back in September was a special-purpose, quick-start AI agent use case. It could tell users about sessions or where to grab some food, but beyond that, it didn\u2019t offer much. For example, you couldn\u2019t pepper it with questions about Data Cloud after viewing a session description.\n\nMoving beyond the quick-start use cases is a big step for many Salesforce customers.\n\n\u201cIn that next step, they realize, beyond that quick-start use case, that\u2019s when they need to bring their enterprise data to full bear, and that\u2019s when we have that middle layer, unified metadata, mapping, governance, augmented AI and analytics discussion,\u201d Tao said.\n\nI\u2019m not predicting Agentforce will be a goldmine for Salesforce or a bust, either. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the early innings, and there\u2019s a long way to go. But evidence that customers are investing in better data is a good start.\n\nDig deeper: What is Salesforce cooking up for marketers in its Spring 2025 release?",

The company will provide its over-a-quarter century expertise to the league\u2019s ticket sales force.\n\nWith Agentforce, AI agents will handle customer inquiries around frequent topics ranging from booking and product questions to stadium policies, freeing up the sales team to focus on more complex customer requests. Agentforce will also augment the fan experience, managing game-day inquiries related to ticketing, stadium policies, and parking, and providing instant, personalized, and consistent support across all channels, 24/7.\n\nFrom developing an easy-to-navigate landing page for the league\u2019s website, which will allow fans to ask the UFL's virtual agent \"Dash\" any game or gameday related question to expediting the ticketing sales process, Salesforce will work hands-on with the UFL\u2019s sales team to develop better skills and to enhance their impact on the UFL. This effort will include a special focus during the upcoming renewal season on addressing the specific needs of fans by offering them a more customized game experience.\n\nIn addition, throughout the upcoming 2025 season, Salesforce will partner with the UFL on a new pre-game feature on FOX which will break down the upcoming game based on player performance data as well as through the insights of the on-air talent before kickoff.The 2025 season will kick off on Friday, March 28, at 8 p.m. ET when FOX Sports debuts FOX UFL Friday \u2013 a new night dedicated to UFL action taking place each Friday during the 10-week regular season \u2013 with a matchup featuring the St. Louis Battlehawks against the Houston Roughnecks.

Welcome to Salesforce's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 results conference call. [Operator instructions] Also, this call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mike Spencer, executive vice president of finance and strategy and investor relations.\n\nSir, you may begin.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2025 fourth quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, president and chief financial officer; Brian Millham, president and chief operating officer. In addition, we also have Robin Washington, our board member and incoming chief operating and financial officer here with us today.\n\nAs a reminder, our commentary today will include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings materials and press release. Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\nA description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call to Marc.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, hey, thanks so much, Mike, and you know, I'm so excited about this call and reading the script with you because this was just the best quarter we've ever had. And I think you're going to see that as we kind of unfold what's happening here. And I'm sitting here with with Amy and Brian and Mike, and Sabastian is also on the table. And our new MOFO -- I mean, COFO, Robin Washington is here.\n\nSo, welcome, Robin. We're thrilled to have you here as well. And look, I'm really excited about this. I really think that we have something incredible to talk about.\n\nAnd obviously, this was the quarter of Agentforce. We're going to talk about that. But it was really just another incredible quarter. And really, it's been another incredible year of growth and innovation.\n\nI'm sure you all can see. We've had a really strong performance across all of our key metrics on revenue, on margin, EPS, cash flow, CRPO. We've passed some amazing milestones, including more than $60 billion in RPO. And this has been the highest cash flow in our company history.\n\nYou can see we exceeded our cash flow guidance. I think Amy did about 12.9 billion last quarter, but I think we delivered 13.1-ish. And that was just incredible for the quarter. And then, we're giving guidance.\n\nI think it's around 14.5 billion in guidance for next year on the cash flow guidance. So, just awesome cash production. Few enterprise software companies have really ever delivered these kind of numbers and, I guess, only a couple have ever delivered guidance in the 40 billions, which is where we are. And our two newest major products are Data Cloud and Agentforce.\n\nAI product line now, we can see, is a multi-billion dollar product line. So, we're excited to be, you know, in that kind of rarefied air of delivering a multi-billion dollar AI product line. We ended this year with 900 million in Data Cloud and AI ARR. It grew 120% year over year.\n\nWe've never seen products grow at these levels, especially Agentforce. And Data Cloud and AI Agentforce, this is now going to be incredible coming into fiscal year '26. As we begin this year and, well, since our founding, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead. It's -- this is a moment like we've just never seen before.\n\nAnd in just a few months, we've seen this addressable market go from hundreds of billions of dollars. And I'm sure you saw those ARC slides that got released over the weekend where she said that she thought this digital labor revolution, which is really kind of what we're in here now. This digital labor revolution, this looks like it's anywhere from a few trillion to 12 trillion. I mean, I kind of agree with her.\n\nI think this is much, much bigger than software. I mean for the last 25 years we've been doing, you know, software to help our customers manage their data. That's very exciting. I think building software that kind of prints and deploys digital workers is more exciting, and you're going to hear some of these incredible stories in a second.\n\nOur formula now really for our customers is this idea that we have these incredible Customer 360 apps. We have this incredible Data Cloud. You know, this -- this -- and this incredible agentic platform. These are the three layers.\n\nBut it's this -- that it is a deeply unified platform. It's a deeply unified platform. You know, it's just one piece of code. That's what makes it so unique in this market.\n\nAnd that is why customers are having so great success with it. It's not a collection of disjointed parts you have to kind of self-assemble, DIY it, you know, all kinds of how do you get the security running, how do you do this, how do you do that. It's this idea that it's a deeply unified platform with one piece of code all wrapped in a beautiful layer of trust. And that's what gives Agentforce this incredible accuracy that we're seeing.\n\nI'm going to talk about even what we've seen at Salesforce with that is amazing. And I'll tell you that our customers are just seeing some great success with it. And that's why just 90 days after it went live, we've already have 3,000 paying Agentforce customers who are experiencing unprecedented levels of productivity, efficiency, and cost savings. No one else is delivering at this level of capability, and we're really seeing a level of integration, simplicity, intelligence, power.\n\nI mean, customers are really telling us that we're light years ahead of other providers, and their feedback really speaks volumes. So, exciting to go on the web and see Agentforce delivering labor for companies like Equinox, OpenTable, Jacuzzi, and others. I mean, I go to their sites. I'm going to their, you know, to their X feeds, their, you know, social media presence, and you see Agentforce running.\n\nAnd look, a lot of other vendors are talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they've got this really running at scale. And as you're about to hear from Brian, we're seeing some amazing results on Salesforce as Customer Zero for Agentforce. Our digital labor force is resolving tens of thousands of customer service inquiries, you know, freeing our human employees to focus on the most nuanced issues and customer relationships. We're seeing tremendous momentum and success stories emerge as we execute our vision to make every company, every single company, every customer of ours an Agentforce company.\n\nThat is we want every customer to be an Agentforce customer. We want every trailblazer to be an agent blazer. And I want to share some of these amazing stories with you today. But first, let's hit a couple of these incredible numbers.\n\nWe closed out fiscal year '25 with 10 billion in revenue. That's amazing, our first 10 billion quarter. I remember, we had our first 10 billion year. Kind of amazing, 10 billion quarter, up 8% year over year, 9% in constant currency.\n\nAnd I think we even lost, Amy, is that right, like a couple hundred million dollars in foreign exchange for the year as well. In Q4, we closed more than 400 deals over a million. All of our top 10 wins included data and AI. Brian, 400 deals over $1 million? Pretty awesome.\n\nAnd we also continued phenomenal growth with Data Cloud this year, which is at the heart Agentforce. Data Cloud is the fuel that powers Agentforce and our customers are investing in it. And Data Cloud surpassed 50 trillion, that's trillion with a T, records, doubling year over year as customers increase their consumption and investment in our data platform. And that is just becoming critical and essential part of our solution.\n\nBecause as customers turn on AI and Agentforce, if they don't have the data -- we've been talking about this, I guess, for almost two years. If you don't have the data, you're not going to get the AI that you so badly want. And nearly, a quarter of those 50 trillion records, that's trillion with a T, were ingested from outside of Salesforce through our Zero Copy Partner Network, which is amazing. We'll see increased investments in software to build an agentic layer as AI continues to advance and handle a higher percentage of workloads, and we're taking advantage of the huge investments that these infrastructure companies.\n\nWe just -- you know, we'll work with -- of course, we have you know, two substrates, you know ,live, where we have Amazon, and we have Alibaba. You know, both companies are making huge investments in infrastructure. And the third one, Google is making a huge infrastructure investment. We're really getting great prices, you know, from these companies our deployment.\n\nOur ability to deploy at a really low cost is just awesome. And it's just driving down our cost for our customers, so that's so exciting. Look, for the full year, we delivered 37.9 billion in revenue, It's up 9% year over year. Operating cash flow reaching 13.1 billion, up 28% year over year.\n\nIt's really one of the best performances I think of any software company. And with our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, our non-GAAP operating margin closed at 33%. That was 250 basis points for fiscal year '25. I think it's 50 basis points higher than we even gave you guidance for a year ago.\n\nIs that right, Amy? Yeah. And that's awesome. But we also passed an incredible milestone with more than 60 billion in RPO. That, I don't think we could have expected.\n\nSo, this is -- this milestone isn't just a number. It's a clear signal that our customers are trusting us, deploying us, getting great value from us, and continuing to invest in our vision for digital labor. I mean, I think it's going to be that digital labor vision, that revelation that we're able to provide digital labor at scale with this trinity of apps, data, and agents that is going to drive this fiscal year '26 success. We expect to deliver fiscal year '26 subscription and support revenue of 9% year over year in constant currency.\n\nWe remain deeply, deeply committed to profitable growth and expect fiscal year '26 non-GAAP operating margin of 34%. We're going to deliver another 100 basis points of expansion, following two years where we expanded more than 1,000 basis points. The pace of change; the focus on productivity, profitability; the speed of innovation, the trinity of apps, data, and agents, it's all coming together. As I mentioned, we're seeing customers deploy Agentforce across every industry.\n\nLet's talk about a couple of examples. We've been working with Lennar, the nation's largest home builder. And most of you know, Lennar is really an incredible company. And they've been a customer of ours for about eight years.\n\nThey came to Dreamforce. And when they came to Dreamforce, they obviously got their hands like many of you did on Agentforce. Got super excited, went back to Miami, talked to their co-CEOs. You probably know Stuart Miller, Jon Jaffe, amazing CEOs.\n\nAnd those co-CEOs called me and said, \"Listen, these guys have done a hackathon around Agentforce. We've got five use cases. We see incredible opportunities on our margin, incredible opportunities in our revenue. And do you have our back if we're going to deploy this?\" And we said, \"Absolutely, we deploy it ourselves,\" which is the best evidence that this is real.\n\nAnd they are just incredible, their vision as a home builder, providing 24/7 support, sales leads through all their digital channels. They're able to sell all kinds of new products. I think they're going to sell mortgages and insurance and all kinds of things to their customers. And, you know, the cool thing is they're using our sales product, our service product, marketing, MuleSoft, Slack, Tableau, they use everything.\n\nBut they are able to leverage it all together by realizing that just by turning it on, they get this incredible Agentforce capability. All right, I want to tell you another story, not just about Lennar and transforming a home builder, but I don't know how many of you know about Pandora. You've been to a shopping center, you see the Pandora store. You walk in.\n\nThey have this gorgeous jewelry. They have these cool charm bracelets. They have amazing, amazing products. And, you know, their CEO, Alex, he's absolutely phenomenal.\n\nI think he's based over in Amsterdam, or he's in the Netherlands. I can't remember where it is, but one of the northern European countries. Incredible CEO. Time actually just gave them an award as one of the most sustainable companies in the world.\n\nGreat company. You know, they're in 100 countries. They employ 37,000 people worldwide. And Alex has this great vision to augment their employees with digital labor.\n\nAnd this idea that whether you're on their website or in their store or whatever it is that they're going to be able to do so much more with Agentforce. They already used -- first of all, they used Commerce Cloud. So, if you've been to pandora.com and bought their products and, you know, if you have it, by the way, it's completely worthwhile. It's great.\n\nAnd you can experience our Commerce Cloud. But it's deeply integrated with our Service Cloud with Data Cloud. It's the one unified platform approach. And now, they're just flipping the switch, turning agents on, and they're planning to deliver 30% to 60% of their service cases with Agentforce.\n\nThat is awesome. And I really love Alex's vision of what's possible. And then, the last customer I really want to hit on, which I'm so excited about is Pfizer. And, you know, Albert is an incredible CEO.\n\nThey are doing unbelievable things. They've been a tremendous customer, but now they're really going all in on our Life Sciences Cloud. We're seeing so many, you know, I was in The Business Council last week in Washington, D.C., met with hundreds of CEOs. And so many of the CEOs of the life sciences industry are going with our Life Sciences Cloud.\n\nIt was incredible. And you can see why because it's just a natural upgrade of what they're already doing with us. And then, this idea that our Life Sciences Cloud becomes this highly differentiated capability from everything currently available in the market and then allows these pharma medtech companies, so many, to be able to streamline not just their clinical operations, all their customer-facing, even the ones who want to go to direct to consumer, even the ones who want to do clinical trials. And this idea that agents are going to make all of that so much better.\n\nAnd with Agentforce sales agents, for example, with Pfizer, you know, that's -- they've got 20,000 customer-facing employees and customer-facing folks. You know, that is just a radical extension for them with agents. And I'll have to slot in one last one because I'll tell you, I'm sure a lot of you are like \"I have flown in Singapore Air. You know what, it's a great airline.\" The CEO, Goh, is amazing.\n\nAnd he has a huge vision that also came out of Dreamforce where they've already delivered the probably the best service of any airline in the world. They want to deliver it through agents. So, whether you're doing it with service or sales or marketing or commerce or all the different things that Singapore Air is doing with us, you're going to be able to do this right on Singapore Air. All right, well I know all of you want to see this in person, talk to these customers yourself.\n\nYou know you can go to help.salesforce.com. Brian's going to talk about that when you hear the numbers we delivered in the quarter there. You're not going to believe it. And listen, a lot of people say to me, \"Hey, how are you different from these other agent companies?\" Number one, go to those other vendors, go to their sites.\n\nAre they running their ancient technology? You've all been on help.salesforce.com. You all know this incredible capability that we're delivering. You've seen it deployed by these other customers like Equinox and Remarkable and others. You've got your hands on it.\n\nDo you see the other scaled vendors delivering this capability, or are they just using the word agent? I think you got to beware -- beware of the false agent because the false agent is out there where people can use the word agent or they kind of -- you know, they're trying to whitewash all the agent, the thing, everywhere. But the reality is there is the real agents and there are the false agents, and we're very fortunate to have the real stuff going on here. So, we've got a lot more groundbreaking AI innovation coming. I can't wait for you to see it at our TrailheadDX event next week, and that's going to be March 5th and 6th in San Francisco.\n\nLooking forward to seeing all of you there and showing you that -- and I'll tell you, while you're there, and I didn't hit it, you've got to see this new product we've just built, which is Tableau Next. I'm sure a lot of you know Tableau. You probably use it every day. When you see what we have built, which is the new Tableau built with Agentforce on the Data Cloud and how it's deeply integrated into our product line, it is going to blow your mind.\n\nIt is incredible. You've got to make sure you get a demo of Tableau Next. You won't believe it, you're going to see the new Slack. You're going to see the new Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, the platform, Agentforce, all the products, this new field service product which is incredible.\n\nYou might get a glimpse of the new ITSM product that's coming if you look hard. But the big thing that I'm excited about, OK, the big thing that I'm really excited about is Tableau Next because that's about to deploy to customers at scale. And I think people are going to be absolutely blown away. All right, now, before I do that, I have to get out the Kleenex because I have to say goodbye to Brian and Amy, who, you know, it's kind of a moment in time here where Brian has been here for, I think, 25 years, 26 years.\n\nHe's just wearing one of the many watches that I've given him to recognize his performance. And Amy is here as well. She's not wearing one of her watches, but she has them at home probably in her jewelry case or safe or something. And, you know, Amy's -- how long has it been, Amy? Twelve years? Eleven years with Amy.\n\nAnd, you know, we're going through a little bit of a transition of our management team between fiscal year '25 and '26, and we want to say goodbye and thank you. We want to say mahalo, and we want to say goodbye, which is a hui hou. And thank you so much for everything. And we're going to let them talk and also say their goodbyes.\n\nBut we're so grateful to everything that you've done for us every single day over the last 25 and 11 years, and it's been great to have you part of our management team, and you're welcome back any time. So, if you get lonely out there on the golf course or -- I know Amy's got some big plans that she's not ready to announce yet in the NGO world. But I'll tell you that, you know, if you guys get lonely or you're missing the thrill of the hunt, come back and see us because we're going to be ready for you to come back. OK.\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Marc.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAll right, Brian.\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nI really appreciate it. It's been a privilege of a lifetime to work here for more than 25 years. Very few people get to start at a company that has zero revenue and helps it grow to 38 billion. The journey has been remarkable, and this year was certainly the capstone.\n\nAs you heard from Mark, in just one quarter, Agentforce has been deployed by thousands of brands worldwide, becoming an incredible lever for productivity, growth, and efficiency. It's happened faster than we ever expected. With our deeply unified platform seamlessly integrating our Customer 360 apps, Data Cloud, and Agentforce, we're leading the digital labor revolution. Customers of every size across every industry are seeing immediate and substantial value with Agentforce.\n\nWe're setting new standards in the industry. OpenTable is a great example of how Agentforce is having an immediate impact. In just three weeks, it's handling 73% of all restaurant web queries, a 50% improvement over their previous tool. And they're not alone.\n\nThe Futurum Group surveyed customers and found that Agentforce can achieve ROI fast five times faster than DIY while lowering costs by 20%. And technology analyst firm, Valoir, found Agentforce delivers autonomous AI agents 16 times faster versus DIY approaches with 75% increased accuracy. We continue to see significant increase in large multi-cloud transactions as companies look to accelerate faster time to value, efficiency, and growth. Goodyear is partnering with us on their transformation, using Agentforce to automate and increase the effectiveness of their sales efforts.\n\nWith Agentforce for field service, Goodyear. will be able to reduce repair time by assisting technicians with answers to vehicle-related questions and autonomously scheduling field tech appointments. We also continue to embed an agentic layer across our own business. Today, we're live on Agentforce across service and sales, our business technology organization, customer support, and more, and the results are phenomenal.\n\nSince launching on our Salesforce help portal in October, Agentforce has autonomously handled 380,000 service requests, achieving an incredible 84% resolution rate. And only 2% of the requests require human escalation. And we're using Agentforce for quoting, accelerating our quoting cycles by more than 75%. In Q4, We increased our AE capacity while still driving productivity, up 7% year over year.\n\nAgentforce is transforming how we do outbound prospecting, already engaging more than 50 leads per day, with personalized outreach and timely follow-ups, freeing up our teams to focus on high-value conversation. Our reps are participating in thousands of sales coaching training sessions each month. Data Cloud has a powerful network effect. As usage expands, the platform becomes more intelligent and more valuable.\n\nAnd that's why we're seeing companies around the world, including Maserati, Bell Canada, Dolce Gabbana, continue to invest in Data Cloud and to build the foundation to implement agents at scale. CaixaBank, which happens to be Spain's leading bank, is using Data Cloud to create a robust data infrastructure that supports its agentic transformation and enables them to drive faster and more consistent customer experiences. As you know, the true value of AI is in the data. Nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI and Data Cloud customers.\n\nAnd all of our top 10 wins in Q4 included Data Cloud and AI. Agentforce revolutionized revolutionizing how our customers work by bringing AI-powered insights and actions directly into the workflows across the Customer 360 applications. This is driving strong growth across our portfolio. Sales Cloud and Service Cloud both achieved double-digit growth again in Q4.\n\nWe're seeing fantastic momentum with Slack with customers like ZoomInfo, Remarkable, and MIMIT Health using Agentforce and Slack to boost productivity. Once again, Slack was included in over a third of our deals over $1 million, and its contribution to the overall deal size increased double digits year over year. With nearly 5 billion messages sent weekly, Slack is central to how people work going forward. We're confident Slack will be the place where every company brings digital labor to all of their employees, enabling collaboration with Agentforce to get work done.\n\nTableau and MuleSoft are mission critical to our customers with each featured in nearly half of our greater than $1 million deals. Tableau, now integrated with Data Cloud and Agentforce on the Salesforce core platform will transform how customers like EchoStar, Goosehead Insurance, and Keller Williams Realty take action on their data. Customers can now unlock actionable insights from conversational analytics, manage and analyze data using AI assistance, and build analytical agents with integrated workflows. Similarly, MuleSoft is transforming how industry leaders like Banco Bradesco, Fujitsu and Sony Honda Mobility approach enterprise integration.\n\nWith agent-driven integration and out-of-the-box connectors for every major system, customers simply describe their needs in natural language, and our AI automatically builds the solution. Agentforce is also enabling us to deliver truly transformative solutions for every industry and region. In Q4, nearly half of our top 100 wins were international, including wins with companies like One New Zealand, LG Electronics and Versace. Our industry business, along with public sector and dot-org finished the year at an incredible 5.7 billion in ARR, up 20% year over year.\n\nAll of our top 10 deals and nearly 75% of our top 100 deals included industry cloud. To meet this demand, we pre-built over 170 specialized Agentforce industry skills and a team of 400 specialists supporting transformations across sectors and geographies. Our new channels and partner ecosystem, anchored by our amazing -- sorry, 19 million trailblazers are unlocking customer spend and driving Agentforce adoption. And we're leaning into our ecosystem.\n\nIn fact, partners were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of our Agentforce activations in Q4. We're also working with our partners to become Agentforce companies themselves. Accenture is using Agentforce Sales Coach, which provides personalized coaching and recommendations for sales teams, which is expected to lead to higher win rates. And Deloitte is projecting significant productivity gains and save workforce hours as they roll out Agentforce over the next few years.\n\nOver 127,000 system integrated employees have completed Agentforce training, and more than a thousand ISE and technology partners are building and selling agents. Our Agentforce Partner Network allows customers to deploy prebuilt agents and use agent actions from partners like AWS, Google, IBM, Workday, and more. Earlier this week, we announced an expanded partnership with Google, as Marc mentioned, to empower customers to use Agentforce with Gemini, their multimodal model, and to deploy Salesforce on Google Cloud. AWS is a huge growth engine for us, helping us close a number of large deals.\n\nIn fact, in Q4, we closed 25 transactions over $1 million, including three that were more than 10 million. We're starting off FY '26 in an incredible position with a highly accomplished and technical leadership team ready to guide us through this pivotal moment in AI and agents. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity and to all the leaders who have gotten us here, especially Marc and Amy. It's been an honor to work alongside both of you.\n\nThank you to our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders. I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished or more excited about what's ahead for Salesforce. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.\n\nAmy E. Weaver -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. I wanted to start also by expressing my gratitude to Marc and Brian for their partnership and for their deep friendship over many, many years. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm truly thankful for the opportunity.\n\nI am also absolutely thrilled to welcome Robin to the team as our new chief operating and financial officer. Fiscal year '25 was a year of incredible change, with new innovation beyond anything we could have expected just 12 months ago, requiring persistence and urgency in our execution. Q4 is a reflection of that focus across the business, and you can see it in our results. Let's start with revenue.\n\nFor the full year, revenue was 37.9 billion, up 9% year over year in both nominal and constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew just over 10% in constant currency. Q4 revenue was 10 billion, up 8% year over year in nominal. This includes approximately 75 million of incremental FX headwinds since our last guidance, resulting in 9% growth year over year in constant currency.\n\nSubscription and support revenue grew 9% year over year in constant, driven by stability in sales, service, and platform, partially offset by MuleSoft and Tableau who had very tough prior-year compares. From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 8% in nominal and constant currency. EMEA grew 6%, or 7% in constant currency. And APAC grew 10%, or 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe saw strong new business growth in Latam, Japan, and Canada, while parts of EMEA remain constrained. Of note, the United States saw some stabilization in the quarter. From an industry perspective, in Q4, health and life sciences, communications and media both performed well, while tech and manufacturing, automotive and energy were more measured. And as you heard from Brian, our multi-cloud momentum continues as customers turn to our deeply unified platform.\n\nThat's why our top 100 deals in the quarter averaged six clouds. And all of our top 10 wins included AI, Data Cloud, service, platform, and industry clouds. Our data and AI momentum continues as we move toward a world where AI is ubiquitous and embedded in everyday workflows. Our investments in this space have been deliberate and focused, and we are now starting to yield strong returns.\n\nIn the -- we ended the year with 900 million in Data Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue, growing nearly 120% year over year. As Marc shared, we closed more than 3,000 paid Agentforce deals in the quarter. As customers continue to harness the value of AI deeply embedded across our unified platform, it is no surprise that these customers averaged nearly four clouds. And these customers came from a diverse set of industries with more than half in technology, manufacturing, financial services, and HLS.\n\nQ4 revenue attrition ended the quarter slightly above 8%, in line with recent quarters. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%, up 170 basis points year over year, driven by top-line outperformance and disciplined expense management. GAAP operating margin was 18.2%, up 70 basis points year over year. And for the full year, I am very pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin of 33%, up another 250 basis points year over year.\n\nGAAP operating margin was 19%, up 460 basis points year over year, inclusive of incremental restructuring charges we incurred in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was nearly 4 billion, up 17% year over year. Q4 free cash flow was 3.8 billion, also up 17% year over year. And for the full year, operating cash flow was a record 13.1 billion, up 28% year over year.\n\nAnd that's inclusive of a predicted 10-point cash tax headwind. And as we said, driving strong free cash flow remains a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Fiscal year '25 free cash flow was 12.4 billion, up 31% year over year. Turning to remaining performance obligations, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, we passed 60 billion for the first time in company history.\n\nQ4 finished at an incredible 63.4 billion, up 11% year over year, representing our customers long-term commitment to Salesforce and the durability of our business model. Current RPO, or CRPO, ended at 30.2 billion, an increase of 9% year over year in nominal currency. This includes a $300 million FX headwind which resulted in 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency, driven by strong performance in Data Cloud and AI and Slack. Q4 CRPO also benefited significantly from strong early renewals.\n\nWithin our bookings this quarter, we again saw continued stabilization in our transactional businesses, including Create and Close and SMB. On capital return, in fiscal '25, we executed 7.8 billion in share repurchases and issued 1.5 billion in dividends. Through our capital return program, we more than fully offset dilution from FY '25 stock-based compensation. And since the inception of our capital return program, we have now returned more than 21 billion to shareholders.\n\nNow, let's turn to guidance. Starting with full fiscal year '26, we expect revenue of 40.5 billion to 40.9 billion, growth of approximately 7% to 8% year over year in nominal and constant currency. And for subscription and support revenue, we expect growth of approximately 9% year over year in constant currency. Now, I want to pause and give a few important notes on this guidance.\n\nFirst, on foreign exchange, as Marc noted, we've seen the U.S. dollar strengthen considerably. And even since our last earnings call, that movement has driven an incremental $200 million headwind to fiscal '26 revenue. Our revenue guidance now incorporates an approximately 0.5 point year-over-year headwind.\n\nSecond, as we experienced in fiscal '25, we continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to growth this year, which is reflected in our guidance for total revenue. Know that as part of our overall implementation strategy, we are leaning more on our partner ecosystem. As you heard from Brian, partners were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of Agentforce activations in Q4. Third, we expect subscription and support revenue to be lifted by momentum in Data Cloud and some contribution from Agentforce this year, partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce, and slower growth in our exploration base in FY '26.\n\nFinally, on Agentforce, we are incredibly excited about the customer momentum we are seeing. However, the adoption cycle is still early as we focus on deployment with our customers. As a result, we are assuming a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal '26. We expect the momentum to build throughout the year, driving a more meaningful contribution in fiscal '27.\n\nAnd on attrition, we expect attrition to remain consistent and slightly above 8% for the full year. Now, turning to profitability and cash flow. On margins, I want to reiterate that the company remains committed to ongoing expansion. The company has laid a strong foundation for continued margin progression, efficiency, and disciplined investments.\n\nFiscal year '26 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34%, representing another 100 basis points of expansion year over year. This incorporates intentional investments in high-growth opportunities, most notably in Agentforce and Data Cloud. And I'd like to call out that from a pace perspective, we do expect a ramp in margins throughout the year. Stock-based compensation is expected to stay relatively flat year over year as a percent of revenue.\n\nWe expect fiscal year '26 GAAP operating margin of 21.6%, representing more than 250 basis points of improvement year over year. We expect fiscal year '26 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.95 to $7.03. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $11.09 to $11.17. As we've mentioned over the last few years, we remain focused on driving durable cash flow growth.\n\nWe expect fiscal year '26 operating cash flow growth of approximately 10% to 11%, and we are not expecting a material headwind from cash taxes this year. We expect capex for the fiscal year to be approximately 2% of revenue again. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 9% to 10% for the fiscal year. Now, to guidance for Q1.\n\nOn revenue, we expect 9.71 billion to 9.76 billion, up 6% to 7% year over year in nominal and 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are lapping the 1 point leap year benefit we noted last Q1, as well as the benefit from license revenue timing. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be approximately 10% year over year in nominal, including a $100 million FX headwind, resulting in slightly above 10% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.49 to $1.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.53 to $2.55.\n\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with our strong finish to the year and the foundation we have set in place for continued success, and I want to thank our employees for their dedication and execution throughout the year. I also want to extend my gratitude to our shareholder and investment community for your continued support. It has really been a privilege working with all of you. Now, Mike, do you want to open up the call for questions?\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks. Operator, we're ready to take questions now. As a reminder, we ask everyone to limit to one question. And we'll take the first question now.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. And the first question today comes from Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on a really strong end to FY '25. I wanted to dig into the Agentforce opportunities. Some really big numbers there in terms of the number of deals signed and really good revenue momentum there.\n\nInvestors are asking me a lot and have a lot of questions on how the pricing model --\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nHey, Keith. Hey, Keith.\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nYes.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nKeith, sorry, we --\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThe first part of your question -- yeah, I can hear you now. The first part of your question cut out. So, could you start over please?\n\nKeith Weiss -- Analyst\n\nSure thing. So, congratulations on the very strong quarter, a lot of focus on Agentforce and a lot of big numbers there. Investors are asking me a lot of questions about the changing pricing model dynamics, going from a seat-based model to one that includes consumptive elements and how that nets out. So, I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of what you guys are seeing thus far when you're doing these Agentforce contracts.\n\nIs it expanding the overall contract size? What kind of expansions are you seeing if you are seeing expansions? And does the math net to be a good positive for Salesforce as we move to a more consumptive model? Are there any bumps in the road that we should be aware of?\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK, well, I'd love to address that directly and then I'm going to ask Brian to come in with some specifics and examples because I think it's so exciting. You know, I think -- of course, you know, we've kind of started the company out with the per-user pricing model, and, you know, that's about humans. We price per human. So, you -- kind of pricing per human.\n\nAnd then, we have products that are also in the consumption world as well. And, of course, those started in the early days, things like our sandboxes. You know, even things like our Commerce Cloud, even our email marketing product, our Marketing Cloud. You know, these are consumption-based products we've had for years.\n\nAnd it's always been a mix of, you know, products that we have for humans and then products that we have for computers. Now, we have, you know these kind of products that are for agents also. And agents are also a consumption model. So, when we look at our Data Cloud, for example, that's a consumption product.\n\nAgentforce is a consumption product. But it's going to be a mix. It's going to be a mix between what's going on with our customers with how many humans do they have and then how many agents are they deploying. I think in one example that I can personally tell you about in the quarter, you know, we did a large transaction with a large telecommunications company.\n\nIt's incredible. And when I was talking to their CEO, she was asking me how are we going to price the transaction and so forth. And I can't remember the exact number of the deal. I think it was -- Brian, maybe it was about $20 million in ACV, something like that for the year, maybe $60 million TCV transaction.\n\nAnd then, as part of that transaction, it's a mix of, you know, we're rebuilding this telecommunications company. So, it's Sales Cloud, it's Service Cloud, it's Marketing Cloud, it's all of our core clouds. But then, also, it's Agentforce. And the Agentforce component, I think, was maybe $7 million in the transaction.\n\nSo, she was buying $7 million of Agentforce. She bought $13 million in our products for humans. And I think that was about 20 million in total. These are about approximate numbers.\n\nI think that's kind of the idea that you're going to see us be able to deliver, you know, the right package for the right customer. Even if you look at Salesforce, as I mentioned, here we are, you know, working in this world, and kind of Brian has hit on it, we did what, 360,000 transactions in the quarter with Agentforce, you know, in help.salesforce.com.\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nThree hundred eighty.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThree hundred eighty. And then, what do you have, about, you know, several thousand, you know, customer support reps? And so, we have our Service Cloud running, we have Agentforce running, we have our different products running. Then, our -- of course, our Service Cloud is deeply integrated with our service -- Sales Cloud and other products. So, it's going to be a mix.\n\nAnd I think that the mix is the most exciting thing. I don't know any company that's 100% agents. I don't know of any company that doesn't need automation for its humans. I don't know any company that doesn't need a data cloud where it needs a consistent common data repository for all of its agents to gain their intelligence.\n\nAnd I don't know any company that's not going to need an agentic layer. And that idea of having apps, data, and agents, I think, is going to be the winning combination. You want to actually give the real details, Brian?\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nNo, that's exactly right. This trinity, as you called it, Marc, CRM plus data plus agents is really what our customers are coming to us for. Our objective is how do we serve the customers and focus on customer success, how do we give them what they need to go drive their business forward, both from a productivity and from an efficiency perspective. The pricing models will change over time.\n\nThere's no doubt about it. The nice thing that we've seen with our customers is they really understand the ROI associated with digital labor. What we're able to provide with agents is really driving the velocity of transactions that we've seen. Marc mentioned the 3,000 transactions that we closed in the fourth quarter, really driven on our ROI model that people understand that they can get a tremendous amount of benefit from agents.\n\nWe will probably move into the near future from conversations as we price most of our initial deals to universal credit that will allow our customers far more flexibility in the way they transact with us. But we see this as significantly upside to our pricing structures going forward. And that's what we've seen in the early days with our engagement with customers.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nTo correctly address, like, here's a transaction that you're doing. Let's say a customer comes in, they're very interested in building an agentic layer on their company. You know, is that bringing other human-based clouds along with it?\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nNo doubt. And I think what we've seen is that we have incremental strength in our core technology, the CRM core technology. You saw in the quarter, we had some good performance, both Sales and Service Cloud, both above 10% growth in the quarter. And so, we are seeing people leverage our core technology, the named pricing models with our core apps and agents together to go drive the efficiencies that they're looking for.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYep, I think you're going to really play it out. And when you do come to TrailheaDX and you do see that new Tableau Next, I think what you're going to see is a Tableau that was only built for humans before but now is deeply integrated into Data Cloud and has a deep agentic layer as well. So, you're going to be able to come to your own conclusions, get your hands on these products, talk to the customers. What an exciting moment.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nOK. Thanks, Keith. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. And our next question comes from Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne -- Analyst\n\nHi. Yes, thanks very much for taking the question. Brian and Marc, I was wondering if you just talk about -- you referred to it a little bit, but, you know, as Agentforce builds, obviously, not every company is going to be ready to potentially go agentic today. But is Agentforce having a bit of a halo effect around some of your other products? Meaning as we are on the journey to get more monetization from Agentforce, are you seeing pickups or at least higher activity levels in some of your other products that, you know, Brian, to your point, you know, sort of form this holy trinity? Thanks.\n\nBrian Millham -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYou're exactly right. And we're seeing it in the way that our customers are using our technology, new ideas, new workflows, new engagements. We talked about Lennar as an example. Their ability to handle leads after hours that they weren't able to get back to or respond to in a quick time frame are now able to touch and engage with those leads.\n\nAnd then, that, of course, flows into Salesforce automation system. And so, we are seeing this halo effect with our core technology. It is making every single one of our core apps better as they deliver intelligence underpinning these applications. And so, it is the message that we're delivering this trinity of apps, data, and agents that are -- is really compelling to our customers.\n\nKirk Materne -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Kirk. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow -- Analyst\n\nHey, perfect. Congrats from me as well. And Marc, like, with Amy and Brian, you lose some very experienced people on the team. What was the thinking in terms of combining those two roles? And how do you see that playing out going forward? Thank you.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I'm so excited, you know, to have Robin come in as our new COFO. And I really think it's exciting because Robin really has this kind of unique capability to deliver the chief operating officer position and chief financial officer position. And I'll tell you, as we did the search, one of the really top candidates that we saw come through held this position in another company. And I think as Robin and I were talking about that, you know, the leverage of having a COFO, this idea that the financial officer and the chief operating officer really come together as this incredible, you know, partnership to deliver, you know, this capability.\n\nIt just was a perfect match for us. I was thinking about going with it on the -- with this outside candidate, and that's where I was fortunate to be able to convince Robin to take the job. And, Robin, would you like to just say something and just kind of come in here and just tell us about how excited you are to be part of the management team?\n\nRobin Washington -- Board Member and Incoming Chief Operating and Financial Officer\n\nSure, Marc. As you've heard Brian, Amy, and Marc talk about it, it is an exciting opportunity for us right now with Agentforce, so I am elated to be able to join forces with the operating team. It's an exciting time in our industry as well. And as you've heard us talk about the trinity and our deeply unified platform, I think we clearly are able to have something that's going to support our customers' growth and productivity in this new area -- in this new era, I should say, with the result of sustainable and profitable revenue growth for Salesforce long term.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. And I just want to also -- I should also really thank -- Miguel Milano, as you probably know, came back as our chief revenue officer about a year ago. And, you know, he decided to rejoin us after some cajoling. And I've asked him to work directly for me, you know, running our worldwide sales organization.\n\nAnd so, I've been so thrilled about that. And I also have to thank Srini, who was our chief engineering officer, who's now our chief engineering and services officer who's taken on customer service and support. And it's been a rebalancing of our management team. So, we have this amazing new executive with Robin.\n\nI couldn't be more excited to have her by my side. And just as a little side note, Robin will tell you, I've been trying to convince her to join the company for over a decade. And so, I finally got her and after a lot of selling. So, we're thrilled to have Robin with us and joining us, you know, at direct operating executive from the board.\n\nAnd then, having Miguel is so exciting. Of course, having Parker with me as well is so critical. And also, as I mentioned, Srini is running services and engineering, and Steve Fisher, being promoted recently to our chief product officer -- or actually, our chief technology officer, running products; and our chief product officer, David Schmaier, also with expanded responsibilities working directly for me. David is now our chief product and impact officer.\n\nAnd this is -- I couldn't be more thrilled. I also have a great chief of staff, Kendall, and a whole team around me with so many incredible functions and capabilities. And, of course, smiling and waving at me across the table is Sabastian Niles, my chief legal officer, who has done an unbelievable job since joining the company. So, I don't think I've ever had a better management team.\n\nI mean, it's hard to beat Amy and Brian, but I think maybe we did it. We're really thrilled. So, sorry, Amy and Brian, to see you go, a hui ho, but welcome to the new management team. And we're so thrilled to have them with us, and we're so excited to start fiscal year '26 with an absolute bang.\n\nAnd, Robin, did you want to end with any parting comments?\n\nRobin Washington -- Board Member and Incoming Chief Operating and Financial Officer\n\nNo, we'll go to the next --\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAll right, very good. She's ready for the next question.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Raimo. Let's go to the next question, please, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nUp next is Brent Thill, Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Marc, just on DOGE and the impact of what the federal and state has been. I'm curious if you could discuss your role and what you think this means for Salesforce.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I don't have any role. I'm -- you know, I think I'm -- you know, of course, I'm coming at this with a beginner's mind like I'm sure all of us are that, you know, we want to see what they are able to deliver with the new administration or -- you know, huge fans of the United States of America. We want us to be a successful country as we possibly can be. And that also includes having something that I think is critically important for us, which is a balanced budget, something I've, you know, encouraged every president that I've worked with for, you know, quite a few administrations to achieve.\n\nWe're thrilled with our relationship with the government. You know that we have so many agencies that depend on us from providing support for veterans through our Veterans Administration and so many other groups. And I think even DOGE is using Slack to manage their communication and coordination. So, you know, we'll work closely with the government.\n\nWe'll do anything we can to help them succeed. And we wish them only the best, and we're here to help at every step of the way. And we want the U.S. to be, you know, as successful as it possibly can.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Brent. Operator, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up, from JPMorgan, it's Mark Murphy.\n\nMark Murphy -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. Marc, you had mentioned this labor arbitrage and that jobs are going to evolve. When you think through the scale of that kind of an opportunity, how much labor do you think you can augment or replace? For instance, you know, could a company with a thousand employees slow its hiring or stop hiring and, you know, just layer in a couple hundred agents for spots and maybe accelerate its growth. And then, you know, further to Brent's point, can we apply that concept to federal government agencies? If they have 3 million workers and some of them are going to leave voluntarily, could they layer in, you know, hundreds of thousands of these Agentforce bots and see some greater efficiency?\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I think that, you know, I could wave you away and say I don't really know yet. But I will tell you that since I'm the CEO of a 75,000-person company -- or how many employees do we have now? Seventy-five, 76,000. So, you know, let's just look at us. You know, so we have, what, 9,000 support agents.\n\nWe really are seeing tremendous efficiency with help.salesforce.com, so we may see the opportunity to rebalance some of those folks into sales and marketing and other functions. We're really excited about that. I would say that we're definitely have seen a lot of efficiency with engineering and with some of the new tools that I've seen, especially some of these high-performance coding tools. One of the key members of my staff who's here in the room with us just showed me one of his new, you know, examples of what we're able to do with these coding tools.\n\nIt's pretty awesome. And we're not going to hire any new engineers this year. We're seeing 30% productivity increase on engineering, and we're going to really continue to ride that up. And we're going to grow sales pretty dramatically this year.\n\nBrian has got a big vision for how to grow the sales organization probably another 10% to 20%, I hope, this year because we're seeing incredible levels of demand. I think every company who is our customer or prospect wants us to come in and start talking about what we're going to do with them and how we're going to transform them. Everybody sees the opportunity. I think that, you know, the big message I have for a lot of CEOs that I meet with is, \"Hey, you know, we're the last generation of CEOs to only manage humans.\" You know, I think every CEO going forward is going to manage, you know, humans and agents together.\n\nI know that's what I'm doing. So, this is what I have to think about every single day as a CEO. And I think everyone is going to have to start to think about that. It's definitely starting because as I mentioned, I was with a large CEO group last week, and it was a topic of conversation in every single person that I met with, and with whether it's those life sciences CEOs that we mentioned or financial services CEOs or manufacturing CEOs.\n\nAnd every example, they can see how agents are going to be able to augment their workforce. And I think you can see it also in the global economy that, I think, productivity is going to rise without additions to more human labor, which is good because human labor is not increasing in the global workforce. So, you have a stagnant human workforce worldwide. So, if you want productivity to go up, and you want GDP to grow up, and you want growth, I think that digital labor is going to be one of the catalysts to make that happen.\n\nAnd I was talking with a significant economist and economic leader last week. And I think that, you know, they -- I think everyone's on the same page that we could see something really dramatic. And this is our main focus as a company. We aren't, you know, building huge, you know, $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion, $100 billion data centers.\n\nWe're not, you know, doing some of these kind of engineering efforts that may or may not have some kind of huge payoff but is going to take down all of our cash and all of our margin for the next several years. We're like augmenting our existing product line with artificial intelligence, taking advantage of these incredible investments that are being made, you know, in infrastructure by others. And we're going to deliver the digital labor revolution. This is our goal.\n\nOur goal is to be the No. 1 provider of digital labor in the world. That's it. I don't think there really is another goal.\n\nYou know, you can say we're the No. 1 AI CRM, which we already are. But when you're the No. 1 AI CRM, you're also going to lead the digital labor revolution.\n\nAnd that is going to be the focus of fiscal year '26. As I said, this is the year of digital labor, and it is going to be the year where every trailblazer is going to become an agent blazer.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that question comes from Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan -- Analyst\n\nHey, thank you very much. We'll miss you, Brian and Amy. Congratulations, Robin. One for you, Marc.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about how we're moving from model building and training to the inference layer. And also, as part of that shift to agentic technology, there's been a lot of debate about the SaaS technology and the business model. Can the SaaS tech stack that you built and pioneered, how does that fit into the agentic world? Is there a risk that SaaS just becomes a CRUD database? I know it sounds really terrible, but I'm sure you have an opinion. I'd love to hear it.\n\nThank you.\n\nMarc Russell Benioff -- Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK, well, Kash, I really appreciate that. And, you know, look, I've heard that Microsoft narrative, too. So, you know, I watched the podcast you watched, and that's a very interesting idea. You know, here's the -- here's how I look at it, which is I believe there is kind of a holy trinity here of AI CRM, which is the apps, the data, and the agents.\n\nAnd these three things have to kind of work together. And I kind of put my money where our mouth is where we kind of built it and we delivered it. And you can see the 380,000, you know, conversations that we had as point of evidence here in the last 90 days on our service and with a very high resolution rate of 84%. Now, you can go to our -- you can go to help.salesforce.com and you can see that today.\n\nNow, Microsoft has had Copilot available for, I think, about two years or more than two years, and they are -- I know that they're the reseller of OpenAI and they've invested their -- kind of repackaged this, you know, ChatGPT or whatever. But where on their site are they delivering agents? Where in their company have they done this? Where -- are they a best practice? Because I think that while they can say such a thing, do they have humans and agents working together to create customer success? Are they rebalancing their workforce with humans and agents? I think that it's a very interesting point that, yes, the agentic layer is very important, but it doesn't operate by itself. It operates with data with a data cloud that has to be federated through your company to all your data sources. And humans, we're still here.\n\nI'm here. I just knocked on the table. In case anybody wants to know, this is not an agent. And I mean, I guess we're not very long, is that actually going to be a good test? But just know that I am here, and you could call me or text me, Kash.\n\nAnd, you know, I am using those apps, too. Like I said I've got -- the new Tableau is amazing, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud I use. I use all of our products. Slack, I was just on.\n\nAnd that idea that our apps and our Data Cloud and our agentic layer, all integrated deliver -- integrated together right now and delivering value right now to our No. 1 Customer Zero, Salesforce. Wow, here we go. And are other vendors really doing that? Beware of the false agent.\n\nGo out there and take a look who's really talking about it and who's really delivering. And this is a lot of engineering that has to get done to make this really work for a large enterprise like us. And Salesforce has done it. We are the No.\n\n1 AI CRM. We are the leader of the digital labor revolution. You can see it now with over 3,000 paid customers. And as you can see, you know, the tens of trillions of transactions that happen in our Data Cloud, incredible.\n\nSo, thank you very much for a great fiscal year '25. Thank you to Amy and Brian. It's amazing. And welcome to Robin onto the management team.\n\nAnd to all of our new executives, congratulations on their promotions. And we're ready for a great fiscal year '26. This is going to be the absolute year of Agentforce.\n\nMichael Spencer -- Executive Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Marc. Thanks, Kash. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the coming weeks.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, that does conclude today's conference.

The figure was up about 8% and below the $2.37 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. In the sales category, Salesforce generated $2.13 billion in revenue, up 8% and also trailing Visible Alpha's consensus of $2.17 billion.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company introduced its second-generation Agentforce artificial intelligence agent technology, which answers employee questions in the Slack team communications app.\n\nSalesforce said it has completed more than 3,000 paid deals involving Agentforce since October.

            "content": "Salesforce Q4 2025 Earnings: CEO Benioff Dismisses Threat To SaaS From Agentic AI\n\n\u201cBeware the false agents,\u201d Salesforce CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff said.\n\nSalesforce CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff called concerns that agentic artificial intelligence could mark the end of software-as-a-service applications a \u201cMicrosoft narrative\u201d and put down the tech giant\u2019s Copilot AI offerings as \u201crepackaged\u201d ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cThere is kind of a holy trinity here of AI CRM, which is the apps, the data and the agents,\u201d Benioff (pictured) said during Wednesday\u2019s quarterly earnings call for the San Francisco-based cloud application vendor. \u201cThese three things have to kind of work together. \u2026 It's a very interesting point that, yes, the agentic layer is very important. But it doesn't operate by itself. It operates with data, with a data cloud that has to be federated through your company to all your data sources.\u201d\n\nBenioff also suggested that Salesforce is doing a better job leveraging its AI products than Microsoft is leveraging its own AI products. He pointed to an online version of Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce on the company\u2019s help portal handling 380,000 conversations with an 84 percent resolution rate and just 2 percent of the requests needing human escalation.\n\n\u201cBeware the false agents,\u201d Benioff said on the call. \u201cGo out there and take a look. Who's really talking about it and who's really delivering. \u2026 We are the No. 1 AI CRM. We are the leader of the digital labor revolution.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: ATSG Closes Evolve IP Acquisition: Preparing For Growth, Looking For A New Name]\n\nSalesforce Q4\n\nCRN has reached out to Microsoft for comment. Earlier this year, Microsoft Chief Communications Officer Frank Shaw took to the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn social media network to call Benioff\u2019s Microsoft attacks part of the CEO\u2019s familiar marketing playbook.\n\n\u201cIf anyone cared to plot a chart of our Copilot and agent news with Benioff\u2019s posts on X, you\u2019d find a relationship,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt's all about marketing, less about truth or substance. It can be, as Marc notes, great marketing in the short term to highlight competitors. Of course, the challenge is that long-term success requires actual competition. We're still waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Wednesday earnings call covered Salesforce\u2019s fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter, ended Jan. 31, and full-year results. Salesforce has about 12,000 partners worldwide.\n\nBenioff also seemed to take a swipe at Microsoft and other AI vendors for spending billions of dollars on data centers to meet AI demand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing some of these engineering efforts that may or may not have some kind of huge payoff but is going to take down all of our cash and all of our margin for the next several years,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cWe're augmenting our existing product line with artificial intelligence, taking advantage of these incredible investments that are being made in infrastructure by others. And we're going to deliver the digital labor revolution.\u201d\n\nPricing Model Changes, Partner Investment\n\nAsked on the call about pricing AI by seat or by consumption, Benioff said Salesforce has historically used both models.\n\n\u201cIt's always been a mix of products that we have for humans and then products that we have for computers,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cNow we have these products that are for agents also. And agents are also a consumption model. \u2026 It's going to be a mix between what's going on with our customers, with how many humans do they have, and then how many agents are they deploying?\u201d\n\nSalesforce President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham, who is retiring May 1, added on the call that Salesforce will move in \u201cthe near future\u201d to a universal credit pricing model from a per conversation basis.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing that we've seen with our customers is they really understand the ROI associated with digital labor,\u201d Millham said. \u201cWhat we're able to provide with agents is really driving the velocity of transactions that we've seen.\u201d\n\nAs for the benefits of Agentforce on Salesforce\u2019s internal operations, Millham said that the AI product has accelerated Salesforce\u2019s quoting cycles by more than 75 percent. In outbound prospecting, Agentforce has engaged more than 50 leads per day.\n\nMillham said on the call that Salesforce is \u201cleaning into our ecosystem,\u201d with partners involved in half of the vendor\u2019s Agentforce \u201cwins\u201d and 70 percent of Agentforce activations in the quarter.\n\n\u201cOver 127,000 system integrator employees have completed Agentforce training and more than 1,000 ISVs and technology partners are building and selling agents,\u201d Millham said.\n\nBenioff\u2019s DOGE Thoughts\n\nSalesforce\u2019s call was its first since Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 47th president and since the formation of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nAsked to weigh in on Musk\u2019s cost-cutting efforts, Benioff said that he is \u201ccoming at this with a beginner's mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see what they are able to deliver with the new administration,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cWe are huge fans of the United States of America. We want us to be as successful a country as we possibly can be.\u201d\n\nBenioff said that he believes a balanced budget is important for the U.S., that he is \u201cthrilled\u201d with Salesforce\u2019s relationship with the federal government and that he\u2019s seen reports of DOGE leveraging Salesforce-owned Slack for communications.\n\n\u201cWe'll work closely with the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'll do anything we can to help them succeed. And we wish them only the best. And we're here to help at every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAsked about the potential for Salesforce AI as the federal government looks at lowering costs, Benioff said that AI will have benefits for organizations worldwide.\n\nSalesforce itself has about 76,000 employees and will leverage AI to move 9,000 support employees more into sales and marketing, he said. Salesforce doesn\u2019t plan to hire new engineers this year and has seen a 30 percent productivity increase in engineering thanks to AI.\n\n\u201cWe're the last generation of CEOs to only manage humans,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cEvery CEO going forward is going to manage humans and agents together. I know that's what I'm doing. \u2026 You can see it also in the global economy. I think productivity is going to rise without additions to more human labor, which is good because human labor is not increasing in the global workforce.\u201d\n\nSalesforce Q4 In Detail\n\nSalesforce reported $900 million in Data Cloud and AI recurring revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter, more than double year over year.\n\nSince October, Salesforce has closed 5,000 Agentforce deals, more than 3,000 of those paid.\n\nData Cloud surpassed 50 trillion records, double year over year. And half of the Fortune 100 are AI and Data Cloud customers.\n\nFor the quarter ended Jan. 31, Salesforce brought in $10 billion in revenue, up 9 percent year over year, ignoring foreign exchange. That marked the third straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth. Subscription and support revenue was $9.5 billion, up 9 percent year over year.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s current remaining performance obligation (CRPO) was $30.2 billion, up 11 percent year over year ignoring foreign exchange.

Its contribution to overall deal size increased double digits year over year, Millham said. Nearly 5 billion messages are sent weekly on Slack.\n\nTableau and MuleSoft were each in nearly half of Salesforce\u2019s $1 million-plus deals. Salesforce\u2019s industry business, including the public sector, finished the fiscal year with $5.7 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up 20 percent year over year.\n\nFor fiscal 2026, Salesforce forecasts revenue between $40.5 billion and $40.9 billion, marking a 7 percent to 8 percent increase over the just concluded fiscal 2025.

Next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $9.74 billion underwhelmed, coming in 1.7% below analysts\u2019 estimates.

This reality coupled with the ongoing migration of enterprises to the cloud drives demand for cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software that integrates data analytics with sales and marketing functions.\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Salesforce grew its sales at a 12.7% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.\n\nSalesforce Quarterly Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Salesforce\u2019s revenue grew by 7.6% year on year to $9.99 billion, missing Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for a 6.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.",

A combination COO and CFO. And more insight into the post-DeepSeek AI market. These are some of the subjects expected to come up Wednesday when Salesforce reports results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31. Partners have been reporting positive early work around the San Francisco-based CRM vendor\u2019s Agentforce AI platform, according to multiple investment firm reports issued in the lead-up to the earnings call. Salesforce has about 12,000 partners worldwide. [RELATED: Salesforce To Lay Off Over 1,000 Employees Amid AI Hiring Spree] Salesforce Fourth-Quarter 2025 Still, the hiring of a combination CFO-COO could mean Salesforce delivers a conservative forecast for its 2026 fiscal year, multiple investment firms said. Partners who spoke with Morgan Stanley said that they see budget scrutiny and extended deal cycles but are optimistic for demand improving with the U.S. presidential election over and generative AI deals moving from proof of concept to monetization. \u201cSalesforce\u2019s position as a consolidator of front office data that is ripe for GenAI disruption and a sticky workflow application to expose new functionality positions the company in the right place for the shift towards Agentic Computing,\u201d the investment firm said in a report Monday. KeyBanc predicted in a Friday report that Salesforce reports less revenue for the quarter compared with the Wall Street consensus. The investment firm predicted $10.02 billion in revenue\u2014representing 7.9 percent growth year over year\u2014compared with the consensus\u2019 $10.05 billion, representing 8.2 percent growth year over year. The firm predicted 9 percent to 9.5 percent forecast subscription revenue growth, a slight deceleration from the prior fiscal year. Here\u2019s more of what to expect when Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff and his team report quarterly earnings Wednesday.\n\nBenioff and his executives are very likely to give listeners an update on Agentforce and the vendor\u2019s AI offerings, which have presented new opportunities for Salesforce and its channel. Agentforce became generally available in October, and Salesforce should deliver version 3.0 around May. Partners have reported optimistic outlooks on Agentforce and its effects on fiscal year 2026, marking this summer as when they\u2019ll see results from customer AI execution and use cases, KeyBanc said in a report this month. Some partners have said that AI decisions are taking longer than expected. \u201cThe world is telling customers that AI is akin to the discovery of fire, so the margin decision is much larger than the typical should-I-add-this-feature decisions that is typically made,\u201d according to KeyBanc. Decisions around AI strategies \u201cinvariably bring in more parties and more decision makers and this does not lend itself to ink on paper in the near term.\u201d Partners have reported to KeyBanc the need for cost parameters to keep customers from burning through credits, the investment firm said. Those parameters could restrict Agentforce from its full potential. Salesforce may provide more details around its pricing model for Agentforce, which is about $2 per interaction with variability based on interaction complexity and the AI model used. AI vendors have been experimenting with different ways to price AI, with Salesforce rival Microsoft making some offers consumption-based and others license-based. KeyBanc praised Salesforce\u2019s pricing model for potentially preventing power users \u201cfrom bottlenecking margin expansion with scale for the longer term,\u201d according to the firm. Agentforce could add 2 percentage points of year-over-year subscription revenue growth to Salesforce\u2019s second half, according to a January report by Bank of America. That could mean an incremental $675 million in Salesforce\u2019s 2026 fiscal year and $1.6 billion in the 2027 fiscal year.\n\nWashington Named New COO-CFO On March 21, Salesforce board member Robin Washington takes on a combination chief operating and financial officer role, replacing CFO Amy Weaver\u2014whose departure was announced last year\u2014and COO Brian Millham, whose departure was announced this month. Millham will retire May 1 and become an adviser. On past earnings calls, Millham\u2014a 25-year veteran of the vendor\u2014delivered details on customer demand trends and even updated listeners on the performance of Salesforce\u2019s channel. For example, on December\u2019s earnings call, Millham said that global partners were involved in 75 percent of Agentforce deals in the quarter and nine of Salesforce\u2019s top 10 wins in the quarter. Benioff will likely use Wednesday\u2019s call to highlight Millham\u2019s work and introduce Washington. It is possible that Washington\u2019s work will put her close to Salesforce\u2019s channel. Salesforce\u2019s stock has fallen about 11 percent since it announced Millham\u2019s departure. Washington has served on Salesforce\u2019s board since 2013. She has also served on the boards of Google parent Alphabet and Honeywell International and will stay on Salesforce\u2019s board, but not as an independent director, according to the vendor. Her resume includes about 12 years with Gilead Sciences, leaving as executive vice president and CFO in 2019, serving as an adviser until 2020. She served as CFO of Hyperion Solutions for about a year. Washington\u2019s selection and combining the COO and CFO roles came as a \u201csurprise\u201d to KeyBanc. Although \u201cWashington's credentials are stellar,\u201d according to the investment firm, her \u201cmost recent hands-on operating role ended over five years ago and was in healthcare, not technology.\u201d Washington\u2019s years on the board could ease her transition into the role, William Blair said in a report this month. Overseeing sales and finance could mean \u201ca streamlined leadership structure with more integration,\u201d according to the investment firm.\n\nDeepSeek AI Observations This marks Salesforce\u2019s first earnings call since China-based AI lab DeepSeek rocked the AI world by allegedly producing comparable offers at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI and other heavyweights. Analysts could seek observations from Benioff and his team on what the technology means for Salesforce AI. Benioff has long dismissed AI models as commodities, with the data and metadata Salesforce\u2019s wares handle \u201cthe new gold\u201d in the AI era, better positioning Salesforce compared with others. In a January report, Bank of America said that \u201cDeepSeek has positive implications for AI names in the application layer,\u201d including Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot, ServiceNow Now Assistant and HubSpot\u2019s Breeze AI. \u201cA lower cost of compute could bring down AI computing costs of sales and drive better margin on AI enabled offerings,\u201d according to the investment bank. \u201cMore importantly, agentic application providers could pass savings on to enterprises via lower price, which could provide a catalyst for adoption/proliferation of agents.\u201d Systems integrators who have spoken with Bank of America have called cost \u201cthe biggest hurdle to adoption of AI applications,\u201d according to the report. However, Salesforce\u2019s expected capital expenditures, which would represent about 2 percent of revenue for the 2025 fiscal year, is about the same year over year, suggesting that Salesforce doesn\u2019t need \u201cheavy AI infrastructure investment to support Agentforce,\u201d according to KeyBanc.\n\nData Cloud, The Acquisitions On Wednesday, Salesforce leaders will likely update listeners on customer demand for its Data Cloud data unification product and integration efforts with recently acquired Zoomin and Own Co. Both acquisitions were completed in November. Calling Data Cloud \u201cthe backbone to Agentforce for enterprises with disparate data systems,\u201d KeyBanc said that it is looking for improvement to the $400 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) and 90 percent growth year over year for Data Cloud Salesforce disclosed last year. As for Salesforce subsidiaries Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack, KeyBanc called their quarterly performance \u201clackluster.\u201d Salesforce channel partners have reported \u201can uptick in Data Cloud deal attached to renewals for use with Agentforce,\u201d according to a Bank of America report in January. Partners have seen customer opportunities adopting Data Cloud with Agentforce or cross-selling opportunities with MuleSoft if the customer decides not to go with Data Cloud, Morgan Stanley reported on Monday. Partners saw strength in Salesforce\u2019s industry clouds, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, but saw weaker performance in the Marketing and Commerce clouds.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Results from Salesforce Inc. this week pose a key test for the stock and for what many believe is the next big thing in artificial intelligence: AI agents.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe software giant is seen at the vanguard of this kind of tool, which is designed to handle multi-step processes on behalf of users without human supervision. It launched its Agentforce product in October and introduced a well-received update in December, meaning this report, due after the market close on Wednesday, will be key to the case for its adoption and potential.\n\nA positive read could not only revive the stock, which has trended lower this year, but reassure investors about AI\u2019s potential to drive growth and efficiency more broadly.\n\n\u201cAI agents are now at the forefront of the software trade, and this is the first quarter where we should see hard numbers,\u201d said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial.\n\n\u201cPeople are questioning whether the capex spent on AI has been worth it, so if we see tangible results and monetization from Salesforce, that could suggest tech deserves its premiums. If it\u2019s a bad print, that will be disappointing since so much growth has already been baked in.\u201d\n\nShares fell 0.9% on Tuesday, on track for their fifth straight negative session.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s previous report came in better than expected on key metrics, thanks in large part to AI, sparking a rally that took shares to a record. However, it failed to build on that rally, and is down 17% since that December release.\n\nLast week was the worst for the stock since August, and shares closed at their lowest since November on Monday. The stock is down almost 9% this year, underperforming both the broader market and an index of software companies this year.\n\nDespite that slump, the company is seen as well positioned to deploy AI agents into its software for such functions as customer service, scheduling, and lead scoring. It has been aggressive with the strategy, hiring workers to sell the product even as it cuts jobs elsewhere.\n\nAI agent tools are proliferating; OpenAI released a research-focused one earlier this month. However, Wall Street is positive on Saleforce\u2019s ability to capitalize. Morgan Stanley sees it \u201cin the right place for the shift towards Agentic Computing,\u201d while Scotiabank wrote that checks \u201chighlighted a clear uptick in customers expanding their spend with Salesforce\u201d as a result of Agentforce, although it caveatted that near-term growth \u201cis still an open question\u201d as many customers remain in the testing stage.",

Revenue over the last twelve months was $37 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $7.3 Bil in operating profits and net income of $5.9 Bil. While the post-earnings stock reaction will depend on how the results and outlook stack up against investor expectations, a detailed look at historical results can aid you if you are an event-driven trader. Here is how \u2013 either understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the earnings announcement, or look at the correlation between immediate return and medium-term return post earnings and take a trade one-day after the announcement.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return\n\nSome observations on one-day (1D) post earnings returns:\n\nIn the past 5 years, 19 earnings data points recorded, with 9 positive and 10 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns seen about 47% of the times.\n\nand one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns seen about 47% of the times. In fact, this percentage has increased to 50% if we consider last 3 year data instead of 5.\n\nMedian of the 9 positive returns = 6.6%, and median of the 10 negative returns =-2.9%\n\nAdditional data for observed returns 5-days (5D), and 30-days (30D) post earnings are summarized along with the statistics, in the table below.\n\nCorrelation Between 1D, 5D, and 30D Historical Returns\n\nA relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has highest correlation and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \u201clong\u201d for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.\n\nIs There Any Correlation With Peer Earnings?\n\nSometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock-reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on past post-earnings performance of Salesforce stock compared with stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Salesforce. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one day (1D) return.\n\nLearn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors.

Learn More.\n\nGoogle Cloud has landed a seven-year, $2.5 billion contract with CRM giant Salesforce, marking a significant expansion of their long-standing partnership. The deal enables Salesforce customers to run its products, including Agentforce AI agents, on Google Cloud infrastructure while introducing a range of new integrations.\n\nOne key enhancement is the integration of Google\u2019s Gemini AI into Agentforce, allowing customers to input images, audio, and video prompts for more complex tasks. For instance, an insurance customer could upload damage photos when filing a claim, and the AI agent could help assess their validity.\n\nAI-powered insights and expanded cloud offerings\n\nSalesforce AI agents will gain real-time insights to Google Search via Vertex AI, providing up-to-date insights and citations. This builds on a pre-established connection such as Google BigQuery, which enables AI agents to take action based on large-scale enterprise data.\n\nThese capabilities could prove valuable for supply chain management, where AI agents can proactively identify potential disruptions \u2014 such as weather conditions or port congestion \u2014 while tracking shipments and inventory.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud will now integrate with Google\u2019s Customer Engagement Suite, allowing for AI-powered customer service tools such as real-time voice translation and intelligent agent recommendations. All Salesforce products will also be made available on the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nGoogle Cloud aims to use these integrations to attract Salesforce customers currently using Microsoft products, according to a Bloomberg report. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press release that \u201cmutual customers\u201d have been asking for a closer collaboration between the two companies.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s cloud strategy and AI computing needs\n\nLast week, reports suggested that Salesforce was in discussion with Microsoft and Oracle, and Google, about a billion-dollar cloud deal to support its AI computing needs; however, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff quickly denied this on X, clarifying that his company had already chosen Google Cloud in 2024.\n\nSalesforce and Google have collaborated for more than 15 years. In 2023, the companies jointly integrated their AI assistants, Google\u2019s Duet AI and Salesforce\u2019s Einstein Copilot, into Slack and Tableau. A Microsoft partnership also seems unlikely, given Benioff\u2019s past criticisms of Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI.\n\n\u201cSalesforce could host their stuff anywhere,\u201d Kurian told Bloomberg. \u201cBut I think they see the quality of our technology.\u201d\n\nAI agents demands for more compute power\n\nSalesforce\u2019s shift toward AI-driven agents is increasing its demand for computing resources. AI agents, which are semi-autonomous generative AI models, can interact with applications and carry out complex tasks in unstructured environments. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads with Agentforce.\n\nSalesforce has been pushing to lead in the AI agent space with new AI agent releases, including Einstein Copilot\u2019s \u201cActions\u201d and Agentforce 2.0. According to Bloomberg, these advancements are straining Salesforce\u2019s compute capacity, prompting it to seek additional cloud partnerships.\n\nIn addition to Google Cloud, Salesforce has relied on Amazon Web Services as a primary cloud provider since 2016, expanding its compute usage with AWS in late 2023. Currently, Salesforce customers can run workloads on Salesforce\u2019s own data centres, AWS, or Alibaba \u2014 with Google Cloud soon joining as a fourth option.",

Agentforce is an autonomous platform that enables customers to help themselves with popular or simple queries. With Gemini, more complex queries can be handled as well.\n\nSrini Tallapragada, Salesforce president and chief engineering and customer success officer, offered commentary in a recent press release: \u201cThrough our expanded partnership with Google Cloud and deep integrations at the platform, application and infrastructure layer, we're giving customers choice in the applications and models they want to use ... Salesforce offers a complete enterprise-grade agentic AI platform that makes it easy to deploy new capabilities easily and realize business value fast. Google Cloud is a pioneer in enterprise agentic AI, offering some of the most powerful, capable models, agents and AI development tools on the planet. Together we are creating the best place for businesses to scale with digital labor.\u201d\n\nAn apparent win-win scenario for both parties doesn't hide the fact Salesforce failed to exceed earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates last quarter. Over the past four earnings announcements, Salesforce has had a decent earnings history, missing EPS and revenue estimates once. With that said, CRM stock has failed to maintain the recent all-time high price of $369 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stock currently sits around $310 per share, which is on the lower end of the 2025 trading range so far. It will be interesting to see if Salesforce execs can wade through the earnings storm and post a strong report in a few days.\n\nWhen we evaluate earnings announcements, we can also look at the implied volatility of the options market to give us context around what the market is expecting this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this week's option expiration cycle, we can see a +/- $26.29 expected stock price move for CRM. This is about 8% of the notional value of the stock price, which puts Salesforce on the higher end of the 5% to 10% range we typically see for stocks reporting earnings.\n\nLooking farther into time, we see a +/- $48.67 expected stock price move through the June expiration. That means the expected move this week makes up for over 50% of the stock's expected range over the next 116 days. The market is not taking this earnings announcement lightly, and given the recent earnings history and expanded Google partnership, we could see fireworks after the close on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullish on Salesforce stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bullish on CRM stock for earnings, you want to hear a more detailed plan for the Google partnership expansion that was just released, and you want to see EPS and revenue estimates exceeded. The stock has had volatile moments over the past few months, but it's still way up from recent lows of $220 late last year. Salesforce bulls are looking for a momentum generator, and the Google partnership could be just that.\n\n\n\n\n\nBearish on Salesforce stock for earnings\n\nIf you're bearish on CRM stock for earnings, you may be weary of the lack of movement to the upside in the stock price after the Google news. You may also think high implied volatility in a well-known tech stock isn't necessarily a good thing. High implied volatility translates to uncertainty, and binary events are certainly unpredictable. Any sort of EPS or revenue miss may make it hard for the stock price to rally off recent lows.\n\nTune in to Options Trading Concepts Live on Wednesday at 11 a.m. CST for an in-depth options trading strategy overview for Salesforce (CRM), Snowflake (SNOW) and NVIDIA (NVDA) earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Butler, tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

In fact, 84% of CIOs believe AI will be as significant to businesses as the internet. To fully realize this potential, businesses need an agentic strategy with openness, trust, and choice at the center.\n\nThis includes:\n\nData : Highly secure and unified access to all your data, no matter where it resides, with a zero-copy architecture and enriched metadata for deeper insights. This breaks down data silos across platforms so customers don\u2019t have to sacrifice choice for an integrated experience, unlike solutions that hoard data access or require users to cobble together disparate solutions.\n\n: Highly secure and unified access to all your data, no matter where it resides, with a zero-copy architecture and enriched metadata for deeper insights.

Additionally, robust guardrails, bias detection, explainability, and toxicity controls are built-in to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Actions: Seamless integration of automation, analytics, and applications across platforms to streamline workflows and drive efficiency across the organization. This allows businesses to maximize the impact of AI agents by connecting them to their existing tools and systems, unlike solutions with limited integrations or closed ecosystems.\n\nData: Real-Time Responses in Agentforce with Google Search\n\nAgentforce will be able to use Grounding with Google Search through Vertex AI, building on the secure data foundation established through the zero copy partnership between Salesforce Data Cloud and Google BigQuery. This integration empowers Agentforce agents with the ability to reference up-to-the-minute data, news, current events, and credible citations, substantially enhancing their contextual awareness and ability to deliver accurate, evidence-backed responses.\n\nFor example, in supply chain management and logistics, an agent built with Agentforce could track shipments and monitor inventory levels in Salesforce Commerce Cloud, and proactively identify potential disruptions using real-time data from Google Search, including weather conditions, port congestion, and geopolitical events. Availability is expected in the coming months.\n\nAI: Unlocking the Power of Choice and Flexibility with Gemini and Agentforce\n\nBusinesses need the freedom to choose the best models for their needs rather than be locked into one vendor. In 2025, Google\u2019s Gemini models will also be available for prompt building and reasoning directly within Agentforce.\n\nWith Gemini and Agentforce, businesses will benefit from:\n\nAgents with multi-modal capabilities: Gemini's native multimodality lets agents \"see\" and interpret the world, enabling AI to recognize images (like error codes) and detect emotions in voice. Integrating this into Agentforce creates smarter agents that respond to audio, video, and text.\n\nGemini's native multimodality lets agents \"see\" and interpret the world, enabling AI to recognize images (like error codes) and detect emotions in voice. Integrating this into Agentforce creates smarter agents that respond to audio, video, and text. Expanded contextual understanding and reasoning: Gemini's 2 million-token context window lets agents retain and reference massive amounts of information, like entire codebases, years of customer interactions, or product documentation.\n\nGemini's 2 million-token context window lets agents retain and reference massive amounts of information, like entire codebases, years of customer interactions, or product documentation. Increased speed and efficiency: Google\u2019s Tensor processing Units (TPUs), combined with advanced techniques like those used in Google's NotebookLM, enable Gemini to process and understand information with exceptional speed and efficiency, delivering real-time responses even for complex queries. This translates to faster response times and reduced operational costs.\n\nFor example, an insurance customer can submit a claim with photos of the damage and an audio voicemail from a witness. Agentforce, using Gemini, can then help the insurance provider deliver better customer experiences by processing all these inputs, assessing the claim's validity, and even using text-to-speech to contact the customer with a resolution, streamlining the traditionally lengthy claims process. Availability is expected this year.\n\nTrust: Salesforce Platform deployed on Google Cloud\n\nCustomers will be able to use Salesforce's unified platform (Agentforce, Data Cloud, Customer 360) on Google Cloud's highly secure, AI-optimized infrastructure, benefiting from features like dynamic grounding, zero data retention, and toxicity detection provided by the Einstein Trust Layer.\n\nOnce Salesforce products are available on Google Cloud, customers will also have the ability to procure Salesforce offerings through the Google Cloud Marketplace, opening up new possibilities for global businesses to optimize their investments across Salesforce and Google Cloud and benefiting thousands of existing joint customers.\n\nAction: Enhanced Employee Productivity and Customer Service with AI-Powered Integrations\n\nMillions use Salesforce and Google Cloud daily. This partnership prioritizes choice and flexibility, enabling seamless cross-platform work. New and deeper connections between platforms like Salesforce Service Cloud and Google Cloud's Customer Engagement Suite, as well as Slack and Google Workspace, will empower AI agents and service representatives with unified data access, streamlined workflows, and advanced AI capabilities, regardless of platform.\n\nSalesforce and Google Cloud are deeply integrating their customer service platforms \u2014 Salesforce Service Cloud and Google Cloud's Customer Engagement Suite \u2014 to create a seamless and intelligent support experience. Expected later this year, this unified approach empowers AI agents in Service Cloud with:\n\nReal-time Voice Translation and Sentiment Analysis: Google Cloud AI in Service Cloud will enable real-time voice translation breaking down language barriers. New agent assist features within the Service Cloud desktop will analyze tone of voice and audio cues for deeper customer sentiment understanding.\n\nGoogle Cloud AI in Service Cloud will enable real-time voice translation breaking down language barriers. New agent assist features within the Service Cloud desktop will analyze tone of voice and audio cues for deeper customer sentiment understanding. Agent-to-Agent Intelligent Handoffs: Across all channels, virtual agents built on Google Conversational Agents will be able to seamlessly connect with Agentforce in Service Cloud for more efficient management of multi-step, customer interactions.\n\nSalesforce and Google Cloud are also exploring deeper integrations between Slack and Google Workspace, boosting productivity and creating a more cohesive digital workspace for teams and organizations. The companies are currently exploring use cases such as:\n\nThe ability for users to use enterprise search in Slack to access and act on files in Google Drive.\n\nThe ability to more easily share information between Gmail and Slack, enhancing communication and knowledge sharing.\n\nThe result is a more connected and productive work environment, where businesses can choose the best tools for their needs from employee productivity to customer service while benefiting from a seamless and intelligent workflow across platforms.\n\nExpanding Partnership Capabilities and Integrations\n\nThis partnership goes beyond core product integrations to deliver a more connected and intelligent data foundation for businesses. This is just the beginning; Salesforce and Google Cloud are committed to ongoing innovation and deeper collaboration to empower businesses with even more powerful solutions. Expected availability throughout 2025.\n\nDeeper integrations across Data Cloud, BigQuery, and Cortex Framework will make it easier than ever for customers to securely ground their AI agents in all of their enterprise data.\n\nNew native Tableau, Looker, and BigQuery integration will allow customers to manage and visualize business data across all platforms in one single UI with standardized business logic and data definitions.\n\nAbout Salesforce\n\nSalesforce helps organizations of any size reimagine their business with AI. Agentforce \u2014 the first digital labor solution for enterprises \u2014 seamlessly integrates with Customer 360 applications, Data Cloud, and Einstein AI to create a limitless workforce, bringing humans and agents together to deliver customer success on a single, trusted platform.\n\nAbout Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud is the new way to the cloud, providing AI, infrastructure, developer, data, security, and collaboration tools built for today and tomorrow. Google Cloud offers a powerful, fully integrated and optimized AI stack with its own planet-scale infrastructure, custom-built chips, generative AI models and development platform, as well as AI-powered applications, to help organizations transform. Customers in more than 200 countries and territories turn to Google Cloud as their trusted technology partner.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250224216587/en/\n\npr@salesforce.com\n\nSource: Salesforce",

Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) report, slated for Wednesday, is its first since China\u2019s DeepSeek sent the tech stock reeling. Investors are also watching for updates from Salesforce (CRM), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Home Depot (HD), and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA).\n\nFriday\u2019s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will give Federal Reserve officials more data about inflation\u2019s path in January. Market watchers are also looking for expected updates to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the housing market, consumer confidence, and the U.S. trade balance.\n\nMonday, Feb. 24\n\nOneok (OKE) and Public Storage (PSA) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nTuesday, Feb. 25\n\nFHFA House Price Index (Q4 2024)\n\nS&P Case-Shiller home price index (December)\n\nConsumer Confidence (February)\n\nDallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nand Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to deliver remarks Home Depot , Intuit (INTU) , American Tower (AMT) , Bank of Montreal (BMO) , Workday (WDAY) , Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Axon Enterprise (AXON) , and Lucid Group (LCID) are scheduled to report earnings\n\nWednesday, Feb. 26\n\nNew home sales (January)\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic is scheduled to deliver remarks\n\nNvidia , Salesforce , Lowe\u2019s , TJX Cos.

PCE rose, as expected, in December and the January reading of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a separate inflation measure, also showed price pressures increasing more than expected.\n\nAlso this week, the consumer confidence survey on Tuesday will include data on public perceptions of inflation, which Fed officials watch as an important determinant of price increases.\n\nSeveral central bankers are expected to deliver remarks this week, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker.\n\nRevisions to fourth-quarter GDP are scheduled for Thursday.

Nvidia's profit more than doubled in the third quarter amid strong sales in its data center division.\n\nSalesforce is also slated to report results on Wednesday. The cloud software provider grew revenue by 8% and delivered better-than-expected earnings in the third quarter as it rolled out its autonomous AI agents.\n\nOther tech companies on the earnings calendar this week include software firm Synopsys and cloud-based data storage company Snowflake.\n\nDell Technologies\u2019 report is scheduled for Thursday. Analysts are optimistic that the computer maker can tap into the AI boom, despite disappointing results in its most recent quarterly update. The company has been in talks on a server deal with Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nHardware retailers are also on this week\u2019s corporate calendar, with Home Depot\u2019s report expected Tuesday. The home improvement store topped analyst estimates for revenue and earnings in the prior quarter, and raised its full-year revenue outlook.\n\nLowe\u2019s report is scheduled for the following day and comes after it forecast in December a return to sales growth in 2025 while the retailer contends with a sluggish housing market that has cut into consumer spending.\n\nChrysler parent Stellantis is expected to deliver earnings this week after the Jeep maker last month reported a noteworthy drop in quarterly shipments. Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid is also scheduled to release earnings this week.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery plans to release its quarterly results this week, after the entertainment giant announced plans to split its TV business from its streaming and movie studios.

But let\u2019s be real\u2014if hard work was the secret, every Uber driver pulling 80-hour weeks would be a millionaire.\n\nThe real secret? Working on the right things at the right time.\n\nI met a founder last week who\u2019s been grinding for three years on a SaaS product, bootstrapping every penny. Solid product, no major competitors. Yet\u2026 no real traction.\n\nHis mistake? He spent all his time perfecting the product instead of figuring out how to sell it.\n\nThe lesson? Distribution > Product.\n\nMost startups die, not because the product isn\u2019t good, but because nobody knows it exists. If you\u2019re not spending 70% of your time on sales, partnerships, and marketing, you\u2019re playing the game wrong.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be everywhere\u2014you just need to be in front of the right people, consistently.\n\n3 Market News Updates from California\n\n\ud83d\udd39 AI Startups Are Dominating VC Funding: 60% of all new venture capital deals in California this quarter went to AI-related startups.

Their consensus price target of roughly $399 would suggest roughly 30% upside from Wednesday\u2019s intraday price.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts recently maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and $400 price target, pointing to early momentum in Agentforce, the company\u2019s suite of autonomous AI agents unveiled in September. The analysts said an \u201cAI halo effect\u201d is driving investments to the Salesforce platform, \u201ceven if current Agentforce spend is just gaining steam.\u201d\n\nThe customer relationship management software giant is expected to post revenue of $10.04 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.62, up from $2.29 a year ago.\n\nNew CFO To Join Salesforce in March\n\nEarlier this month, Salesforce said former Gilead Sciences (GILD) CFO Robin Washington will join the company on March 21 as chief operating and financial officer. She will succeed COO Brian Millham, who plans to retire in May, and CFO Amy Weaver, who said last year she would leave the company when a successor was named.\n\nOppenheimer analysts called Millham's departure a \"negative surprise\" but said they expect Washington \"should continue raising operating efficiency.\" The analysts reiterated an \"outperform\" rating and $415 price target, calling Salesforce \"one of the healthiest long-term profitable growth stories\" among software-as-a-service companies.\n\nSalesforce shares edged 0.5% higher in Wednesday afternoon trading to $307.85. The stock has had a tough start to 2025, with shares down close to 8% for the year so far after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2024.\n\nUPDATE\u2014Feb. 26, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.\n\n",

            "content": "Salesforce's Q4 Financial Projections and AI Impact\n\nSalesforce is poised to announce its fourth-quarter financial results today, with Wall Street analysts expressing optimism regarding the company's stock performance, largely attributed to AI-driven advancements. Analysts from Yahoo Finance highlight that 20 out of 25 analysts have rated Salesforce as a 'buy', supported by a consensus price target of $401, indicating a potential 30% increase from the recent closing price.\n\nAdding momentum to Salesforce's growth narrative, the company is projected to achieve a revenue of $10.05 billion, reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase, according to data captured by IndexBox. Furthermore, adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $2.62 from $2.29 during the same quarter last year.\n\nDeutsche Bank's continued 'buy' rating and $400 price target underscore the anticipated impact of Agentforce, Salesforce's newly launched AI-powered suite of services. Despite its infancy in terms of revenue generation, anticipation surrounding the 'AI halo effect' remains high among investors and analysts alike.\n\nMeanwhile, Oppenheimer analysts have addressed executive transitions within the company, acknowledging the impending departure of COO Brian Millham as a 'negative surprise,' yet maintaining confidence that incoming CFO and COO Robin Washington will sustain operational efficiency. Their affirmative 'outperform' rating comes with a $415 price target, underscoring Salesforce as a leading software-as-a-service entity even amidst a broader market downturn.\n\nDespite these forward-looking projections, Salesforce shares have encountered a rough patch, declining nearly 3% to $309.80 amidst market instability, contributing to a 7% decrease in stock value for 2025 following a successful 2024 against the S&P 500 index.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "Is the artificial intelligence stock market boom still wired or tired amid the emergence of China's DeepSeek? Top AI stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) face high expectations. For many companies \u2014 such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) \u2014 the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.\n\nAmid the rise of generative AI \u2014 which generates text, images, and video \u2014 it's a good time to be cautious amid the hype, especially given recent developments at Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nMany companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, semiconductor plays out-performed software companies as the best AI stocks. Investor interest in data center infrastructure stocks has cooled off in 2025. Nvidia and many other AI stocks are in the red.\n\nOne view is that software companies will emerge as the best AI stocks if they can monetize new products and services.\n\nWhat's clear is that AI stocks are under more scrutiny.\n\n\"We expect AI to transition from a 'tell me' to a 'show me' story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny,\" said a Bank of America report.\n\nAI Stocks: Meta Sets Llama Conference\n\nMeanwhile, Meta stock has advanced 7% in 2025. Further, Meta will host its first developer conference, called LlamaCon, on April 29. The event will showcase Meta's open-source AI model ecosystem, its Llama series of models.\n\nAt the event, Meta could release its own AI-driven search engine, posing a new worry for Google.\n\nFurther, Meta AI now has over 700 million monthly average users , and management believes it is now the No. 1 leading AI assistant. Meta expects to reach 1 billion users in 2025. With AI, the social media giant plans to deliver more personalized and relevant responses for users across apps, including Thread.\n\nMeta last year hired away Salesforce's top AI executive, Clara Shih, to head a new \"Business AI\" group.\n\nAlso, Morgan Stanley projects that Meta's generative AI-related revenue will grow at a 67% compound annual growth rate to $101 billion in 2028, up from $13 billion last year.\n\nNvidia Stock Tumbles\n\nOn the earnings front, Broadcom (AVGO) reported fiscal Q1 results on March 6. Broadcom stock popped on its AI chip demand outlook. Broadcom makes custom AI chips for cloud computing titans. But AVGO stock has retreated 16% this year.\n\nChip maker Nvidia reported Q4 earnings on Feb. 26. Shares tumbled on an underwhelming outlook. Nvidia stock is now down 16% in 2025.\n\nFor Nvidia, ramping up production of next-generation Blackwell AI chips in 2025 has been a key issue. Q4 revenue rose 78% from a year earlier to $39.3 billion, edging by estimates of $38.5 billion. But the manufacturing of Blackwell chips appears to be more complex and costlier, and could squeeze profit margins more than anticipated.\n\nAnd, Nvidia could face more U.S. chip export restrictions that include older devices.\n\nThe chip maker hosts the Nvidia GTC AI Conference from March 17 to March 21.\n\nCoreWeave Sets IPO\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia-backed CoreWeave has filed for its initial public offering. CoreWeave is a new AI cloud services provider. The CoreWeave IPO is expected to raise around $4 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, software maker Salesforce (CRM) reported Q4 earnings 26 that disappointed. The software maker's fiscal 2026 outlook came in light even though it's ramping up new AI products.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Q4 earnings topped expectations. SNOW stock has gained 3% in 2025.\n\nAlso, Amazon announced a new \"AI Alexa\" at an event in New York City. Amazon's smart home devices feature the Alexa voice assistant.\n\nDeepSeek Shakes Up AI Trade\n\nFurther, China startup DeepSeek has roiled AI stocks, including Nvidia.\n\nDeepSeek came out of nowhere to release a powerful AI training model developed with much less computing power. AI stocks sold off amid new questions over the outlook for capital spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nHere's IBD's take on the key questions involving DeepSeek, including U.S./China competition in artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite the emergence of DeepSeek, cloud computing titans and tech giants plan big increases in artificial-related capital spending in 2025 amid the race to human-like artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nThe AI assistant battleground now includes OpenAI's ChatGPT, xAI's Grok, DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, Perplexity and Meta.\n\nThe commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While \"training\" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to \"inferencing,\" or running AI applications, in the long run.\n\nHaving struggled to generate new revenue from \"copilots,\" software companies are now turning to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.\n\nPalantir Stock Falters\n\nWhat's more, data analytics software maker Palantir (PLTR) has pulled back after a torrid start to 2025. It's still among the best AI stocks. PLTR stock has climbed 12% in 2025 after soaring 340% last year.\n\nAmid worries over capital spending, Google stock is down 8% in 2025, while Microsoft has shed 6%. Amazon has dropped 9%.\n\nOne worry for Google is startup OpenAI, which now claims ChatGPT serves 400 million weekly active users, up from 300 million in December 2024. OpenAI has not disclosed figures for paid consumer subscriptions. Its enterprise usage figure has doubled since September 2024, reaching 2 million paying business users.\n\nAmong AI stocks to watch, Apple (AAPL) has lagged in 2025. Apple stock has shed nearly 5%.\n\nThe big question has been whether Apple Intelligence features in iPhone 16 models will spur a big upgrade cycle. Based on Apple's December quarter results, a big AI-driven upgrade cycle has not yet kicked in. And, voice assistant Siri has yet to be upgraded with advanced AI technology.\n\nU.S. Chip Export Restrictions A Wild Card\n\nThe 2025 capital spending plans of cloud computing giants remain robust.\n\nBut AI chip export restrictions remain a wild card on Nvidia stock as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). AMD stock is down 17% in 2025.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM), ARM Holdings (ARM), and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) are other AI chip makers to watch.\n\nIntel's (INTC) artificial-intelligence boss, Justin Hotard, is leaving to become CEO of telecom network gear maker Nokia (NOK).\n\nAmong other data center infrastructure plays, Arista Networks (ANET) reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street targets. Full year 2025 revenue guidance for Arista stock underwhelmed. Arista stock is down 24% this year.\n\nBest AI Stocks: Will Software Emerge?\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in generative AI leader OpenAI, having spent some $14 billion on the startup. But Oracle will now be a big provider of data center capacity to OpenAI for training AI models.\n\nMost of Microsoft's new AI revenue comes from its cloud computing business, not software upgrades.\n\nPalantir \u2014 as well as Snowflake and privately held Databricks \u2014 are focused on helping companies use proprietary data to build their own AI models. Here's a look at Databrick's strategy.\n\nIn an IBD interview, ServiceNow (NOW) Chief executive Bill McDermott explained about how the enterprise software maker aims to be an AI winner. ServiceNow stock has dipped 14% this year.\n\nMeanwhile, startups OpenAI and Anthropic are battling Google, Meta and others in developing large, multimodal and small language foundation models.\n\nAlso, AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.\n\nUntil recently, machine learning was largely limited to models that processed data to make predictions. The AI models focused on pattern recognition from existing data. Corporate spending on AI projects was modest as companies mulled return on investment.\n\nAI Stocks To Watch By Industry Group\n\nCompany Symbol Comp Rating Industry name AI angle Nvidia (NVDA) 83 Elec-Semiconductor Fabless Cloud computing giants buying more chips to train AI models or run AI workloads. Big lead over rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). CrowdStrike (CRWD) 91 Computer Software-Security AI chatbots expected to automate more functions in security-operations centers and reduce the time to detect computer hacking. Arista Networks (ANET) 80 Computer-Networking Sells computer network switches that speed up communications among racks of computer servers packed into \"hyperscale\" data centers. With AI growth, internet data centers will need more network bandwidth. Microsoft (MSFT) 65 Computer Software-Desktop Biggest investor in generative AI startup Open AI, whose ChatGPT users require Azure cloud services. Microsoft's business AI assistant, Office 365 Copilot, will have general availability on Nov. 1. Salesforce (CRM) 78 Computer Software-Enterprise Pivoted to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents from conversational co-pilots. Expected to use a mix of subscription and consumption-based pricing. Amazon.com (AMZN) 84 Retail-Internet Alexa smart assistant upgraded. Cloud computing unit working with OpenAI rivals Anthropic, Hugging Face and Falcon 40B.\n\nNew generative AI models process \"prompts,\" such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own.\n\nCompanies will aim to boost productivity by developing customized AI for specific industries. Proprietary company data will be used to train AI models.\n\nAI systems require massive computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. So the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.\n\nFor chipmakers, analysts expect a market for \"edge AI\" \u2014 on-device processing of AI apps to emerge.\n\nWill AI Startups Challenge Tech Giants\n\nWhat's more, one key question for investors is whether tech industry incumbents will be the big generative AI winners. Or, will a new wave of AI startups eventually dominate? OpenAI has told employees its now on an annual revenue run-rate of $3.4 billion, up from $2 billion in January.\n\nOpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding, valuing the startup at $157 billion, up from $86 billion early this year. The new round was led by venture-capital firm Thrive Capital. Microsoft again invested. New investors include SoftBank and Nvidia but not Apple as rumored.\n\nFurther, OpenAI recently laid out more details of its plans to adopt a for-profit business structure in 2025.\n\nLarge language models provide the building blocks to develop applications. Further, LLMs help AI systems understand the way that humans write and speak. Also, LLMs require training data for specific tasks. Companies with access to troves of data hold an edge.\n\nOpenAI is part of a wave of LLM startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Cohere. Anthropic's latest funding round values it at $61.5 billion.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

Govindarajan said that someone could interview a counselor, see what they do on a daily basis, and then use an agentic AI system to \"describe what you're trying to build and it'll give you a first draft of the solution.\" While that first draft may not be perfect, \"you go take it to this counselor, have them play with it,\" and listen to their feedback and any critique, he said.\n\n\"Then you'd come back and you tweak it again. No code. You'd give it instructions in English. That's very possible,\" Govindarajan said.\n\nThe Salesforce exec said someone who has gone through this process has demonstrated two key things.\n\n\"One, agency to go seek out a problem to solve,\" Govindarajan said. \"And two, learn the tool set \u2014 that's a no-code tool set or a low-code tool set \u2014 to be able to go get the job done.\"\n\nIn that hypothetical example, once the counselor is interested in actually buying the proposed solution, a more experienced coder could then be brought in to sharpen up the edges and fine-tune the software product.\n\nGovindarajan's remarks offer a look into how the world of software development and sales is evolving in the age of AI.\n\nSince the emergence of AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer, several coding tasks have been automated, creating uncertainty in a once-stable industry and new challenges for some younger entrants looking to break into software engineering.\n\nDuring Google's third-quarter earnings call in October, CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of new code at the company was generated by AI, though it was still reviewed and accepted by employees. Other tech giants have similarly integrated AI into coding tasks. One Microsoft manager told BI that AI helped him cut down the time he spent on coding tasks by about 70%.\n\nEven as coding becomes increasingly automated, some industry leaders believe learning the basics continues to be necessary, arguing that it's more important than ever to understand the fundamentals of technology in order to build on it.\n\nOther industry leaders seem to be leaning in the direction that soft skills could be what sets candidates apart.\n\nMark Zuckerberg said in a July interview with Bloomberg that he believed the most important skill was \"learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young.\"\n\n\"If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in, like, the art of learning something,\" Zuckerberg said in the interview, discussing what he looked for in job candidates.\n\nThe CEO said that skill applies to situations that could arise during a career at Meta, and it's key to showcase your ability to dive deep and master whatever you're working on.\n\nOr, as Govindarajan may put it: using the tools at your disposal to get stuff done.",

This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some Salesforce.com metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue- Professional services and other' to reach $515.43 million.

This new technology is currently in development, with a focus on integrating Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud features with Amadeus\u2019 advanced Central Reservations Systems (CRS) and Guest Interaction tools, ultimately targeting the global hotel industry.\n\nThe heart of this innovative service center solution will be aimed at users of Amadeus\u2019 Central Reservations System (ACRS\u2122) and iHotelier\u00ae platforms, facilitating a more seamless and simplified booking process for guests.

With this integration, the solution seeks to cut average call durations by up to 40%, while enabling agents to offer a fully tailored travel experience for each guest, creating more personalized interactions.\n\nMoreover, the system offers hotels the opportunity to boost incremental revenue by leveraging smart, context-driven special packages or exclusive offers. These are based on sophisticated guest data analytics, which provide a deeper understanding of each traveler\u2019s needs and preferences. This approach allows agents to not only provide efficient service but also deliver custom experiences that can lead to increased revenue.\n\n\u201cBuilding on the success of Amadeus Delphi \u00ae on Salesforce, Amadeus has now selected the Salesforce Platform and Agentforce to scale its new Service Center offering. This ongoing collaboration with Amadeus empowers customer service representatives with the industry\u2011leading power of Salesforce Service Cloud and Amadeus\u2019 ACRS and iHotelier solutions. We see great potential in continuing to bring innovations to our mutual customers.\u201d Brian Landsman\n\nThe flexibility of the new service center is another major highlight, offering hoteliers the ability to seamlessly integrate Salesforce\u2019s Service Cloud into their operations. This flexible solution can scale from basic functionalities, such as booking management and guest profile upkeep, to more advanced features like task automation, case management, and omnichannel communication. Whether for small boutique hotels or large international hotel chains, this enterprise-level solution is designed to cater to a wide range of operational needs.\n\nIn addition to these features, Amadeus is investigating innovative ways to automate tasks and manage cases more effectively, potentially resulting in significant operational efficiencies for hotel businesses. With the introduction of solutions like Agentforce, Amadeus is poised to transform agent productivity, streamlining workflows while providing a high level of service quality that meets the evolving demands of the modern traveler.\n\nThis next-generation service center is set to redefine how hoteliers interact with guests, blending advanced technology with personalized customer service to elevate the overall guest experience while driving operational efficiency across the hospitality industry.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to expand our partnership with Salesforce to deliver an end\u2011to\u2011end solution to help hotels better service their guests while driving bookings and incremental revenue. By creating efficiencies in the management of guests and potential guests, this innovative service center solution will enable exceptional service.\u201d Peter Waters Executive Vice President, Hotel IT Solutions, Hospitality, Amadeus\n\nShare On:",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nUsers are adopting artificial intelligence tools at an unprecedented pace. As reported by Reuters, OpenAI weekly active users surged past 400 million in February, reinforcing the observation. The artificial intelligence startup had 300 million weekly active users in December 2024, signifying an increase of 100 million users. Furthermore, the company\u2019s paying business users also crossed 2 million in February, a figure that has more than doubled from its last update in September 2024.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 15 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching\n\nWith OpenAI boasting its successes despite DeepSeek\u2019s emergence, other tech companies are also joining in the parade. xAI, led by Musk, has recently revealed Grok3, the latest iteration of its chatbot. This innovation is in direct competition with AI models by companies such as OpenAI and DeepSeek. It is being rolled out immediately to Premium+ subscribers on X. xAI is also launching a new subscription tier, SuperGrok. This would be for users accessing the chatbot via its mobile app and Grok.com website.\n\n\"Grok-3 across the board is in a league of its own\u201d.\n\nAnalysts are also pouring in their comments about xAI\u2019s latest innovation.\n\n\"The introduction of Grok-3 puts xAI back in the race for leadership in open-source LLMs. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on some benchmarks, which makes xAI relevant again\u201d.\n\nWhile Luria did point out xAI\u2019s relevancy in the leadership in open-source LLMs, it was also noted that improvements over the Grok-2 model appear to be too small to justify the enormous resources used to train it.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic, another AI startup, is doing its best to catch up with firms such as OpenAI. More than a week ago, the company projected that its revenue could reach as high as $34.5 billion in 2027. The report revealed that in a base case scenario, Anthropic's revenue would reach $12 billion in 2027, up from $2.2 billion in 2025. Back in January, Reuters also reported how Anthropic is nearing a deal to raise $2 billion at a price that values the company at $60 billion.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.",

Govindarajan said that someone could interview a counselor, see what they do on a daily basis, and then use an agentic AI system to \"describe what you're trying to build and it'll give you a first draft of the solution.\" While that first draft may not be perfect, \"you go take it to this counselor, have them play with it,\" and listen to their feedback and any critique, he said.\n\n\"Then you'd come back and you tweak it again. No code. You'd give it instructions in English. That's very possible,\" Govindarajan said.\n\nThe Salesforce exec said someone who has gone through this process has demonstrated two key things.\n\n\"One, agency to go seek out a problem to solve,\" Govindarajan said. \"And two, learn the tool set \u2014 that's a no-code tool set or a low-code tool set \u2014 to be able to go get the job done.\"\n\nIn that hypothetical example, once the counselor is interested in actually buying the proposed solution, a more experienced coder could then be brought in to sharpen up the edges and fine-tune the software product.\n\nGovindarajan's remarks offer a look into how the world of software development and sales is evolving in the age of AI.\n\nSince the emergence of AI tools such as GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer, several coding tasks have been automated, creating uncertainty in a once-stable industry and new challenges for some younger entrants looking to break into software engineering.\n\nDuring Google's third-quarter earnings call in October, CEO Sundar Pichai said more than a quarter of new code at the company was generated by AI, though it was still reviewed and accepted by employees. Other tech giants have similarly integrated AI into coding tasks. One Microsoft manager told BI that AI helped him cut down the time he spent on coding tasks by about 70%.\n\nEven as coding becomes increasingly automated, some industry leaders believe learning the basics continues to be necessary, arguing that it's more important than ever to understand the fundamentals of technology in order to build on it.\n\nOther industry leaders seem to be leaning in the direction that soft skills could be what sets candidates apart.\n\nMark Zuckerberg said in a July interview with Bloomberg that he believed the most important skill was \"learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young.\"\n\n\"If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in, like, the art of learning something,\" Zuckerberg said in the interview, discussing what he looked for in job candidates.\n\nThe CEO said that skill applies to situations that could arise during a career at Meta, and it's key to showcase your ability to dive deep and master whatever you're working on.\n\nOr, as Govindarajan may put it: using the tools at your disposal to get stuff done.",

Analysts suggest the stock prices of Salesforce could see substantial impacts due to these developments as companies adopt AI to boost efficiency and decrease costs.\n\nThe positive response from the market highlights growing anticipation surrounding Salesforce's growth potential as we step firmly footed in this new technological era. The increasing demand for AI-fueled CRM solutions has the potential to not only reinforce Salesforce\u2019s standing as an industry leader but also significantly heighten its market share and stock value.\n\nThroughout recent months, Salesforce has been diligently reinforcing its AI capabilities, clearly indicating its proactive approach to thrive within the AI integration narrative shaping the tech industry.\n\nOne of the key components of Salesforce\u2019s strategy includes the acquisition of several AI-driven analytics companies. This strengthens the company's platform, enhancing predictive analytics and automative features central to operations. These acquisitions enable Salesforce to provide more powerful insights and analysis to its customers, potentially leading to elevated client satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nWith the rollout of its AI-infused platform, Salesforce is not just upgrading its software; it is revolutionizing how businesses interact with their clients. By optimizing sales processes and automizing mundane tasks, the firm\u2019s new offerings can provide sharper insights, allowing for more personalized customer experiences which are increasingly seen as the norm.\n\nMarket reactions to these initiatives suggest they could significantly bolster Salesforce\u2019s stature as they prepare to ride the AI wave. The integration of AI is anticipated to attract new clientele and maintain existing customer relationships, enhancing Salesforce\u2019s market position and appeal among investors.\n\nInvestors are taking note of this strategic shift, recognizing the potential for solid returns as Salesforce climbs the ladder within the burgeoning AI CRM sector. This transition is more than just technological; it signifies Salesforce being responsive to both current market demands and future growth opportunities.\n\nThe three leading questions surrounding Salesforce's AI strategy illuminate its long-term viability: What advantages do the AI-enhanced CRM solutions offer? How does AI integration affect Salesforce\u2019s market position and potential growth? What challenges could arise from these AI initiatives?\n\nAI-enhanced CRM systems facilitate improved sales forecasts, personalized customer experiences, and advanced data analysis. These benefits enable businesses to make more informed decisions and strengthen their customer relations, leading to greater operational efficiency and profitability.\n\nLooking at its market viability, Salesforce's integration of AI is likely to significantly upgrade its competitive edge. The heightened demand for AI-driven solutions suggests Salesforce\u2019s advanced capabilities could draw new clients and strengthen loyalty among current users, boosting market share effectively.\n\nWhile the road forward appears promising, it's not without challenges. Maintaining data privacy and security remains imperative as Salesforce navigates new AI frontiers. There's also the need to uphold the accuracy and reliability of AI predictions, particularly as ethical concerns surrounding AI deployment continue to evolve.\n\nThe tech giant must also contend with competitive pressures from other firms enhancing their own AI capabilities, requiring them to maintain innovation and keep improving their product offerings.\n\nFor those eager to explore Salesforce\u2019s latest innovations, the official Salesforce website offers comprehensive insights and updates.",

            "content": "Wow, what a week at Salesforce Sales Kick-Off (SKO) FY \u201826. It was a whirlwind of innovation, inspiration, and connection, with so many familiar faces \u2014 partners, clients, and Salesforce folks \u2014 all energized for the new fiscal year. The conversations were buzzing, the energy was high, and the happy hour Atrium hosted was a great way to celebrate and reconnect.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, it was pretty awesome being back in Chicago! As a former Chicagoan (go Ramblers!), it was a trip down memory lane to return to my old stomping grounds. (Though, I wouldn\u2019t mind a slightly warmer locale next year\u2026 perhaps somewhere we can ditch the winter coats, scarves, and gloves and break out the sunscreen!)\n\nBut seriously, as I reflect on the informal chats, shared insights, and overall vibe, I\u2019m excited about the future of financial services and the transformative power of the Salesforce platform.\n\nThe Atrium crew (from left to right): Valerie Weis, Laura Koch, Chad Karstens, and Kara Lawhorn\n\nWith that, here are my top 5 takeaways from SKO FY \u201826 \u2014 gleaned not from formal sessions, but from the invaluable connections made and conversations had \u2014 and what they mean for banks, credit unions, wealth management firms, asset management firms, mortgage companies, and commercial banks.\n\n1. Agentforce is the real deal, but requires the right expertise\n\nThe buzz around Agentforce was undeniable, and it\u2019s clear this technology is poised to revolutionize how financial institutions operate. But to truly unlock its potential, Agentforce needs to be implemented strategically, with a focus on user needs and business outcomes. This requires deep Financial Services Cloud (FSC) expertise and AI knowledge \u2014 something we pride ourselves on at Atrium.\n\n2. Service transformation is key (and Atrium can help)\n\nFinancial institutions are feeling the pressure to deliver exceptional service while controlling costs. The key is to adopt a user-centric approach, designing solutions that empower your workforce and deliver personalized customer experiences. This is where Atrium\u2019s expertise in FSC and our focus on user-centered design can make a real difference.\n\n3. A focus on client needs, driven by data and design\n\nThe week in Chicago reinforced the importance of understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind client challenges. It\u2019s about going beyond surface-level requirements and uncovering the root causes of their pain points. At Atrium, we achieve this through deep discovery, persona identification, and data-driven insights, ensuring we deliver solutions that truly align with your unique needs and drive meaningful business outcomes.\n\n4. AI is everywhere \u2014 and those not planning for it are behind\n\nNo surprise here \u2014 AI was a hot topic. But what struck me was the sense of urgency. It wasn\u2019t just excitement about the potential; it was a realization that those not actively exploring and implementing AI are falling behind. The conversations were less about \u201cif\u201d and more about \u201chow\u201d to integrate AI, how to ensure responsible use, and how to maximize its impact. The shift is happening now: from AI as a copilot to AI as a true digital workforce, freeing up human capital for higher-value tasks. Salesforce\u2019s AI-first approach is clearly resonating.\n\n5. The Salesforce Ohana is strong\n\nConnecting with the Salesforce Ohana \u2014 partners, clients, and Salesforce employees \u2014 is truly energizing. The shared passion, the collaborative spirit, and the genuine sense of community are what make this ecosystem so special. As a first-timer, I was truly impressed by the welcoming atmosphere and the willingness to share knowledge and insights.\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead? Optimizing for success in the age of AI\n\nLast week confirmed that institutions are seeking more than just digital transformation; they need optimization. They need to move beyond large-scale overhauls and prioritize agile, outcome-driven initiatives that deliver tangible business value. This requires a shift in focus from technology deployment to strategic outcomes, powered by AI and data-driven insights.\n\nAI is the hot topic of the moment, but at Atrium, it\u2019s not just a trend; it\u2019s what we do. We\u2019ve been pioneering data and AI solutions for years, building up a deep well of expertise along the way. We understand the financial services landscape inside and out, and we\u2019ve helped countless institutions achieve their goals. When it comes to AI, we\u2019re not newbies; we\u2019re seasoned pros.\n\nWhy Atrium is the ideal partner\n\nOkay, so you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cThis all sounds great, but how can Atrium actually help my financial institution?\u201d Well, here\u2019s the thing: we\u2019re not just another Salesforce partner.

The company is in the midst of a major transformation, reorganizing its operations as part of AI integration.\n\nAfter retreating from a record high in early December, the movement of Salesforce\u2019s stock has been sluggish, and the weakness continued in the run-up to the earnings. However, the valuation is on the higher side, with the stock price nearly doubling in the past two years. Given the company\u2019s growth prospects and strong market position, CRM remains an attractive long-term investment.\n\nEstimates\n\nWhen the tech firm reports its fourth-quarter earnings on February 26, at 4:00 pm ET, Wall Street will be expecting earnings of $2.61 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $2.29 per share, on an adjusted basis. It is estimated that Q4 revenues grew about 8% annually to $10.04 billion. The Salesforce leadership expects earnings per share to be in the range of $2.57 to $2.62 in the fourth quarter, on estimated revenues of $9.90-10.10 billion.\n\nFor the whole of fiscal 2025, the management forecasts revenues between $37.8 billion and $38.0 billion, and adjusted profit in the range of $9.98 per share to $10.03 per share. Having launched an advanced version of Agentforce, its autonomous AI application that provides specialized support to customers, the company is confident about its prospects as a transformative digital labor technology. Interestingly, Agenetforce has been integrated into almost all of Salesforce\u2019s platforms including Tableau and Slack.\n\nQ3 Outcome\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, revenues grew 8% year-over-year to $9.44 billion, aided by an impressive performance by the core Subscription & Support business segment. The top line exceeded estimates. Earnings, excluding special items, increased sharply to $2.41 per share in Q3 from $2.11 per share in the same period last year. Earnings missed estimates for the first time in more than a decade. On an unadjusted basis, the company reported a profit of $1.53 billion or $1.58 per share for the October quarter.\n\nRecently, Salesforce appointed Robin Washington as president and chief operating and financial officer. Robin will assume the new role on March 21, 2025, replacing long-time veteran Brian Millham.\n\nFrom Salesforce\u2019s Q3 2025 earnings call:\n\n\u201cThis is the market for digital labor. And Salesforce has become right out of the gate here, the largest supplier of digital labor, and this is just the beginning and it\u2019s all powered by these autonomous AI agents. All of you know that. This is fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate. It\u2019s fundamentally reshaping how we operate our business and how we think about the industry itself and how you\u2019re thinking about the industry, how we\u2019re thinking about Salesforce. And with Salesforce Agentforce, we\u2019re not just imagining this future, we\u2019re already delivering it.\u201d\n\nAfter beginning the week on a positive note, Salesforce\u2019s shares experienced weakness on Wednesday and slid about 1.5% by the afternoon. However, it remains well above the 12-month average price.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nTiger Brokers, an online brokerage firm, has recently revealed that it has embedded DeepSeek's model into its AI-powered chatbot. The DeepSeek-R1 model integrated into TigerGPT signifies a strategic move made by the firm to enhance the platform\u2019s capabilities and user experience. The move comes amid brokerages and money managers racing to leverage the start-up's artificial intelligence breakthrough.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nOther Chinese brokers and fund managers who have integrated DeepSeek\u2019s model include Sinolink Securities, CICC Wealth Management, and China Universal Asset Management. Their integrations have allowed them to radicalize how they conduct research, manage risks, make investment decisions, and even interact with clients.\n\nThe R1 model will allow Tiger Brokers to help customers analyze valuations, and make trading decisions and as Wu Tianhua, Tiger Brokers' founder and CEO puts it, \"feel the beauty of investment\u201d, all by tapping on their financial data.\n\n\"Its impact is real. It's no longer a concept, or a marketing trick,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nChinese firms may be integrating DeepSeek fast into their operations, but tech firms in the US are racing hard to develop their own. In the latest news, Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup xAI has revealed the Grok-3 model, a version of its chatbot that is launched to rival OpenAI merely days after Musk\u2019s unsolicited cash bid to buy the company was rejected.\n\nGrok-3 is available to Premium+ subscribers on X. The service costs $22 a month. In comparison, full access to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o costs $200 a month. xAI has also revealed its plans to start a new subscription called SuperGrok for the bot\u2019s mobile app and Grok.com website. Bloomberg reported that xAI plans to open-source preceding versions of Grok models as soon as the latest one is fully mature. This move coincides with similar ones made by other AI firms after the launch of DeepSeek\u2019s AI models, reflecting a broader AI trend toward transparency and collaboration.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Salesforce\u2019s focus on margin expansion through productivity improvements positions it as a compelling Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) stock in the software sector.\n\nSalesforce Inc. (CRM) is experiencing a slight dip in its stock price, currently trading at $325.22, despite positive sentiments from Bank of America (BAC) Securities. Analyst Brad Sills has reaffirmed his \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on the stock, setting an optimistic price target of $440.00. This confidence stems from Salesforce\u2019s potential to reaccelerate growth, highlighted by expectations of a solid 9% to 10% revenue increase for fiscal year 2026 and an even more robust 12% to 13% by the end of FY26.\n\nSills\u2019 positive outlook \u2013 in fact, he has highlighted CRM as a top pick \u2013 is not just based on raw numbers but on broader market trends and Salesforce\u2019s strategic initiatives. He points to an improving software spending environment which could lead to increased demand for Salesforce\u2019s services. Additionally, the introduction of Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce cycle, aimed at enhancing agent productivity and customer engagement, is expected to play a pivotal role in driving this growth. This cycle introduces new tools and methodologies that could redefine how businesses manage customer relationships, thereby expanding Salesforce\u2019s market reach and deepening its penetration within existing clients.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce has been focusing on margin expansion through productivity improvements. This focus on operational efficiency not only supports higher profitability but also makes the stock more appealing as a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) investment. According to Sills, these efforts are turning Salesforce into a prime example of a company where investors can expect both growth and reasonable valuation, a rare combination in the software sector known for high valuations.\n\nDespite these promising aspects, the stock\u2019s current slight decline might reflect investor caution or perhaps a wait-and-see approach until more tangible results from these growth strategies materialize. The 1%-point beat in current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO) is commendable but hasn\u2019t yet acted as a significant catalyst for stock price movement. This might suggest that while investors acknowledge Salesforce\u2019s potential, they are looking for more concrete evidence of growth acceleration before pushing the stock price higher.\n\nBottom line, while Salesforce\u2019s shares see a minor dip, the underlying fundamentals and strategic directions outlined by BofA paint a picture of a company well-positioned for future growth. This scenario makes Salesforce a potentially attractive investment for those looking at the long-term horizon, where the company\u2019s efforts in expanding margins and leveraging new product cycles could indeed lead to significant shareholder value.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

Channel checks indicate strong deal activity and a positive outlook for Salesforce\u2019s Sales and Service Clouds, with additional potential from Agentforce pilots that are gaining traction. New use cases for Agentforce, such as call summarization and semantic search, are emerging, contributing to the company\u2019s growth potential.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce\u2019s data cloud deals are showing continued strength, supporting the data needs of Agentforce, and there is an increase in Mulesoft activity. Despite mixed results from Tableau and Slack, the overall healthy pipeline builds and the potential for revenue growth of 9% to 10% in FY26 reinforce the Buy rating. Salesforce\u2019s stock currently trades at a discount compared to its peers, making it an attractive investment opportunity as it is positioned to benefit from a more favorable software spending environment and further contribution from Agentforce.\n\nSills covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Salesforce, Microsoft, and Workday. According to TipRanks, Sills has an average return of 3.5% and a 47.34% success rate on recommended stocks.\n\nIn another report released on February 14, Goldman Sachs also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $400.00 price target.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "For the last two years, technology stocks have been rocking thanks to an overwhelmingly bullish narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Among AI's biggest winners have been software businesses, a theme that I don't see changing anytime soon.\n\nBelow, I'm going to compare two of the biggest names in enterprise software benefiting from the AI revolution: Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). While each appears well positioned to continue riding the AI wave, I see Palantir as the superior choice for growth investors.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nLet's dig into how each of these software leaders is affecting the AI sector and assess why I think Palantir will become the bigger company by the end of the year.\n\nPalantir vs. Salesforce\n\nAs of this writing (Feb. 10), Salesforce has a larger market capitalization than Palantir by roughly $52 billion. With that said, the underlying trends shown in the chart below are quite interesting.\n\nCheck out the difference between how each company's valuation has moved since AI emerged as the next megatrend. Over the last couple of years, Palantir's valuation has expanded significantly. By contrast, Salesforce's price movement has exhibited far more ebbs and flows. As a result, there's a clear convergence seen in the graph below with Palantir's market value starting to encroach on that of Salesforce.\n\nCRM Market Cap Chart\n\nCRM market cap, data by YCharts.\n\nWhat tailwinds does each software company have?\n\nSalesforce owns a number of properties including data analytics platform Tableau and messaging tool Slack. The company's prior strategy of acquiring competing businesses and integrating them with the core ecosystem helped build an end-to-end software suite that offers businesses a variety of data-driven applications, but investors eventually grew tired of such an approach.\n\nFor the last couple of years, Salesforce has been under enormous scrutiny from Wall Street to start delivering more robust revenue acceleration and profit margin expansion excluding inorganic assets purchased through acquisitions.\n\nI'll admit that Salesforce has made good on this promise ... for the most part. The issue Salesforce continues to face revolves around consistency. In other words, sometimes the company blows Wall Street's expectations out of the water, while at other times investors are left scratching their heads questioning what is going on in execution.\n\nFor this reason, I'm not entirely sold that Salesforce is going to dominate its pocket of the AI realm. Specifically, the company's newest area of interest, called agentic AI, faces fierce competition -- namely from Microsoft, a much larger company with a stronger balance sheet.\n\nWhen you add in that Salesforce faces a number of tangential competitors, including Monday.com, HubSpot, Atlassian, Asana, Workday, and more, I'm hard-pressed to see how it navigates amid all of these businesses.\n\nOn the flip side, Palantir -- which is much smaller than Salesforce in revenue and earnings -- is partnering with the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Oracle. To me, big tech's decision to work alongside Palantir as opposed to launching competing products represents enormous potential since the company continues to scale up its biggest driver of growth, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software suite.\n\nSomeone sitting at a desk looking at charts and graphs on a laptop.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLooking at the future\n\nThe chart below illustrates consensus estimates among Wall Street analysts for growth in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) between Salesforce and Palantir.\n\nCRM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nCRM revenue estimates for current fiscal year; data by YCharts.\n\nThe dichotomy shown above is obvious: Wall Street is estimating far less acceleration for revenue and earnings for Salesforce compared to Palantir over the next two years. My interpretation of these forecasts is that analysts may see more competitive headwinds for Salesforce when compared to Palantir.\n\nTo be fair, this should be expected to some degree. Salesforce is a much larger enterprise than Palantir, and so at some point the company's growth profile is going to mature.\n\nHowever, I have not fully bought into that idea because AI is supposed to represent transformative opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Given the mundane growth profile for Salesforce, I'm wondering if Wall Street shares my suspicion that AI may not be as influential for the company as it could be for other software businesses, such as Palantir.\n\nFor these reasons, I would not be surprised to continue witnessing some inconsistent trends in Salesforce throughout this year (and maybe even longer). By contrast, Palantir's prospects look strong, and I think investors could continue cheering on the stock -- propelling its valuation even higher during 2025.\n\nI think there could be some contraction in Salesforce's market cap and even more expansion in Palantir's, thereby tightening the gap between the two companies even further. If this happens, I think Palantir will emerge as the more valuable business by the end of the year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nWhile the stakes across the entire software industry are steep, they are even loftier for Salesforce and SAP due to both their current scale and reach and also their ambitions in the data-cloud and agentic AI spaces:\n\nNext week, Salesforce will release its fiscal-2025 results and is expected to post fiscal-year revenue of about $37.9 billion for the 12 months ended Jan. 31.\n\nLast month, SAP reported calendar-2024 total revenue of $36.2 billion\n\nBehind Benioff\u2019s bullishness on agents\n\nWhile the CEOs of every Cloud Wars Top 10 company have been bullish on AI in general and agents in particular, Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff has been the most visible and passionate advocate for agentic AI, stating that his company already has thousands of customers paying for its Agentforce services.

A big factor in Benioff\u2019s thinking is that his company needs to reaccelerate its growth trajectory, which has slipped to 8% as customer demands for its widespread app clouds is far below tra\n\nKlein Leads SAP Into Data Cloud Category\n\nThe hyperevolution unfolding at SAP takes a different path because SAP\u2019s apps business is currently booming, with overall Q4 cloud revenue up 27% to $4.9 billion while its Business Suite (formerly Cloud ERP Suite) revenue was up 35% to $4.1 billion.\n\nKlein is attempting to parlay that momentum in apps with a powerful new partnership with Databricks to form the SAP Business Data Cloud, which promises to harmonize for customers not only SAP data but also non-SAP data. With that ambitious foundation in place, SAP is also accelerating its rollout of new agents to be managed and optimized by its Joule \u201corchestrator,\u201d and has also rolled out an Agent Builder leveraging all of the impressive new capabilities within the Business Data Cloud. For more on those moves by SAP, please see my two recent analyses:\n\nFinal thought\n\nWhile my focus today has been on these two heavyweights and their early approaches to the new post-applications reality, Oracle will also be a major player in the worlds of agents and data, while Workday has rolled out several new agents to optimize HCM and Financial workflows for customers.\n\nAnd of course Microsoft is complementing its big early position around Copilots with a major commitment to agents as well.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no doubt that as the Agent Wars intensify, the biggest winners will be the customers.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +0.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSalesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.16 indicates a change of +11.4% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $37.94 billion and $41.34 billion estimates indicate +8.8% and +9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSalesforce.com reported revenues of $9.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.3%. EPS of $2.41 for the same period compares with $2.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.13%. The EPS surprise was -0.82%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Salesforce.com surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSalesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nJust Released: Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2025\n\nHurry \u2013 you can still get in early on our 10 top tickers for 2025.

            "content": "FEW FOUNDER-CEOs have a voice as consistent and emphatic as Marc Benioff\u2019s. As the larger-than-life force behind Salesforce, the world\u2019s number one customer relationship management (CRM) platform, Benioff\u2019s enthusiasm is unmistakable, his speech often punctuated by his favourite word: \u201cincredible.\u201d Benioff has mentioned the word 246 times in earnings calls over the past few years, 34 times in Q1 FY25 alone. This isn\u2019t a linguistic quirk. It offers a glimpse into Benioff\u2019s leadership style, which inspires confidence, both in his team and investors, helping keep the $278-billion m-cap juggernaut in motion. \u201cSalesforce is the #1 SaaS spend among Vertice customers and the 9th most common vendor by share of customers using it,\u201d says Eldar Tuvey, CEO and founder of Vertice, a spend optimisation platform.\n\nWhile the Cloud giant clocked a revenue of $34.9 billion in 2024, with $4 billion in cash flow, it\u2019s the India business that\u2019s stealing the spotlight. At the helm of this growth is former State Bank of India chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, the first CEO of Salesforce India who took over in March 2020. Since her appointment, revenues have vaulted 6x from \u20b91,505 crore in FY20 to \u20b99,117 crore in FY24, a compounded annual growth rate of over 43%. Bhattacharya has made India the hub of Salesforce\u2019s operations in Asia. \u201cMark is happy with the numbers and excited about the growth and talent in India,\u201d she tells Fortune India.\n\nFor Bhattacharya, transition from a banker to a tech CEO was far from easy. \u201cIt took me five months to decide,\u201d she says. Coming from a non-IT background, she had doubts about fitting into Salesforce\u2019s digital-first world. But her experience in public sector banking gave her a unique edge \u2014 one rooted in user experience and practical tech solutions. \u201cI realised I could contribute by bringing the user\u2019s perspective,\u201d she recalls, drawing on her tenure at the country\u2019s largest public sector bank where she spearheaded significant digital initiatives.\n\nBut it was the meeting with Benioff that sealed the deal. In the sleek, glass-walled offices of San Francisco, Bhattacharya met a leader whose approach was as expansive as it was inclusive. \u201cHe asked why Salesforce India was 37th in great places to work, while in most countries, it was never below the top 10,\u201d recalls Bhattacharya. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about revenue. It was about building a great workplace. That\u2019s something I appreciate about him.\u201d\n\nTaking over just as the Covid-19 pandemic was unfolding, Bhattacharya faced unprecedented challenges. The global crisis necessitated rapid organisational pivots, and Salesforce was no exception. \u201cInitially, I thought the virtual work set-up would last only three months,\u201d she says. She found herself handling 2,200 employees across six cities \u2014 Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Jaipur \u2014 remotely. \u201cWe still managed,\u201d attributing the success to her team\u2019s collective strength.\n\nThe first task was to integrate Salesforce\u2019s disparate segments in India. \u201cMarc wanted them unified under a single leadership to strengthen our collective identity,\u201d says Bhattacharya. This led to the creation of \u2018One India,\u2019 a unified vision that aligns with Salesforce\u2019s global \u2018Ohana\u2019 (family) culture. \u201cUltimately, both sectors \u2014 banking and IT \u2014 are centered on service. Effective management of people is crucial for success,\u201d says Bhattacharya.\n\nSalesforce India has since undergone a transformation. The headcount has surged nearly 5X to around 9,000, mirroring the rapid digitalisation across the country. This reflects the expanding depth and influence of Salesforce in India. \u201cIndia is a critical hub driving growth and innovation. Arundhati\u2019s leadership has been incredible. In just four years, she\u2019s made a phenomenal impact across the company,\u201d says Salesforce president and CFO Amy Weaver.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk has recently been in the news for his vain attempt to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, but that\u2019s not all. It has recently come to light that Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company, xAI, is canvassing potential investors for a roughly $10 billion funding round. This could value the company at an estimated $75 billion.\n\nAccording to media reports, existing investors, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Valor Equity Partners, are in discussions to participate in the transaction. However, the terms of the round aren\u2019t finalized yet and may change.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings\n\nAccording to data compiled by PitchBook, xAI was last valued at $51 billion. The startup was launched by Musk in 2023, a rival to OpenAI. xAI has recently revealed that Grok3, its AI chatbot, is in the final stages of development and will be released in a week or two.\n\n\u201cGrok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we\u2019ve done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that\u2019s been released, that we\u2019re aware of, so that\u2019s a good sign\u201d.\n\nWith the competition in the AI world heating up fast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has recently revealed its plans around GPT-5, and how the company is going to work on simplifying its offerings. He stated that he realizes how the company\u2019s models and product offerings are getting complicated, bringing a solution for user ease.\n\n\u201cWe hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence\u201d.\n\nCurrently, users are required to manually select various AI models for different tasks. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, internally known as Orion, will be the company\u2019s final \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d After its release, the company will unify o-series and GPT-series models.\n\nIt will do so by offering a system that can use all of its features and determine when to take more or less time to think. The GPT-5 model will be launched as a comprehensive AI system that will incorporate o3 along with other technologies.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$368 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$318. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$327 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Salesforce\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Salesforce?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $446.27, but it is currently trading at US$327 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Salesforce\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Salesforce generate?\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth February 16th 2025\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 58%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.",

But many sales tech providers are pushing a similar narrative to excite the market and reignite funding and growth. Early-stage investors such as Y Combinator are pouring money into similar sales startups, while even the mighty Salesforce is placing its hopes on its new Agentforce platform. Since its release at Dreamforce, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been touting such \u201cdigital labor platforms\u201d as a trillion-dollar market opportunity. Benioff seems to have convinced the financial markets in the process, with Salesforce\u2019s market cap rising by USD50 billion as a result.\n\nAgent coworkers: Reality or fiction?\n\nAmid the current hype blizzard around agentic AI, it is vital that sales leadership and those with ownership of sales technology can separate reality from fiction. They must understand the real near-term potential and priorities while preparing their organizations for longer-term change being driven by these innovations. Having spent some time speaking to sales leaders and sales tech owners in recent months, I think this is a challenge for many in B2B.\n\nIt\u2019s time to take a hard look at the AI coworker narrative\n\nTaking a more cynical perspective, here are five reasons why the \u201cAI agent as coworker\u201d narrative is nonsense:\n\nIt\u2019s transparently self-serving. As mentioned above, agentic AI is a gift for the sales tech industry. When a company the size of Salesforce is using agents to significantly reframe the perceived long-term value of the company with very limited evidence, buyers should rightly be wary of the claims being made. It\u2019s just automation. You have to admire Benioff\u2019s chutzpah in defining digital labor as some brand-new massive market opportunity. But to many, it just sounds like automation. Like every other phase of automation since the beginning of the industrial age, this phase is also about doing more with fewer human resources. The market is blurring agentic differentiation. Forrester defines agentic AI as general AI systems, trained to act invisibly on behalf of an enterprise or individual, performing tasks, making decisions, and interacting with data or other systems autonomously. But with agents the flavor of the month in B2B tech, providers have been adjusting their go-to-market efforts for existing approaches to bask in the agent glow. Copilots, intelligent assistants, and single and multiple agents all now occupy a spectrum of what is claimed to be agentic, creating confusion and increasing skepticism for buyers. There\u2019s a false equivalency of agents as virtual employees. Attempts to establish some sort of equivalency between agents and actual employees is not only misleading but demeaning to B2B professions. It misrepresents the agentic role in B2B processes, which will increasingly be invisible to both employees and customers. \u201cCoworker\u201d suggests relationships or partnerships to complete tasks or processes. Human employees surrounded by AI robots at Amazon warehouses or Tesla factories do not see these robots as \u201ccoworkers,\u201d so why should sellers? The ROI potential is exaggerated. In the world of software, providers talking big on ROI and productivity is nothing new. The hype around agents often presents a form of sales leadership \u201cfever dream\u201d of 24-hour selling uninterrupted by sickness or PTO. But the limited, task-level scope of many proclaimed \u201cagent\u201d solutions should rightly make buyers wary. Forrester\u2019s ongoing studies of sales productivity over the past 10 years or more have shown that the explosion in sales technology during this period has only had a limited impact on seller productivity. Sales productivity has a tendency to soak up the productivity enhancements provided by evolutionary waves of sales technology, finding new efficiency barriers and roadblocks along the way. Potential AI impacts on productivity should be viewed in this context.\n\nHealthy AI skepticism is good\n\nHolding such views does not automatically imply that you may be an AI troglodyte. Being skeptical of the coworker narrative is not at odds necessarily with believing in the long-term value or impact of AI in sales. Having a balanced view will actually help inform a better AI strategy and prioritize more impactful use cases. It should also inform stronger change management approaches that combine adoption, employee satisfaction, and, ultimately, more significant company impact.\n\nThe original article is here.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CDOTrends.

            "content": "I went down another rabbit hole of AI tools a few months ago. But it wasn\u2019t for writing, design, or analytics this time. It was for something outside my expertise: sales.\n\nI\u2019ve never had to hit a sales quota, but I\u2019ve seen the pressure of chasing deals and keeping up with follow-ups. Sales is a constant balancing act of research, outreach, relationship-building, and administrative work that consumes more hours than most people realize. That\u2019s what got me curious about the best AI sales assistant software.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d heard claims that these AI sales tools can handle prospecting, draft personalized emails, remind reps to follow up at the perfect time and predict which deals will likely close. It sounded like the kind of magic sales teams could use, but I wanted to see if the reality lived up to the hype.\n\n\n\nRecently, I tested these AI sales assistant software solutions. Some were frustratingly rigid, others made big promises but delivered generic automation that no real salesperson would trust.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever lost a deal because a lead went cold while you were buried in admin work, or if you\u2019ve wished for a way to spend more time selling and less time organizing, these AI sales assistants might be exactly what you need.\n\n8 best AI sales assistant software: My picks Salesforce Sales Cloud for boosting sales productivity and forecasting with comprehensive CRM capabilities and AI ($165/month) HubSpot Sales Hub for simplifying sales with user-friendly CRM and sales engagement tools ($20/month) Apollo.io for connecting with prospects using data intelligence and engagement tools ($49/month) ZoomInfo Sales for a comprehensive B2B contact database that helps you find accurate, up-to-date leads (pricing available on request) Gong for delivering conversational insights to improve sales performance through call recording and analysis (pricing available on request) Fathom for facilitating knowledge sharing with AI-driven meeting transcription and highlights (Free edition available, paid plan starts at $19/month) Instantly for B2B email outreach with automated campaigns and lead management features ($30/month) Clari for powerful sales forecasting and pipeline management with real-time insights (pricing available on request) *These AI sales assistant software solutions are top-rated in their category, according to G2 Grid Reports. I\u2019ve also added their pricing to make comparisons easier.\n\nMy Experience with the best AI sales assistant software\n\nAI sales assistant software is like having a smart, always-on sales partner that helps manage the busy work so sales teams can focus on closing deals. While I don\u2019t work in sales, I\u2019ve tested various AI-driven tools designed to automate follow-ups, prioritize leads, generate personalized outreach, and analyze deal trends. These tools enhance productivity by handling repetitive tasks, surfacing insights, and ensuring you\u2019re ready to increase sales.\n\nHow did we find and evaluate the best AI sales assistant software? I explored AI sales assistant software at all levels, from basic tools that automate follow-ups and lead prioritization to advanced platforms with AI-driven analytics, predictive insights, conversation intelligence, and seamless CRM integrations. I evaluated their core functionalities, tested them in different sales workflows, and analyzed feedback from sales professionals to gauge real-world effectiveness.\n\n\n\nI reviewed hundreds of G2 ratings, cross-referencing my findings with G2\u2019s Grid Reports to assess accuracy, usability, efficiency, and overall value. After extensive research and hands-on testing, I\u2019ve compiled a list of the best AI sales assistant software for teams of all sizes.\n\n\n\nI consulted sales professionals with direct experience and verified their insights against trusted G2 reviews for tools I couldn't test firsthand. The screenshots in this article include a mix of those captured during testing and those sourced from G2 vendor pages.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, the best AI sales assistant software pinpoints high-priority leads based on engagement data, suggests personalized follow-ups, and seamlessly integrates with CRMs to organize everything. Some tools analyze past deals to predict which prospects will most likely convert. In short, the best AI sales assistants act like intelligent co-pilots, giving sales teams the insights and automation they need to work more efficiently, close more deals, and stay ahead.\n\nHow I tested the best AI sales assistant software solutions\n\nBelow are the factors I considered while evaluating the best AI sales assistants.\n\nCore functionality and automation capabilities: When evaluating AI sales assistant software, I first consider its ability to automate and streamline essential sales tasks. The tool should handle lead qualification, follow-ups, meeting scheduling, CRM updates, and sales forecasting. The best AI assistants use natural language processing (NLP) to engage with prospects intelligently, adapting their responses based on previous interactions. If the AI lacks genuine decision-making capabilities and simply automates repetitive tasks without adding strategic value, it\u2019s not worth investing in.\n\nWhen evaluating AI sales assistant software, I first consider its ability to automate and streamline essential sales tasks.

If the AI lacks genuine decision-making capabilities and simply automates repetitive tasks without adding strategic value, it\u2019s not worth investing in. Integration with existing tech stack: A great AI sales assistant tool integrates seamlessly with your current sales tools. I don\u2019t want a system that forces me to restructure my workflow or creates data silos. I check if it integrates smoothly with major CRM platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zoho and communication tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email clients. Real-time bidirectional data syncing is crucial for accessing updated information without manual data entry.\n\nA great AI sales assistant tool integrates seamlessly with your current sales tools.

Real-time bidirectional data syncing is crucial for accessing updated information without manual data entry. Personalization and engagement quality: Personalization is one of the most significant differentiators in sales. I need AI beyond generic responses and tailoring interactions based on customer behavior, preferences, and previous conversations. The ideal AI sales assistant software analyzes past engagements and adjusts its messaging to improve conversion rates. If the AI sends standardized, robotic messages, it risks alienating potential customers instead of nurturing them. I also check whether the AI supports multi-channel outreach, including email, chat, and even voice, so you can connect with prospects in their preferred communication style.\n\nPersonalization is one of the most significant differentiators in sales.

Scalability and performance under load: A sales assistant software should grow with your business. Scalability is crucial because an AI that works well for a small team might struggle under increased demand. I assess how many leads, conversations, and interactions the AI can handle simultaneously without affecting performance. Machine learning capabilities are another consideration because I want AI that improves over time rather than remains static. If the software starts lagging or failing to keep up with an expanding sales pipeline, it\u2019s not a viable long-term solution.\n\nA sales assistant software should grow with your business.

If the software starts lagging or failing to keep up with an expanding sales pipeline, it\u2019s not a viable long-term solution. Analytics and data-driven insights: Beyond automation, I need AI that provides actionable insights. The software should track and analyze sales performance, lead engagement, and customer behavior, helping refine your sales strategy. AI-powered reporting should exceed basic metrics, offering predictive analytics on deal closures and sales trends. If the reporting tools are too basic or lack customization, you might still need to rely on external analytics platforms, which defeats the purpose of having an AI sales assistant.\n\nTo be included in the AI sales assistant software category, a product must:\n\nSupport sales teams by automating routine tasks and delivering predictive insights\n\nUse built-in artificial intelligence as a core functionality\n\n*This data was pulled from G2 in 2025. Some reviews may have been edited for clarity.\n\n1. Salesforce Sales Cloud\n\nI find it impressive how Salesforce Sales Cloud can predict sales trends with AI-driven forecasting. Instead of just generating static reports, it identifies patterns and gives a clearer picture of what might happen next. I can see how this would be useful for sales teams trying to make data-backed decisions instead of relying on instinct. The ability to anticipate changes in the pipeline could help businesses prepare rather than react.\n\n\n\nOne thing I appreciate about AI-driven sales tools is how they simplify lead management. I\u2019ve seen that Salesforce Sales Cloud assigns priority levels to leads based on their engagement and historical data, which seems like a smart way to focus efforts on the right prospects. I imagine this would help sales teams avoid wasting time on leads that are unlikely to convert.\n\n\n\nI like having AI suggest the best next steps for a deal. I appreciate that Salesforce Sales Cloud analyzes ongoing sales activities and offers data-driven recommendations to keep things moving. If a deal is stalling, it can flag potential issues and provide actionable advice.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve noticed how AI in sales software is becoming more personalized, and Salesforce Sales Cloud seems to lean into that. Based on previous interactions, it suggests the best way to engage with each prospect. I can see how this would help sales reps avoid sounding robotic or scripted.\n\n\n\nI can see how the AI features in Salesforce Sales Cloud might take some time to master. While they offer powerful insights, they also seem complex, especially for sales teams that aren\u2019t used to working with AI-driven tools. I imagine that without the right training, many users might not take full advantage of everything the software can do.\n\n\n\nOne thing that stands out about AI-driven sales tools is that they\u2019re only as good as the data they work with. The AI's recommendations could be misleading if the information entering Salesforce Sales Cloud is incomplete or outdated. This would require businesses to be extra diligent about keeping their data up-to-date.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen how AI-powered systems can sometimes be rigid regarding customization, and Salesforce Sales Cloud seems to have similar limitations. While AI offers useful recommendations, adjusting them to fit a company\u2019s sales strategy might be difficult. Making deeper changes requires technical expertise or additional paid customizations.\n\n\n\nWhile the basic features provide some automation, the more powerful AI-driven insights often require an upgrade to premium tiers or additional purchases. I imagine this could be a barrier for smaller businesses that want the benefits of AI but can\u2019t justify the extra expense.\n\nWhat I like about Salesforce Sales Cloud: I find it impressive how Salesforce Sales Cloud predicts sales trends instead of just generating static reports. The AI identifies patterns and gives a clearer picture of what might happen next, which seems like a game-changer for sales teams.\n\nOne thing I appreciate about AI-driven sales tools is how they simplify lead management, and Salesforce Sales Cloud seems to do this well. It automatically ranks leads based on engagement and historical data. What G2 users like about Salesforce Sales Cloud: \"Its Kanban boards and Sales Path are useful for managing sales processes. Customizable real-time reports and dashboards provide valuable insights. Its Process Builder and workflow rules streamline the sales cycle. The Salesforce mobile app allows access to CRM from anywhere. It provides accurate AI-based sales forecasts. It has a feature called Chatter, which allows users to share updates within Salesforce quickly.\"\n\n\n\nSalesforce Sales Cloud Review , Shilpa G.\n\nWhat I dislike about Salesforce Sales Cloud:\n\nI can see how the AI features in Salesforce Sales Cloud might take some time to master.

Slow speeds and occasional downtime have disrupted our operations, especially with large datasets. The user interface feels somewhat overwhelming, making navigating and finding what I need difficult. Sometimes, the standard reports and dashboards lack the customization needed for more advanced reporting.\"\n\n\n\n- Salesforce Sales Cloud Review, Patricio G.\n\nWant to use AI in sales?

It doesn\u2019t look like a platform that forces a rigid workflow, which is important for sales strategies that evolve. I would want a system that lets me create pipelines and automation in a way that makes sense for my sales style rather than being stuck with a predefined setup.\n\nI see the appeal of automation for repetitive sales tasks. Things like follow-ups, email sequences, and deal tracking can be time-consuming, so having a system that ensures no lead slips through the cracks sounds valuable. I would want AI-driven insights that optimize outreach without manually checking in on every prospect.\n\nI\u2019d want a sales platform that provides meaningful insights beyond basic activity tracking, and HubSpot Sales Hub appears to offer that. Access to data on how prospects engage with emails, links, and other content would make it easier to understand their level of interest. Instead of guessing which leads are worth pursuing, you can rely on engagement metrics to make more informed follow-ups.\n\nSales software must allow users to access detailed reports. HubSpot Sales Hub offers analytics that break down sales performance by individual reps, pipeline stages, and outreach methods. I want a system that helps identify which strategies work and which need adjustment.\n\n\n\nCustomization is important in a sales platform. While HubSpot Sales Hub seems flexible, I can see how predefined workflow structures could be frustrating when tailoring automation to a specific sales process. If you had a particular way you wanted to set up follow-ups or deal tracking, you wouldn\u2019t want to run into restrictions that force you to adjust your strategy to fit the software.\n\n\n\nAI-powered sales insights sound great, but predictions aren\u2019t always perfect. I\u2019ve seen that HubSpot Sales Hub\u2019s AI-driven lead scoring can sometimes misjudge a prospect's quality. I wouldn\u2019t want to rely too heavily on AI only to discover that some flagged leads aren\u2019t interested while others get overlooked.\n\nWhat I like about HubSpot Sales Hub: I like that HubSpot Sales Hub allows flexible sales processes rather than forcing a rigid workflow. It seems like a platform that lets you build pipelines and automation that fit your sales strategy.\n\nAutomation for follow-ups, email sequences, and deal tracking is a big advantage. I\u2019d want AI-driven insights that optimize outreach without requiring constant manual intervention. What G2 users like about HubSpot Sales Hub: \"We can get a very clear view of the entire customer pipeline, which easily helps manage customer engagements with the help of automated emails and sequences. They have a great support team, and in case of any issues, they are always willing to go the extra mile to assist.\"\n\n\n\nHubSpot Sales Hub Review , Shyam K.\n\nWhat I dislike about HubSpot Sales Hub:\n\nWhile there\u2019s flexibility, I can see how some workflows might feel restrictive. If you had a specific way of managing follow-ups and deal tracking, you wouldn\u2019t want to be forced into a predefined structure.\n\nAI-powered lead scoring sounds helpful, but I wouldn\u2019t rely on it completely. If the system misjudges lead quality, it could mean wasted effort on unqualified prospects while missing strong opportunities.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about HubSpot Sales Hub:\n\n\"There is some redundancy with adding information into fields, but perhaps AI advancements can minimize its need. Specialized templates for certain industries like biotechnology or pharmaceuticals would be a nice addition and minimize the time involved in customizations.\u201d\n\n\n\n- HubSpot Sales Hub Review, Verified User in Pharmaceuticals\n\nAsking sales to do more cold calling? Equip them with the best auto dialers we tested this year.\n\n3. Apollo.io\n\nI find the idea of AI-powered lead prioritization valuable, especially when working with many prospects. Apollo.io seems to take the guesswork out of deciding who to reach out to by ranking leads based on engagement data. Instead of spending time chasing cold leads, this AI sales assistant helps focus efforts on those most likely to convert.\n\n\n\nEmail timing and messaging play a huge role in outreach success, and I like how Apollo.io uses AI to optimize this. From what I understand, it analyzes engagement data to predict the best times to reach out and which email styles are most effective. That could mean fewer wasted emails and higher response rates, which every salesperson would appreciate.\n\n\n\nKeeping up with leads across multiple platforms can be overwhelming, and I appreciate that Apollo.io handles that with AI-driven automation. From what I\u2019ve seen, it can manage email sequences, call scheduling, and LinkedIn outreach, which would keep sales teams on track without manual follow-ups.\n\n\n\nI also appreciate that Apollo.io uses AI to suggest personalized messaging based on a prospect\u2019s background, industry, or past interactions. That sounds useful for keeping emails and messages relevant without spending too much time researching each contact. AI-generated recommendations could help make outreach more effective, especially for teams handling many leads.\n\n\n\nWhile AI can be incredibly powerful, it usually takes some time to understand how to use it effectively. If the system requires a lot of input and adjustments before making accurate recommendations, that could slow down adoption. Sales teams don\u2019t always have time to experiment with AI settings, so an overly complex setup might be frustrating. If the learning curve is steep, I imagine some users might not fully take advantage of what AI offers.\n\n\n\nAI-generated lead scoring sounds great in theory, but I know that algorithms don\u2019t always get things right. From what I\u2019ve gathered, Apollo.io ranks leads based on engagement and behavior, but no AI can perfectly predict who\u2019s ready to buy. If the system over-prioritizes certain leads while overlooking others, that could lead to missed opportunities.\n\n\n\nAI-driven messaging seems useful, but I wonder if it could create unintended biases. If Apollo.io\u2019s AI bases its suggestions on past successful outreach, it might repeatedly push similar messaging styles. That could lead to repetitive communication that lacks originality or fails to connect with diverse prospects.\n\nWhat I like about Apollo.io: I like how Apollo.io\u2019s AI takes the guesswork out of lead prioritization. Instead of wasting time on cold leads, it helps focus on those most likely to convert.\n\nIf Apollo.io can predict the best time to send emails and which styles work best, that could improve engagement rates. I appreciate any tool that helps make outreach more strategic and effective. What G2 users like about Apollo.io: \"My favorite part about Apollo.io is the ability to set up sequences and workflows. This saves countless hours as opposed to manual emailing and contact searches. After just a few days and two sequences, I already have my first meeting set up. Pipeline management is extremely important for all salespersons and companies, large and small. This tool maximizes employees' time, maximizing company resources at an affordable cost.\"\n\n\n\nApollo.io Review , Ryan D.\n\nWhat I dislike about Apollo.io:\n\nAI tools can be powerful, but I know they often come with a learning curve. If Apollo.io requires too much manual setup before delivering accurate insights, that could slow adoption.\n\nLead scoring with AI sounds promising, but I\u2019d be cautious about trusting it completely. If Apollo.io over-prioritizes certain leads while overlooking others, that could mean missed opportunities.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Apollo.io:\n\n\u201cIt takes a very technical person to put together your sequencing, workflows, and search contacts properly to put the system to good use. A typical salesperson isn't able to dive so deep into all the technical aspects of this tool. In other words, ensure you have a technical expert when onboarding this in your business.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Apollo.io Review, Chad B.\n\nGrowing your sales team in 2025? Check out the most important sales KPIs you should track.\n\n4. ZoomInfo Sales\n\nZoomInfo Sales makes cold outreach more efficient by providing verified contact information. Rather than wasting time searching for email addresses or phone numbers, I can quickly access a list of prospects more likely to engage. This allows you to scale outreach efforts while maintaining personalization. Additionally, having direct dial numbers means you don\u2019t always have to go through gatekeepers, increasing the likelihood of connecting with decision-makers.\n\nNot all leads are equal, and ZoomInfo helps prioritize high-value prospects. With firmographic and intent data, I can focus on leads that show signs of being in an active buying cycle. Instead of contacting every contact on a list, you can narrow efforts to those more likely to convert. This means you are increasing volume and improving the quality of your outreach.\n\nI also appreciate how ZoomInfo Sales provides detailed information about a company's tech stack. Access to a prospect's tech stack makes it easier to tailor outreach with a more relevant pitch. Instead of sending generic sales messages, you can highlight how your product complements or replaces a competitor\u2019s tool.\n\nWhile ZoomInfo is valuable for enriching data, the accuracy isn\u2019t always perfect. I may still encounter outdated contact details, incorrect job titles, or missing phone numbers. This means users sometimes need to cross-check information before reaching out, adding an extra step to their workflow.\n\nIf I\u2019m looking into Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets, I might find the data coverage less reliable than in North America or Europe. Sometimes, the company size estimates or employee counts are inaccurate, making it harder to assess target companies. This means users must supplement their research with other sources to verify details.\n\nWhile ZoomInfo provides a vast database, sometimes the contacts are redundant or repeated under different listings. This can lead to wasted effort when contacting the same person under slightly different company names or job titles. If I don\u2019t carefully filter and clean the list before outreach, I might accidentally message the same lead twice, creating a negative impression.\n\nWhat I like about ZoomInfo Sales: Instead of spending hours searching for the right email addresses or phone numbers, I can quickly pull up a list of verified contacts that are more likely to respond.\n\nNot every lead is worth pursuing, and ZoomInfo helps me focus on the ones that truly matter. With firmographic and intent data, I can prioritize prospects already showing signs of being in a buying cycle rather than reaching out blindly. What G2 users like about ZoomInfo Sales: \"As an outsourced SDR/Lead Generation business, having great data is fundamental to delivering successful campaigns for our clients. ZoomInfo gives us direct access to the stakeholders that can influence the procurement of our client's services, saving us valuable time and stopping us from getting blocked by gatekeepers. It also integrates seamlessly with our CRM, saving wasted time on administration.\"\n\n\n\nZoomInfo Sales Review , Eddy R.\n\nWhat I dislike about ZoomInfo Sales:\n\nWhile ZoomInfo Sales provides valuable contact information, I\u2019ve noticed that the data isn\u2019t always 100% reliable. Sometimes, phone numbers are outdated, job titles are incorrect, or key details are missing altogether.\n\nOne challenge I\u2019ve encountered is that ZoomInfo Sales sometimes lists the same contact multiple times under different entries. If I accidentally reach out to the same person twice, this can lead to wasted effort.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about ZoomInfo Sales:\n\n\"Due to the huge volume of data, some percentage is always out of date. For instance, a contact might have moved on to a new company, and ZoomInfo Sales might still show them in their previous role, or ZoomInfo Sales might say that they are using a certain infrastructure. When you reach someone and talk to them, you find out they switched suppliers already.\u201d\n\n\n\n- ZoomInfo Sales Review, Danny S.\n\n5. Gong\n\nOne of the biggest pain points in sales is drafting personalized follow-ups after meetings. With Gong, I don\u2019t have to manually jot down notes or replay entire calls just to extract key details. It automatically summarizes discussions, highlights action items, and sends recaps within minutes. This means users can quickly send impactful follow-ups without second-guessing what was discussed.\n\nSales forecasting is usually a cumbersome, manual process, but Gong\u2019s forecasting tool makes it much easier. Instead of juggling spreadsheets and back-and-forth emails, I can see real-time insights. It gives users a clear picture of where deals stand and helps them prioritize outreach. You can also quickly see the timeline of engagements and interactions without digging through multiple sources.\n\nUnlike other sales tools that require extensive onboarding, Gong integrates into your workflow almost instantly. I have seen users mentioning that their team didn't need formal training to use it effectively. Calls are automatically recorded and saved without extra steps, so you can focus on selling instead of dealing with administrative tasks.\n\nWhen working with multiple stakeholders, details can easily slip through the cracks. With Gong, I can quickly check whether a specific topic was discussed in a previous call. This is particularly useful when aligning with account managers, customer success teams, or other sales reps. You don\u2019t have to rely on secondhand information if a client claims something was promised. You can pull up the exact call and verify what was said.\n\nWhile Gong captures conversations well, I sometimes struggle to locate specific information across calls. For example, the search function doesn't always make it easy if you want to see all discussions related to a particular topic from a specific customer. You must sift through multiple results instead of getting a consolidated view of relevant moments. A more refined search capability would make it easier to pinpoint exactly when and where a topic was discussed.\n\n\n\nRight now, all my recorded meetings exist in one central location, which can make finding specific calls tedious. It would be useful to have customizable folders or categories for meetings like discovery calls, negotiations, or internal discussions. Instead, I must rely on naming conventions or timestamps to sort through my calls.\n\nWhen working with multiple stakeholders from a single company, I\u2019d like an easier way to see all past interactions grouped. You must manually piece together different conversations, which can be inefficient. It would simplify my workflow if I could pull up a single timeline that consolidates all calls, emails, and key points from one customer in one place.\n\nWhat I like about Gong: Instead of replaying calls or scrambling to take notes, I get an instant summary with action items. This allows me to send personalized, well-informed follow-ups in minutes.\n\nI can see real-time insights into my pipeline without juggling spreadsheets or manual reports. Tracking deals and prioritizing outreach is much easier when I have a clear timeline of customer interactions. What G2 users like about Gong: \"The intuitive and AI-driven nature of Gong is one of the only ways I can continue to be successful in my career in sales. For example, as someone frequently clogs her calendar with customer meetings, I find it very hard to remember to enter notes into our CRM, and sometimes even forget what I need to do as a follow-up to a call. Gong Engage has cut down any (sometimes all) time I spend on follow-up, allowing me to focus more on larger priorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nGong Review , Randi P.\n\nWhat I dislike about Gong:\n\nIf I need to track a particular discussion across different meetings, the search function doesn\u2019t always make it easy. I often have to sift through multiple results instead of getting a consolidated view.\n\nAll my calls exist in one central location, making it hard to find the ones I need quickly. Customizable folders or categories for different types of meetings would help streamline my workflow.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Gong:\n\n\"The search function isn't exactly top-notch. I don't usually get the results I am looking for, although some are pretty close. It would be good if I could search based on the types of calls, e.g., cadence, success review, onboarding, etc.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Gong Review, Michael O.\n\n6. Fathom\n\nThe AI in Fathom captures details effectively, even in fast-paced conversations. It ensures that nothing important is missed during sales calls. I can rely on it to extract meaningful insights without reviewing every call. This level of accuracy makes it a valuable tool for staying on top of sales conversations.\n\nThe AI significantly reduces the time I spend manually capturing and reviewing notes. It allows users to focus more on the sales process than administrative tasks. This efficiency ensures you can move quickly from one prospect to another without losing track of key details. The time that would have been spent on documentation is now redirected toward engaging with potential clients.\n\nWith Fathom, I don't have to worry about manually initiating the note-taking process on every call. The AI captures and summarizes conversations automatically. This means you can step into meetings without extra preparation related to note-taking.\n\nFathom does its job without interfering with the actual conversation. It works in the background, ensuring that interactions feel natural and not overly monitored. This makes it easier to build rapport with clients without them feeling like AI is analyzing them. I don\u2019t have to worry about the software interrupting the conversation or creating an awkward dynamic.\n\nAfter a call, I can quickly refer to the AI-generated notes rather than going through an entire recording. This makes follow-ups more precise since you can address the exact points discussed. You don\u2019t have to rely on memory or hastily written notes, which can sometimes miss critical details.\n\nIf I\u2019m using Asana or similar project management tools, I must manually transfer notes or summaries. This creates an extra step that reduces efficiency, contradicting the time-saving benefit of AI. It would be more convenient to link Fathom directly with my workflow rather than working around its limitations.\n\n\n\nWhile it excels at transcribing calls, it lacks the flexibility to handle handwritten notes or spontaneous ideas outside of meetings. Sometimes, I want to add quick thoughts or insights that don\u2019t come directly from a call. Having a tool that strictly works within the call context limits how I can use it.\n\nWhat I like about Fathom: The AI in Fathom captures details accurately, even in fast-paced conversations. I don\u2019t have to worry about missing key points during sales calls.\n\nThe AI saves me time by handling note-taking automatically. I can focus on selling instead of getting distracted by administrative work. What G2 users like about Fathom: \"Fathom takes the headache out of sales calls by capturing and summarising conversations effortlessly. No more frantic note-taking or forgetting key details, it just works in the background, letting me stay present on the call. The AI-generated insights are spot-on, helping me tailor follow-ups without spending ages listening back to recordings. It\u2019s like having an extra brain dedicated to sales intelligence, making it easier to build relationships and close deals without feeling like I\u2019m trying.\u201d\n\n\n\nFathom Review , Emre S.\n\nWhat I dislike about Fathom:\n\nFathom sometimes joins calls when I don\u2019t want it to. I\u2019d prefer more control over when it activates to avoid unnecessary recordings.\n\nI have to manually transfer notes to Asana, which adds an extra step and reduces efficiency.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Fathom:\n\n\"I would love it if Fathom integrated with Asana to create tasks from the action items.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Fathom Review, Lorilee P.\n\n7. Instantly\n\nI like how Instantly handles follow-ups automatically. You don\u2019t have to manually track when to send a second or third message, saving you much time. The system ensures your outreach stays consistent without you remembering every interaction.\n\nInstantly provides valuable insights into how my emails perform, giving me a clear understanding of what\u2019s working. It helps you track open rates, reply rates, and other key metrics that guide your outreach strategy. Instead of guessing, you can make data-driven decisions to improve your messaging and approach.\n\nOne of the standout features is how Instantly uses AI to help personalize emails at scale. Instead of sending generic messages, I can craft outreach that feels more tailored without spending hours on customization. This makes cold emails feel less robotic and increases the likelihood of a positive response.\n\nWhile AI personalization is helpful, it doesn\u2019t always get the tone right. I don\u2019t like how the suggested messages sometimes feel too templated or lack a natural, human touch. You must still tweak the output to ensure emails sound authentic.\n\n\n\nInstantly uses AI to rank or score leads, but no system is perfect. Sometimes, you might prioritize the wrong prospects because the AI misjudges their likelihood of engagement. I dislike that you can miss out on high-value leads that don\u2019t fit the AI\u2019s scoring model. While AI can process data quickly, it still lacks the intuition of a seasoned sales professional.\n\nWhat I like about Instantly: Instantly handles follow-ups automatically, so I don\u2019t have to track every interaction. This saves time and ensures outreach stays consistent.\n\nInstantly provides clear email performance metrics like open and reply rates. This helps me make informed decisions instead of guessing what works. What G2 users like about Instantly: \"I like how they release new helpful features I didn't know I wanted every few weeks. They do pre-warmed emails and done-for-you email domains and accounts (while I am not sure any of their competitors currently do that). Pre-warmed accounts save the hassle of setting up the DMARC, DKIM, and SPF and 30 days of warming up your email accounts before using them.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstantly Review , Corbin M.\n\nWhat I dislike about Instantly:\n\nWhile AI personalization is helpful, the messages sometimes feel too templated. I still have to tweak them to make sure they sound natural. Without adjustments, emails may come across as robotic.\n\nAI sometimes misjudges which leads are worth prioritizing. This means I could miss valuable prospects who don\u2019t fit the scoring model. I still need to double-check rankings instead of relying on AI alone.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Instantly:\n\n\"The new lead finder feels like an incomplete idea. Sure, it helps gather leads, but it lacks depth. The inability to craft or automate ice breakers directly within the tool is a huge letdown. It feels like a missed opportunity for personalization, which is key in outreach. Without that feature, it\u2019s just another basic lead scraper.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Instantly Review, Khaled A.\n\n8. Clari\n\nI find it valuable when a tool provides real-time forecasting, making anticipating shifts in the sales pipeline easier. Clari\u2019s forecasting module seems built for that, offering waterfall, funnel, and trend views that help visualize data. Access to these insights allows teams to adjust their strategies quickly instead of reacting too late. I like that it eliminates the guesswork often involved in sales forecasting, which can improve decision-making at all levels.\n\nI appreciate it when a tool removes unnecessary manual work, especially regarding CRM data entry. Clari\u2019s automation helps eliminate the risk of human error while ensuring that sales data remains current. Having accurate records at all times allows managers to make more informed pipeline assessments without wasting time double-checking inputs.\n\nI think having a clear view of at-risk deals is essential before it\u2019s too late to act. Clari\u2019s risk detection system helps highlight weak points in the pipeline, allowing sales teams to prioritize their efforts. Identifying problem areas before they impact revenue makes it easier to avoid potential losses.\n\nI find it frustrating when decision-makers don\u2019t have access to the full picture, which is why visibility across teams is so important. Clari offers leadership teams a way to assess sales performance from multiple angles in real-time. The ability to make adjustments on the fly, rather than waiting for reports, makes a big difference in overall efficiency.\n\nI think sales teams need flexibility when analyzing data, and Clari\u2019s limitations could be frustrating. Some users wish they had more options for creating custom views and calculated fields. When a tool is too rigid in its reporting structure, extracting the exact insights needed for unique business models can be challenging.\n\n\n\nI think consistency in data reporting is crucial, especially for global businesses. Some users have noted that Clari\u2019s pipeline roll-up process hasn\u2019t worked smoothly in certain regions. If data isn\u2019t consolidated correctly, it can create forecasting issues and confusion for sales teams.\n\nWhat I like about Clari: I like how Clari\u2019s forecasting module provides real-time insights, making it easier to anticipate pipeline shifts. The waterfall, funnel, and trend views help visualize data.\n\nI appreciate that Clari automates CRM data entry, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors. Accurate, up-to-date records mean managers don\u2019t waste time double-checking inputs. What G2 users like about Clari: \"I appreciate the simplicity of Clari. The tool is built in a way that makes it easy for everyone to use and understand. Our teams have received the new forecasting methodology well, and the functionality is solid. Everything rolls up correctly, which is crucial for our weekly calls with the lines of business teams in the U.S. The visibility it provides, especially with the upsell tab, is also a big plus. The support team at Clari has been top-notch; our dedicated customer success manager has helped us navigate any roadblock we have faced so far.\u201d\n\n\n\nClari Review , Eric M.\n\nWhat I dislike about Clari:\n\nI find it frustrating when a tool lacks flexibility in creating custom reports. Clari doesn\u2019t offer enough options for personalized views and calculated fields.\n\nI think consistency in reporting is critical, especially for global teams. Some users have mentioned issues with Clari\u2019s pipeline roll-up not consolidating data correctly.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Clari:\n\n\"Some users may find Clari\u2019s analytics and forecasting tools complex, requiring significant onboarding and training. While Clari integrates with many CRM platforms, users occasionally report difficulties syncing data seamlessly, especially with custom CRM setups.\u201d\n\n\n\n- Clari Review, Bharat K.\n\nBest AI sales assistant software: Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\n1.

Instead of drowning in follow-ups, spreadsheets, and CRM updates, you can focus on what moves the needle: closing deals and building relationships.\n\n\n\nBut not every AI tool lives up to its promise. Some are more of a headache than a help, adding unnecessary notifications or delivering insights that don\u2019t make a difference. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to pick a tool that fits your workflow, not one that forces you to change how you sell. Look for an AI sales assistant that provides real value, whether that\u2019s by saving you time, improving forecasting, or helping you engage leads more effectively. If it feels like another thing to manage, it\u2019s probably not right.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, AI should work with you, not against you. The right AI sales assistant keeps you ahead of your pipeline, sharpens your strategy, and lets you focus on what you do best: selling. Choose wisely, and you\u2019ll spend less time buried in busy work and more time winning deals.\n\n\n\nWant to close more deals this year?

Thanks to a generous grant from UJA-Federation of New York and a major donor who prefers anonymity, the program has grown significantly, providing culturally informed, cutting-edge professional training and career advancement opportunities to community members.\n\nSince its inception in 2018, the Career Hub has evolved from offering basic computer and soft skills training to a comprehensive career development program, currently serving 115 students annually. In the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year alone, the program has trained 54 new students, equipping them with in-demand job skills that enhance employability and career growth. Responding to the ever-changing job market, the program has recently incorporated QuickBooks certification, Google Sheets, Salesforce training, and AI-integrated instruction into its curriculum.\n\nRecognizing the diverse needs of its participants, the Crown Heights Career Hub now offers a hybrid learning model, blending in-person instruction for beginners\u2014ensuring one-on-one guidance\u2014with online learning options for experienced professionals. The success of this approach has led to increased student retention and higher proficiency levels, reaffirming the program\u2019s commitment to individualized support and long-term career success.\n\nBuilding on this momentum, JCCGCI is set to expand the Career Hub\u2019s physical location in late Spring 2025, combining forces with JCCGCI\u2019s NYC government-funded Workforce Development Program. This full-service employment center will offer a wide range of workforce training, job placement services, and career counseling\u2014significantly enhancing economic opportunities for Crown Heights residents.\n\nAdditionally, the Career Hub\u2019s growing reputation has extended beyond Crown Heights, with other Haredi communities expressing interest in replicating the program model. In recognition of its excellence, Intuit Corporation has officially listed the Career Hub as a QuickBooks training site, a testament to its commitment to equipping students with high-value industry skills.\n\n\u201cThe Crown Heights Career Hub is more than just a training program\u2014it is a lifeline for those seeking financial stability and career growth,\u201d said Rabbi Moshe Wiener, Executive Director of JCCGCI. \u201cBy adapting to evolving industry demands and maintaining strong partnerships, we continue to provide our community with the tools they need to thrive in an increasingly competitive job market.\u201d\n\nAs the Career Hub continues to expand, JCCGCI remains committed to fostering economic empowerment, professional development, and career success within the Crown Heights community.\n\nFor more information about JCCGCI\u2019s Crown Heights Career Hub and its programs, click here or contact Program Director Neil Schwerd at n.schwerd@jccgci.org.\n\nCrown Heights Career Hub operates under the guidance of Virginia G. Cruickshank, one of the pioneers of workforce development programming in New York and benefits from the input of its Advisory Committee and from Rabbi Eli Cohen, Executive Director of the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council.",

            "content": "Salesforce's valuation has fluctuated quite a bit over the last couple of years.\n\nFor the last two years, technology stocks have been rocking thanks to an overwhelmingly bullish narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Among AI's biggest winners have been software businesses, a theme that I don't see changing anytime soon.\n\nBelow, I'm going to compare two of the biggest names in enterprise software benefiting from the AI revolution: Palantir Technologies (PLTR 8.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 2.82%). While each appears well positioned to continue riding the AI wave, I see Palantir as the superior choice for growth investors.\n\nLet's dig into how each of these software leaders is affecting the AI sector and assess why I think Palantir will become the bigger company by the end of the year.\n\nPalantir vs. Salesforce\n\nAs of this writing (Feb. 10), Salesforce has a larger market capitalization than Palantir by roughly $52 billion. With that said, the underlying trends shown in the chart below are quite interesting.\n\nCheck out the difference between how each company's valuation has moved since AI emerged as the next megatrend. Over the last couple of years, Palantir's valuation has expanded significantly. By contrast, Salesforce's price movement has exhibited far more ebbs and flows. As a result, there's a clear convergence seen in the graph below with Palantir's market value starting to encroach on that of Salesforce.\n\nWhat tailwinds does each software company have?\n\nSalesforce owns a number of properties including data analytics platform Tableau and messaging tool Slack. The company's prior strategy of acquiring competing businesses and integrating them with the core ecosystem helped build an end-to-end software suite that offers businesses a variety of data-driven applications, but investors eventually grew tired of such an approach.\n\nFor the last couple of years, Salesforce has been under enormous scrutiny from Wall Street to start delivering more robust revenue acceleration and profit margin expansion excluding inorganic assets purchased through acquisitions.\n\nI'll admit that Salesforce has made good on this promise ... for the most part. The issue Salesforce continues to face revolves around consistency. In other words, sometimes the company blows Wall Street's expectations out of the water, while at other times investors are left scratching their heads questioning what is going on in execution.\n\nFor this reason, I'm not entirely sold that Salesforce is going to dominate its pocket of the AI realm. Specifically, the company's newest area of interest, called agentic AI, faces fierce competition -- namely from Microsoft, a much larger company with a stronger balance sheet.\n\nWhen you add in that Salesforce faces a number of tangential competitors, including Monday.com, HubSpot, Atlassian, Asana, Workday, and more, I'm hard-pressed to see how it navigates amid all of these businesses.\n\nOn the flip side, Palantir -- which is much smaller than Salesforce in revenue and earnings -- is partnering with the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Oracle. To me, big tech's decision to work alongside Palantir as opposed to launching competing products represents enormous potential since the company continues to scale up its biggest driver of growth, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software suite.\n\nLooking at the future\n\nThe chart below illustrates consensus estimates among Wall Street analysts for growth in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) between Salesforce and Palantir.\n\nThe dichotomy shown above is obvious: Wall Street is estimating far less acceleration for revenue and earnings for Salesforce compared to Palantir over the next two years. My interpretation of these forecasts is that analysts may see more competitive headwinds for Salesforce when compared to Palantir.\n\nTo be fair, this should be expected to some degree. Salesforce is a much larger enterprise than Palantir, and so at some point the company's growth profile is going to mature.\n\nHowever, I have not fully bought into that idea because AI is supposed to represent transformative opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Given the mundane growth profile for Salesforce, I'm wondering if Wall Street shares my suspicion that AI may not be as influential for the company as it could be for other software businesses, such as Palantir.\n\nFor these reasons, I would not be surprised to continue witnessing some inconsistent trends in Salesforce throughout this year (and maybe even longer). By contrast, Palantir's prospects look strong, and I think investors could continue cheering on the stock -- propelling its valuation even higher during 2025.\n\nI think there could be some contraction in Salesforce's market cap and even more expansion in Palantir's, thereby tightening the gap between the two companies even further. If this happens, I think Palantir will emerge as the more valuable business by the end of the year.",

            "content": "If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Salesforce, Inc. ( ) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 72% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 13% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Salesforce achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 46% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 52.65, the market remains optimistic.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nSalesforce shareholders are up 13% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 12% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com.

They're trading 12-hour shifts for leadership positions that still impact healthcare\u2014just on a bigger scale.\n\nWhy Doctors Are Making the Switch\n\nFor Dr. Lisa Shah, the shift was about scale. She loved treating patients but left exhausted every day.

Burnout soared. A Bain & Company survey found that one in four clinicians were considering leaving medicine.\n\nAnd the pay? Still solid.

It's expected to hit $1.5 trillion by 2032, growing at nearly 19% per year, according to researchers at Rock Health.\n\nThat means more companies need medical expertise\u2014and they're hiring doctors to provide it.\n\nDr. Guy Maytal spent nearly two decades in psychiatry before joining Forge Health, a startup focused on mental health and substance use treatment.\n\n\"I could grumble on the sidelines, or roll up my sleeves and do something about it,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nThe Role of CMOs in Business\n\nTech giants are getting in on the action. Salesforce hired a CMO in 2019 to focus on employee health. Google added its first chief health officer the same year.\n\nAt Uber Health, Dr. Joshua Sclar now works on getting patients to medical appointments and delivering medications.\n\n\u201cBeing a physician, I know what happens when that care is missed,\u201d he told Business Insider.\n\nBut adjusting to corporate life isn't always easy. Dr. Nikole Benders-Hadi, CMO at TalkSpace TALK, says her biggest challenge was learning to communicate with business leaders who don't speak \u201cdoctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere can be really different end goals when you\u2019re talking about business objectives versus healthcare objectives,\u201d she said.\n\nSee Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs.

Musk co-founded the artificial intelligence startup with Sam Altman but left the company in 2018 after a disagreement with Altman and other cofounders over OpenAI\u2019s direction and funding.\n\nThe filing noted that Musk will withdraw the bid if the OpenAI board is \"prepared to preserve the charity's mission and stipulate to take the 'for sale' sign off its assets by halting its conversion. \"\n\nOtherwise, \"the charity must be compensated by what an arms-length buyer will pay for its assets.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and 10 AI News Stories That Are Dominating Headlines\n\nIn its filing with the same court on Wednesday, OpenAI said that Musk\u2019s bid to buy OpenAI contradicts the arguments he is making in court that the startup's assets cannot be transferred for private gain. It seems to be \"an improper bid to undermine a competitor.\" Even though Musk seemingly wants OpenAI to retain its non-profit structure, OpenAI noted that in his bid, he wants OpenAI to be sold to himself.\n\n\u201cIn this Court, Musk argues that OpenAI, Inc.\u2019s assets cannot be \u2018transferred away\u2019 for \u2018private gain.

The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020.

            "content": "Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares\n\nIn recent years, the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has led to extraordinary improvements in natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, this progress comes with a significant caveat: the inference process\u2014generating responses one token at a time\u2014remains a computational bottleneck. As LLMs grow in size and complexity, the latency and energy demands for sequential token generation become substantial. These challenges are particularly acute in real-world deployments, where cost, speed, and scalability are critical. Traditional decoding approaches, such as greedy or beam search methods, often require repeated evaluations of large models, leading to high computational overhead. Moreover, even with parallel decoding techniques, maintaining both the efficiency and the quality of generated outputs can be elusive. This scenario has spurred a search for novel techniques that can reduce inference costs without sacrificing accuracy. Researchers have therefore been exploring hybrid approaches that combine lightweight models with more powerful counterparts, striving for an optimal balance between speed and performance\u2014a balance that is essential for real-time applications, interactive systems, and large-scale deployment in cloud environments.\n\nSalesforce AI Research Introduces Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). At its core, RSD leverages a dual-model strategy: a fast, lightweight \u201cdraft\u201d model works in tandem with a more robust \u201ctarget\u201d model. The draft model generates preliminary candidate outputs rapidly, while a process reward model (PRM) evaluates the quality of these outputs in real time. Unlike traditional speculative decoding, which insists on strict unbiased token matching between the draft and target models, RSD introduces a controlled bias. This bias is carefully engineered to favor high-reward outputs\u2014those deemed more likely to be correct or contextually relevant\u2014thus significantly reducing unnecessary computations. The approach is grounded in a mathematically derived threshold strategy that determines when the target model should intervene. By dynamically mixing outputs from both models based on a reward function, RSD not only accelerates the inference process but also enhances the overall quality of the generated responses. Detailed in the attached paper , this breakthrough methodology represents a significant leap forward in addressing the inherent inefficiencies of sequential token generation in LLMs.\n\nTechnical Details and Benefits of RSD\n\nDelving into the technical aspects, RSD operates by integrating two models in a sequential yet collaborative manner. Initially, the draft model produces candidate tokens or reasoning steps at a low computational cost. Each candidate is then evaluated using a reward function, which acts as a quality gate. If a candidate token\u2019s reward exceeds a predetermined threshold, the output is accepted; if not, the system calls upon the more computationally intensive target model to generate a refined token. This process is guided by a weighting function\u2014typically a binary step function\u2014that adjusts the reliance on the draft versus the target model. The dynamic quality control afforded by the process reward model (PRM) ensures that only the most promising outputs bypass the target model, thereby saving on computation. One of the standout benefits of this approach is \u201cbiased acceleration,\u201d where the controlled bias is not a detriment but rather a strategic choice to prioritize high-reward outcomes. This results in two key benefits: first, the overall inference process can be up to 4.4\u00d7 faster compared to running the target model alone; second, it often yields a +3.5 average accuracy improvement over conventional parallel decoding baselines. In essence, RSD harmonizes efficiency with accuracy\u2014allowing for a substantial reduction in the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) while still delivering outputs that meet or even exceed the performance of the target model. The theoretical underpinnings and algorithmic details, such as the mixture distribution defined by PRSD and the adaptive acceptance criterion, provide a robust framework for practical deployment in diverse reasoning tasks.\n\nInsights\n\nThe empirical validation of RSD is compelling. Experiments detailed in the paper demonstrate that, on challenging benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH500, OlympiadBench, and GPQA, RSD consistently delivers superior performance. For instance, on the MATH500 benchmark\u2014a dataset designed to test mathematical reasoning\u2014RSD achieved an accuracy of 88.0 when configured with a 72B target model and a 7B PRM, compared to 85.6 for the target model running alone. Not only does this configuration reduce the computational load by nearly 4.4\u00d7 fewer FLOPs, but it also enhances reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of RSD to outperform traditional methods, such as speculative decoding (SD) and even advanced search-based techniques like beam search or Best-of-N strategies.\n\nConclusion: A New Paradigm for Efficient LLM Inference\n\nIn conclusion, Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD) marks a significant milestone in the quest for more efficient LLM inference. By intelligently combining a lightweight draft model with a powerful target model, and by introducing a reward-based acceptance criterion, RSD effectively addresses the dual challenges of computational cost and output quality. The innovative approach of biased acceleration allows the system to selectively bypass expensive computations for high-reward outputs, thereby streamlining the inference process. The dynamic quality control mechanism\u2014anchored by a process reward model\u2014ensures that computational resources are allocated judiciously, engaging the target model only when necessary. With empirical results showing up to 4.4\u00d7 faster inference and an average accuracy improvement of +3.5 over traditional methods, RSD not only paves the way for more scalable LLM deployments but also sets a new standard in the design of hybrid decoding frameworks.\n\nCheck out the Paper and GitHub Page.

            "content": "Cloud computing boomed during the 2010s, but growth in this next-gen IT industry is still in the early innings. For years, organizations around the globe have been migrating their operations to the cloud -- digital data and services stored within a remote data center and accessed via the internet. However, the rise of remote work during the pandemic accelerated the trend. Now, generative AI has kicked off the next wave of cloud expansion.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBusiness research provider Grand View Research projects that spending on global cloud computing (including data center infrastructure and edge computing) will increase at a 21.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from an estimated $752.4 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030. Cloud computing is also closely tied to other tech developments such as mobile 5G networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Clearly, cloud computing stocks are a top investment theme for 2025 and the decade ahead.\n\nCloud computing stocks for 2025 Investing in the best cloud computing stocks of 2025 To get started, the best cloud stocks to invest in are the five largest public cloud giants: Amazon (AMZN 2.09%) Web Services (AWS); Microsoft (MSFT 2.58%) Azure; Alphabet (GOOGL 1.68%) (GOOG 1.75%) Google Cloud; Oracle (ORCL 1.09%) Cloud; and IBM (IBM 1.04%) Cloud. Although these companies aren\u2019t pure plays in the cloud industry, all five provide infrastructure and services for organizations undertaking a digital transformation (a phrase that encompasses the migration to cloud-based operations). They have the most complete ecosystems of software and partnerships with third-party software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers.\n\nDefinition Icon Cloud Computing Cloud computing is a network of interconnected servers and data centers working together to deliver a service through the Internet.\n\nBeyond those big five, here are seven more focused companies that provide portfolio exposure to the development of the cloud:\n\n1 - 2 1. Salesforce\n\nWhen talking about cloud computing, Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) needs to be part of the conversation. The customer relationship management (CRM) specialist was a pioneer of software that used cloud technology, which started in the late 1990s. Salesforce has since branched out to other areas of enterprise software via organic growth and a steady stream of acquisitions. Salesforce\u2019s takeover of remote work and collaboration tool Slack put it on a collision course with Microsoft\u2019s Teams collaboration suite. Today, Salesforce offers a complete suite of software aimed at helping business teams manage data and get work done efficiently. Due to its success in becoming a full-blown tech platform for businesses of all types and sizes, Salesforce is also a top way to play smaller cloud upstarts. It regularly invests in or acquires stakes in smaller cloud peers -- such as when it invested in Snowflake (SNOW 4.19%) before its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020 (and sold it for a profit in 2021). It also acquired a stake in hot IPO Monday.com (MNDY 5.57%). Salesforce fell on hard times in 2022 and faced activist investor pressure to boost profit margins. Founder and CEO Marc Benioff and the top team have made progress, though, and hope to become the world\u2019s largest and most profitable enterprise software company within the next few years. It seems to be on the right track. Salesforce reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.21 for fiscal 2023 but booked diluted EPS of $4.20 in fiscal 2024, and management projects fiscal 2025 to be even higher: $6.15 to $6.20.\n\n2. Adobe\n\nSoftware company Adobe (ADBE 4.47%) got its start in an IT era that predates both the cloud and the internet. But it has transformed itself into a leader in cloud services by adapting its large and expanding platform to the cloud era. Adobe\u2019s core competencies in providing creativity software and document editing have made it a staple of digital transformation. Although it isn\u2019t a serial acquirer like Salesforce, Adobe has made some big moves to round out its software suite. In 2018, it acquired small firms Marketo and Magento to bolster its position as a partner for e-commerce companies. In late 2020, it purchased Workfront to add workflow and project management solutions to its arsenal. As a creative software specialist, Adobe is also well suited to tackle the new generative AI era. Its work with top chip designer Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) helped it quickly release its Firefly suite of apps aimed at helping creatives increase their image and video creation, as well as expanding editing capabilities. Paired with the organic growth that Adobe\u2019s legacy offerings still generate, this firm is a top free cash flow generator in the cloud industry. It deserves consideration as a core portfolio holding. 3 - 4 3. Snowflake\n\nThe cloud increases a company's flexibility, often unlocks cost savings, and helps them get more done with the data they have on their operations and customers. However, with the adoption of the cloud comes an explosion of digital data and new security risk considerations. Managing that data is a complex task. That's where Snowflake comes in. It hit the public markets in 2020 with incredible fanfare due to its triple-digit-percentage revenue growth. The stock has fallen since then, and revenue growth has moderated a bit, but Snowflake is now much more reasonably valued. Snowflake is an important business that has pioneered new ways for businesses to store, migrate, and process massive amounts of digital information. It continued to expand at a rapid pace even during the bear market of 2022 and despite fears of a recession in 2023. It also began turning a healthy profit, as measured by free cash flow. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, for example, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $496.5 million and $778.9 million, respectively. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, moreover, Snowflake reported free cash flow of $468.6 million. Snowflake is a young company, though, and the stock will likely be highly volatile for some time. It's all about growth for this business right now, and even small changes in management's expectations can cause some wild fluctuations in share price. Snowflake could, nevertheless, be a very promising investment for the long term. 4. Zoom Video Communications\n\nFew companies have skyrocketed out of obscurity and into household name status as quickly as Zoom (ZM 2.73%). The videoconferencing service became a staple during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping family members and business teams stay in touch from afar (as it turns out, many pre-pandemic in-person meetings weren't all that necessary after all). Zoom is poised to continue as a basic necessity of corporate communications services for a long time. Zoom is eyeing a bigger piece of the massive global telecom industry by going after large business communications accounts. Zoom Phone accounts, a service for transferring calls across different devices, has steadily grown for years. Zoom's contact center services to manage inbound calls and customer contact have also remained a key growth initiative. While Zoom struggled with many individual and small business subscribers canceling their service in the wake of the pandemic, it has succeeded in improving its financials over the past couple of years. Growing free cash flow from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024, Zoom projects free cash flow of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2025. The company is still benefiting from changes in communications, but it's no longer a growth company. Zoom's top priority now is managing modest revenue expansion while figuring out how to steadily increase earnings for shareholders.\n\nDefinition Icon Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\n\n5 - 7 5. ServiceNow\n\nThere are greater complexities involved in managing big cloud computing infrastructure, but the cloud also offers the ability to continuously streamline and automate operations. That's ServiceNow's (NOW 4.03%) software specialty. Be it digital customer experiences, employee workflow management, or software development, ServiceNow helps about 8,400 companies around the world find chokepoints in their operations. Once these pain points are found, ServiceNow can help suggest and automate fixes. In a new era of AI, ServiceNow could be a big winner, building on its recent success. After growing subscription revenue by 23% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, ServiceNow projects a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of about 19% for fiscal 2025. The company is using Nvidia hardware to make automation even better and even landed Nvidia as a bigger customer using automation software that Nvidia is helping ServiceNow to create. With challenges like labor shortages persisting in the wake of the pandemic, ServiceNow is primed to keep growing. In addition to steady growth, ServiceNow also recently turned profitable by all metrics. This could be a great stock holding for the next decade and beyond as the cloud infiltrates more of the world's corporate operations.\n\n6. The Trade Desk\n\nNetflix (NFLX 3.13%) made streaming TV from the cloud an everyday staple. Lots of new internet-based services have come to market in the past couple of years. This has been a boon for digital advertising technologists such as The Trade Desk (TTD 0.11%), a cloud-based offering that helps marketers automate the purchase of digital advertising (known as programmatic advertising). Digital ads are dominated by the likes of Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), but The Trade Desk\u2019s cloud-based marketing management tools have won over lots of users. It now ranks as the largest independent digital ad management software company. And its rapidly-escalating top-line growth further reflects the massive success it has achieved. From fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023, for example, The Trade Desk has grown revenue at a massive 52% CAGR. Despite massive internet growth in the past decade, just over half of marketing spending takes place in a digital format. Digital ads will continue to be a fast-growing industry in the next decade -- especially in at-home entertainment as TV and movies move to an on-demand internet streaming format. In the coming years, streaming services will pick up millions of new household subscribers and account for billions of additional hours spent viewing content. That creates a huge opportunity for The Trade Desk as it manages connected TV advertising activity. Still a small company in a global marketing industry approaching $1 trillion annually and growing, the sky\u2019s the limit for The Trade Desk. 7. DigitalOcean\n\nDigitalOcean (NASDAQ:DOCN) is a fresh face in the cloud computing space. It completed its public offering of stock in early 2021. It\u2019s a public cloud infrastructure and software provider similar to Amazon\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. While the big three focus their attention on large enterprises, DigitalOcean aims at the massive but underserved community of small businesses and start-ups. This is a lucrative niche. Most IT innovations are developed for and funded by large organizations. Yet small businesses still make up about half of the global economy\u2019s production. Most are far behind the curve in making needed digital transformation. That\u2019s where DigitalOcean comes in, providing a full range of affordable services to help small companies find their way in the new cloud era. Besides offering cloud infrastructure for small businesses to test and host web-based services and apps, it also offers services for the non-tech-savvy outfit. It acquired a company called Cloudways that offers website building and hosting. Despite its tiny size, DigitalOcean is an efficient operation. It generates healthy and growing free cash flow, and while it has generated gross profits for years, it booked positive net income for the first time in 2023, reporting diluted EPS of $0.20. Through the first three quarters of 2024, DigitalOcean has generated diluted EPS of $0.70. This could be a quality small- to mid-cap stock worth investing in for the long haul.\n\nInvesting in cloud ETFs Investing in cloud ETFs For investors not interested in attempting to pick the best cloud stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are also an option. The First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY 3.67%) is the largest cloud ETF around, with about $3.9 billion in assets under management. The fund is a basket of 61 cloud infrastructure and software stocks. It has an ETF expense ratio of 0.6%, meaning it costs $6 per year for every $1,000 invested. A more recent arrival is the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU 3.28%). Since the fund launched in early 2019, GlobalX\u2019s cloud ETF has narrowly outperformed First Trust\u2019s offering due to its focus on just 37 stocks, most of which are software companies. The fund is smaller, with about $376 million in assets under management. It has a slightly higher annual expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nRelated investing topics\n\nShould you invest? Cloud computing is a long-term growth trend Cloud computing picked up steam during the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained an enduring growth story even during the bear market. More efficient than legacy IT, it enhances technology such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and gaming. It gives organizations and their employees more flexibility with important functions such as remote work. The cloud is quickly becoming the basic infrastructure of the future. As is the case with all high-growth stocks, though, investing in cloud companies will have bumps in the road. Investors should stay focused on the long-term potential, not just stock price performance over the course of a year or two. This long-term secular growth trend is poised to remain intact for the next decade and beyond. Cloud stocks should be a top investment priority in 2025.",

            "content": "Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe split between longtime life sciences software partners Veeva and Salesforce is getting down to crunch time, and pharmas and biotechs need to confront what that change will entail in an evolving healthcare market.\n\nSoon, clients who depend on the customer relationship management platforms that connect sales reps with buyers will need to choose which path to take as the divorce finalizes. And the decision could be more impactful than it seems on the surface, according to Nancy Phelan, head of customer engagement at industry consulting firm Trinity Life Sciences.\n\n\u201cSometimes this is being seen as just an IT migration \u2014 but no, if you\u2019re just migrating, you\u2019re missing the strategic importance of this,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cA lot of leaders are starting to realize this is a much bigger decision, and they need to think through the choices, the timing and the approach to set up for a very different world.\u201d\n\nThe contract between the two companies expires this September, and drugmakers will have until September 2030 to make the call. Veeva announced the intended split in December 2022.\n\nVeeva\u2019s departure from the Salesforce platform stems from mounting risks and roadblocks that made going solo a better option for the company\u2019s tailored life sciences position, according to a report from Everest Group. And while the separation will diminish Salesforce\u2019s market presence, the firm\u2019s larger size could allow for quicker development of next-generation technologies.\n\nWith Salesforce being the largest CRM provider in the world across sectors and Veeva still a particular favorite of the life sciences, this upcoming fork in the road demands some attention from the industry to understand the implications of each choice, Phelan said.\n\nHoneymoon is over?\n\nThe two companies have been intertwined since Veeva launched in 2007 based on the Salesforce CRM platform. Neither one has worked in the life sciences sector without the other, but each has been developing new products that will carry on past the split.\n\nAlmost two decades later, that\u2019s where the paths diverge, Phelan said.\n\n\u201cLarge companies like Pfizer or Novartis last made this decision more than 15 years ago, and the business model was very different then,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have the specialty pharmacy complexity, the need for some of the field reimbursement, issues with patient affordability and the kinds of teams you have out in the field right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of leaders are starting to realize this is a much bigger decision, and they need to think through the choices, the timing and the approach to set up for a very different world.\u201d Nancy Phelan Senior vice president, head of customer engagement, Trinity Life Sciences\n\nWith both companies rolling out new CRM platforms, it\u2019s time for drugmakers to reflect on the changes to the industry in that time, Phelan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for companies to think differently about what\u2019s happening in the market and what\u2019s happening with their customers,\u201d she said, adding that CRM software companies like Oracle, SAP and others exist in the space, as well. But Salesforce and Veeva are the dominant players serving the biggest companies, Phelan said.\n\nWhen the partnership began, digital marketing activity was still getting off the ground \u2014 but now, AI and big data analytics play a role that didn\u2019t exist at the time. And that makes the decision between providers a much different choice than it was back then, according to Phelan.\n\nTwo roads\n\nThe main difference between Salesforce and Veeva moving forward will be what drugmakers are looking to get out of the platforms, Phelan said, noting that Trinity doesn\u2019t encourage one over the other unilaterally.\n\nFundamentally, Salesforce is betting on bigger, connected AI while Veeva is playing to its strengths of rep interface and content. Each one will still have flavors of the other, though, and it will come down to individual companies\u2019 needs and preferences, Phelan said.\n\nSalesforce will be working with IQVIA\u2019s orchestrated customer engagement platform to develop the Life Sciences Cloud, which will employ AI to give biotech and pharma leaders \u201cgreater cohesion,\u201d Phelan said. The platform has launched as of last year, but sales automation functions won\u2019t be offered until September this year due to the existing contract with Veeva.\n\nVeeva announced in December last year the newest iteration of its Vault CRM Suite, which will include AI components and industry-specific programming. For life sciences companies, this is the user experience they\u2019re most accustomed to, and Phelan said Veeva has promised not much will change with that interface.\n\nIn some ways, the divorce has gotten a little messy with the two companies scrambling to convince clients to pick their platform. At the end of December, Salesforce had reportedly poached some big customers from Veeva, which held about 80% market share in the life sciences.\n\nBoth companies are adapting to drastic changes in the healthcare landscape including an abundance of data, more complex therapies and evolving customer needs.\n\nFrom what Phelan has seen so far, drugmakers aren\u2019t pooling to one side or the other based on characteristics like size, pipeline or core focus area. Each of the diverging roads isn\u2019t designed for one particular pharma or biotech in mind, but they could shape the experience in multi-dimensional ways, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, both Veeva and Salesforce are putting their best foot forward ahead of the split, and pharma companies still have time to come to terms with their preferred path.\n\n\u201cHow we\u2019re advising companies is, you\u2019ve got a window of time and a future that is radically different from the last time you made this decision,\u201d Phelan said. \u201cYou need to strategically assess the pieces that are important to you.\u201d",

December\u2019s monthly job gains also showed an upward revision, highlighting that the US labor market ended 2024 in a better position than previously reported. Economists are thus of the opinion that the Federal Reserve may not cut rates in the near future. Consequently, this increases pressure on inflation data to cool down before the central bank considers slashing borrowing costs.\n\nOn January 30, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell\u201d to discuss the stock market and the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates unchanged. Sticking to the opinion he gave in December, Gundlach was of the view that 2025 would bring a maximum of two rate cuts by the Fed. He reiterated that he was not predicting two cuts but that two would be the maximum number attained in 2025, keeping one rate cut as the base case for the year. The unemployment rate went up for several consecutive months before ticking down, which Gundlach thinks is a matter of deep solace for the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Outlook for the Stock Market Look Like?\n\nOn February 10, Mary Ann Bartels, Sanctuary Wealth\u2019s chief investment strategist, appeared on CNBC to discuss the 2025 outlook for the stock market. She showed bullish sentiment towards the market, particularly due to strong earnings growth. Comparing the current environment to previous periods of innovation, such as the 1920s and the 1990s, Bartels highlighted the role of robotics, AI, and Web3 in driving long-term growth in the present.\n\nShe noted that companies today fund investments with cash and equity rather than excessive leverage, unlike the 1990s. Her estimates showed that the S&P could reach 7,200 to 7,400 this year and 10,000 to 13,000 by the decade\u2019s end, as she expects the bull market to extend through 2029 to 2030.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 20 growth stocks. We checked their 5-year revenue growth (at least above 15%) and then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of fiscal Q3 2024.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other large-cap stocks. We previously covered 10 Large-Cap Stocks Insiders Are Buying Recently.\n\nWhy should investors track insider moves? Is it a bad sign for the company when insiders sell their shares? Not necessarily; just like insider buying activity doesn\u2019t always mean the stock is heading for growth. Both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, it's important to consider these moves within the broader context of the company\u2019s fundamentals, industry trends, and overall market conditions.\n\nHowever, insiders or people in high positions within a company\u2014such as executives and directors, often have precious insights into the company\u2019s strategy, plans, next moves and initiatives. Sometimes, for example, when a CEO or CFO invests their own money to acquire company shares, it can signal strong confidence in the company\u2019s potential.\n\nSimilarly, when insiders are selling their shares, it can sometimes mean that the management is losing confidence. On the other hand, it also happens that large shareholders just want to trim their holdings to more appropriate position sizes based on the risk/reward. Insiders can also decide to sell their shares due to personal financial reasons that have nothing to do with the company.\n\nThis means that both insider selling and buying can be driven by various motives, and therefore, any insider trading activity should be carefully analyzed only with other factors. That\u2019s why due diligence before any investment is of the utmost importance. However, insider trading activity in combination with other relevant determinants can offer valuable insights into a company\u2019s capabilities, helping investors make more informed investment decisions.\n\nTo identify the 10 large-cap stocks insiders are selling recently, we considered only stocks with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. We first used Insider Monkey\u2019s insider trading stock screener and looked for stocks with at least two insiders selling over the last two months.",

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI news making waves on Wall Street.\n\nOpenAI has previously been dependent on Nvidia for its chip supply, but it looks like it may not be for long. As reported by Reuters, the artificial intelligence startup is all set to develop its first generation of in-house artificial intelligence silicon.\n\nAccording to sources, the startup is finalizing the design for its first in-house chip in the next few months. It then plans to send it for fabrication at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co in a \u201ctaping out\u201d process.\n\nREAD NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nThis training-focused chip will be used as a strategic tool to strengthen OpenAI\u2019s negotiating leverage with other chip suppliers. If all goes smoothly, the company will be able to mass-produce its first in-house AI chip and potentially test an alternative later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, big tech companies have struggled to produce satisfactory chips over the years. Nevertheless, DeepSeek has raised questions about whether fewer chips will be needed in developing powerful models in the future.\n\nGoogle DeepMind boss Demis Hassabis has recently dismissed DeepSeek\u2019s claims that its popular chatbot and AI model is using far less money than US rivals.\n\nDeepSeek \u201cseems to have only reported the cost of the final training round, which is a fraction of the total cost.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that DeepSeek\u2019s emergence doesn\u2019t upend the economics of AI development.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any new silver bullet technologies. DeepSeek is not an outlier on the efficiency curve.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese startup has reportedly spent around $5.6 million on computing costs to train its models. OpenAI and Microsoft are currently investigating these claims, searching if anyone tied to DeepSeek has obtained data from OpenAI through a process known as distillation.\n\nAccording to Hassabis, DeepSeek seems \u201cto have relied on some Western models to distill from\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).",

(NYSE:CRM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nLosing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 5.7% last week. However, the 16% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nNYSE:CRM Ownership Breakdown February 12th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Salesforce. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Salesforce, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth February 12th 2025\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 5.8% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.3% of the shares allocated to their name.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",

Analysts led by Daniel Ives observe that Palantir expands its use cases, cultivating a broader partner ecosystem and meeting increasing demand for enterprise-scale generative AI solutions.\n\nIt would be brands of all kinds, but Ives's team is tracking dozens of big companies on the AI guardrail, watching enterprise spending as well as all sorts of use cases. According to them, CIOs are accelerating their AI strategies, and AI will take around 1015% of IT budgets in the coming months. Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) chips and robust cloud services are very important in early AI deployments. Nvidia, he notes, every dollar you invest in Nvidia multiplies, somewhere, eight, nine, 10 times in the tech ecosystem. According to Wedbush, accelerated AI adoption fueled by platforms like Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform could lead to a $2 trillion capital expenditure wave over the next three years the highest individual figure on the overall private compute pie by reshaping enterprise technology investments. Investment in the tech landscape leads to unforeseen challenges, and the analysts recommend being careful.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

The company is not just focussing on enhancing its AI initiatives but is also concerned about its environmental impact. Yesterday, it launched a tool, AI Energy Score, in partnership with Hugging Face, Cohere, and Carnegie Mellon University, to evaluate the relative energy efficiency of different AI models. Boris Gamazaychikov, Head of AI Sustainability at Salesforce emphasized how important it is have to a standardized approach to measure and disclose such information.\n\nMeanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives identified Palantir Technologies PLTR and Salesforce as the leading AI software investments for the year.

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

Additionally, the company plans to establish a regional headquarters in Riyadh and upskill 30,000 Saudi citizens by 2030, setting a strong foundation for long-term market growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Overview:\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is emerging as a key hub for AI investments, highlighted by significant capital commitments at the LEAP 2025 event.\n\n\n\nSalesforce\u2019s $500 million investment reinforces its strategy to lead in AI and cloud innovation in the region.\n\n\n\nThe strategic partnership with AWS underpins the deployment of Hyperforce, enhancing regional cloud capabilities.\n\n\n\nKey Points:\n\n\n\nThe collaboration with global consulting giants aims to tailor Salesforce\u2019s solutions to local market needs.\n\n\n\nEstablishing a regional headquarters and upskilling programs demonstrates a long-term commitment to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nThis initiative is expected to drive both technological innovation and economic growth in the Middle East.\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\n\n\nSalesforce\u2019s expansion in Saudi Arabia could set a benchmark for future AI investments in emerging markets.\n\n\n\nThe integration of advanced cloud technologies and localized services will enhance competitive positioning.\n\n\n\nSuccessful execution of this strategy may accelerate global AI adoption and drive long-term shareholder value.\n\n\n\nBull Case:\n\n\n\nSalesforce's $500 million investment in Saudi Arabia positions it as a leader in the rapidly growing Middle Eastern AI and cloud market, potentially capturing significant market share in a region with high digital transformation potential.\n\n\n\nThe strategic partnership with AWS for Hyperforce deployment provides a robust infrastructure foundation, enabling Salesforce to offer localized, high-performance cloud services that comply with regional data regulations.\n\n\n\nCollaborations with global consulting firms like Capgemini, Deloitte, and IBM will help tailor Salesforce's AI solutions to local market needs, accelerating adoption and revenue growth.\n\n\n\nThe commitment to upskill 30,000 Saudi citizens by 2030 builds a skilled workforce and customer base, fostering long-term growth and brand loyalty in the region.\n\n\n\nSalesforce's expansion aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, potentially leading to preferential treatment and additional government contracts in the future.\n\n\n\nBear Case:\n\n\n\nThe $500 million investment represents a significant financial commitment in a region with geopolitical uncertainties, potentially exposing Salesforce to risks if regional stability is disrupted.\n\n\n\nIntense competition from other tech giants also investing heavily in Saudi Arabia, such as Google and Alibaba, could limit Salesforce's ability to dominate the market as intended.\n\n\n\nCultural and regulatory differences may pose challenges in fully implementing Salesforce's AI and cloud solutions, potentially leading to delays or reduced effectiveness of the investment.\n\n\n\nThe focus on Saudi Arabia might divert resources from other high-growth markets or core business areas, potentially impacting overall global performance.\n\n\n\nIf the upskilling initiative fails to meet its targets or produce qualified workers, Salesforce may struggle to find local talent, hindering its expansion plans in the region.\n\n\n\nThis significant investment highlights Salesforce\u2019s proactive approach to capturing emerging opportunities in the global AI landscape. By combining cutting-edge cloud technology with strategic local partnerships, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on the rapid digital transformation underway in Saudi Arabia and beyond.Looking ahead, Salesforce\u2019s initiative not only reinforces its leadership in cloud and AI solutions but also offers a blueprint for expanding into high-growth international markets.

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI stocks dominating Wall Street.\n\nRepresentatives from around the world are going to be attending the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit at the Grand Palais on 10\u201311 February 2025. The summit will focus on harnessing the power of AI systems as well as the risks posed by them. From heads of state and government and leaders of international organizations to business leaders, as well as representatives from academia, civil society, and the arts, it would seem everyone related to the artificial intelligence world is to attend. However, that\u2019s not quite true.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week\n\nReuters has recently reported that the U.S. delegation to the AI Summit will not include technical staff from the country\u2019s AI Safety Institute. Vice President JD Vance is leading the U.S. contingent to France, with attendees including members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: Principal Deputy Director Lynne Parker and Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence Sriram Krishnan. However, Homeland Security and Commerce Department officials are not going to be there, particularly the representatives of the U.S. AI Safety Institute trips have been canceled.\n\nThe AI Safety Institute, created under former President Joe Biden, was created to mitigate certain risks from AI, having signed agreements with U.S. startups OpenAI and Anthropic for safety testing. The absence of these representatives implies that the Commerce Department, in which the Safety Institute resides, is still in the transition phase after Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nRegarding the discussion on AI, Prof Gina Neff from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy said that there is currently \u201ca vacuum for global leadership on AI\u201d.\n\nAnother professor from Southampton University seems to agree:\n\n\u201cDeepSeek made everybody realize that China is a force to be reckoned with,\u201d says the computer scientist. We don\u2019t have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\u201d -Prof Dame Wendy Hall, Southampton University.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based CRM company that has gained traction after the launch of its AI-powered platform called Agentforce. On February 7, Bloomberg reported that software companies are increasingly being pressured to invest in artificial intelligence capabilities without hitting their profits. As a result, companies such as Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Workday are making two moves: cutting jobs and highlighting cost savings from adding workers internationally.\n\n\u201cDo we need to hire everybody in San Francisco? Or can we think about other locations that are cheaper where we can get really incredible labor like India and Mexico City.\u201d -Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said at an event hosted by Barclays Plc in December.\n\nPreviously, Bloomberg also reported on February 4th that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been cutting jobs and simultaneously hiring workers to sell new artificial intelligence products.\n\nThe cuts speak \u201cto the company\u2019s focus on driving productivity and should help offset some of the incremental sales hiring that the company has already outlined\u201d. -Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks dominating Wall Street.

Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool.

His frustration? A booking app without an AI agent to handle his preferences. In contrast, his friends from across the street our seen seated in cozy, sheltered outdoor restaurant, enjoying their meal. As he blames the app for his discomfort, Salesforce introduces its AI agent , positioning it as the solution to avoid such restaurant disasters\u2014because, as Salesforce puts it, it\u2019s what AI was meant to be.\n\nMY HOT TAKE: McConaughey, my guy, if it\u2019s raining, move inside.

It\u2019s also a contrast to other AI ads where we see brands selling AI as a powerful tool. Here, AI is more framed as a glorified assistant for people who are reluctant to handle minor inconveniences.\n\nSalesforce wants AI to seem essential, but in this scenario, it\u2019s making basic human decision-making appear decapitated. Maybe the real takeaway here isn\u2019t about AI at all\u2014it\u2019s about how we\u2019re outsourcing even the simplest forms of human agency to technology.

The challenge isn\u2019t just about security\u2014it\u2019s about finding the right IAM tool that actually works without adding complexity to daily operations.\n\nIf you\u2019re a security leader, IT manager, or business decision-maker, finding the best identity and access management software for your organization can feel overwhelming. With so many options promising airtight security and seamless integration, how do you know which one truly delivers?\n\nI\u2019ve done all this research, so you don\u2019t have to. I spoke with IAM experts, reviewed G2 reports, and gathered insights from my own IT and security team (who have seen enough bad IAM setups to last a lifetime). After comparing 15 leading IAM solutions, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to the top five that actually stand out\u2014for security, scalability, and usability.\n\n5 best identity and access management software: My Top Picks Microsoft Entra ID for organizations already in Microsoft ecosystem.($6/user/month)\n\nfor organizations already in Microsoft ecosystem.($6/user/month) JumpCloud for managing identities across multi-OS environments with built-in mobile device management.($9/user/month)\n\nfor managing identities across multi-OS environments with built-in mobile device management.($9/user/month) Okta for enterprise-grade authentication with effortless third-party integrations.($2/user/month for SSO)\n\nfor enterprise-grade authentication with effortless third-party integrations.($2/user/month for SSO) Salesforce Platform for businesses running on Salesforce that need built-in identity management.

I have mentioned the starting price of their paid plans for easy comparison.\n\nWhether you\u2019re upgrading your IAM strategy or choosing a solution for the first time, this guide will help you find the best fit for your organization.\n\n5 best identity and access management software I recommend\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand how important identity and access management software is for businesses. Without it, managing user access is like handing out keys to an office and losing track of who has them or where they\u2019re being used.\n\nIAM software is what keeps that chaos in check. It controls who gets access to what, when, and how securely, so IT teams can enforce security policies, prevent unauthorized access, and reduce risk without turning every login attempt into a support ticket.\n\nI've seen my fair share of IAM software in all shapes and sizes, from cloud-focused ones to on-premises solutions and from highly customizable systems for large enterprises to simple options for growing teams.\n\nFrom my research and conversations with IAM experts, I\u2019ve realized that the best IAM software isn\u2019t just about security. It's about the balance between secure user authentication, granular access controls for enforcing the least privilege, and smooth integration with existing systems.\n\nHow did I find and evaluate the best IAM software? Finding the best IAM software isn\u2019t just about comparing feature lists or vendor promises\u2014security leaders need solutions that actually work in the real world. I started by analyzing G2 Grid reports, which rank IAM tools based on real-world adoption, user satisfaction, and enterprise fit. This gave me a clear view of which platforms dominate the space and how they perform in areas like authentication, access control, and compliance. To go beyond rankings, I used AI to analyze to analyze hundreds of user reviews of these products. This helped me identify recurring themes\u2014whether it was frustration over clunky authentication flows, praise for adaptive access policies, or concerns about integration with existing security stacks. I also spoke with IAM experts, my own IT and security team members, and professionals who deal with identity security daily. Their feedback helped me cut through the noise and focus on solutions that deliver strong security without becoming a bottleneck for IT operations. The screenshots featured in this article may be a mix of those captured during testing and ones obtained from the vendor\u2019s G2 page.\n\nWhat makes the best identity and access management software: My criteria\n\nBased on everything I\u2019ve learned, here\u2019s the checklist I used to evaluate the top IAM solution:\n\nStrong authentication without friction : Authentication has to be robust, but it shouldn\u2019t create unnecessary headaches. If logging in feels like a chore, users will take shortcuts\u2014reusing passwords, writing them down, or bypassing security altogether. I looked for IAM solutions that offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) beyond the basics, with options like biometric verification, passwordless login, and adaptive authentication that adjusts security requirements based on risk. Single sign-on (SSO) was another big factor since it reduces login fatigue while maintaining security. Risk-based authentication also stood out\u2014solutions that analyze behavior, location, and device to trigger additional security when needed scored higher on my list.\n\n: Authentication has to be robust, but it shouldn\u2019t create unnecessary headaches.

Granular access controls and role-based management: It\u2019s not just about who can log in\u2014it\u2019s about what they can access once inside. IAM solutions that offer strong role-based access control (RBAC) made the cut, allowing IT teams to manage permissions at scale without manually adjusting every user\u2019s access. I also looked at tools with attribute-based access control (ABAC), which considers context like device type, location, and login behavior to make smarter access decisions. Just-in-time access was another feature that stood out, limiting high-privilege access only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, reducing long-term exposure to sensitive systems.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about who can log in\u2014it\u2019s about what they can access once inside.

Just-in-time access was another feature that stood out, limiting high-privilege access only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, reducing long-term exposure to sensitive systems. Integration with existing security infrastructure : An IAM system isn\u2019t useful if it doesn\u2019t fit into the broader security ecosystem. I prioritized solutions that integrate smoothly with identity providers like Active Directory and Azure AD, as well as SIEM platforms for real-time authentication monitoring. IAM should also connect with HR and ITSM systems for automated provisioning and de-provisioning of accounts\u2014because manual account management is a recipe for errors and security gaps.\n\n: An IAM system isn\u2019t useful if it doesn\u2019t fit into the broader security ecosystem.

Compliance and audit-readiness : For organizations dealing with strict regulations, IAM isn\u2019t just a security tool\u2014it\u2019s a compliance requirement. I focused on solutions that offer built-in audit logs, detailed compliance reporting, and governance features like access reviews and certification workflows. Meeting industry standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR was another major factor. Security leaders need IAM tools that don\u2019t just help them secure identities but also make compliance audits less of a nightmare.\n\n: For organizations dealing with strict regulations, IAM isn\u2019t just a security tool\u2014it\u2019s a compliance requirement.

Security leaders need IAM tools that don\u2019t just help them secure identities but also make compliance audits less of a nightmare. Scalability and flexibility for growing organizations : A good IAM solution should grow with the business, not hold it back. I evaluated how well these tools support hybrid IT environments and whether they offer multi-tenant support for enterprises managing multiple subsidiaries or divisions. API-driven customization was another key factor\u2014organizations need IAM systems that allow them to automate workflows and integrate with other security tools instead of forcing a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n: A good IAM solution should grow with the business, not hold it back.

API-driven customization was another key factor\u2014organizations need IAM systems that allow them to automate workflows and integrate with other security tools instead of forcing a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach. User experience: IAM security only works if people actually use it. I looked for IAM solutions that offer clean, intuitive admin dashboards that IT teams can navigate without extensive training. Self-service password reset was another major factor\u2014IT teams don\u2019t have time to constantly unlock accounts just because someone forgot a password. The best solutions reduce friction while still enforcing strong security policies.\n\nI wanted to evaluate IAM solutions from a security-first perspective while also considering how IT teams and employees interact with them daily. After checking each tool against this checklist and cross-referencing it with expert insights, real-world feedback, and AI-driven review analysis, I identified the top five IAM solutions.\n\nThe list below contains genuine user reviews from the IAM software category. To be included in this category, a solution must:\n\nProvision and de-provision of user identities.\n\nAssign access based on individual role, group membership, and other factors.\n\nEnforce user access rights based on permissions.\n\nVerify user identity with authentication, which may include multi-factor authentication methods.\n\nIntegrate with directories that house employee data.\n\n*This data was pulled from G2 in 2025. Some reviews may have been edited for clarity.\n\n1. Microsoft Entra ID\n\nWhen it comes to IAM solutions, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) is often one of the first name that comes up\u2014and for good reason. It\u2019s deeply integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what makes it even more appealing in my opinion. If a company is already using Microsoft services like Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune, or Power Platform, Entra ID comes included for free. That means there\u2019s built-in support for MFA, unlimited SSO across SaaS apps, basic reporting, and self-service password changes for cloud users without any extra cost. For businesses already in the Microsoft ecosystem, this is a huge advantage.\n\nFrom my research and conversations with IT professionals, Entra ID stands out for its strong authentication, powerful security controls, and flexible conditional access policies. Combine it further with Intune, Microsoft's cloud-based endpoint management solution, we get a robust system for unified access control and endpoint management.\n\n\n\nOne of its biggest strengths is conditional access in my opinion. IT teams love the ability to enforce security policies based on user behavior, location, and risk level. This means users logging in from an unknown device might be prompted for MFA, while trusted users on managed devices can access resources without unnecessary friction. It\u2019s a smart approach that balances security with usability.\n\nI also found that we could connect on-premise Active Directory with Entra ID using Entra Connect and simplify access management across cloud and on-premise. I think this is particularly beneficial for organizations transitioning to the cloud but still maintaining on-premises infrastructure.\n\nBut that said, there are some drawbacks too. One of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve come across with Microsoft Entra ID is the setup and configuration process. If you\u2019re already running a Microsoft-heavy environment, things tend to fall into place more smoothly. But for companies with a mixed IT infrastructure or those transitioning from a non-Microsoft setup, getting everything properly configured can take time.\n\nLicensing costs are another thing that stood out to me. Entra ID does come with a free tier if you\u2019re already using Microsoft services, but the more advanced security features under identity protection, governance, and privileged access management are only available in higher-tier licenses like Entra ID P2 or the Suite. That\u2019s where things get tricky in my opinion.\n\nFor smaller organizations that actually need these features but don\u2019t have the budget for premium licensing, it can be a tough call. If you\u2019re looking for a fully-featured IAM solution without spending extra, you really have to dig into which Entra ID tier matches your security and compliance needs.\n\nDespite these cons, Microsoft Entra ID is a solid IAM to consider, especially if you are already in the Microsoft ecosystem and are cloud-native.\n\nWhat I like about Microsoft Entra ID: I love how seamlessly Entra ID integrates with Azure, Office 365, and the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem. There\u2019s no fuss\u2014everything just connects the way it should, from SSO to conditional access policies.\n\nManaging hybrid identities is also a huge win. With Entra Connect, I can sync on-prem Active Directory with the cloud, and on-prem writeback makes life so much easier for businesses that aren\u2019t fully cloud-native yet. What G2 users like about Microsoft Entra ID: \"Microsoft Entra is one of the best solutions Microsoft offers for verifying and identifying enterprise technology assets such as laptops and mobile phones. It ensures that only the right people have access to specific resources. What I like the most are these three features: multi-factor authentication with the Microsoft Authenticator app, identity management for each device, and its integration with BitLocker, which provides full disk encryption for the asset. This way, data is securely stored and can be recovered with a BitLocker recovery key.\" - Microsoft Entra ID Review, Erick Vincent Steve G.\n\nWhat I dislike about Microsoft Entra ID:\n\nFrom what I observed, setting up Entra ID isn\u2019t exactly a smooth ride. If you\u2019re not already locked into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, expect some extra time and effort to get everything configured properly.\n\nBased on my research, licensing cost is another pain point. While the free tier covers the basics, some of the features that security teams actually need are locked behind Entra ID P2, which isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Microsoft Entra ID:\n\n\"Users who are not familiar with Microsoft products will face difficulties in understanding the integration of this product, and the same goes for companies using non-Microsoft platforms. The cost of implementing Microsoft Entra ID could be a concern for low-budget companies along with this, the companies that pose challenges in environments with unstable internet access can face problems because Entra ID is cloud-based.\"\n\n- Microsoft Entra ID Review, Sahil C.\n\nOn a budget? Explore the top free IAM software options.\n\n2. JumpCloud\n\nJumpCloud stands out to me as a flexible, cloud-first IAM solution that\u2019s designed for organizations that want to move beyond traditional on-prem identity management.\n\nWhat I like about it is that JumpCloud follows an open directory approach which gives the freedom to manage identities across Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, and Linux\u2014all from one platform. It doesn\u2019t just work with Azure or Active Directory\u2014it also integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace, AWS, and third-party SaaS apps. That makes it a strong choice for multi-cloud and hybrid setups.\n\nI also like that JumpCloud combines IAM with mobile device management (MDM), directory services, and endpoint security into a single platform. Managing users, devices, and security policies from one place makes life easier, especially for IT teams juggling multiple operating systems.\n\nFrom a usability standpoint, JumpCloud definitely gets my praise for its clean and user-friendly interface. Onboarding new users is simple, and SSO and MFA are easy to deploy across an organization.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve found is that JumpCloud has an extensive knowledge base with step-by-step tutorials and videos. This makes it easy to set up and implement security policies. And if something does go wrong, customer support has a solid reputation.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that can be improved. From what I saw, some features are missing, like self-service for account unlocks, which means IT teams have to step in every time a user gets locked out. There\u2019s also room for improvement in existing features like remote assist, which is a bit clunky to work with.\n\nAlso, from my perspective, JumpCloud does offer MDM, but if you're managing a large fleet of devices, especially in Apple-heavy environments, it might not have the same level of granular control and automation that Jamf or other MDM provides.\n\nThat said, I'd say JumpCloud\u2019s strength lies in its unified approach of integrating IAM, directory services, and MDM into a single platform. If you're looking for an all-in-one solution rather than a standalone enterprise-grade option of IAM and MDM, Jumpcloud is still a solid choice, especially for small and medium businesses, even at a higher price point.\n\nWhat I like about JumpCloud: Unlike Microsoft Entra ID, which is better optimized for the Microsoft ecosystem, JumpCloud gives me the freedom to manage identities across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS\u2014all from a single platform.\n\nI like that JumpCloud isn\u2019t just an IAM solution\u2014it also includes mobile device management (MDM), directory services, and endpoint security. What G2 users like about JumpCloud: \"JumpCloud is very easy to use and user-friendly. It helped us manage our employees' systems. We can now manage software application installations on these systems via a feature in JumpCloud, Software Management, which is quite helpful. Also, it is very easy to apply any policies via JumpCloud to end-user systems, such as password policy, MFA for logging into the system, etc. Also, directory integration is very easy to set up, such as AD, Cloud, or HR directories. With this, we can also run commands on remote systems and take remote assistance/control of the system, which is very useful. And the customer support is always there for you, and they are quite fast in responding.\" - Jumpcloud Review, Saurabh R.\n\nWhat I dislike about JumpCloud:\n\nFrom my observation, some features are still missing. For example, I found it lacks self-service account unlocks. Every time a user gets locked out, IT has to step in, which feels unnecessary when other IAM solutions offer self-service options.\n\nI also think certain features need improvement. For instance, remote Assist feels clunky, and while MDM works, it doesn\u2019t offer the same granular control and automation as dedicated tools like Jamf.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about JumpCloud:\n\n\"Jumpcloud has yet to develop advanced features like self-service for Account unlocks, User orchestration, and governance capabilities, which are necessary in this era of enterprise security management.\"\n\n- Jumpcloud Review, Gangadhara S.\n\n3. Okta\n\nFrom my experience, Okta is one of the most flexible and scalable IAM solutions, especially for organizations that need strong security, seamless integrations, and advanced authentication controls. Okta is also vendor-neutral\u2014just like JumpCloud, and I\u2019ve found it to be a great fit for companies managing multi-cloud environments or handling a complex mix of SaaS applications that require deep integration and automation.\n\nOne thing that really impressed me is how well Okta integrates with other tools. Whether you\u2019re running Microsoft, Google Workspace, AWS, or managing a large number of SaaS applications, Okta handles SSO, adaptive authentication, and automated user provisioning effortlessly.\n\nAnother area where Okta shines is user experience. The interface is a breeze to work with for both IT teams and end users, and from what I\u2019ve seen, it offers one of the smoothest SSO experiences out there.\n\nWhile it has Okta Verify as a solid built-in option for MFA, I find it valuable that it also supports third-party MFA and token providers, giving companies the freedom to integrate what works best for them. I also like that Okta offers a user-customized SSO portal. It\u2019s smooth and efficient and makes managing multiple apps much easier.\n\nNow, there are some downsides. While Okta is packed with enterprise-grade security and IAM features, I\u2019ve seen that pricing can be a hurdle for smaller businesses and startups. Okta offers a la carte pricing, so companies can pick and choose the features they need. For small businesses and startups, these costs can add up, especially when multiple services are needed.\n\nWhile Okta is powerful, getting it fully set up isn\u2019t easy. There are many settings, policies, and integrations that need careful configuration, and the initial setup can feel overwhelming, based on my observations. Definitely, Okta offers good documentation and support, but it still takes time and effort to fine-tune everything for security, access controls, and automation. But once it\u2019s up and running, it\u2019s incredibly effective.\n\nWhat I like about Okta: I highly value that Okta seamlessly integrates with everything, whether you are managing Microsoft, Google Workspace, AWS, or a ton of SaaS apps. It makes SSO, adaptive authentication, and automated user provisioning effortless.\n\nI like that I can customize SSO policies and mix them with different MFA options, including Okta Verify or third-party providers like Symantec VIP, Duo Security and Google Authenticator. It gives me the control I need to balance security with usability. What G2 users like about Okta: \"Over the years, I have worked with Okta across various companies, and I must say that it is honestly one of the best SSO solutions on the market. Not only is it user-friendly with a modern interface, but it also boasts high security standards and supports working with thousands of users simultaneously.\" - Okta Review, Paloma G.\n\nWhat I dislike about Okta:\n\nFrom what I saw, the setup isn\u2019t exactly quick. Okta is powerful, but getting everything configured takes time. There are a lot of settings to fine-tune, and the learning curve can feel steep if you\u2019re new to IAM. Once it\u2019s running, it\u2019s great\u2014but don\u2019t expect to flip a switch and be done.\n\nCost can be a challenge for smaller businesses, in my opinion. With a $1,500 annual contract minimum, it can feel out of reach for startups or small IT teams that only need a few core features.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Okta:\n\n\"Okta is expensive and unsuitable for smaller businesses. Pricing plans are a la carte and confusing. Configuring directories and user synchronization will take a lot of effort and time.\"\n\n- Okta Review, Qual A.\n\nRelated: Learn about how identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) is different from IAM.\n\n4. Salesforce Platform\n\nI'll be honest and admit here that when I think of IAM solutions, Salesforce isn\u2019t the first name that comes to mind. I mean, they are known for their customer relationship management (CRM) system. That was it for me. But after digging in, I realized that Salesforce Identity, offered through the Salesforce Platform, is actually a solid IAM option\u2014especially if your business is already running on Salesforce.\n\nIt has all the essentials I\u2019d expect from an IAM solution\u2014SSO, MFA, connected apps, and centralized user management.\n\nSalesforce also has App Launcher, which lets users access all their business apps, be it Salesforce apps like Salesforce Coud, Mulesoft, Quip, Tableau products or other vendor apps from one place without logging in separately. Even if the company uses Active Directory for user management, you can use Identity Connect to manage Salesforce accounts.That\u2019s a huge win for usability and security, in my opinion.\n\nI like the level of control Salesforce provides over data access. Using connected apps and OAuth, you can define exactly who sees what, making it easy to restrict customer account access to sales and support teams while ensuring other departments only see what they need. Plus, identity monitoring services help track and manage who is accessing systems, services, and data, which is a big win for security teams looking for better visibility into user activity.\n\nI also found Customer Identity to be a strong add-on, especially for large businesses with thousands of customers to track them across all channels. Customers can self-register, log in, and securely access apps with a single identity. The best part is that it\u2019s fully customizable to fit a company\u2019s branding and workflows, making Salesforce not just an IAM solution but also a powerful Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) and marketing tool at the same time.\n\nWhile Salesforce Identity has a lot going for it, there are a few areas where I see some challenges. Setting everything up isn\u2019t as straightforward as you'd expecte\u2014there are a lot of configurations, permissions, and integrations to fine-tune, which can make onboarding time-consuming. Unlike dedicated IAM solutions like Okta or JumpCloud, which are built specifically for identity management, Salesforce Identity is more like a piece of a larger system, so it takes extra effort to get everything working smoothly.\n\nAlso, based on my observations, the platform can feel sluggish, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex workflows. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but if you\u2019re expecting instant access and fast response times all the time, this might be something to keep in mind.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s pricing. In my opinion, Salesforce Identity makes sense for large businesses and enterprises already invested in the Salesforce ecosystem. But, for small to mid-sized companies, it might not be the most budget-friendly option.\n\nMy recommendation would be to use Salesforce Identity if you are already heavily invested in the platform, especially if you are using one of Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Performance Edition of their CRM software.\n\nWhat I like about Salesforce Platform: Salesforce Identity feels like a natural extension rather than a separate tool. Managing SSO, MFA, and user permissions directly within the Salesforce ecosystem makes things easier.\n\nI like that Salesforce Identity isn\u2019t just for employees\u2014it also provides Customer Identity (CIAM) with the external identity license. The ability to let customers and partners self-register, log in, and use social sign-ins like Facebook or LinkedIn makes authentication more easy. What G2 users like about Salesforce Platform: \"Salesforce is cloud-based and offers enterprise-grade scalability. Whether you're connecting to external systems via APIs, using Salesforce Connect for external data sources, or leveraging pre-built connectors for popular tools. I like best is its flexibility and power in enabling businesses to build custom applications without requiring a lot of complex coding. Also customer support is great and very helpful. I am using saleforce daily in my work. It is easy to use, intergrate and implement.\" - Salesforce Platform Review, Rushabh U.\n\nWhat I dislike about Salesforce Platform:\n\nTo me, getting Salesforce Identity fully configured takes time. There are a lot of settings to tweak, permissions to manage, and integrations to set up, which can make onboarding more complicated compared to dedicated IAM solutions like Okta or JumpCloud. Performance can be slow \u2013\n\nAs I see it, certain processes feel sluggish, especially when working with large datasets or complex workflows on Salesforce. So, if you\u2019re expecting fast response times across the board, this might be a pain point.\n\nWhat G2 users like about Salesforce Platform:\n\n\"As a user, what I don't like about Salesforce is that it is very expensive, espically for small bussiness and startups. As a developer, when you are dealing with large amount of data, the reports and dashboard can run slowly and sometimes governor limit can restrict the complex operation.\"\n\n- Salesforce Platform Review, Dhruv G.\n\n5. Cisco Duo\n\nWhen I first explored Cisco Duo, I was impressed by its straightforward approach to security. What really stood out to me is how simple yet effective it is. MFA, SSO, and adaptive authentication are at their core, and unlike some IAM tools that feel bloated with features you\u2019ll never use, Duo keeps things focused and easy to manage.\n\nWhat stands out to me is how easy Duo is to use. Some IAM platforms come with a steep learning curve, but Duo keeps things straightforward based on my research. It\u2019s also highly flexible, integrating with a wide range of applications and platforms, which makes deployment less of a headache\u2014something I can\u2019t always say for other IAM tools.\n\nAnother cool feature is Duo Passport, which makes life easier for users by sharing remembered device sessions across applications. That means fewer repeated logins and less friction for employees who need quick access to multiple systems.\n\nWhat I like the most is that Duo offers a free plan, which isn\u2019t something you see often with IAM solutions. You can add up to 10 users at no cost and still get access to strong MFA, seamless integrations, and Duo\u2019s free authenticator app. It\u2019s a great way for small teams or startups to get started with secure access controls without worrying about budget constraints. Plus, it lets you test Duo\u2019s features before committing to a paid plan, which is always a plus.\n\nOne issue I\u2019ve noticed is that its offline access is limited, which can be frustrating for users who need to authenticate but don\u2019t have an internet connection. I also think there\u2019s room for improvement in Duo\u2019s UI and design. While it\u2019s functional, it could be more intuitive and modern. Duo feels a bit utilitarian in comparison to other platforms. A more polished interface would make the experience even better.\n\nIrrespective of these cons, Cisco Duo is a solid choice for organizations seeking reliable MFA and SSO solutions with seamless integration capabilities\n\nWhat I like about Cisco Duo: Some IAM tools feel like you need a certification just to set them up. But I've found that Duo keeps things straightforward, making MFA, and SSO, easy to deploy without overcomplicating security.\n\nI love that Duo Passport remembers device sessions across apps. You don\u2019t have to keep re-authenticating every time you switch between services. It makes access smoother while keeping security tight. What G2 users like about Cisco Duo: \"It was simple to set up, and authentication is virtually immediate when connecting to my company's VPN. I prefer the push notification approval approach, as it only requires me to tap a button on my phone. It combines with many other out-of-the-box solutions, and it offers cloud-based, AD-integrated SAML SSO and virtual appliance alternatives to protect even bespoke interfaces. We utilized Duo to protect our VMware Horizon desktop environment; setup and deployment were simple, and I like how simple it is to connect with Active Directory. Even better, end user onboarding was simple, and end users found the system simple to use, which is the most important benefit.\" - Cisco Duo Review, Connie B.\n\nWhat I dislike about Cisco Duo:\n\nBased on my research, if a user doesn\u2019t have an internet connection, Duo doesn\u2019t offer many ways to authenticate, which can be a problem for people who travel or work remotely in low-connectivity areas.\n\nFrom what I saw, the UI feels a little outdated \u2013 It works, but it\u2019s not the most modern or intuitive interface I\u2019ve seen. A refresh would make the experience smoother, especially for IT teams managing large deployments.\n\nWhat G2 users dislike about Cisco Duo:\n\n\"The set up of online and offline can be confusing for end users. Also, if time desyncs, it becomes a HUGE problem.\"\n\n- Cisco Duo Review, Jonathan M.\n\nExplore the best password managers that are designed to securely store, generate, and autofill passwords while protecting user accounts.\n\nNow, there are a few more options, as mentioned below, that didn't make it to this list but are still worth considering, in my opinion:\n\nAWS Verified Access: Best for securing AWS environments with Zero Trust access controls.\n\nGoogle Cloud Identity: Best for organizations deep in the Google ecosystem needing seamless IAM.\n\nOracle Identity Cloud Service: Best for hybrid cloud IAM with strong enterprise integrations.\n\nRippling: Best for combining IAM with HR and payroll management in one platform.\n\nIBM Verify: Best for AI-driven identity security and advanced threat detection.\n\nSailPoint: Best for enterprise-level identity governance and compliance management.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on IAM software\n\n1. Why is IAM important for businesses?\n\nIAM enhances security, reduces the risk of data breaches, streamlines user access, and ensures compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). It also improves productivity by automating user provisioning and access management.\n\n2. What features should I look for in IAM software?\n\nKey IAM features include:\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO): Enables users to log in once and access multiple applications.\n\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords.\n\nUser provisioning and deprovisioning: Automates account creation and removal.\n\nRole-based access control (RBAC):Assigns permissions based on job roles.\n\nAudit and compliance reporting: Helps track access logs for security and regulatory purposes.\n\nIdentity federation: Supports cross-domain authentication.\n\n3. What is the difference between IAM and PAM (Privileged Access Management)?\n\nIAM focuses on managing access for all users in an organization. PAM is specifically designed to secure access for privileged accounts with elevated permissions, such as system administrators.\n\n4. Is IAM software cloud-based or on-premises?\n\nIAM solutions can be:\n\nCloud-based: Hosted by a provider, scalable, and ideal for modern SaaS applications.\n\nOn-premises: Installed within a company\u2019s infrastructure, offering more control over security policies.\n\nHybrid: Combines both models for flexibility.\n\n5. Can IAM software help with Zero Trust security?\n\nYes, IAM is a critical component of Zero Trust by enforcing identity verification, least privilege access, and continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n6. How much does IAM software cost?\n\nIAM pricing varies based on features, deployment type, and the number of users. Some vendors offer subscription-based models, while others provide enterprise licensing. Additional costs may include implementation, support, and compliance features.\n\n7. How can I choose the right IAM solution for my business?\n\nConsider: Your organization's size and security need Integration capabilities with your existing tools, Compliance requirements, Scalability, ease of use, and Support for modern security practices (e.g., Zero Trust, MFA, adaptive authentication).\n\n8. Which is the best identity and access management software?\n\nThe best IAM tool depends on your organization's needs, budget, and existing infrastructure. Popular IAM solutions include Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), JumpCloud, Cicso Duo, Ping Identity, IBM Security Verify, and ForgeRock. It's best to compare features, integrations, and security capabilities before choosing.\n\nIAM ready\n\nAfter digging into the best IAM software solutions, I\u2019ve come to one conclusion: security should work with people, not against them. The strongest authentication policies in the world won\u2019t help if employees find ways around them out of frustration. At the same time, an easy login experience means nothing if the wrong person gains access. That\u2019s the balancing act every IT and security team faces, and the right IAM tool makes all the difference.\n\nIf your company is deep in Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, Entra ID is a strong choice. JumpCloud and Okta gives you flexibility across different platforms. Salesforce Identity makes sense if Salesforce runs your business, and Cisco Duo keeps things simple with strong MFA and integrations. Each tool has its place\u2014but the best IAM solution is the one that fits how your organization actually operates.\n\nAt the end of the day, IAM isn\u2019t just about securing logins\u2014it\u2019s about protecting your business from real threats while keeping access smooth for the right people. So, Ppick the right IAM, and you\u2019re not just enforcing policies\u2014you\u2019re building a security culture that actually works.\n\nStill on the hunt?

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index.

            "content": "Fewer than half of consumers are fully satisfied with what banks, insurance providers, and wealth management advisors deliver. That\u2019s why standout customer service and digital experiences \u2014 including those powered by AI agents \u2014 are key to earning and keeping their business. That\u2019s a key finding from Salesforce\u2019s new Connected Financial Services Report, based on a global survey of 9,500 financial service institution (FSI) consumers.\n\nWhy it matters: Consumers consistently report that competitive rates, fees, and pricing keep them loyal to their FSI. With declining interest rates making introductory incentives less feasible for FSIs, differentiated customer service and digital experiences are getting renewed attention. The advent of AI agents presents an opportunity for FSIs to boost their digital experiences to exceed customers\u2019 high expectations for speed and personalization.\n\nIn addition to the most competitive pricing, rates, and fees, FSIs can win customers by providing standout service and tools. In fact, 46% of consumers \u2014 including 55% of high earners (defined in the United States as households making over $100,000 per year) would remain with an FSI that provides an excellent customer experience even if it raised its rates or fees.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nWhat constitutes an excellent experience is digital and self-service in nature, with most consumers opting to complete tasks without the help of representatives over the phone or in a branch.\n\nSalesforce customers like Pentagon Federal Credit Union (PenFed) meet these customer expectations through self-service tools that provide quick customer resolutions whenever, wherever.\n\nOnly 41% of wealth management clients are fully satisfied with their institutions\u2019 customer service speed and effectiveness \u2014 figures which drop even further among banking and insurance customers. AI agents \u2014 which understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention \u2014 offer a unique opportunity for FSIs to differentiate their digital experiences against the competition while increasing efficiency and lowering costs.\n\nHalf of consumers expect AI to impact their relationships with FSIs more than other industries \u2014 a sentiment that\u2019s higher among millennials and Gen Z \u2014 and only 8% think FSIs will be AI laggards. Customers are especially bullish about the potential of AI to speed up financial transactions \u2014 65% now expect this, up from 46% in 2023.\n\nBut as agents increasingly come online, consumers will need more education and demonstrations of their sophisticated capabilities, which include acting as financial coaches, increasing financial literacy, and showing consumers how to save or even earn money.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI solutions like Agentforce will scale a limitless expert digital labor force for financial institutions,\u201d noted Eran Agrios, SVP & GM of Financial Services at Salesforce. \u201cImagine FSIs that provide a personal digital banker, advisor, or agent to every one of their customers 24/7 to answer questions like \u2018Am I saving enough for retirement?\u2019 or \u2018Can I afford this trip?\u2019 without waiting. That\u2019s the scale that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAs FSIs race to take advantage of AI and agents, choosing the right partners and technology is key to ensuring consumer trust. While 54% of consumers say they trust the use of AI agents, only 10% say they completely trust them.\n\nThis is likely in part because people are naturally cautious about new technology, but they also don\u2019t trust how financial companies handle their data, according to the survey. Many consumers report being worried about how their personal information is used and protected, and they are becoming more cautious about keeping it safe.\n\nA related study of global consumers revealed the critical importance of transparency as companies across industries implement agents. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of consumers say it\u2019s important to know whether or not they\u2019re communicating with an agent in the first place.\n\n\u201cFor humans and agents to work together, it\u2019s critical for financial service institutions to implement with trust, transparency, and the highest levels of regulatory compliance as core to their strategy \u2014 not an afterthought,\u201d said Agrios. \u201cInstitutions must ask themselves not only if their strategies are worthy of customers\u2019 trust, but if the solutions they invest in are, too.\u201d\n\nWhat this means for ERP insiders\n\nGet tips from FSIs already down the path with Agentforce. A prominent financial services company specializing in banking and insurance faced challenges with complex loan application procedures, limited access to credit information, and inefficient data collection. By implementing Agentforce, they developed a customized Loan Assistance Agent that simplified the loan application process for customers, automated the collection of essential customer information, and enhanced the review mechanism for submitted applications. This integration led to improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Similarly, a regional bank with over a million clients aimed to reduce customer attrition, particularly among younger account holders. Utilizing Agentforce, the bank empowered its sales representatives to identify at-risk clients through automated data analysis, engage proactively with personalized offers and communications, and automate routine tasks, allowing staff to focus on high-value activities. This approach resulted in improved client retention and more efficient operations.\n\nFSIs should lay out clear Agentforce, ERP integration and performance optimization plans. Application integration gurus will tell you to pursue an API-first strategy, by leveraging Salesforce APIs (REST, SOAP, Bulk APIs) to connect Agentforce with ERP systems like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, and Workday. Also, use Mulesoft (Salesforce-owned), Boomi, Informatica, or other iPaaS solutions to manage data exchange efficiently. And build an event-driven architecture by implementing Kafka, AWS EventBridge, or Azure Event Grid for real-time data synchronization. Also it\u2019s a good idea to unify customer data across Agentforce and ERP systems for holistic insights into financial history (e.g., loans, accounts, investments), personalized interactions based on behavioral data, and seamless handoffs between departments (e.g., sales, underwriting, customer service). Most high-performing customer- and data-driven companies will also implement Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) like Salesforce Data Cloud for advanced segmentation and analytics. Security and compliance are paramount in the financial services industry so FSIs should implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) between Agentforce and ERP systems, using role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict sensitive data access, encrypting data in transit (TLS 1.2/1.3) and at rest (AES-256), and ensuring audit logs and compliance reporting for financial regulations.\n\nNext two years will define the future of AI-powered finance. AI-powered virtual financial advisors and wealth managers will outperform human advisors in speed, efficiency, and personalization. Traditional banks and wealth management firms will lose market share to AI-first fintech companies. Firms leveraging AI-driven hyper-personalization (e.g., AI-generated investment portfolios, autonomous trading) will attract more digital-native customers. For example JP Morgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs are already exploring AI-driven wealth management solutions, while fintech disruptors like Wealthfront, Betterment, and Robinhood are integrating agentic AI to offer real-time, adaptive financial planning. Agentic AI will detect fraud and risks in real-time, predicting fraudulent transactions before they happen. AI-native financial institutions will outperform legacy banks in security, cutting fraud rates by up to 40-50%. Regulatory-compliant AI models will reduce compliance costs and accelerate regulatory approvals. For example, Mastercard\u2019s Decision Intelligence AI detects fraud with near zero false positives. And AI-first credit risk assessments will disrupt FICO and credit scoring systems, benefiting challenger banks and fintech lenders. Agentic AI will automate high-frequency trading (HFT) and dynamic asset allocation with real-time decision-making. Hedge funds, trading firms, and investment banks will rely less on human traders and more on self-learning AI-driven trading algorithms. AI-driven market makers will increase liquidity while reducing spreads, making markets more efficient. For instance, Citadel Securities and Renaissance Technologies are doubling down on AI-driven trading, while startups like Kavout and Aiera are using AI to analyze real-time market sentiment and execute autonomous trades. AI chatbots and voice assistants will replace Tier 1 and Tier 2 customer service reps, reducing customer service costs by 30-50%. AI-powered neobanks (e.g., Chime, Revolut, Monzo) will dominate customer experience with instant AI-driven resolutions. Traditional banks will either adapt or lose customers to digital-first, AI-native competitors. For example, Bank of America\u2019s Erica AI has handled over 1.5 billion interactions, reducing wait times and costs. And HSBC and Citi are testing agentic AI for real-time mortgage approvals and loan servicing.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market\u2019s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump\u2019s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.\n\nSectors To Focus on in 2025\n\nFidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector\u2019s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.\n\nThe H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nGrowth Drivers Amidst Policy Shifts\n\nAs per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity\u2014mainly in industrials and healthcare\u2014 are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.\n\nEven though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration\u2019s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.",

Employers in the US slashed more jobs in January compared to December, but the figure was the lowest recorded for the month in three years, the latest monthly report from the global outplacement and business and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc showed, reported Business Insider.The Challenger report showed that 49,795 jobs were cut in January, up 28 percent from the 38,792 announced in December. However, the figure was 40 percent less than the 82,307 cuts announced in January 2024.Big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta handed over pink slips to its employees in January. Reports suggest thousands of people have lost their jobs in at least over two dozen firms in the US.Software giant Workday is slated to lay off about 1,750 employees, its CEO Carl Eschenbach revealed. The CEO reportedly blamed \"increasing demand\" for artificial intelligence as having \"the potential to drive a new era of growth\" for the company. In other words, AI is the reason for the layoffs. The layoffs are expected to impact about 8.5% of the company's staff around the world. Eschenbach added that the firm will be \"prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development.\"Walmart, America's largest private employer, is eliminating hundreds of roles and closing one of its North Carolina offices as it continues to pull workers back to its main hubs in California and Arkansas. The initiative aims to consolidate the company's corporate footprint, according to a report by Bloomberg. According to an internal memo written by Walmart's Chief People Officer Donna Morris, Walmart will be shutting down its Charlotte, North Carolina office and eliminating hundreds of roles in the process. Walmart did not specify the exact number of people affected or when the office would be shut down.Amazon has cut dozens of jobs in its communications unit in an effort to cut costs. In a fresh round of layoffs, the tech giant has eliminated a \"small number of roles\" in its communications department, as part of its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, according to a Bloomberg report. \u201cFollowing a recent review, we\u2019re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs part of these changes, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles. We don\u2019t make these decisions lightly, and we\u2019re committed to supporting affected employees through their transitions.\u201dMicrosoft has reportedly begun firing employees on the basis of their performance with employees receiving termination notices due to not meeting the company\u2019s job performance standards. According to a report in Business Insider, the affected employees will lose their jobs with immediate effect and receiving no severance packages, according to termination letters sent to staff. The report suggests that the termination letters state that employees are being let go because their \"job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations\" for their positions.\" The report mentions that at least three employees have claimed they were informed by the company that they would not receive any compensation.Facebook parent company Meta will lay off around 3,600 employees who are identified as low performers in the new year, Bloomberg reported. CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the decision as a step to \"raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster\" as the company forges ahead in building out AI-powered services and immersive devices. Notices will go out to employees losing their jobs starting at 5 a.m. local time Monday in most countries, including in the US, according to one of the posts, authored by Meta's Head of People Janelle Gale. The company confirmed last month that it was planning to trim about 5% of its \"lowest performers\" and backfill at least some of the positions.Last week reports said Google has offered a voluntary exit programme to US-based employees within its Platforms & Devices organisation, the division responsible for key products like Android, Pixel, Chrome, and Nest. The program, announced via an internal memo from Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh and first reported by 9to5Google, offers severance packages to employees who choose to leave the division. \u201cThe Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package,\u201d a Google spokesperson confirmed.It has been reported that Salesforce is planning to cut over 1,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. Bloomberg News reported that the company is simultaneously hiring new employees to support its expansion into Al-driven products. Notably, displaced workers will be able to apply for other jobs internally. It could not be determined which divisions the reductions were focused on.Stripe has announced the layoff of 300 employees, primarily impacting roles in product, engineering, and operations, according to an internal memo dated January 20. Despite this decision, Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh noted in the memo that the company plans to grow its overall workforce to around 10,000 employees by the year's end.: The Washington Post said in January it would lay off about 4% of its workforce or less than 100 employees in a bid to cut costs, as the storied newspaper grapples with growing losses, reported Reuters. The newspaper is making changes across several business functions, a spokesperson said, while suggesting the job cuts will not impact its newsroom. The Post has seen a decline its digital readership and reported a $77 million loss in 2023.Companies are cutting jobs even as the US economy grows. In January, the US economy added 353,000 jobs, double economists' predictions. Despite this, major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Discord, Salesforce, and eBay all reduced their workforces. These cuts follow significant tech stock declines in 2022.Companies are under pressure from investors to increase profits. This has led to layoffs, particularly among workers hired during the pandemic's increased consumer tech spending. A World Economic Forum survey found 41% of global companies expect to reduce workforces in the next five years due to artificial intelligence.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said, \u201cAI is likely to make dramatic improvements in workers\u2019 quality of life, even if it eliminates some positions.\"Cost-cutting is a major factor in these job reductions, especially in the tech and consumer sectors. Imperio Consulting CEO Eric Brown explained, \u201cTech and consumer-focused sectors often feel the brunt of market volatility first. When budgets shrink, businesses curb spending on new tools and marketing. Companies with direct exposure to tight capital markets are more likely to see employees facing the chop.\\\"Economic concerns and inflation in 2022 and 2023 reduced business spending on software and cloud services, further contributing to layoffs. Recent cuts reportedly target middle managers, some of whom are seeking coding jobs rather than management roles.",

            "content": "Comment (updated) Tesla reportedly decided not to upgrade its SAP's enterprise software a decade ago, opting to build its own system instead. Now, with Elon Musk heading up the Trump-blessed US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his cost-cutting mindset could have major implications for federal IT spending - and the big tech vendors cashing in on government contracts.\n\nIf he thought SAP was too bloated and overpriced, what does that mean for big-spending government departments?\n\nFirst in the line of fire has been USAID, which Musk said he had put through a \u201cwood chipper\u201d last Sunday.\n\nWhile the whole federal agency dedicated to distributing billions of dollars in aid around the world may not totally disappear, it may well be massively cut and merge with the State Department, though reports conflict on the details.\n\nLegal challenges have added further uncertainty. On Friday, a federal judge put at least part of those plans on hold, temporarily pausing the Trump administration from placing thousands of USAID workers on administrative leave.\n\nNonetheless, this raises questions about USAID's tech contracts, how they will be dealt with, and what the fallout will be during any dismantlement and after. Its major partner is NTT Data, the Japanese tech services giant, which runs a contract worth up to $469.7 million for custom computer programming services.\n\nTech consultancy Accenture and CRM software vendor Salesforce are among the tech suppliers cashing in on USAID's IT budget, too.\n\nNTT Data declined to comment on how changes at USAID may affect its work with them, wood chipper or no wood chipper.\n\nRegardless of political stance, USAID is a relatively small federal department. If DOGE really wants to get a hold of US government tech spending, it needs to think bigger \u2013 which means, apart from the potentially daunting technical aspect of cutting down services, the team will run into certain powerful forces that presumably would rather keep millions of dollars in IT deals rolling in.\n\nAccording to President Trump, the administration has the final say on whether to proceed with cuts recommended by DOGE, though so far the commander-in-chief has backed Musk, whose companies continue to hold contracts and other dealings and interactions with the very government the SpaceX billionaire is now rifling through.\n\nThe largest federal government department is Health and Human Services, with a total budget of $1.7 trillion proposed for 2025 - most of it allocated to Medicare and Medicaid, which DOGE has been poking around this week already.\n\nMeanwhile, General Dynamics has a $879.1 million deal for custom computer programming services, and Accenture has an up to $805 million contract for systems design services.\n\nAnother famously big spender in the federal government is the Department of Defense, with a total budget of $850 billion for fiscal year 2025 \u2013 another part of Uncle Sam DOGE has started investigating along with the Dept of Education.\n\nThe Pentagon relies heavily on Oracle for its ERP and finance systems, and has a string of contracts with Big Red, including this one for $338 million.\n\nOracle resellers and systems integration partners also feature prominently on the DoD\u2019s tech spending list, including Mythics LLC, with a $307.5 million deal, and DLT Solutions (part of TD Synnex) with deals worth $279.3 million, $238 million and $132 million.\n\nNonetheless, it remains to be seen how much of DOGE\u2019s plan is to create a barrage of noise and attacks on Trump and Musk\u2019s political and commercial opponents, and how much is really planned to reel in government spending. After all, the systems and relationships are very entrenched and creating alternatives may be more challenging than a migration at a relatively small automaker. Yes, despite Tesla\u2019s market valuation, it doesn\u2019t rank in the top 10 automotive manufacturers in terms of production.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the IT suppliers have friends in high places. Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, a proud Republican, stood alongside Trump during the launch of the proposed $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nAnother Oracle project at the Department of Veterans Affairs just rebooted a $330 million project, despite concerns over the rollout cost and safety of its Cerner patient record system under the original $9.99 billion deal. We cannot imagine Oracle standing by and letting these contracts be whittled down without some say in it.\n\nTrump's pick for Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said during a Senate nomination hearing that the program had gone on for \u201ctoo many years and cost too many billions of dollars without finding a solution.\" He said it would be \"one of the very first priorities, if confirmed, is to get in and figure out why and put this on a bigger timeframe to get this medical health records issue solved.\"\n\nGoing after federal government tech spending might be more difficult than it seems, therefore, but there is also more to Tesla\u2019s ERP system.\n\nDespite claims that a team of 250 Tesla staffers built a new ERP system in four months, other reports suggest it built some manufacturing software that was bolted on the side of a Microsoft Dynamics finance system.\n\nLike many tech legends, the truth is far less exciting than the myth. The same may be true of DOGE\u2019s efforts to take on federal agency\u2019s big tech spending. \u00ae\n\nSpeaking of DOGE... The team was this week blocked from accessing the US Dept of Labor's data in a win for unions. A 19-year-old member of DOGE was reportedly fired from an internship after he was accused of sharing information with a competitor. And it's not just inexperienced engineers in the squad; it also has lawyers with elite establishment credentials. There are various reports of the crew, with the White House's blessing, accessing highly sensitive systems, some involving personal data and classified materials, at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the General Services Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Dept of Education, at least. This has included, it's said, analyzing sensitive Dept of Education data with AI tools in Microsoft's Azure cloud. All with the stated intention of rooting out inefficiencies and things to cut, aka stuff Musk doesn't find appropriate.\n\nUpdated to add on February 11\n\nAn earlier version of this story said Peraton was one of the big-ticket tech suppliers that would come under DOGE scrutiny. We have since learned its contract ended in 2021 and we are happy to make this clear.",

Savings of high proportions of contact centers are registered on operational cost, along with improved productivity. Average return on investment for companies using integrated CTI-CRM solutions is 315% in the first year, and the costs of implementation are recovered within three to five months. Such performance improvements translate into tangible financial benefits such as reduced average handling times, higher first-call resolution rates, and a 45% increase in agent productivity.

Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

Moreover, the ETF\u2019s 1.5% gains on a YTD basis outshines the stock\u2019s losses over the same time frame.\n\nCRM's underperformance stems from significant near-term challenges. Revenue growth has slowed due to cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Businesses are now prioritizing smaller, incremental projects over large-scale digital transformations, forcing Salesforce to adapt. Moreover, foreign exchange headwinds and competition from Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL) further complicate its near-term outlook.\n\nOn Dec. 3, CRM reported its Q3 results, and its shares closed up by 11% in the following trading session. Its adjusted EPS of $2.41 missed the Wall Street expectations of $2.44. The company\u2019s revenue was $9.4 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $9.3 billion. For Q4, CRM expects adjusted EPS to be between $2.57 and $2.62, and expects revenue to be between $9.9 billion and $10.1 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ended in January, analysts expected CRM\u2019s EPS to grow 23.4% to $7.48 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 45 analysts covering CRM stock, the consensus is a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 33 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, three \u201cModerate Buys,\u201d seven \u201cHolds,\u201d and two \u201cStrong Sells.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than a month ago, with its overall rating of \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d consisting of 32 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 6, Stifel Nicolaus analyst J. Parker Lane maintained a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on CRM with a price target of $425, implying a potential upside of 28.5% from current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $397.81 represents a 20.3% premium to CRM\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $450 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 36%.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "A lot is happening in the world of artificial intelligence, and not a lot of it makes sense. We're told that AI is the future of business, yet it is wildly unprofitable; investment in AI companies is ramping up even as AI-adjacent tech stocks tumble; the American Plagiarism Machine is accusing the Chinese Plagiarism Machine of plagiarism. But nothing\u2014nothing\u2014is as head-spinning, as bizarre, or as infuriating as this, the bafflingly ubiquitous ad where renowned actors Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson hawk Salesforce's newest AI enterprise software product:\n\nI want to note up front that my anger with this commercial is not because it is aimed at somebody who is not me. I've lived in D.C., and as such I am intimately familiar with seeing ads on the Metro designed to appeal exclusively to a handful of senators and Department of Defense procurement specialists. Our Kinetic Weapon Systems Shred Human Bodies 15 Percent Faster Than Our Competitors ... Northrup Grumman: We Make The Possible Practical, etc. I mostly do not mind when the ad I am watching is selling something I do not need and cannot buy for a business I do not run.\n\nBut this commercial? This one is different. The bewilderment and rage at this commercial has spread to all corners of the internet, including the hosts of the legal podcast 5-4, sportswriter Katie Nolan, and countless social media posts. It demands an explication, which I will do my best to provide to you at the cost of what is left of my sanity.\n\nThe ad\u2014entitled \"Dining Alfiasco,\" its first and last moment of wit\u2014begins with a thoroughly soaked McConaughey, sitting alone outside a restaurant in the middle of the pouring rain:\n\n\"The booking app I used didn't have AgentforceTM, so an AI agent didn't know to move my reservations inside...\"\n\nFirst off, the sheer density of this opening text rivals only \"He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died\" in the modern canon. Subjects, objects, and causal relationships pummel and disorient the viewer like a flurry of jabs to the face. This will also be, incredibly, the least confusing part of this sentence.\n\nThis tell-don't-show exposition immediately raises numerous questions, none of which are answerable without descending into the mouth of madness. For starters: Wealthy and extremely famous person Matthew McConaughey makes his dinner reservations with a booking app? How many OpenTable points do we think he has? And what does it matter that his initial reservation was for a table outside; in what universe would a restaurant staff decide to seat anyone\u2014let alone Matthew David Goddamn McConaughey\u2014outside during a deluge? Were there no indoor tables available at this restaurant, or did they refuse to modify his reservation on principle? In either case, how would an AI agent powered by AgentforceTM\u2014a cutting-edge digital labor platform, certainly, but not a miracle worker\u2014accomplish what McConaughey apparently could not? And, why\u2014for the love of God, why\u2014would McConaughey let himself be seated outside during this downpour? Why has he decided to be complicit in his own abjection?\n\nAlso, note McConaughey's line reading here: He says that the absent-or-incompetent AI agent didn't know to move \"my reservations\" inside. (He says the line quickly, but he definitely says reservations, plural. By now, my relationship to this commercial is roughly that of Jim Garrison to the Zapruder film.) \"My reservations\" is either a perfect Freudian slip, a reveal that even McConaughey understands enough about AI to trigger subconscious anxiety, or\u2014horrifyingly\u2014an insinuation that this exact situation, which never has happened to anyone else, ever, has happened to Matthew McConaughey multiple times.\n\nThe ad continues, with McConaughey disdainfully considering a shrimp cocktail before shoving it away:\n\n\"...or know what I like to eat, which is not that.\"\n\nWith this, the ad moves from the merely inexplicable to the thoroughly insane. McConaughey is dining\u2014or attempting to dine, given adverse conditions\u2014at a restaurant where they bring food to you unbidden? The simple act and near-universal social custom of perusing a menu of available dishes and communicating what you want to the kitchen, either directly or through a go-between, has been abandoned at this establishment? The thoroughly solved problem of obtaining the food that you want from an establishment that sells food\u2014at least as, if not more, thoroughly solved than the problem of water falling from the sky onto your body\u2014now requires AI to ensure that people don't incorrectly get what they didn't order?\n\nIt is simply wild that Salesforce has this opportunity to highlight to a mass audience, even indirectly, their best and most promising use-case for AI, and here they are aggressively pitching an inscrutable solution to a non-existent problem. What often ruins advertisements aimed at the highest socioeconomic strata is a lack of relatability. (Is your banged-up old car elevator ruining your enjoyment of your Maui beach house?) In a mind-bending twist, that is not the problem here. The basics of this premise\u2014a restaurant, a table, food, even a booking app\u2014are extremely relatable to almost everyone. What makes this commercial an avant-garde experience is that at no point are the people on-screen relating to these perfectly ordinary things in a way that any human ever has. Booking apps are in charge of ordering the food while the restaurants abuse their patrons, and in Rand McNally hamburgers eat people.\n\nThe only true note in all of this is that it is totally believable that Matthew McConaughey finds a mere shrimp cocktail beneath his enlightened palate.\n\nAgain, though, we return to the central question: Why is he just sitting there? He is deliberately immiserating himself through inaction, while the only people who could conceivably help him are instead making his situation worse. Nobody should be treated like this, let alone an Oscar-winning actor, Lincoln Motor Company in-house poet, and the man famous for playing Wooderson, the charming and eminently quotable pedophile from Dazed and Confused. Why won\u2019t he leave??? Everyone is acting like it has to be this way, but it ... just ... doesn't?\n\nIt is at this moment that the true terror sets in. This ad is not a sales pitch; it is a vision of the dystopia to come. The world depicted in this commercial is one where AI has come to dominate our lives. AI will be what intermediates you and other human beings, it will direct you where to go and what to do, it will give you what it decides to give you, its decisions are binding on you and others, its judgment is irreversible, and you will have to sit there and take it.\n\nThe only choice you have here is to choose which machine makes your choices for you. Salesforce promises that AgentforceTM AI will allow you to \"unlock human success,\" but this ad reveals that the opposite is true: It will, at best, construct for you a higher-quality prison. This situation is unbearably bleak, until:\n\n\"What's up, my brother?\" \"Oh, hey, bud!\"\n\nSuddenly, we see our hero, Woody Harrelson, dining at a restaurant across the street and oafishly grinning at the predicament McConaughey has found himself in. Harrelson's dinner companions are a man and a woman of indeterminable age and mysterious relation; McConaughey's debasement brings peals of laughter from the man and a look of abject horror from the woman. Neither speaks, and it is plausible that they exist only because it would be sad to show Harrelson dining alone. Could they be AI-generated? My thoughts are indistinguishable from Rorschach diary entries at this point.\n\nTwo things are immediately evident upon the Harrelson reveal. First\u2014and, for me, the most important\u2014there is the tantalizing possibility that what we're seeing is happening in the world of True Detective, Season 1. To those skeptical of this reading, I ask: Who is more likely to sit in obvious discomfort for reasons they cannot articulate, international superstar Matthew McConaughey or self-destructive nihilist Rust Cohle? (\"I tell myself I bear witness, but the real answer is that it's obviously my programming, and I lack the constitution for suicide.\") And if anyone would forego human connection and give himself over to an AI-powered ubermensch\u2014though one sadly lacking AgentforceTM's powerful Atlas Reasoning Engine and specialized, always-on support\u2014wouldn't it be someone who has witnessed firsthand man's inhumanity to man, and is also in possession of an A.J. Soprano\u2013level understanding of Nietzsche? (\"Why should I live in history, huh? Fuck, I don't wanna know anything anymore. This is a world where nothing is solved.\") You can see it, right?\n\nIn any event, the second thing you notice is what doesn't happen next. In a normal commercial, it would be revealed that Harrelson did what McConaughey failed to do: namely, that he had used a booking app that does have AgentforceTM, and as a result its AI agent\u2014no doubt using its seamless integration with the Salesforce ecosystem\u2014did know to seat diners where it is dry instead of where it is wet. This is Advertising 101: You introduce Goofus, who doesn't use your product, and therefore is sad; then you show Gallant, who does use your product, and therefore is happy.\n\nI very much dislike these kinds of ads\u2014the sputtering emasculation of Goofus, the tired gender stereotype of Goofus's harumphing wife, the thought of disappointing those that I love with my poor choice of interior wall paint\u2014and yet there is no catharsis in an ad that shows Goofus's pain without Gallant's triumph. But imagine, just imagine, Harrelson turning to the camera and saying something like:\n\n\"Thankfully, my booking app had AgentforceTM powering its AI agent, and that's the reason why I moved indoors during a storm and that's why this restaurant served me the food that I wanted.\"\n\nThat pitch never comes, for the obvious reason that it would make absolutely no goddamn sense. Still, its absence gives the whole game away: Nobody in this commercial, or anywhere, actually needs any of this shit. There is no evidence that the other, competent restaurant uses AI at all, or that the other diners needed an AI agent in a booking app to get themselves out of the rain, or that the Harrelson throuple did anything other than order their food off a menu like actual human beings. They are normal people doing normal things in a normal way; only McConaughey needs the power of AI to avoid rain and purchase food, two things mankind has been doing successfully for thousands of years.\n\nAfter some small talk about the necessity of the rain (... reference to horrors of climate change or mere coincidence? ... hunrh ... must investigate further ...), Harrelson finally extends his hand:\n\n\"Paddle on over! We got you, brother.\"\n\nHarrelson considers McConaughey in a way that AI could never: as a person, with autonomy and agency. Harrelson reaches out to him with love, beckoning him back to humanity. In doing so, Harrelson gives McConaughey that which had been taken from him, that what he could not see he needed: a choice. He is free to leave this cursed place, and at long last, become fully himself again.\n\nAs McConaughey gets up to cross the street, the tagline flashes:\n\nWhat AI Was Meant To Be\n\nGiven what we've seen here, it is clear what AI is meant to be. AI is meant to be ignored, discarded, rejected in favor of the shelter of community and the warm embrace of a friend. Rust Cohle, again:\n\nTo realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person.\n\nCome on. It kinda works, right?",

Brandon Sloter/Getty Images\n\nSalesforce, the software giant with deep ties to San Francisco, is laying off 153 local workers.\n\nAfter declining to confirm or comment on a Monday Bloomberg report that said the company was laying off a total of 1,000 employees, Salesforce revealed the San Francisco cuts in a WARN notice to state officials on Tuesday. Such notices are usually required in the event of mass layoffs in a single location.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the WARN document, Salesforce said the laid-off workers are based in SoMa\u2019s Salesforce Tower and that they would be quickly notified. The cuts span three divisions: 42 in Technology and Product, 25 in Sales and Distribution and 86 in General Administration.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, more than a dozen discharged employees had flooded onto LinkedIn with references to the layoff and #OpenToWork posts. One former sales director blamed \u201cthe powers that be (AI?),\u201d and a few of the posters called the layoffs \u201cunexpected.\u201d\n\nThe job cuts come just a few weeks after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said his company had opened up 2,000 salesperson positions, looking for new workers to sell its artificial intelligence offering known as \u201cAgentforce.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that Salesforce is one of a few software companies shifting more of its hiring away from the United States. In its story, the outlet cited a comment from Brian Millham, Salesforce\u2019s chief operating officer, at a December event hosted by Barclays.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cDo we need to hire everybody in San Francisco?\u201d Millham, who is stepping down from the exec role, reportedly said. \u201cOr can we think about other locations that are cheaper where we can get really incredible labor like India and Mexico City.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Salesforce is one of the city\u2019s largest employers.

            "content": "Copado this week extended the reach of its DevOps platform to include the Salesforce Data Cloud service, which is at the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) agents that Salesforce hopes organizations will build and deploy on its platforms.\n\nThe Salesforce agentic AI strategy, dubbed Agentforce, revolves around using the Salesforce Data Cloud to provide access to metadata that will be used to train AI models to automate specific tasks.\n\nDavid Brooks, senior vice president of evangelism for Copado, said Copado is now making it possible to apply best DevOps practices to configuring the Salesforce Data Cloud, including integrations with sandboxes and data kits.\n\nThe Salesforce software-as-a-service (SaaS) application platform requires a special set of DevOps tools because it is based on a set of objects, tables and metadata that need to be invoked by any custom application added to the platform. That approach eliminates the traditional separation of concerns on other platforms used to build and deploy applications, noted Brooks.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many custom applications are being deployed on the Salesforce platform, however, as more organizations begin to build and deploy AI agents the need for a set of well-defined best practices for building them will become more apparent, he added.\n\nIn general, DevOps teams should expect to see a wave of AI agent projects being launched. There is no shortage of AI agents being added to commercial applications but in many cases, organizations will opt to also build AI agents that are trained to specifically automate tasks that are unique to their organizations. Some of those AI agents might be deployed on a SaaS application platform, or they might be added to existing custom applications that DevOps teams have built and deployed. The challenge will then become finding a way to orchestrate the integration and management of all these AI agents across an end-to-end business process.\n\nRegardless of approach, the machine learning operations (MLOps) workflows that are generally used to build AI agents will need to become more tightly coupled to the DevOps practices used to deploy the software that AI agents are going to be embedded in. The challenge will be finding a way to meld two distinct cultures that have evolved around data science and application development teams.\n\nLess clear is the degree to which AI might be employed to build AI applications. As AI is increasingly used to write code it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI agents running on DevOps platforms will be used to create AI applications. Copado is already adding generative AI copilots to its platforms to automate the building of test scripts. In time, DevOps teams will have access to any number of AI agents capable of performing a wide range of tasks that previously required a significant amount of manual toil.\n\nIn the meantime, DevOps teams should be preparing now for a new era of software development where applications are built and deployed at rates of speed that not too long ago would have been considered simply unimaginable.",

Millham\u2019s tenure saw the company grow into the massive, \u201cworld-class customer success operation\u201d that it is today. This led current CEO Marc Benioff to declare that Millham had \u201c\u2026shaped the very DNA of Salesforce.\u201d Benioff also noted that his \u201c\u2026impact will be felt for decades to come.\u201d\n\nIn his place, Robin Washington will be stepping in as both chief operating officer and chief financial officer, taking over for Amy Weaver, who announced her own departure back in August. Weaver noted that she would step down once the company had found a replacement, and that appears to be the case now. Combining a role like this could be an issue, but apparently, Washington had previously engaged in such role combinations as both financial and operational leadership at places like PeopleSoft and Hyperion.\n\nAbandon Ship\n\nSalesforce has been losing people left and right, and recently, the pitch only seems to have amplified. Yesterday, reports emerged about large-scale layoffs, with 1,000 roles cut at the company. Reports suggest that the company was increasingly turning to \u201cAI hiring\u201d instead.\n\nOther reports note that the layoffs are impacting divisions, and ranks, all throughout Salesforce. LinkedIn, reports note, is swarming with tales of former Salesforce employees, from marketing to sales and other divisions, with ranks as high as manager and director all telling their stories publicly. With the C-suite getting consolidated, and Salesforce\u2019s rank and file getting winnowed down, it becomes easy to wonder just how Salesforce is actually doing these days.\n\nIs Salesforce a Buy, Sell or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on CRM stock based on 32 Buys, seven Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 15.93% rally in its share price over the past year, the average CRM price target of $396.94 per share implies 19.22% upside potential.\n\nSee more CRM analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

Read our full review of Pipedrive CRM for details on implementation, usability and more.\n\nSalesforce vs. Pipedrive Comparison Salesforce provides an all-purpose CRM for sales, marketing and customer service. Pipedrive\u2019s offering, on the other hand, was built to serve businesses focused on their dedicated sales teams. Here\u2019s an overview of their pricing and essential CRM features. Pricing Salesforce Pricing Salesforce\u2019s Starter Suite is available on a month-to-month basis. All other plans require an annual contract. Note that Salesforce has a vast array of offerings. For simplicity, the pricing below is for the Salesforce Sales Cloud solution. Plan Price Features Starter Suite $25 per user, per month (billed monthly or annually) Account, contact, lead, task and opportunity management\n\nEinstein Activity Capture\n\nLead assignment and routing\n\nCustomizable sales processes, dashboards and reports\n\nProducts and price books\n\nFiles and case management\n\nEmail integration Pro Suite $100 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Starter Suite, plus: 1 sales console app\n\nSales quoting and forecasting\n\nTrack quotes and orders\n\nLightning App Builder\n\nAccess to AppExchange\n\n5 flows per company\n\nAccess to add-on features like Einstein Email Insights and Flow Orchestration Enterprise $165 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Pro Suite, plus: Advanced forecast and pipeline management\n\nOpportunity scoring\n\nEinstein Conversational Insights\n\nSales teams\n\nContracts, orders and quotes\n\nSales territories\n\nDeal insights\n\nApproval processes Unlimited $330 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Enterprise, plus: Sales engagement and conversation intelligence\n\nEinstein Relationship Insights\n\nLead scoring\n\nSales cadences\n\nSales engagement hub\n\nOne developer sandbox and one full sandbox per organization Einstein 1 Sales $500 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Unlimited, plus: Generative AI\n\nUnified data\n\nSales planning, programs and collaboration\n\nKnowledge base\n\nSales Elevate with Slack Salesforce subscription costs rise quickly. However, the more expensive the plans become, the fewer extra features they have over the previous level \u2014 especially between the Unlimited and Einstein 1 Sales tiers. That said, the range of features at every subscription tier should cover most businesses\u2019 needs. Note that enhanced customer support options \u2014 including 24/7 assistance, a dedicated account manager and an expert coach \u2014 add up to 30 percent to your monthly subscription costs. Pipedrive Pricing Plan Price Features Essential $14 per user, per month (billed annually) $24 per user, per month (billed monthly) 3,000 live deals\n\n30 custom fields per company\n\n15 reports per user\n\nCustomizable pipelines\n\nLeads inbox\n\nDeal rotting\n\nData import and export\n\nMerge duplicates\n\nProducts catalog\n\nPeople and organization management\n\nCalendar view and activity management\n\nEmail inbox\n\nSales Assistant\n\nAPI access\n\nWebhooks Advanced $39 per user, per month (billed annually) $49 per user per month (billed monthly) Everything in Essential, plus: 10,000 live deals\n\n100 custom fields per company\n\n30 reports per user\n\nProduct subscriptions and installments\n\nImportant fields\n\nTwo-way email sync\n\nEmail open and click tracking\n\nGroup emailing\n\nAutomations\n\nSmart contact data Professional $49 per user, per month (billed annually) $64 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Advanced, plus: 100,000 live deals\n\n300 custom fields per company\n\n150 reports per user\n\nRequired fields\n\nFormula fields\n\nPipeline-specific fields\n\nDeal card customization\n\nContacts timeline\n\nAutomatic assignment\n\nRevenue forecasting\n\nTeam filters and goals\n\n24/5 live chat support\n\nSmartDocs Power $64 per user, per month (billed annually) $79 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Professional, plus: 200,000 live deals\n\n500 custom fields per company\n\n250 reports per user\n\nUp to 15 teams\n\nFree Projects and SmartDocs with e-signature add-ons\n\nDeveloper Center access Enterprise $99 per user, per month (billed annually) $129 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Power, plus: Unlimited live deals\n\nUnlimited custom fields per company\n\nUnlimited reports per user\n\nUnlimited teams\n\nNondeveloper sandbox account\n\nSecurity rules and alerts Pipedrive is more affordable than Salesforce, and we like how the platform includes valuable features at lower subscription levels. However, beyond the Professional tier, you pay higher fees primarily to increase the number of open deals and custom fields you can access. Note that you\u2019ll incur additional costs for premium apps and features, including: Web Visitors (website visitor tracking tool)\n\nProjects (Kanban-chart-based project management tool)\n\nCampaigns (email marketing campaigns platform)\n\nSmartDocs (document management tool) Best for Pricing Pipedrive Pipedrive stands out in the pricing category due to its competitive, feature-rich plans. Its plans are well-priced \u2014 not just in comparison to Salesforce but also to many other CRM options. Salesforce offers much greater and deeper functionality than Pipedrive, but that's why it's more expensive. Workflows and Automations Salesforce Customizable dashboard layouts: Managers can keep salespeople focused by adding widgets to their dashboards. These tools can show key performance indicators (KPIs) like call time, number of calls and conversion rate. You can highlight your most important metrics by choosing a light or dark theme and picking from a range of preset color palettes. This feature can help draw attention to what really matters.\n\nManagers can keep salespeople focused by adding widgets to their dashboards.

You can highlight your most important metrics by choosing a light or dark theme and picking from a range of preset color palettes. This feature can help draw attention to what really matters. Control over processes: We like how the Flow Builder process allows you to add buttons to screens and forms that require a specific rep or agent action before a deal can move to the next stage. You can check who moved a deal along the funnel for greater transparency.\n\nWe like how the Flow Builder process allows you to add buttons to screens and forms that require a specific rep or agent action before a deal can move to the next stage.

Automated tasks: We were impressed with the easy-to-use interface in Salesforce\u2019s Automation Studio for workflow automations. For example, you can identify and merge duplicate records, apply routing logic so a lead goes to a particular rep, and map out steps in the customer journey automatically. Salesforce makes it easy to build custom workflow automations. Source: Salesforce Pipedrive Out-of-the-box automations: Pipedrive has dozens of customizable and shareable automations. There are four types of prebuilt automations: deal-focused, lead engagement, work optimization and connection to external apps.\n\nPipedrive has dozens of customizable and shareable automations.

It scours the internet for information on companies, decision-makers and then populates the relevant contact record. CPQ: Pipedrive\u2019s marketplace is home to four powerful CPQ plug-ins, which update sales reps\u2019 live quotes based on real-time information like supplier and shipping prices. This saves them from having to gather the details manually. (A similar feature is also offered as a plug-in for Salesforce CRM.) Best for Workflows and Automations Salesforce Salesforce beats Pipedrive here because it offers far greater automation and customization opportunities. However, Pipedrive's workflow automations are particularly well-suited for companies with sales teams. Communications Platform Features Salesforce Connect via email: Send and receive individual emails with Salesforce CRM\u2019s built-in email client and send email blasts via its bulk emailing platform. You can send up to 5,000 bulk emails a day and create professional, responsive emails from a range of customizable templates.\n\nSend and receive individual emails with Salesforce CRM\u2019s built-in email client and send email blasts via its bulk emailing platform. You can send up to 5,000 bulk emails a day and create professional, responsive emails from a range of customizable templates. Connect on social media: Salesforce discontinued its proprietary Social Studio in 2024. It now directs users to third-party integrations like Hootsuite, Sprout Social and Khoros to engage audiences on social media. Although they may cost extra, these integrations allow you to manage, plan and create social media posts, as well as engage in private app messaging. You can also monitor which posts get the best client engagement on these partner apps.\n\nSalesforce discontinued its proprietary Social Studio in 2024.

Connect on multiple channels: We like how all email and social media interactions are added to the system\u2019s client histories \u2014 whether you\u2019re having a conversation with the customer or they\u2019re responding to an ad campaign. This includes interactions on WhatsApp, SMS and MMS, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, the telephone, and more. Pipedrive Email connectivity: Pipedrive\u2019s email client and marketing suite are easy to use and intuitive.

Phone connectivity: Pipedrive has an excellent selection of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) plug-ins. This feature allows you to make and receive calls from the Pipedrive dashboard. Auto-dialer integrations like Ring.io are also available if you want to run an outbound telemarketing campaign through the CRM.\n\nPipedrive has an excellent selection of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) plug-ins.

The automated email campaigns in Pipedrive are a great way to nurture Best Communications Platform Features Salesforce Salesforce and Pipedrive both excel in one-to-one communication and marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Both rely heavily on third-party integrations, which work very well but may add to your monthly costs. However, Salesforce wins here primarily because of its impressive 5,000-email-per-day allowance. FYI Did you know Don't underestimate the potential of winning customers over the phone . According to \u200b\u200b Cognism's 2024 State of Cold Calling Report , prospects answer the phone on the first attempt 75 percent of the time. Reporting and Analytics Salesforce Track results accurately: We were impressed by how Salesforce CRM tracks, analyzes, and reports on the customer journey and marketing campaign outcomes. If you sell online, you\u2019ll find the revenue and purchase funnel reports particularly useful.\n\nWe were impressed by how Salesforce CRM tracks, analyzes, and reports on the customer journey and marketing campaign outcomes.

Another app, LASER Credit Access, even adds business credit scores to your records. Salesforce CRM supports dynamic report creation. Source: Salesforce Pipedrive Customizable dashboards: Each dashboard can hold up to 25 reports, which you can resize, rearrange and filter by time or user.

Live rep and deal monitoring: See in real time the deals your sales reps are working on. Such info includes their current status and past leads, won and lost. You can also see how long it takes a salesperson to move deals through the stages of your sales process. Best for Reporting and Analytics Salesforce Pipedrive excels in sales forecasting and rep analysis; it outperforms Salesforce in these areas without requiring any extra plug-ins. However, Salesforce ultimately takes this round because of the depth and breadth of the reporting and analytics tools it offers for both sales and marketing. AI Enhancements Salesforce Sales teams: Salesforce\u2019s AI tool, Einstein AI, helps sales agents get better results. We particularly like the Einstein Next Best Action feature. It can, among other things, advise reps on live opportunities to upsell and cross-sell during a call or email conversation.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s AI tool, Einstein AI, helps sales agents get better results.

The platform can help salespeople create excellent product presentations. It can also free up customer service teams with website chatbots, enhance performance with workflow suggestions and more. Pipedrive Sales teams: Using real-time performance metrics, Pipedrive\u2019s AI-powered Sales Assistant suggests ways managers can improve team and sales rep outcomes. We liked the Kara AI app integration ($30 per month).

This functionality is backed up by tools like lead prioritization and automated email suggestions. AI assistance improves sales task automation in Pipedrive. Source: Pipedrive Best AI Enhancements Salesforce Salesforce's AI integration is much deeper and more developed than Pipedrive's. So, it's the winner in this category. We believe Einstein Next Best Action and Einstein Discovery are potential game-changers for businesses. Tip Bottom line AI can boost successful lead conversions significantly while also improving agent productivity.

Washington will join Salesforce in March, replacing finance chief Amy Weaver and operating chief Brian Millham, who will retire in May.\n\nIn August, Salesforce said Weaver would step down once the company had named a successor.

In 2019, she retired from Gilead and became a director at Alphabet. Washington will remain on Salesforce's board, and Arnold Donald, the former Carnival CEO who has been on Salesforce's board since 2023, will become lead independent director, according to a statement.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised Washington's abilities in a post on social media site X.\n\n\"A visionary leader, former CFO of Gilead & Hyperion, and longtime Salesforce board member, Robin's expertise will guide us into the Agentforce era,\" Benioff wrote. Salesforce has been busy promoting Agentforce add-on software that can automate sales and customer service processes inside of companies.\n\nEarlier in her career, Washington ran finance at enterprise software provider Hyperion and was a vice president at software seller PeopleSoft. She has also been an auditor at Deloitte. Hyperion and PeopleSoft were both acquired by Oracle, where Benioff worked before he co-founded Salesforce in 1999.\n\nMillham took a job as president of commercial sales at Salesforce months after the company's establishment. He was promoted to president and operating chief in August 2022. In early 2023, when co-CEO Bret Taylor left in 2023, Millham took on some of Taylor's responsibilities.\n\nWATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: Don't think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI stocks sending shockwaves on Wall Street following DeepSeek scare.\n\nThe pace of artificial intelligence development and deployment is \u201cpretty terrifying\u201d. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed by Steven Adler, a former safety researcher at OpenAI. The remarks come amid growing concerns that robust AI systems capable of evading human control could come into being with catastrophic consequences.\n\nAmid the safety concerns raised, tech giants and emerging startups are not showing signs of slowing down on AI spending. They are allocating billions of dollars on capital expenditures to accelerate the development of powerful AI systems. Bloomberg expects capital expenditures in the development of various AI solutions to exceed $200 billion in 2025, representing a $90 billion increase from last year.\n\nHigher capital expenditure should result in new innovations resulting in the widespread use of AI in many industries. Similarly, AI is predicted to transform various sectors, including healthcare, retail, finance, and the automotive industry.\n\nNevertheless, billionaire investor Steve Cohen believes AI\u2019s transformational shift could take decades to realize. \u201cThis is a 10- to 20-year theme. It\u2019s going to affect everybody in how they conduct their lives, how they do their business,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the first, second inning of something that\u2019s going to be transformational for the economy and the world. \u2026 It is such a dramatic, important shift that to ignore it, I think it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe CEO and chairman of hedge fund Point72 maintains that there may be ups and downs in the AI boom and that the volatility surrounding investments related to AI may worsen due to a lack of reliable information. However, the increasing need for cutting-edge AI technologies like deep learning and robotics may present difficulties for hardware parts like AI chips. That\u2019s because the high processing demands of AI algorithms and machine learning models are beyond the capabilities of conventional CPUs and GPUs. Top tech firms must increase their expenditures and production to overcome these obstacles.\n\nBecause AI applications like generative AI and large language models require massive data processing, energy efficiency is another issue. Potential remedies include quantum computing and high bandwidth memory, but each has drawbacks. Amid the ever-growing energy needs needed to power AI models and infrastructure, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has urged President Donald Trump to take the threat of tariffs off the table definitively. According to Freeland, the US needs Canadian energy to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence. Freeland insists the US should thank Canada for being \u201ca great partner\u201d that can provide the much-needed power to dominate the AI space.",

Or just bots in formal wear?\n\n\u201cThey are not going to have to be an expert in an LLM, they are not going to have to understand all of these deep capabilities that you would need to know to be a computer scientist,\u201d he said.

Displaced workers will be able to apply for other jobs internally, the person added.\n\nA representative of San Francisco-based Salesforce declined to comment. It couldn\u2019t be determined which divisions the reductions were focused in. Salesforce had nearly 73,000 workers as of January 2024, when that fiscal year ended.\n\nTechnology companies have grown more accustomed to regular job reductions after a massive wave of layoffs at the start of 2023. So far this year, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all moved to trim their corporate workforces.\n\nShares jumped 1.6% Tuesday morning in New York. The cuts speak \u201cto the company\u2019s focus on driving productivity and should help offset some of the incremental sales hiring that the company has already outlined,\u201d wrote Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nSalesforce, the leading maker of customer management software, has embarked on a hiring spree for salespeople focused on the company\u2019s new AI agent products. But it\u2019s also been keeping a closer eye on maintaining profit margins after pressure from activist investors in 2023.\n\nFor more: Salesforce Expects Thousands of Agentforce Deals This Quarter\n\n\u201cJust because we have a hit new product doesn\u2019t mean that we ignore the commitments we\u2019ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said when asked about the company\u2019s profit-focus during an event hosted by Barclays Plc in December. \u201cWe\u2019re looking across the entire company to say, \u2018Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we\u2019re doing to go invest in scale going forward?\u201d\n\nSalesforce is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings around the end of February.\n\n(Updates with share movement and analyst commentary in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "content": "Customer relationship management software maker Salesforce (CRM) is cutting 1,000 roles and focusing on hiring more sales personnel to accelerate its AI (artificial intelligence) ambitions. The news was first reported by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. CRM stock reacted positively to the news, rising 1.6% in extended trading yesterday.\n\nCRM Focuses on AI Ambitions\n\nSalesforce is shifting gears toward the success of its AI ambitions, particularly of its generative AI agent, Agentforce. In December, CEO Marc Benioff mentioned that the company had closed more than 1,000 deals for Agentforce, which creates virtual AI agents to run routine tasks such as answering customer queries and evaluating sales opportunities.\n\nSalesforce is making these job cuts as it begins its new Fiscal year. Last year too, CRM cut some 1,000 roles in two rounds of layoffs. The affected employees are not getting fired, meaning they will be able to shift to other jobs internally. There is no information about the exact roles and divisions that will be impacted in this round.\n\nWhile Salesforce is determined to scale its AI business, it plans to do so by keeping its margins and expenses in check. The company underwent severe pressure from activist investors in 2023 and is abiding by its pledge to maintain profitability and share price appreciation. A lot of American big tech companies have already announced layoffs this year, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META).\n\nInsights from TipRanks\u2019 Bulls Say, Bears Say Tool\n\nSalesforce is expected to report its Q4 FY25 results at the end of February. Ahead of the results, analysts have differing opinions on the stock.\n\nAccording to TipRanks\u2019 Bulls Say, Bears Say tool, bulls are encouraged by CRM\u2019s leading market position, supported by a 22.1% share globally, the release of Agentforce, and its subscription model that ensures recurring revenues.\n\nOn the other hand, bears are concerned about the highly competitive market, global macroeconomic headwinds that impact customer\u2019s CRM spend, and slowing revenue growth.\n\nIs CRM a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nDespite the success of the Agentforce product, analysts remain divided on Salesforce stock\u2019s trajectory due to the reasons discussed above. On TipRanks, CRM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sell ratings. Also, the average Salesforce price target of $396.94 implies 17% upside potential from current levels. In the past year, Salesforce stock has gained 18.4%.\n\nSee more CRM analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article? Write to editor@tipranks.com",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "The fact that multiple Salesforce, Inc. ( ) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Salesforce\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$7.3m worth of shares, at about US$275 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$342, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 0.1% of Marc Benioff's stake.\n\nOver the last year we saw more insider selling of Salesforce shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free\n\nSalesforce Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Salesforce. In total, insiders dumped US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Salesforce insiders own about US$8.3b worth of shares (which is 2.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Salesforce Insiders?\n\nInsiders haven't bought Salesforce stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that Salesforce is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Salesforce. Every company has risks, and we've spotted you should know about.\n\nBut note: Salesforce may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

            "content": "The rise of big data has made data analytics a critical tool for businesses seeking a competitive edge. Companies specializing in data analytics solutions help businesses process massive amounts of information to make smarter, data-driven decisions.\n\nAs industries from finance to healthcare increasingly rely on analytics, stocks in this sector are witnessing strong demand and growth potential. Therefore, you might consider buying data analytics stocks Salesforce, Inc. (CRM), Accenture plc (ACN), and Teradata Corporation (TDC).\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are some of the biggest drivers of the data analytics industry. These technologies allow businesses to automate insights, predict trends, and optimize operations with minimal human intervention. As per PwC\u2019s Pulse survey, 73% of executives mentioned using GenAI to make changes in their respective company\u2019s business models.\n\nIn 2025, industries such as retail, healthcare, and financial services will rely heavily on analytics for customer insights, fraud detection, and operational efficiency. According to Statista, the global public cloud market is projected to reach $1.81 trillion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 18.5%. Meanwhile, the global IT Services market is poised to grow from $1.51 trillion this year to $1.88 trillion by 2029 at a CAGR of 5.6%.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at the fundamentals of the above-mentioned stocks in detail.\n\nSalesforce, Inc.

            "content": "India stands at a defining moment, where AI-driven innovation, digital infrastructure, and a future-ready workforce will determine its global leadership in the digital economy. The Union Budget 2025 is more than a fiscal plan \u2014 it is a bold blueprint for a stronger Digital India, prioritising technology-led development, AI-driven modernisation, and inclusive economic growth.\n\nAs someone who has witnessed India\u2019s financial and technological evolution, I see this Budget as a pivotal inflection point in our journey towards a Viksit Bharat \u2014 one that is built on innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity.\n\nThe government\u2019s commitment to advancing AI and deep-tech through initiatives like the DeepTech Fund of Funds and 10,000 fellowships for technological research in IITs and the IISc reflects a vision for India to lead in automation and emerging technologies. The focus on Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in Tier-2 cities will further unlock AI-powered digital services, fostering regional innovation and new employment opportunities at scale.\n\nSkilling remains the linchpin of this transformation. With one of the world\u2019s largest talent pools, India has a unique opportunity to drive the AI revolution, but achieving this requires rapid upskilling, industry collaboration, and democratised learning. The government\u2019s investment in 50,000 Atal Tinkering Labs, a \u20b9500-crore Centre of Excellence for AI in Education, and five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling aligns seamlessly with our mission at Salesforce. At Salesforce, through Trailhead and our Salesforce-AICTE Virtual Internship Programme, we are equipping thousands of learners with AI, Cloud, and automation skills to thrive in tomorrow\u2019s workforce.\n\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises, or MSMEs, are not just the backbone of India\u2019s economy \u2014 they are the engine of innovation, employment, and economic resilience. By revising investment and turnover thresholds and enhancing credit availability, the government is ensuring that MSMEs can scale competitively on a global stage while fostering a culture of innovation.\n\nTrue digital transformation is built on diversity and inclusion. The government\u2019s \u20b92-crore term loan scheme for first-time women entrepreneurs, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes demonstrates a strong commitment to fostering inclusive economic opportunities. Technology has long been a great equaliser, opening doors for women in leadership, entrepreneurship, and STEM. For India to lead in the digital era, innovation must be inclusive, empowering all to thrive in the AI-driven economy.\n\nFinally, India\u2019s sustainability ambitions take centre stage with initiatives like the National Manufacturing Mission, investments in clean tech, and AI-enabled energy efficiency solutions. Furthermore, as announced, the Nuclear Energy Mission aims to develop 100 GW of nuclear power by 2047, marking a significant step in India\u2019s clean energy transition. This initiative strengthens energy security and sustainability while supporting the growing demand for high-performance, AI-driven data centres. With nuclear power offering a reliable, high-output solution, it will be a key enabler of India\u2019s digital expansion and innovation-driven economy.\n\nIndia\u2019s journey toward Viksit Bharat is driven by technology, digital infrastructure, and workforce skilling. The Union Budget 2025 accelerates economic growth while empowering businesses and individuals to lead the nation\u2019s digital transformation. The Budget\u2019s focus on AI-driven modernisation, digital skilling, and start-up growth aligns with this vision.\n\nArundhati Bhattacharya is Chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses along with insights on The Fed Chair & Lower AI Costs.\n\nIn his appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired before the day of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate environment, Jim Cramer shared how Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would have to fine-tune his remarks in line with President Trump\u2019s sentiments about interest rates. The President made hard-hitting statements earlier this year when he stated that he would demand central banks worldwide reduce interest rates as oil prices were dropping.\n\nSharing his thoughts on the Fed chair, Cramer stated \u201cYeah, I think that, uh, Jerome Powell knows how to punt better than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen. I mean, he\u2019s, I just think he\u2019s just not going to take the bait. I think he\u2019s going to say listen we gotta see what happens.\u201d Cramer stated that Powell would keep his options open because of the dynamic nature of today\u2019s markets. After all, it was only last week that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock was the most valuable company in the world. And now, it\u2019s in third place.\n\nCramer outlined that \u201cI think people are [inaudible] to recognize, that it\u2019s not like we know everything. Things are so fluid.\u201d He also linked the fluidity with investors\u2019 urge to invest with President Trump\u2019s every statement. \u201cThat first it\u2019s the Iron Dome mention, I just talked about [the company that makes missiles for the Iron Dome], well [it] has this terrific drone killer system, which they\u2019ve shot down a huge number of these.\u201d Cramer added that while the President might want the \u201cdrone killer\u201d as well, it doesn\u2019t mean that the statement would mean to buy stock. He added \u201cA lot of off-the-cuff comments, and you can\u2019t react to all of them. So I think that Jay Powell would be best to say you know what, we have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve announced its latest interest rate decision today. As expected, the central bank kept rates unchanged, but the uncertainty in its statement meant that the flagship S&P index bled 0.8% while the broader NASDAQ index lost 1.1%. Investors were particularly spooked by the fact that the Fed\u2019s latest comments didn\u2019t include the usual inflation \u201chas made progress\u201d statement that had previously reassured them that progress on the inflationary front was occurring and could lead to future rate cuts. In other words, the door is now open for the central bank to raise rates further this year if need be, despite an adamant President who believes otherwise.",

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

            "content": "Many Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nSalesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$7.3m worth of shares, at about US$275 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$342. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 0.1% of Marc Benioff's holding.\n\nOver the last year we saw more insider selling of Salesforce shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\nNYSE:CRM Insider Trading Volume February 1st 2025\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\n\nInsiders At Salesforce Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Salesforce. In total, insiders sold US$1.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Salesforce\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Salesforce insiders own about US$8.3b worth of shares (which is 2.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",

The Union Budget 2025 is more than a fiscal plan\u2014it is a bold blueprint for a stronger Digital India, prioritizing technology-led development, AI-driven modernization, and inclusive economic growth.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nPivoting AI and Deeptech\n\nThe government\u2019s commitment to advancing AI and deep-tech through initiatives like the DeepTech Fund of Funds and 10,000 fellowships for technological research in IITs and IISc reflects a vision for India to lead in automation and emerging technologies. The focus on Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in Tier-2 cities will further unlock AI-powered digital services, fostering regional innovation and new employment opportunities at scale.\n\nEmphasis on Skilling\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSkilling remains the linchpin of this transformation. With one of the world\u2019s largest talent pools, India has a unique opportunity to drive the AI revolution, but achieving this requires rapid upskilling, industry collaboration, and democratized learning. The government\u2019s investment in 50,000 Atal Tinkering Labs, a \u20b9500 crore Centre of Excellence for AI in Education, and five National Centres of Excellence for Skilling aligns seamlessly with our mission at Salesforce. At Salesforce, through Trailhead and our Salesforce-AICTE Virtual Internship Program, we are equipping thousands of learners with AI, cloud, and automation skills to thrive in tomorrow\u2019s workforce.\n\nMSMEs are not just the backbone of India\u2019s economy\u2014they are the engine of innovation, employment, and economic resilience. By revising investment and turnover thresholds and enhancing credit availability, the government is ensuring that MSMEs can scale competitively on a global stage while fostering a culture of innovation.\n\nTrue digital transformation is built on diversity and inclusion. The Government\u2019s \u20b92 crore term loan scheme for first-time women entrepreneurs, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes demonstrates a strong commitment to fostering inclusive economic opportunities. Technology has long been a great equalizer, opening doors for women in leadership, entrepreneurship, and STEM. For India to lead in the digital era, innovation must be inclusive, empowering all to thrive in the AI-driven economy.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nRoad to Sustainability\n\nFinally, India\u2019s sustainability ambitions take center stage with initiatives like the National Manufacturing Mission, investments in clean tech, and AI-enabled energy efficiency solutions. Furthermore, as announced, the Nuclear Energy Mission aims to develop 100 GW of nuclear power by 2047, marking a significant step in India\u2019s clean energy transition. This initiative strengthens energy security and sustainability while supporting the growing demand for high-performance, AI-driven data centers. With nuclear power offering a reliable, high-output solution, it will be a key enabler of India\u2019s digital expansion and innovation-driven economy.\n\nIndia\u2019s journey toward Viksit Bharat is driven by technology, digital infrastructure, and workforce skilling. The Union Budget 2025 accelerates economic growth while empowering businesses and individuals to lead the nation\u2019s digital transformation. The budget\u2019s focus on AI-driven modernization, digital skilling, and startup growth aligns with this vision.",

What AI Was Meant to Be\u201d campaign, Salesforce is returning to Super Bowl 59 with a 30-second ad, again starring Matthew McConaughey.\n\nThe cloud software company will also air a second spot during the game as part of its broader campaign, though it wouldn\u2019t share specifics\n\nIn one of the ads, \u201cDining Al Fiasco,\u201d which is currently airing and has been live on YouTube for the last three weeks, McConaughey finds himself in a lighthearted dining disaster\u2014caught in pouring rain with a meal he didn\u2019t want\u2014all because the booking app he used lacked Agentforce, Salesforce\u2019s AI agent. The technology promises to handle everything from making reservations to negotiating business deals autonomously.\n\nThe Super Bowl spot builds on Salesforce\u2019s \u201cAsk More of AI\u201d campaign, launched last year, which aimed to bridge the AI trust gap for businesses. With Agentforce, the company is shifting the conversation toward what AI agents can actively do for customers.\n\nBrands are treading lightly when it comes to AI during the Big Game. Last year saw waves of backlash over AI-generated ads and frustration with companies like Google and Apple over hard-selling the tech. But in Salesforce\u2019s Super Bowl spot, the company is taking a slightly different approach, leaning on celebrity star power to make AI feel more approachable.\n\nBy 2030, AI is expected to add trillions to the global economy, according to Salesforce, reinforcing the idea that AI is no longer futuristic\u2014it\u2019s already reshaping industries.\n\nBeyond the Super Bowl, the Agentforce campaign is running across live TV, streaming, online video, print, and social channels, along with out-of-home ads in New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nSalesforce is reportedly paying McConaughey over $10 million annually to be its creative adviser and TV pitchman.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nTechnological innovations in steam power, electricity and microprocessors drove the first industrial revolution. Fast forward, artificial intelligence is the catalyst driving the fourth industrial revolution. That\u2019s because the technology is reshaping industries at a breakneck speed. From revolutionizing the healthcare sector to addressing cybersecurity challenges to reshaping the auto industry, technology is reshaping the way of life in ways not seen before.\n\nAccording to Markets and Markets, the global AI market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 35.7% to $1.3 trillion by 2030. Significant advancements in computational power and data availability are the factors expected to accelerate the growth. Similarly, revolutionary technology is giving rise to unique investment opportunities as companies compete against time to develop game-changing innovations and enhance productivity.\n\nThe $500 billion Stargate project is one such investment that sums up the enormous sums of money that companies are willing to spend to gain an edge on AI. While most of the investments are going to data centers and other infrastructures, companies are also inking deals and partnerships to secure reliable energy to power AI models and infrastructure.\n\nThe companies that provide the metaphorical picks and shovels of artificial intelligence, the manufacturers of semiconductors, servers, networking gear, and power generators\u2014have seen a sharp increase in stock prices as a result of the spending frenzy.\n\nThe tremendous opportunity up for grabs is evident due to the blockbuster gains in the equity markets over the past two years. Major US indices are trading near all-time highs. While deep pullbacks have come into play in recent months, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities remains bullish about the AI-driven rally.\n\nIves dismissed the recent tech stock sell-off caused by DeepSeek as a \u201ctech AI head fake\u201d and believes that investors have a \u201cgolden buying opportunity\u201d with it. Ives claims that the fear surrounding the low-cost, high-performance model of the Chinese AI company is exaggerated and won\u2019t affect the AI revolution\u2019s long-term course.\n\n\u201cThis DeepSeek tech-driven sell-off will be historically noteworthy in market history,\u201d Ives wrote, emphasizing that it does not reflect a genuine threat to AI spending trends. \u201cWe expect more innovation in AI and LLM model costs to come down\u2026 that is ultimately a great thing for computing power, use cases, and where the tech world is going in this 4th Industrial Revolution.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has already reiterated that DeepSeek is a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the U.S. tech industry, insisting the sector should be laser-focused on computing if the US is to maintain its edge on the technology.\n\nIn an attempt to keep American businesses from lagging behind their Chinese counterparts, Wall Street thinks DeepSeek\u2019s success will encourage the US government to increase its investment in AI.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, DeepSeek\u2019s achievement is likely to pressure the U.S. into increased support for domestic AI development, most likely leading to increased federal investment in AI research and infrastructure,\u201d wrote Mills of Raymond James. The firm added that it could envision the U.S. passing an AI version of the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a software application company that provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology that connects customers with businesses. It is one of the company\u2019s well-positioned to capture the growing demand for AI software as a leader in CRM with over 150,000 customers. While the company was under pressure on January 27th, owing to the DeepSeek triggered sell-off, it has bounced back due to the tremendous opportunities presented by AI agents.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has made it simple for businesses to set up basic agents to automate a variety of tasks. London\u2019s Heathrow Airport has used its AI agents to coordinate functions like gate changes and the operation of passenger navigation software. Additionally, thanks to Salesforce\u2019s AI agents, 83% of customer inquiries can now be successfully answered without the assistance of a human customer support representative. Due to TD Cowen\u2019s belief in the company\u2019s potential, shares of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) were upgraded from a \u201cHold\u201d rating to a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on January 20th.\n\nOverall CRM ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping up Wall Street. While we acknowledge the growth potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

            "content": "Many major companies are requiring employees to return to the office full or part-time.\n\nBusiness Insider compiled a running list of the companies calling employees back.\n\nThe list includes companies like JPMorgan, Starbucks, and Amazon.\n\nThe start of 2025 could herald a new return-to-office push.\n\nCorporate giants like Amazon and AT&T announced at the end of 2024 that they would bring their employees back into the office five days a week this year. Sweetgreen, too, said in December that it's upping support staff's in-person requirement for 2025.\n\nOther major employers, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have also abandoned the hybrid attendance policy they adopted during the pandemic and instead implemented full return-to-office mandates.\n\nSeveral executives and leaders have said they believe productivity increases when workers are in the office together, while others hope to increase in-person collaboration. Even some CEOs who previously praised the flexibility of remote work have backpedaled, telling workers to comply with RTO mandates. Some are tracking attendance and firing employees who don't comply.\n\nHere's a list, in alphabetical order, of major companies requiring employees to return to offices. Business Insider will update this list regularly.\n\nAmazon\n\nCEO Andy Jassy wrote in a September 16 memo that Amazon would end remote work starting in 2025.\n\n\"We've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID,\" Jassy said. \"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant.\"\n\nThe CEO cited easier employee collaboration and connection and said in-person work would strengthen the company's culture. This echoes his February 2023 memo, which mandated employees spend at least three days a week in the office.\n\nNot everyone agrees. Some Amazon employees took to an internal Slack channel to criticize the new RTO policy, BI's Ashley Stewart first reported, with one staffer writing that it was \"significantly more strict and out of its mind\" than pre-COVID operations.\n\n\"This is not 'going back' to how it was before,\" they wrote. \"It's just going backwards.\"\n\nThe critical reaction is reminiscent of employees' response to 2023's surprise return-to-office rule. Thousands of Amazon workers joined a Slack channel to share their thoughts, with some even organizing to file a petition against the change.\n\nIn December, BI reported that Amazon is delaying full RTO for some employees over office-capacity issues.\n\nApple\n\nIn August 2022, Apple's senior leaders told workers they had to return to the office at least three days a week after previously requiring two days a week. CEO Tim Cook said the decision was meant to restore \"in-person collaboration.\" Some employees fought back and issued a petition shortly after the announcement, arguing that staffers can do \"exceptional work\" from home.\n\nDespite the pushback, Apple's hybrid work program launched the following month and is still in place.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T confirmed to BI that it's requiring all office employees to work on-site five days a week starting in January.\n\nThe change follows about a year of AT&T accommodating a hybrid schedule in its widely publicized office push.\n\n\"The majority of our employees and leaders never stopped working on location for the full work week \u2014 including during the pandemic,\" a spokesperson for the telecom giant told BI.\n\nAT&T told BI it's updating its facilities amid the policy change.\n\n\"As we continue to evolve our model, we are enhancing our facilities and workspaces, adapting our benefits programs, and incorporating best practices to ensure our employees are best equipped to serve our customers,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nBlackRock\n\nIn 2023, BlackRock mandated employees return to the office four days a week. The investment firm, which is headquartered in New York City, intended to bring employees into its then newly leased office space \u2014 which spans 1 million square feet across 15 floors, according to Hudson Yards.\n\nIn a May 2023 memo sent by the company's COO, Rob Goldstein, and the head of human resources, Caroline Heller, the execs wrote: \"Career development happens in teaching moments between team members, and it is accelerated during market-moving moments, when we step up and get into the mix. All of this requires us to be together in the office.\"\n\nAdditionally, the memo notified staffers that the firm would give them the opportunity to work remotely for two weeks during a relevant time period in their country, to offer \"seasonal flexibility.\"\n\nChipotle\n\nThe fast-food chain announced in June 2023 that corporate workers should work in the office four days a week, Bloomberg reported. Chipotle had previously required workers to show up three days a week, according to the report.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup asked its 600 US workers, who were previously eligible to work remotely, to return to the office full-time, Bloomberg reported. In a memo released by the investment firm in May, the majority of staff are reportedly still able to work a hybrid schedule, with up to two days a week outside the office.\n\nHSBC and Barclays followed suit, mandating workers to come into the office five days a week, according to the report.\n\nVaccinated Citigroup employees across the US were asked to return to the office for at least two days a week in March 2022, an internal memo obtained by Reuters said.\n\nDell\n\nDell told its sales staff to return to the office five days a week starting on September 30. Previously, the company let US employees pick between working remotely or following a hybrid schedule with about three days a week in the office.\n\nSeptember's sales-team mandate came with just a few days' notice, Business Insider reported, sending employees with kids into a hurry to find childcare.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Dell called its global workforce back to the office full time via an email, which BI exclusively obtained. In the email, CEO Michael Dell said that remote work would come to an end in just over a month.\n\n\"Starting March 3, all hybrid and remote team members who live near a Dell office will work in the office five days a week,\" Dell wrote. Employees who live further from an office would be allowed to keep working remotely, according to the email.\n\nDisney\n\nIn a January 2023 memo obtained by Business Insider, CEO Bob Iger told workers that starting that March, any Disney staff member working \"in a hybrid fashion\" would need to return to Disney's offices four days a week.\n\nIn response, over 2,300 employees signed a petition asking Iger to reconsider the mandate.\n\n\"This policy will slow, or even reverse, our post-COVID recovery and growth by creating critical resource shortages and causing irreplaceable institutional knowledge loss,\" signees wrote, according to The Washington Post.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nIn March 2022, CEO David Solomon told Fortune that the company was asking employees to return to the office five days a week. Seven months later, he told CNBC that about 65% of staffers were working in the office.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHowever, some staff have failed to follow the policy a year into its implementation, causing senior managers to become frustrated and Goldman Sachs to further crack down on employees to return to the office full-time, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGoogle\n\nIn March 2022, Google employees in the San Francisco Bay Area and \"several other US locations\" were told to return to the office for at least three days a week starting the following month.\n\nThe next year, however, the company tightened RTO expectations, telling staff in an email viewed by BI that office attendance would factor into their performance reviews.\n\nFiona Cicconi, Google's chief people officer, wrote in the memo that requests to work remotely full time will now be considered \"by exception only.\"\n\nSome employees expressed feeling \"frustrated\" with the new policy. One staffer previously told BI, \"We don't like being micromanaged like school kids.\"\n\nIBM\n\nAt the start of 2024, IBM told managers to either come into offices or leave the company.\n\nIBM asked all US managers to report to an office or client location at least three days a week, according to a memo viewed by Bloomberg.\n\nA source told the outlet that staff would have to live within 50 miles of an IBM office or client location. The memo said employees had until August to complete their relocation arrangements, and those who were unable to comply with the new policy must \"separate from IBM.\"\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna previously told the news outlet that employees' careers could suffer if they work from home. He said that although he wasn't forcing his own staffers back to the office, he thought remote workers may struggle to get promotions.\n\nJPMorgan\n\nJPMorgan Chase was a first mover in the full return to office push.\n\nThe bank began requiring managing directors to work in person five days a week in April 2023 \u2014 and, at the time, reminded all other employees to come in at least three days a week.\n\nNow, the company plans to double down. Bloomberg reported in January 2025 that JPMorgan may soon require all of its workers to return to the office five days a week and eliminate the option of remote work entirely.\n\nCEO Jamie Dimon has long been vocal about the importance of onsite work in the face of pushback from employees.\n\n\"I completely understand why someone doesn't want to commute an hour and a half every day, totally got it,\" he told The Economist in July 2023. \"Doesn't mean they have to have a job here either.\"\n\nThe company has also been collecting data on staff activity, including tracking attendance.\n\nKFC\n\nKFC is moving its headquarters out of Kentucky. Its parent company, Yum Brands, announced in a press release on Tuesday that it would establish two new brand headquarters in the US \u2014 one in Irvine, California, and another in Plano, Texas.\n\nAs part of the move, the company is recalling about 90 remote US employees to the office, and said that they'd be placed at the \"campus where their work happens.\"\n\nThe company said the relocation of its remote employees will take place over the next 18 months, adding that the motive behind the changes is to \"foster greater collaboration among brands and employees.\"\n\nMeta\n\nMeta updated its remote work policies in September 2023, requiring employees to head into the office three days a week.\n\nIt had also stopped offering remote work in new job listings. People familiar with the company previously told BI that hiring managers could no longer post new jobs that list the work location as \"remote\" or outside an existing office.\n\nIn June 2023, the company doubled down on its RTO efforts, telling workers that their attendance would be tracked daily and that failure to comply could lead to termination.\n\nHowever, some employees returning to the office said they were met with a lack of space and privacy, with one worker calling the mandate \"a mess.\"\n\nRedfin\n\nIn April 2023, real estate company Redfin announced an updated return-to-office policy via a memo from CEO Glenn Kelman.\n\nThe memo noted that starting July 2023, Redfin would require \"headquarters employees\" who live within 20 miles of the company's Seattle, San Francisco, and Frisco offices to work from the office for a full day on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\n\nThe company said those who live beyond the 20-mile radius were required to visit the office in person once a quarter for a day or more of meetings.\n\nTo hold employees accountable, the memo included a \"no-exceptions\" section, reading that \"to determine your distance from an office, we'll use Google Maps, with the distance from your home address measured in miles driven over roads by car.\"\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce told employees in an internal memo seen by The San Francisco Standard in July that, as of October 1, the majority of workers had to be in an office four to five days a week.\n\nAccording to the memo, the new policy is mandated for select staff in sales, workplace services, data center engineering, and on-site support technicians.\n\nEarly in 2023, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff revised the company's annual strategic plan, including return-to-office mandates, according to a draft shared in an internal Slack message viewed by BI.\n\nThe updated draft return-to-office policy required nonremote employees to work three days a week in the office and employees in \"non-remote\" and \"customer-facing\" roles to work four days a week. Engineers must work from the office 10 days per quarter, down from 20 in the initial draft, which was updated based on employee feedback.\n\nSnap\n\nSnap implemented a new mandate in September 2023, requiring employees to work in an office at least four days a week. The change represented a shift from the company's former \"remote first\" policy, which allowed employees to work from home or elsewhere.\n\nEmployees previously told BI that some managers told them the company can track workers' WiFi connections to see who is complying.\n\nStarbucks\n\nIn a January 2023 memo to corporate staffers, then-CEO Howard Schultz said employees within commuting distance would be required to return to the office at least three days a week.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSchultz said some staff had failed to \"meet their minimum promise of one day a week\" and also said that Starbucks baristas didn't have the \"privilege\" of working from home. The executive had previously said he \"pleaded\" with workers to come back to the office.\n\nStarbucks employees responded by signing an open letter protesting the company's return-to-office mandate.\n\nIn September 2024, former Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol took over as CEO of the coffee chain.\n\nIn October, the company threatened to fire staff if they did not comply with the RTO policy, Bloomberg first reported, citing an internal memo.\n\nBeginning in January, the company plans to initiate a \"standardized process\" to hold workers accountable to the hybrid schedule at the team level, where consequences will cover \"up to, and including, separation,\" according to the email obtained by Bloomberg.\n\nEmployees, however, may request exemptions due to physical or mental medical reasons.\n\nSweetgreen\n\nSalad chain Sweetgreen is shifting to a four-day workweek from January 2.\n\nThe mandate will apply to its few hundred support staff who do not work at the chain's restaurants, Bloomberg reported on December 18.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Sweetgreen's cofounder and chief executive Jonathan Neman said that the company will move to a \"hard four\" days in the office policy, a shift from its current \"more flexible\" three to four-day policy.\n\nHe said the decision was in the works earlier in the year then solidified after Amazon put out its own five-day workweek RTO announcement in September.\n\n\"That was the big turning point where everyone's like: 'Oh, they're doing it, now we can do it,'\" Neman said to Bloomberg.\n\nRepresentatives of Sweetgreen did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside regular business hours.\n\nTesla\n\nIn June 2022, Tesla employees were notified of a mandatory return-to-office policy.\n\nThe email from Elon Musk told employees \"If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned,\" and said that everyone at Tesla must work from the office at least 40 hours a week.\n\nMusk, who has called remote work \"morally wrong,\" nodded to his frequent presence at Tesla factories as the reason for the business' success. \"If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt,\" he wrote.\n\nTikTok\n\nTwo employees told BI that TikTok plans to require its US e-commerce employees to return to the office for eight hours a day, five days a week.\n\nIt's also asking its e-commerce organization, which runs TikTok Shop , to be at work between 4 and 7 p.m. PT, according to the employees.\n\nAn internal message was sent out to employees across the US, but the wording appeared to be referring to workers in its Seattle office.\n\nThe ByteDance-owned company is based in China, and US employees have previously said they've been required to attend late meetings due to the time difference.\n\nToyota\n\nToyota told North American employees in January that they would be required to work in the office from Monday through Thursday beginning in September 2025.\n\nToyota employs more than 64,000 people in North America across 14 factories, as well as in design, engineering, and corporate offices.\n\nUbisoft\n\nIn September, Ubisoft, the France-based maker of the popular \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Far Cry\" video game series, ordered its staff worldwide to return to the office three days a week.\n\nFrench workers at the video game maker went on strike on October 15 over the RTO mandate.\n\nUber\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told employees that beginning in April 2022, Uber staffers in 35 of the company's locations were required to return to the office at least half the time. He added that on other days, staffers were allowed to work remotely and that some could be entirely remote if they got clearance from their managers.\n\nKhosrowshahi said in 2024 that remote work took away some of Uber's \"most frequent customers,\" adding that \"there is an audience who kind of stopped using us as frequently as they used to.\"\n\nWalmart\n\nAlong with slashing hundreds of jobs, Walmart also asked previously remote employees in the US to move to offices in May 2024.\n\nStaffers located in smaller offices in Dallas, Atlanta, and Toronto were being directed to the company's central hubs, including its headquarters in Arkansas or New Jersey, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe retail giant would still permit hybrid schedules as long as workers come in-person most of the time, according to the outlet.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nWilliam Lewis, CEO and publisher of The Washington Post, told staffers in early November that they would be required to return to the office five days a week, according to a memo obtained by BI.\n\n\"I want that great office energy for us every day,\" Lewis wrote, referring to the energy in the office during election week. \"I am reliably informed that is how it used to be here before Covid, and it's important we get this back.\"\n\nAll employees were expected to return to the office by June 2, 2025, while managers were expected to return by February 3, 2025.\n\nAfter starting remote work in 2020, the Post previously required employees to return to the office three days a week in early 2022.\n\nThe announcement at the Post came shortly after Amazon's return-to-office mandate. The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and executive chairman.\n\nX\n\nAfter buying X, formerly Twitter, in 2022, Musk told employees that not showing up to an office when they're able to was the same as a resignation.\n\nMusk also told staffers in an email that remote work was no longer allowed and that employees were expected to be in the office for at least 40 hours a week unless given explicit approval to work elsewhere.\n\nIn 2023, the National Labor Relations Board filed a formal complaint saying that X had illegally fired an employee who complained about Musk's RTO policy.\n\nThe complaint said that Yao Yue, a principal software engineer, criticized the mandate, tweeting, \"don't resign, let him fire you.\" She also posted, \"don't be fired. Seriously\" in a company Slack channel.\n\nYue was then fired five days later and told it was due to violating an unspecified company policy.\n\nZoom\n\nZoom, the darling of remote work, said in 2022 that less than 2% of staffers work in person full time. However, in 2023, the video-calling company asked employees to return to the office.\n\nWorkers living within 50 miles of one of its offices were mandated to work there at least two days a week.\n\n\"We believe that a structured hybrid approach \u2014 meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams \u2014 is most effective for Zoom,\" a spokesperson previously said in a statement. \"As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers.\"",

            "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 10 Stocks & Says He\u2019s In Waiting For AI GPU Spending Clarity. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on whether the low AI development costs demonstrated by China\u2019s DeepSeek AI models would upend investor expectations of AI spending. Ever since the AI wave kicked off in November 2022, businesses have committed and spent hundreds of billions of dollars to procure AI GPUs and develop data centers to host them. The high spending requirements also led President Trump to announce a massive $500 billion Stargate project earlier this month.\n\nHowever, data center stocks crashed on Monday and wiped out a trillion dollars of value as investors worried whether low AI development costs would mean that this spending would not materialize. Cramer is divided about the overall sentiment when it comes to AI spending after the DeepSeek selloff.\n\nHe commented that the lower costs are \u201cthe theme of the moment because some people saw it coming.\u201d Cramer added \u201cand yet they still ordered. That would be the Zuckerberg case, maybe the Musk piece.\u201d On the other hand, he outlined that others \u201cjust say oh my, what am I in, I\u2019m gonna go buy a double short NVIDIA.\u201d Finally, the CNBC host also shared a third category of people \u201cwho think that it\u2019s [Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock] a hand cream.\u201d\n\nWhile investors fretted about lower AI costs translating into weaker demand for items such as GPUs, another narrative questioned whether lower costs meant that AI development would open up to more firms and entities than the higher costs had previously permitted. Cramer admitted that this was possible, but added that it also meant that perhaps \u201cthe monopoly rent that people feel that\u201d the premier GPU company \u201cwas charging is gone.\u201d He added that he was in wait-and-watch mode when it came to AI spending.\n\nCramer noted several events that could signal to him that perhaps the narrative shift surrounding AI spending was permanent. One of his tests \u201ctest would be, uh, is, Three Mile Island not going to be reopened? That would be one I need to hear.\u201d The second driver that might convince the CNBC TV show host of a paradigm shift for AI spending would be reports of \u201cany [GPU] order pullback. And I have not heard that yet.\u201d Cramer added \u201cBut that\u2019s not, necessarily, what people are going to announce, \u2018listen, I\u2019ve decided. . . If this thing only needs one-tenth of the power, one-tenth of the compute, well I\u2019m going to cut my orders by nine-tenths.\u2019 I\u2019ve not heard that yet, but this thing is. . . a steamroll.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 29th and mentioned in his Morning Take from his Investing Club morning meeting.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an enterprise software firm that caters to businesses\u2019 customer relation management needs. The firm\u2019s narrative in today\u2019s AI era is driven primarily through its Agentforce AI products. Agentforce uses AI to provide users with 24/7 support, and it has allowed Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s shares to gain a respectable 33% over the past six months. Cramer\u2019s recent comments for the firm have surrounded its CEO Marc Benioff and his opinions about the partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft. This time around, he remarked on the fluidity and the rapidly changing AI environment:\n\n\u201cThe fluidity of a situation. Last night I had Marc Benioff, talking about the split up with, David we\u2019re talking about a split with OpenAI . . .last night.\u201d \u201c[On Altman and Nadella together] Benioff\u2019s was slagging that. And saying the combination and saying that it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nOverall CRM ranks 6th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(You can watch my full interview with Benioff here.)\n\n\u201cWe are in an opportunity for all of our customers to connect with their customers in this incredible new way that we call agentics or agents. But we\u2019re witnessing something I think, that we\u2019ve only seen in the movies, and we\u2019re bringing this into our businesses to create better businesses that are going to operate at much lower costs and that are going to be creating much better customer relationships. And all of our KPIs for our businesses are going to be better, and this is what technology is all about. And yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\n\nWhile that excitement is certainly centered on helping customers do things they could never do before and helping them create bold new futures, Benioff also described how he and Salesforce are experiencing the AI Revolution first-hand, which he said has provided a series of high-impact lessons. And one of those lessons, he said, is that while Salesforce\u2019s software-engineering in 2025 will be more ambitious and wide-ranging then ever before, the company will not be adding more developers \u2014 instead, Salesforce will meet that new challenge with what Benioff calls digital labor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just about to go into a whole new area and the way to think about this is in terms of the many TAMs [Total Addressable Markets] that we have,\u201d Benioff said, noting that the company has 75,000 employees and will do about $38 billion in the fiscal year that ends Jan. 31 (tomorrow).\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s all built on multiple billion-dollar TAMs for products that we have like Slack or Sales or Service or Marketing or Commerce or analytics. And if you add that all up, it\u2019s in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the total addressable market,\u201d Benioff said.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nDigital Labor: A \u2018Multi-Trillion-Dollar TAM\u2019\n\n\u201cBut when we think about the new world that we\u2019re all going into together, which is the world of digital labor, well, that\u2019s a multi-trillion-dollar TAM. It\u2019s the idea that we\u2019re going to provide not only the ability for our customers to manage their data, which has been our primary focus for the last 25 years, but now we\u2019re creating digital workers, digital labor, the idea that we can offer them the ability to do new things with their business,\u201d he said.\n\nIn our conversation, Benioff described how Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce now operates the company\u2019s support business at help.salesforce.com and has dramatically shifted what happens with the 36,000 calls that the company\u2019s 9,000 support people receive every week:\n\nFROM: 26,000 handled by AI agents, with 10,000 getting bounced to humans;\n\nTO: 31,000 handled by AI agents, with only 5,000 getting bounced to humans.\n\nAs a consequence, Benioff said, Salesforce is planning to \u201crebalance\u201d its support workforce by shifting about 2,000 of those 9,000 support professionals to other positions. At the same time, the rise of digital labor is affecting the company\u2019s development operations as well, which could serve as a model for customers to evaluate and perhaps emulate.\n\nIn our conversation, I said that I suspect that not too many executives have experience with planning for and operating in trillion-dollar TAMs.\n\n\u201cRight? Well, I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Benioff replied with a smile.\n\n\u201cI have no experience in that area myself, but we\u2019re all going to have a lot of experience in that area soon so we\u2019ll need to drag each other kicking and screaming into that because we\u2019re all going to go into this new area together. I\u2019m in it now with my company, and we\u2019ll deliver sales agents and marketing agents and HR agents for ourselves, our own company, and by doing that we\u2019ll motivate our customers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already sold this technology to thousands of customers, and we\u2019ve seen now robust deployments of these agents,\u201d Benioff said, \u201conly went into production the fourth week of October 2024.\u201d\n\nNot Hiring Developers in 2025\n\nPart of the wrenching mindset-adjustment to which Benioff referred involves how AI and agents are overhauling our perspectives on what\u2019s required to develop software.\n\n\u201cIt may not be the right thing to learn how to code anymore,\u201d Benioff said, \u201cbecause at Salesforce we\u2019re not going to hire any more engineers this year. \u201cOur head of engineering came in and said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve doubled our engineering staff in the last five years since the pandemic, and it\u2019s amazing, with tens of thousands of engineers. But let\u2019s look at that: Now we\u2019re like, whoa, we got 30% more productivity this year by itself!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo how do we deploy that capability \u2014 how can we make that happen?\u201d Benioff said. \u201cWe need to look at questions like these:\n\n\u201cWhere are the jobs today?\n\n\u201cWhere are things going?\n\n\u201cHow do these things make us better?\n\n\u201cWhere is our company going to get stronger?\n\n\u201cWhere are the jobs going to be?\u201d\n\nNot Buying the Microsoft Approach\n\nBenioff went on to share several other intriguing perspectives about the coming year \u2014 the vital significance of data, how AI can \u201cmake humans more human,\u201d and the unfolding interplay between apps and agents, which has sparked a lot of confusion among customers because the leading apps vendors \u2014 Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Workday, and Microsoft \u2014 have adopted differing strategies about the ways in which apps and agents will or will not work with each other. I urge you to check out the full video interview for Benioff\u2019s perspectives on that.\n\nAnd in particular, I think you\u2019ll enjoy Benioff\u2019s perspectives on the different approach around agents that Salesforce is taking versus what Microsoft is doing. I urge you to watch it so you can see and hear it directly from Benioff, but here\u2019s a quick sample:\n\nI think that you\u2019re still going to have databases and app servers and applications and workflow, and that that AI is going to require all of that, and you can see that in how the AI is delivered today. And today, Salesforce is delivering the highest-quality enterprise AI on the planet. We\u2019re happy to do benchmarks against anybody to prove that, and I think that our model and our technology and our capability will prove out, especially over the next 12 months where you just said what I believe is true, that we\u2019ll have thousands and thousands of companies who will be deploying, I think, up to a billion agents. And we will be the absolute leader in agentic technology for the enterprise.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nIn the agentic world, Benioff said, it will be the customers that \u201care closest to their data that are going to do the best. And the 230 petabytes of data that we manage for our customers is directly accessible to us, and we\u2019re going to deliver capabilities to our customers that they\u2019ve never seen before. And they\u2019re going to be thrilled out of their minds.\u201d\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis\n\n.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other top trending AI stocks on latest news.\n\nThe bloodbath that triggered one of the biggest routs in US stock markets appears to be under control. Even as people across China hail the success of their homegrown tech startup DeepSeek, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear there is room for everyone in the artificial intelligence race. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed across the board as it becomes clear markets might have overreacted on reports China is at the forefront of developing AI models at the lowest costs possible.\n\nA day after US stocks came under pressure amid the DeepSeek revelations, developers at leading US AI firms have already started praising DeepSeek AI models, touting them as Sputnik models. Some AI experts praised DeepSeek\u2019s robust team and state-of-the-art research, but they were unconcerned by the development as concerns about competition rippled through the U.S. stock market.\n\n\u201cThe dust is now settling after Monday\u2019s long overdue AI reckoning, and while we still believe in the AI-driven productivity story, investing in this sector going forward may not be as easy as it was over the past two years,\u201d said Emily Bowersock Hill at Bowersock Capital Partners. \u201cWe expect investors to be more discerning and selective when it comes to AI investing.\u201d\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that R1, one of DeepSeek\u2019s models, \u201cis an impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price.\u201d Nvidia also echoed the sentiments, stating DeepSeek\u2019s achievement proved the need for more of its chips.\n\nAccording to US President Donald Trump, the release of DeepSeek\u2019s AI models should be a wake-up call on the need to be laser-focused on competing to win. The sentiments come from the Hype around the new AI models triggering over $1 trillion in US and European tech stocks.\n\nThe sentiments come at the backdrop of reports that AI presents a $15 trillion opportunity over the next few years, given the transformation it is poised to bring in various sectors. Therefore, there is room for every company to leverage technology to strengthen its competitive edge.\n\nBarclays has already reiterated that companies offering advanced AI services are well poised to benefit from the availability of cost-effective AI models. In contrast, companies working on expensive hardware needed to enable and power AI should remain under scrutiny if DeepSeek\u2019s revelations that it\u2019s possible to develop AI models using common or cheap chips are anything to go by.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. The company\u2019s service includes sales to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities, and gain insights through analytics and artificial intelligence. It is one of the stocks edging higher even as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek continues to rattle the markets with groundbreaking revelations.\n\nOn January 27th, analysts at Barclays reiterated that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the few companies offering AI services such as AI copilots and agents well poised to benefit even as DeepSeek kicks off debate for more cost-efficient and accessible AI models. The stock rallying by more than 4% underscores investors\u2019 confidence in the company\u2019s AI offering as investors react to the introduction of cheaper AI models. Salesforce\u2019s ability to adapt and offer valuable AI services seems to be a key factor in its resilience in the market.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of top trending AI stocks on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Benioff talks to Bob Evans about Salesforce\u2019s excitement for 2025 and beyond as well as the transformative role that agents will play in enhancing customer relationships and business operations.\n\nHighlights\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Excitement for 2025 and the Role of Agents (01:04)\n\nBenioff shares his enthusiasm for the current technological moment. He explains that agents will help businesses operate at lower costs and improve key performance indicators (KPIs). Agents are being rapidly adopted, with Salesforce deploying its agent platform at scale and significantly reducing the workload on human support agents. \u201cWe are in an opportunity, I think, for all of our customers, to connect with their customers in this incredible new way that we call agentics or agents . . . we\u2019re witnessing something I think, that we\u2019ve only seen in the movies.\u201d\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Market Position and Digital Labor (02:35)\n\nSalesforce is the second largest software company in the world, with a $38 billion market cap and $12.9 billion in cash flow. \u201cI think we\u2019re one of the first enterprise software companies to deliver an agentic platform at scale with the level of performance and capability that everybody wants.\u201d Its platform, Customer 360, integrates various products, creating a comprehensive solution. It\u2019s well-positioned to address the issue of digital labor, which has the potential to transform businesses. Benioff says there\u2019s a multi-trillion-dollar total addressable market (TAM) for digital labor.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\nThe Importance of Data and AI in Salesforce\u2019s Strategy (10:30)\n\nBenioff outlines three core initiatives at Salesforce over the past 24 months: integrating acquired apps into the core platform, developing a high-performing data cloud, and enhancing the agentic layer. He discusses the importance of a unified data model and the integration of the data cloud with Salesforce\u2019s apps. AI and machine learning have made many advancements in recent years and while AI is not yet perfect, it has significantly improved over the past decade.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Core Values and Commitment to Partnership (15:29)\n\nSalesforce\u2019s core values \u2014 trust, customer success, innovation, equality, and sustainability \u2014 have remained unchanged for 25 years. As Salesforce moves into new technological frontiers, including AI, Benioff stresses the importance of transparency, communication, and collaboration. \u201cWe are moving into a new world together, and we\u2019re going to be better together.\u201d He reaffirms Salesforce\u2019s dedication to working closely with customers and welcomes them into the future of innovation and technology.\n\nThe Role of Agents in Enhancing Human Potential (17:11)\n\nBenioff discusses the potential of agents to enhance human capabilities, citing examples from Disney and Gucci where AI has improved employee performance and customer satisfaction. \u201cWe also saw that in Gucci, for one of the call centers where we deployed this technology, revenue [rose] 35% because the agents were just making those employees just better.\u201d He touches upon the need for rebalancing roles within the company as AI takes over certain tasks, ensuring that employees are continuously skill-building and evolving.\n\nThe Future of Agents and Applications (20:50)\n\nHe addresses the misconception that traditional databases and applications will be entirely replaced by voice-driven AI interfaces, like those depicted in the movie Her. He explains that AI models are not data storage systems but intelligence engines that augment and extend existing capabilities. While AI is evolving rapidly, Benioff says that current enterprise systems still rely on databases, applications, and workflows. He clarifies that AI will complement these systems rather than replace them entirely.\n\nAsk Cloud Wars AI Agent about this analysis",

How do you set a culture that sees AI as an opportunity for growth and capability, rather than just a tool for cutting costs?\n\n02:30 \u2014 Benioff mentions that there will be some rebalancing. He talked about how Salesforce now has thousands of paying customers for Agentforce, and he said many were able to deploy and get those agents fully up and running within just two months since its release.

He argued that the companies closest to the data will be the biggest winners. And he promised that with what Salesforce has in store, \u201cOur customers will be thrilled out of their minds.\u201c\n\n04:20 \u2014 Not so long ago, technology sometimes drove customers out of their minds.

            "content": "Retailers, particularly post-COVID, are operating in a world where the lines between physical and digital commerce have permanently blurred. Consumers no longer see channels; they see convenience.\n\nThis evolution of the retail customer experience was the dominant theme at NRF 2025, where Salesforce unveiled a point-of-sale (POS) operating system built on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to complement the status quo \u2014 we\u2019re here to replace it,\u201d Nitin Mangtani, SVP and GM, retail, Salesforce, told PYMNTS Karen Webster. \u201cRetailers need technology that doesn\u2019t just power transactions but transforms the entire shopping experience from discovery to checkout. That\u2019s what this GenAI-powered POS is built to do.\u201d\n\nBusinesses, Mangtani explained, must respect today\u2019s fluid consumer journeys, which intertwine physical and digital touchpoints. For instance, a consumer might discover a product through a TikTok video, purchase it online, and exchange it in-store.\n\n\u201cUnified commerce is not just a buzzword. It\u2019s table stakes. The consumer journey today is so intertwined that attributing success to one channel is nearly impossible,\u201d he added, stressing the importance of GenAI powered and cloud-based POS systems to help with online and offline shopping.\n\nStill, for retailers, the challenge lies not only in adopting today\u2019s cutting-edge technologies, like GenAI, but also in integrating them in ways that respect and enhance the customer journey.\n\nUnified Commerce Backed by GenAI\n\nIf unified commerce is the backbone of modern retail, GenAI is its future. Salesforce\u2019s own recent announcements at NRF \u2014 including Agentforce for Retail and Retail Cloud with Modern POS \u2014 underscore the company\u2019s commitment to leveraging AI to reimagine the shopping experience.\n\nGenAI offers a unique advantage in this unified commerce narrative. Salesforce\u2019s new POS system doesn\u2019t just handle transactions \u2014 it acts as a fully integrated, intelligent agent capable of personalizing every touchpoint. Whether it\u2019s recommending products, processing returns, or adjusting orders in real time, this system is designed to remove friction at every stage of the customer journey.\n\n\u201cImagine asking your agent for a jacket, and it provides six options that match your tastes. You can refine your request further, like specifying leather jackets, and it will adjust instantly,\u201d explained Mangtani of the Agentforce solution.\n\nThe second area of focus for Agentforce is post-purchase interactions, such as tracking orders, correcting shipping details, or switching delivery methods. These interactions are powered by robust data systems, ensuring accuracy.\n\n\u201cIn enterprise, a \u2018maybe\u2019 answer doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mangtani emphasized.\n\nBeyond these capabilities, Salesforce\u2019s vision includes enabling businesses to build AI agents with minimal technical overhead. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to write hundreds of thousands of lines of code to deploy these agents,\u201d Mangtani explained. This low barrier to entry is critical, especially when time-to-market is a decisive factor.\n\nAccording to Mangtani, \u201cConsumers have shifted dramatically to agent-driven interactions. For many, including myself, the primary interface is no longer search; it\u2019s an agent. GenAI represents a superset of all previous technologies \u2014 it\u2019s the future, and we\u2019ve built a platform that aligns with that vision.\u201d\n\nRethinking Store Experience\n\nFor decades, the physical store experience has remained largely static, with checkout being the final, often cumbersome step. Mangtani sees this as an opportunity for disruption. \u201cWhy should checkout be a 20-minute ordeal?\u201d he asked, highlighting the frustration consumers feel after deciding to make a purchase.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Apple, where associates can complete transactions anywhere in the store, Mangtani emphasized the importance of mobility in POS solutions.\n\n\u201cPOS is no longer a cash-and-carry device,\u201d he stressed.\n\nInstead, it has evolved into a tool for delivering a unified customer experience, bridging online and in-store interactions. The shift toward smaller, brand-owned stores further amplifies the need for flexible POS systems that integrate digital catalogs.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t have the product in stock, showing it on an iPad and completing the transaction ensures you don\u2019t lose the sale,\u201d he added.\n\nDespite the allure of cutting-edge technologies, retailers remain focused on ROI. Mangtani observed that modern CIOs are savvy, fiscally disciplined, and ROI-driven. This mindset has fostered a healthier ecosystem, where investments in technology are made strategically.\n\nRead more: Salesforce to Launch AI Agents and Cloud-Based POS for Retailers\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s Saks Fifth Avenue or other customers, we\u2019re seeing real ROI in terms of reduced wait times, better customer service, and higher sales conversion rates,\u201d Mangtani said of retailers that have embraced AI-powered unified commerce solutions.\n\n\u201cDuring peak shopping seasons, service often deteriorates due to insufficient staffing,\u201d he added. \u201cWith AI, you can triage service calls, reduce wait times, and improve the overall customer experience.\u201d\n\nDespite the crowded nature of the POS market, Salesforce\u2019s approach feels less like a competitive entry and more like the introduction of an entirely new category. With a broad definition of retail that includes everything from luxury fashion to home furnishings, the company is betting big on a market that\u2019s seen little innovation in decades.\n\n\u201cThink about payments 12 years ago,\u201d Mangtani said. \u201cNobody thought there was room for new players, but Stripe and Adyen proved otherwise. The POS market is the same \u2014 it\u2019s ripe for disruption.\u201d",

            "content": "San Francisco, California-based Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) provides customer relationship management software that enables businesses to access, manage, and share sales information. Valued at a market cap of $332.2 billion, it helps firms streamline customer interactions, develop custom workflows, and provide tailored experiences using advanced analytics, AI, and integration tools. The leading agentic AI company is expected to announce its fiscal Q4 2025 on Wednesday, Feb. 26.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect CRM to report a profit of $1.95 per share, up 9.6% from $1.78 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company has consistently surpassed Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports. In the most recent quarter, CRM beat the consensus EPS estimate by a 4.5% margin.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect CRM to report EPS of $7.48, up 23.4% from $6.06 in fiscal 2024.\n\nCRM stock has outperformed the S&P 500\u2019s ($SPX) 22.9% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 24% during the period. In addition, the stock has outpaced the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 12.8% rise over the same time frame.\n\nCRM\u2019s outperformance stems from its strong SaaS-based subscription model, which ensures steady revenue, and its acquisitions like Slack, Tableau, and MuleSoft, which expand its offerings and create cross-selling opportunities. Its AI-driven innovations, such as Agentforce and Retail Cloud with Modern POS, enhance customer base and employee engagement, while partnerships with NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) further elevate its technological capabilities, driving advanced insights and increased productivity.\n\nMoreover, shares of CRM climbed nearly 11% following its Q3 earnings release on Dec. 3 as the company reported better-than-expected revenue of $9.4 billion. Strong growth in key segments, including Sales Cloud and Service contributed to the revenue beat, despite a slight EPS miss at $2.41. The company also slightly raised its full-year fiscal 2025 revenue guidance to $37.8 billion - $38 billion, further fueling investor optimism.\n\nAnalysts\u2019 consensus opinion on CRM stock is bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall. Out of 45 analysts covering the stock, 33 advise a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating, three suggest a \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d seven give a \u201cHold,\u201d and two recommend a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201d As of writing, CRM is trading below the average analyst price target of $397.81.\n\nMore news from Barchart\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer with insights on the DeepSeek AI sell-off.\n\nOn the day that Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI GPU stock bled 17% in the wake of investors panicking about Chinese AI startup DeepSeek\u2019s low development costs for AI, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the topic. Cramer has been one of the biggest fans of the GPU company, and right off the bat, he started out by sharing that the key thing to consider now is whether the GPU orders for the firm will materialize.\n\nHe also commented on \u2018traveler stocks\u2019 or those that have benefited from the broad AI sentiment. Cramer shared \u201cWhat I find most interesting is that, the fellow travelers to these are the nuclear stocks that have been up a lot. . . .Are the memes. Are the crypto.\u201d He commented that the fact that these stocks were all simultaneously losing value was not great for the market. According to Cramer, \u201cSo looks [like] they are all you know one stock and that is not good. That\u2019s not good because that says you have hype and froth in here that has to come out no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his experience using DeepSeek\u2019s R-1 model. In his previous remarks, Cramer revealed that he was a fan of ChatGPT and had used OpenAI\u2019s product to research stocks ahead of his appearances on CNBC. However, he wasn\u2019t impressed by R-1. Cramer outlined that he \u201ctried to do a couple of, I tried to get it to give me Netflix\u2019s performance from 2010. And it says I can\u2019t do that. Well I mean, honestly? I can do that.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of R-1 that left him unimpressed was censorship. \u201cThis is a Chinese product,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo when I put into my very helpful DeepSeek, what famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of a tank? And it initially says, the famous picture you are referring to, Tank Man, unknown rebel, June 5, 1989,\u201d he added. While this is all good, soon after the initial response, R-1 \u201ctakes that back and says sorry, can\u2019t help you with that. And then secondarily it says sorry that\u2019s beyond my current scope,\u201d according to him.\n\nWhen co-host Carl Quintanilla asked him whether it was worth buying any of the AI stocks, Cramer was rather direct. He shared \u201cI don\u2019t have the knowledge to be able to make that decision. It\u2019s better to own that.\u201d Cramer also noted that before Monday\u2019s appearance, there was a debate about whether \u201ccan we just make a determination, or is the determination that we don\u2019t want to let anybody down so we can\u2019t make that?\u201d Given the absolute bloodbath in the premarket that day, he felt \u201clike, whatever you do, maybe twisted between now and the opening.\u201d As a result, Cramer shared \u201cBut sometimes you have to admit, like if you were at the hedge fund you\u2019d just say, you know I\u2019m not sure what to do, it\u2019s not a cop-out. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d",

While the tech titan ended last year on a weaker note, selling off in the final few weeks of December, the start of this year has been kinder to Salesforce bulls.\n\nSalesforce Today CRM Salesforce $279.76 +8.02 (+2.95%) 52-Week Range $212.00 \u25bc $369.00 Dividend Yield 0.57% P/E Ratio 46.01 Price Target $365.62 Add to Watchlist\n\nThe past two weeks alone have seen the stock gain 10%. In early trading on Tuesday, the stock was logging even further gains and coming within just a few dollars of December's high.\n\nGet Salesforce alerts: Sign Up\n\nThe San Francisco-headquartered company has a $300 billion market cap and is a leader in customer relationship management (CRM). Its products help businesses manage customer data, sales pipelines, and marketing automation, making it an almost must-have tool for many companies across industries. Looking ahead into 2025, there are plenty of reasons for investors to be excited, especially around the prospect of the stock getting back to fresh all-time highs in the coming weeks. Let's jump in.\n\nSalesforce Sets a Strong Foundation Heading Into 2025\n\nSalesforce's fundamental performance over the past couple of quarters has been mixed, but there's plenty to like. The company smashed revenue expectations with its latest earnings report, delivering a record-high print, though a miss on EPS spooked some investors. Despite this, management's bullish outlook and guidance for 2025 should not be ignored.\n\nThe December report suggested there's a strong foundation in place, with Salesforce navigating market headwinds while continuing to scale its operations. This optimism sets the tone for the year ahead, particularly as investors eye Salesforce's next earnings report in early March. Another record revenue print\u2014this time ideally paired with beats on both top and bottom-line expectations\u2014should support the stock as it rallies back towards highs.\n\nAnalysts Point to Salesforce\u2019s Bright Future\n\nOne of the main reasons we're so excited about Salesforce shares is the analysts' coverage of the stock. In a note to clients last week, the team over at TD Cowen upgraded CRM shares from a Hold rating to a Buy while increasing their price target from $380 to $400. From where the stock closed on Monday, that's pointing to a targeted upside of some 15%, well into fresh all-time high territory.\n\nThis bullish stance is echoed by Piper Sandler and Needham & Company, both of which reiterated their Buy ratings earlier this month. Piper Sandler set a price target of $405, while Needham is targeting $400, underscoring the broad confidence in Salesforce's ability to deliver strong returns. Much of this optimism stems from Salesforce's dominant market position and its AI-powered tool, Agentforce, which analysts believe could drive significant revenue growth by early 2026.\n\nBearish Views Remain in the Minority Among Analysts\n\nIt has to be noted, though, that while there's a lot to like about Salesforce, there are some reasons to be cautious. Not all analysts are on board with the bullish narrative. Earlier this month, Guggenheim downgraded the stock to a Sell rating, while Macquarie assigned a Neutral rating in December.\n\nThese more cautious stances are primarily tied to concerns around Salesforce's ability to consistently beat analyst expectations. After missing on EPS last quarter, they're likely waiting to see if the company can reestablish its track record of strong beats. Still, it's worth pointing out that these bearish takes are in the minority, standing out against the backdrop of overwhelmingly positive sentiment from Wall Street.\n\nSalesforce: A Stock to Watch Closely in the Year Ahead\n\nOverall, heading into the rest of the quarter, there's much to like about Salesforce. This is supported by the technical setup, with the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently at a nicely bullish 63. This suggests there's a ton of bullish momentum with plenty of room to run before the stock enters overbought territory.\n\nFor those of us happy to lean into the analysts' bullish outlook, this has all the makings of a fantastic entry opportunity. The broader macro environment, strong recent performance, and supportive technicals all point to Salesforce being a stock that's worth watching closely in 2025.\n\nBefore you consider Salesforce, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Salesforce wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Salesforce currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here",

            "content": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been hitting the headlines over the past few months because of his sentiments toward Microsoft's AI efforts. As you may already know, the AI bubble is the new craze in the tech industry that every major tech corporation is racing to adopt and integrate across its services. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has been the talk of the town after unveiling its V3-powered AI model, R1, which, according to benchmarks, surpassed OpenAI o1's reasoning capabilities across math, science, and coding at a fraction of the development cost for proprietary models.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Communication Officer Frank X. Shaw recently addressed Benioff's myriad of comments aimed at Microsoft's AI and Copilot efforts on LinkedIn.\n\nLately, Marc Benioff has had quite a bit to say about Copilot and Microsoft\u2019s AI strategy, which I recently provided comment for (in the FT: \"Marc has no idea what he's talking about.\" In fact, I\u2019m sure if anyone cared to plot a chart of our Copilot and agent news with Benioff\u2019s posts on X, you\u2019d find a relationship. As a communicator, I got curious. What\u2019s behind this borderline obsession with Copilot? Well, it turns out there\u2019s an answer in a playbook he published many years ago: \u201cposition yourself either as the leader, or against the leader in the industry\u201d\u2026 and other sage advice in the excerpt below. Hint: it's all about marketing, less about truth or substance. It can be, as Marc notes, great marketing in the short term to highlight competitors. Of course, the challenge is that long term success requires actual competition. We're still waiting. And to my friends in the media...how does it feel to be used for marketing? If you need a quote....you know where to find me. \ud83e\udd23 Microsoft CCO, Frank X. Shaw\n\nLast year, Benioff bashed Microsoft's AI efforts, indicating the Redmond giant had done \"a tremendous disservice\" to the industry while referring to Copilot. According to the Salesforce CEO:\n\n\"When you look at how Copilot has been sold to our customers, it's disappointing. It doesn't work. It spews data all over our floors, it doesn't deliver value. I haven't found a customer who has transformational work with Copilot. Copilot is just the new Microsoft Clippy.\"\n\nShaw's LinkedIn post also features an attachment, which he refers to as Benioff's playbook from many years ago. The executive indicated that Salesforce's CEO had borrowed a page from his book to compete with rivals in the AI space. \"Position yourself either as the leader, or against the leader in the industry,\" a quote Shaw lifted from Benioff's playbook. According to Microsoft's CCO, Benioff's comments about Microsoft's AI efforts are \"all about marketing, less about truth or substance.\"\n\nMarc Benioff \u2014 The Salesforce \"marketing guru\"\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images | Bloomberg)\n\nAs Benioff notes in rule #23 of his playbook under the tagline \"Reporters Are Writers, Tell Them a Story\":\n\n\"Although the battle between salesforce.com and Siebel wasn't driven by a personal feud, the press didn't see it that way, and reporters loved building drama around this story. That makes sense. After all, reporters like to tell a story with a protagonist and a villain.\"\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

He's previously been spotted tooting his company's own trumpet, indicating Salesforce is probably the largest AI enterprise supplier in the world, with the capability of doing \"a couple of trillion AI transactions per week.\"\n\nBenioff was quick to indicate that Microsoft was in panic mode after it announced its plan to add support for creating autonomous agents to Copilot Studio, further indicating that Copilot is a flop because Microsoft lacks the data to create real corporate intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft CCO Frank Shaw isn't the first executive at the company to call out Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff over his comments on the tech giant's AI efforts. Earlier this month, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft CVP of Business & Industry, shared impressive stats indicating over \"100,000 organizations\" had used Copilot Studio to create AI agents by October 2024, potentially rebutting Benioff's comments.",

            "content": "After tech investors licked their wounds yesterday on the launch of the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot DeepSeek, today they saw an opportunity from the upheaval.\n\nSoftware stocks broadly rallied as the stock market bet that costs to run AI infrastructure could come down and efficiencies could improve, benefiting the software companies that rely on that infrastructure and are launching their own AI platforms and looking to leverage the power of agentic AI.\n\nThat makes sense, as the AI infrastructure is being built to ultimately run software applications. Among the winners today were MongoDB (MDB 0.15%), Salesforce (CRM 2.82%), and GitLab (GTLB 4.20%). As of 11 a.m. ET, the stocks were up 8%, 5.4%, and 10.3%, respectively, on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks are soaring\n\nAll three stocks have staked their future on AI in different ways.\n\nMongoDB is a provider of NoSQL database software, and AI has huge potential applications in the database sector. MongoDB has launched an AI Applications Program (MAAP), and is working with companies like Meta Platforms.\n\nIt also said that using AI tools along with professional services can reduce the cost of migrating legacy applications onto MongoDB by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, management also told investors that AI wouldn't be a meaningful tailwind for fiscal 2025, which ends this month, though it sees it as a valuable opportunity and a question of when, not if. The technology behind DeepSeek could help accelerate AI demand for companies like MongoDB by making it more efficient and accelerating its deployment.\n\nSalesforce is already pushing hard into AI with Agentforce, its agentic AI tool that it launched in September. Agentforce hasn't made a notable impact on Salesforce's business yet, though it's still very early, and the company has not yet reported fourth-quarter results.\n\nHowever, Salesforce is the kind of company that looks well positioned to capture demand for AI software, as it's well entrenched as the leader in customer relationship management (CRM), with more than 150,000 customers, including Fortune 500 companies and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nLike MongoDB, Salesforce helps organizations manage data, in this case related to sales and customer service, as well as AI tools that make that easier and cheaper for customers.\n\nFinally, GitLab is a specialist in cloud-based DevSecOps, or helping developers and organizations securely manage their IT infrastructure and deploy new applications and programs. It automates DevSecOps, and its software replaces a number of point solutions that businesses had traditionally used to meet those needs.\n\nAI can play a role in GitLab in a number of ways. It launched GitLab Duo, a suite of AI features that assist developers, while they work in GitLab, and DeepSeek could also drive increased interest in building on platforms like GitLab, making it cheaper to build AI features into programs. That could attract more interest in using GitLab as it increases its potential utility.\n\nWhat's next for the software sector?\n\nInvestors have jumped to a number of conclusions over the last two trading sessions in response to DeepSeek, but at this point, a lot is still unclear about how AI might change.\n\nIn a geopolitical environment where TikTok has essentially been banned because of a national security risk, it's hard to imagine a Chinese AI chatbot not facing a similar restriction. Still, the technology is out there, which means American companies are likely to copy it or improve upon it. Already, Meta is reportedly working on a war room to reverse-engineer DeepSeek's technology so it can beat it and capture the related cost savings.\n\nTechnology costs tend to go down over time, even when there isn't a major leap like DeepSeek, so software companies like these three should benefit from falling AI costs and improved efficiencies over time, no matter what happens with DeepSeek.\n\nTaking the long view, MongoDB, Salesforce, and GitLab are all industry leaders and should benefit from AI over the long run. That's one reason to be bullish on these stocks as the AI future continues to unfold.",

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 1.4% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nThe optimism surrounding the stock can be attributable to the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Salesforce is benefiting from a comprehensive product suite and robust partner ecosystem enabling enterprises to enhance seamless customer interaction and productivity. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver.\n\nThis customer-management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.5%. Revenues are expected to be $10.04 billion, up 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Salesforce.com, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on CRM going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.\n\nMarket Outlook 2025\n\nOn December 17, 2024, J.P. Morgan released its market outlook 2025. The report expects the global economy to continue growing at a robust rate, however a sharp slowdown in China is expected. Regarding the equity market, the firm anticipates depressing trends across stocks, sectors, and themes. Analysts at the firm estimate the S&P 500 to be around 6,500 in 2025 with earnings per share of $270. The head of Global Market Research, Hussain Malik noted that the policies of the United States regarding trade, immigration, and regulatory policy will play a critical role in defining the year\u2019s outcome for the country and globally.\n\nThe report further elaborated on its anticipation of a depressed stock market by highlighting de-coupling central bank policies, uneven progress in disinflation, and ongoing technological innovation. Moreover, increased geopolitical tensions are also likely to add unusual complexity to the global stock market. Despite all this, the firm has bright expectations for the United States. It believes that the country will remain a key driver of growth due to factors such as an expanding business cycle, a robust labor market, increased capital spending related to AI, and active capital markets. On the other hand, Europe is expected to grapple with structural challenges, while emerging markets may face headwinds from persistent high interest rates, a strong US dollar, and trade policy issues.\n\nLakos-Bujas, head of Global Markets Strategy at J.P. Morgan warned that a key risk to their base case involves disinflation stalling or reversing, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate hikes later in 2025 or early 2026. Such developments would necessitate a reassessment of their market outlook.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of the 10 best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. We checked the 25 most widely held stocks by hedge funds for 10-year growth rates from Seeking Alpha and ranked these stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n10-Year Revenue Growth: 22.04%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading customer relationship management (CRM) company that helps businesses manage their interactions with customers. It does so through a cloud-based platform called Customer 360, which integrates marketing, sales, analytics, and AI to ensure smooth customer relationship management. The company has recently launched its AI-powered platform called Agentforce, a cutting-edge platform designed to create and manage autonomous AI agents that can perform various business functions.\n\nOn January 23, Bradley Sills, analyst at BofA reiterated his Buy rating on the stock, while maintaining his price target of $440. The analyst noted that even after a strong performance in 2023 and 2024, where the stock gained 98.5% and 27.1% respectively, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) remains undervalued compared to its peers. Bradley believes that this combined with 12% to 13% year-over-year revenue growth expectation for the second half of 2026, driven by Agentforce and strong spending makes the stock a Buy for high returns.\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) grew its revenue by 8% year-over-year to reach $9.44 billion, driven by its competitive Agentforce platform. Moreover, on December 12, the company introduced the next version of its platform called Agentforce 2.0, a significant upgrade to its digital labor platform aimed at creating a limitless workforce powered by autonomous AI agents. The upgraded version includes a comprehensive library of pre-built skills that allow businesses to quickly customize AI agents for specific tasks. These skills span across various applications, including CRM, Slack, and Tableau, making it easier for teams to deploy agents without extensive setup time. It is one of the best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025.\n\nMontaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThere are multiple structural trends in the enterprise software space, including (i) the ongoing cloud migrations and digital transformations of enterprises, and (ii) the infusion of AI into software applications. While the former remains in its early innings (80-85% of enterprise workloads still reside \u2018on-premise\u2019 \u2013 many of which will ultimately move to public clouds), the latter remains in its infancy. Given all the hype of late, it\u2019s hard to fathom that large-scale deployments of AI-based enterprise applications have barely even started. It\u2019s all still to come. And we believe 2025 will be the first year that we really start to see meaningful deployments and adoption of these kinds of applications. Consider another of our top 10 holdings, Salesforce, for example. Its revenue growth is at a cyclical low. Indeed, at just +8% per annum, as reported in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, its rate of revenue growth has never been lower. But in 2025, not only will price increases that were announced two years ago boost Salesforce, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:CRM) revenue growth, but the year will also mark the early stages of adoption of the company\u2019s new \u2018Agentforce\u2019 (released only weeks ago). This is a new platform that lets businesses build and deploy their own custom AI agents to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 8th on our list of best stocks to buy for high returns in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Key Takeaways The stocks of software companies such as Salesforce have soared this week on hopes that Chinese start-up DeepSeek's cost-efficient AI model could make AI applications significantly less expensive to develop and run.\n\nDeepSeek's success could hasten the roll-out of AI agents, semi-autonomous digital assistants that Wall Street analysts expected to command greater investor attention this year.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure platform, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Tuesday, could benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications.\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s super-efficient open-source AI model may have sunk some of Wall Street\u2019s favorite AI stocks on Monday, but it may have also crowned some new favorites.\n\nYesterday was the worst day for Nvidia (NVDA) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) since March 2020. Yet some tech sector stocks have soared\u2014Salesforce (CRM) stock has risen 8% this week and Apple (AAPL) has climbed 7%.\n\nThat\u2019s because the AI trade has, up to now, been driven by the suppliers of the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of artificial intelligence: semiconductors, networking equipment, and electricity. But DeepSeek\u2019s success suggests AI\u2019s picks and shovels may not need to be as plentiful or as fancy as investors once thought. That could be a boon to AI buyers, like software companies, who pay cloud service providers and AI companies for access to foundational models and computing power.\n\nCould DeepSeek Hasten the Rise of AI Agents?\n\nSeveral analysts predicted at the end of last year that AI agents\u2014digital assistants capable of performing more tasks than AI chatbots\u2014would draw more interest from investors.\n\nMajor tech companies and upstarts have already begun rolling out AI agents that have the potential to reshape consumer behavior, and Wall Street has taken notice. OpenAI last week launched its AI agent, Operator, which the company said could order users' groceries or book their plane tickets. Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce saw \u201chealthy early interest\u201d in its first months, according to Bank of America analysts. And shares of med-tech company Tempus AI (TEM) soared last week after it released olivia, its AI-power health concierge.\n\nThe pivot from infrastructure to application may have been hastened by DeepSeek\u2019s model, the cost-efficiency of which can likely be replicated by U.S. companies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that DeepSeek\u2019s innovations at the model layer reinforce our thesis that the Application and Platform layers are set to benefit as revenue moves from the Infrastructure layer and enterprises allocate more budget to AI,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Tuesday. Lower computing costs, they say, \u201cshould help catalyze broader usage of AI workloads and encourage adoption across businesses and consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnterprise Software Could Benefit from DeepSeek Ripple Effect\n\nGoldman expects the benefits of lower computing costs to accrue first to major software companies with established AI products, including Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce and Adobe (ADBE). But, they say, more efficient models should lower the barrier to entry for smaller competitors and encourage the proliferation of AI use cases.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts agreed that enterprise software companies were most likely to benefit from the savings that should follow from America's DeepSeek reckoning. \"More cost-efficient models are bringing down \u2018GenAI input costs\u2019 for the broader Software ecosystem,\" the analysts wrote. They highlighted Microsoft as a major beneficiary, noting its Azure platform is an optimal location for application developers to access and build on foundational AI models.\n\n",

            "probability": null,
            "content": "B2B marketing and sales have long been at odds. Sales teams frequently criticize the quality of leads they receive, while marketers question sales\u2019 ability to follow up effectively. At the heart of this frustration is a structural problem rooted in CRM systems.\n\nI personally think Salesforce, the most widely used CRM in B2B, is to blame for this disconnect.\n\nSimply put, the Lead Object, which is central to Salesforce\u2019s design, completely messes with everyone\u2019s head and doesn\u2019t align with how B2B buying decisions are made.\n\nIn B2B, purchases happen at the account level, involving multiple stakeholders across an organization. Yet marketers are expected to focus on generating individual leads, usually hit with a certain quota\u2026and we all know how that usually pans out.\n\nThis problem isn\u2019t because of technology, though. It\u2019s all about mindset.\n\nToo many marketing strategies focus on influencing individuals rather than building relationships across entire organizations. Similarly, sales teams often lack the visibility they need to understand the full picture of account engagement and end up chasing the wrong individual simply because they ended up in a list from marketing. You see how the cycle is destined for division!\n\nDig deeper: Why account-based expansion is B2B\u2019s next growth lever\n\nThe Lead Object is where this problem started\n\nTo put it bluntly, the Lead Object is outdated and ineffective for B2B marketing and sales. When Salesforce introduced this model, it made sense for simpler, transactional sales processes. But in BB today, the Lead Object creates more problems than it solves.\n\nLet\u2019s take a peek at this through the lens of your ops team and see exactly why it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThis alone should tell you everything you need to know about why the Lead Object is unnecessary and absurd. Once a Lead becomes a Contact, that\u2019s it \u2014 it\u2019s a one-way trip. Seriously, why even bother using this in the first place?\n\nThe Lead Object overlooks multi-stakeholder buying\n\nB2B deals are rarely decided by a single person. Buying committees are the norm, with champions, blockers, influencers, decision-makers and maybe even a grumpy executive or two. Focusing on just one lead in an organization ignores how decisions are actually made and that\u2019s going to hurt you down the road.\n\nDig deeper: Why B2B CMOs are frustrated with ABM platforms\n\nShift to account-level thinking\n\nB2B purchases don\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and they\u2019re rarely the result of just one person\u2019s decision without any other input. So why do so many organizations still treat their CRM systems like they\u2019re selling to individuals? Here\u2019s how you can start winning as one team.\n\nFocus on accounts, not individuals\n\nTrack all activity at the account level. Every contact, every conversation and every touchpoint should map back to the broader organization. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to leverage this information? This creates a unified view of their engagement and makes it easier to build your own engagement strategy to create and win the deal.\n\nMap out stakeholder relationships\n\nNot all stakeholders are created equal. You need to know who\u2019s influencing the deal, who\u2019s advocating for your solution and who might try to block it. Understanding the roles each contact plays within the buying process is critical to building a strategy that works. Know your enemy. Anticipate what\u2019s to come so you can plan accordingly rather than reacting in real time.\n\nRethink communication as a cohesive motion\n\nWhy does communication between marketing and sales need to feel so binary? Marketing warms them up. Sales closes them. It sounds good in theory, but it\u2019s disconnected in practice. A smarter approach would treat communication as one cohesive strategy. Sales could focus on key players while marketing engages other stakeholders. After all, most communication happens in the same channels, so why not coordinate and anticipate what needs to happen to move the account forward? Anything less feels like wasted potential.\n\nStop over-complicating things\n\nLook, as fun as it is to make your job sound wildly complex with Rube Goldberg-like processes and over-the-top jargon \u2014 it\u2019s not. Keep it simple. At the end of the day, you\u2019re one of thousands and thousands of companies trying to do the same thing: track who to communicate with and when to reach out and why.\n\nToo many organizations still treat individual leads as the center of their process when the reality is you\u2019re selling to entire accounts. Buying decisions don\u2019t hinge on one person. They\u2019re made by groups of people with different perspectives, needs and priorities. Fragmenting communication between marketing and sales makes it impossible to approach accounts as a cohesive whole, limiting your ability to build the relationships across stakeholders that drive deals forward.\n\nThe account IS the lead.\n\nThe sooner you stop clinging to individual lead-centric processes, the sooner you\u2019ll start working smarter.\n\nTreat communication as one cohesive motion, with marketing and sales playing complementary roles instead of stepping on each other\u2019s toes. When you shift your mentality to the account, you start building a strategy that mirrors how B2B buying actually happens \u2014 where every connection is a chance to strengthen your position and move closer to a win.\n\nWhen your CRM is built to support this reality, it becomes an actual solution that helps you achieve alignment and results.",

            "content": "Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) recently announced that SharkNinja, a global product design and technology company, is implementing Agentforce and other Salesforce products, including Commerce Cloud, to drive global growth by scaling its personalized customer service approach with autonomous agents.\n\nSharkNinja is a global provider of indoor and outdoor household products, transforming how people cook, clean, and live in homes around the world. As the innovator behind two multi-billion-dollar brands\u200c \u2014 \u200cShark and Ninja\u200c \u2014 \u200cSharkNinja is renowned for its diversified portfolio of products, including Shark vacuum cleaners and beauty tools, as well as Ninja kitchen appliances, such as blenders, air fryers, and ice cream makers.\n\nTo support its rapid, global growth, SharkNinja is embracing solutions that will scale support and service more efficiently across more than 30 markets while delivering a seamless consumer shopping experience.\n\nExplore related questions Ask ERP Today what is this?\n\nAgentforce, a new layer on the Salesforce Platform, will enable SharkNinja to easily build and deploy AI agents that can autonomously take action across any business function. With Agentforce, SharkNinja will have an always-on, digital workforce available 24/7 to guide customers through the buying process, answer product questions, troubleshoot issues, and manage returns \u2014 streamlining human agent workloads so they can focus on meaningful, high-impact interactions.\n\n\u201cInnovation is the driver behind every product SharkNinja creates across our vast portfolio, so it was really important to find a tool that could give us the capabilities needed to be just as innovative across every consumer interaction,\u201d said Velia Carboni, CIO, SharkNinja. \u201cWe believe Agentforce is this key to helping us build a community that keeps consumers coming back as we continue to grow and develop new problem-solving innovations that positively impact people\u2019s lives in homes around the world.\u201d\n\nAgentforce will also help SharkNinja enhance brand loyalty through tailored support interactions that deliver targeted solutions and recommendations based on insights from customer data from previous purchases and service history.\n\n\u201cSharkNinja prioritizes quality, innovation, and an exceptional customer experience,\u201d said Adam Evans, EVP & GM of Salesforce AI Platform. \u201cBy integrating customer data with service and support functions, Agentforce enables SharkNinja to deliver an exceptional experience at every touchpoint \u2014 building customer loyalty and keeping them coming back time and time again.\u201d\n\nSharkNinja will also leverage Commerce Cloud, enabling the company to consolidate customer data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This integration will enable the delivery of more personalized shopping experiences for each customer. At the same time, having unified touchpoints will allow SharkNinja to more effectively track engagement across its global customer base.\n\nWhat this means for ERP Insiders\n\nAgentic AI just might be the killer app of AI. As of late 2024, approximately 26% of companies have initiated agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept. This figure is projected to rise to 50% by 2027. And by 2028, it\u2019s anticipated that 33% of enterprise software applications will incorporate agentic AI, facilitating 15% of daily operational decisions to be made autonomously. But generative AI is not going away. GenAI is best suited for augmentation, content creation, and decision support\u2014helping professionals generate high-quality content and insights faster. Agentic AI is ideal for automation and autonomous decision-making\u2014handling complex, multi-step tasks and executing them without human intervention. Organizations will benefit most by combining both\u2014using Gen AI to generate insights and Agentic AI to take action on those insights. The convergence of Gen AI and Agentic AI will lead to autonomous, creative, and intelligent systems capable of end-to-end automation, content production, and strategic decision-making.\n\nAgentforce plays well with others. Agentforce is designed to integrate seamlessly with a wide array of major enterprise systems, enhancing its capabilities across various business functions. For instance, through MuleSoft\u2019s pre-built connectors, Agentforce can access and interact with SAP\u2019s ERP modules, facilitating real-time data synchronization and process automation. And Agentforce integrates with Oracle ERP systems, enabling efficient data exchange and workflow automation to streamline business operations. Integration with Microsoft Dynamics ERP allows Agentforce to unify data and automate processes, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency. Agentforce also connects with supply chain management systems to provide predictive insights, optimize supply chain operations, and improve resource management. And Agentforce is natively integrated with the entire Salesforce Customer 360 suite, including Sales, Service, Commerce, and Marketing Cloud, allowing agents to utilize complete customer context and take action directly within these applications. Agentforce leverages MuleSoft\u2019s integration capabilities to connect with various other external systems and data sources, ensuring agents have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information necessary for informed decision-making.\n\nLearn from companies already down the path with Agentforce. Wiley, in the publishing and education industry, implemented AI-powered agents to assist customers in resolving common issues independently. As a result, the company achieved a 213% return on investment by reducing the workload on service representatives, allowing them to focus on more complex cases, and enhanced customer satisfaction through quicker issue resolution. The Adecco Group, in the talent solutions and recruitment industry, deployed autonomous agents to handle administrative tasks such as sifting through resumes, creating shortlists, and managing end-to-end screening processes. The company improved efficiency in the recruitment process, enabling recruiters to focus on building meaningful connections with candidates. The Adecco Group is now exploring further applications of Agentforce to enhance job descriptions and boost candidate engagement. OpenTable, in the hospitality and reservations space, enhanced customer service by integrating Agentforce with Service Cloud. The company boosted productivity for service representatives through AI agents, leading to more efficient handling of customer inquiries, and it improved overall customer experience by providing timely and accurate responses.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other best SaaS stocks to invest in.\n\nMobile devices are now running more sophisticated and complicated software applications, which supports improving demand for SaaS solutions that can be accessed only with the help of an internet connection. As of now, continuous innovation has been helping businesses in running their operations globally. It continues to improve scalability and flexibility in data storage. Experts opine that the SaaS domain has been aiding in major decision-making and strategy-building as dynamic technologies such as AI and ML have been intersecting with it.\n\nSaaS Growth Drivers for 2025\n\nAs per Fortune Business Insights, the global Software as a Service (SaaS) market size was pegged at US$273.55 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow from US$317.55 billion in 2024 to US$1,228.87 billion by 2032. The US SaaS market is expected to grow significantly, reaching an estimated value of US$236.69 billion by 2032, courtesy of the adoption of public and hybrid cloud-based tools by enterprises. Overall, the SaaS market growth is expected to be fueled by numerous factors such as an increase in the adoption of public & hybrid cloud-based solutions, integration with other tools, and centralized data-driven analytics.\n\nAs per Straits Research, increased demand for smart devices and their applications has been aiding the broader market. Notably, end-user demand for intelligent devices is supported by the expansion of email, instant messaging applications, and video calls. This is expected to contribute to the expansion of the SaaS market. Also, higher spending on cloud-based solutions by end-use businesses can accelerate the expansion of the broader SaaS industry over the upcoming years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends Likely to Help SaaS in 2025\n\nWith continuous advancements in technology, changing market demands, and increased dependence on cloud-based solutions, SaaS trends have been redefining the future of digital transformation for companies. Fortune Business Insights believes integrating AI and ML with SaaS Solutions will fuel broad-based market growth. This means that the adoption of AI/ML is expected to change the SaaS industry in many ways, mainly by improving the critical features of several software solutions. Notably, customizing & automating solutions, augmenting security, and improving human capacity are possible by incorporating SaaS solutions and AI/ML abilities.\n\nFurthermore, SaaS has been continuously evolving and transforming services among cloud computing technologies. As per Fortune Business Insights, the key trending factors of SaaS are expected to continue to evolve and outline the future of cloud technologies, innovation, efficiency, and business values.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Best SaaS Stocks to Invest In, we used a screener and scanned through several online rankings. Next, we chose the companies that were popular among hedge funds. Finally, the companies were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is in the SaaS industry as it provides cloud-based software solutions that are hosted and delivered over the internet. Bradley Sills, an analyst from Bank of America Securities, reiterated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the company\u2019s shares with the same price target of $440.00. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is well-placed for a revenue growth acceleration to 12% \u2013 13% YoY by H2 2026, says Sills. This growth is expected to be aided by an improved spending environment and the introduction of Agentforce.\n\nSaaS adoption has been growing across industries because of its scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility. These increased demand trends for SaaS solutions align directly with Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s offerings, mainly its Customer 360 platform and CRM software. Furthermore, a rise of AI and ML in SaaS products offers Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) an avenue to strengthen its position via platforms such as Einstein AI.\n\nThe company\u2019s established market position and vast customer base offer significant advantages as the broader CRM landscape evolves. Montaka Global Investments, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cThere are multiple structural trends in the enterprise software space, including (i) the ongoing cloud migrations and digital transformations of enterprises, and (ii) the infusion of AI into software applications. While the former remains in its early innings (80-85% of enterprise workloads still reside \u2018on-premise\u2019 \u2013 many of which will ultimately move to public clouds), the latter remains in its infancy. Given all the hype of late, it\u2019s hard to fathom that large-scale deployments of AI-based enterprise applications have barely even started. It\u2019s all still to come. And we believe 2025 will be the first year that we really start to see meaningful deployments and adoption of these kinds of applications. Consider another of our top 10 holdings, Salesforce, for example. Its revenue growth is at a cyclical low. Indeed, at just +8% per annum, as reported in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, its rate of revenue growth has never been lower. But in 2025, not only will price increases that were announced two years ago boost Salesforce, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:CRM) revenue growth, but the year will also mark the early stages of adoption of the company\u2019s new \u2018Agentforce\u2019 (released only weeks ago). This is a new platform that lets businesses build and deploy their own custom AI agents to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 1st on our list of best SaaS stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Savvy investors are drawn to stock splits because they are often roundabout indicators of quality businesses. To elaborate, stock splits are only necessary after substantial share price appreciation, which rarely happens to bad businesses. In the past year, several artificial intelligence companies completed stock splits to reset their soaring share prices, as detailed below:\n\nArista Networks has returned 324% in the last two years. The company conducted a 4-for-1 stock split in December 2024.\n\nhas returned 324% in the last two years. The company conducted a 4-for-1 stock split in December 2024. Broadcom has returned 318% in the last two years. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in July 2024.\n\nhas returned 318% in the last two years. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in July 2024. Nvidia has returned 640% in the last two years. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024.\n\nhas returned 640% in the last two years. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024. Super Micro Computer has returned 325% in the last two years. The company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in October 2024.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (META 2.96%) and Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) soared 350% and 115%, respectively, over the last two years. That price appreciation makes both companies stock-split candidates in 2025. More importantly, Wall Street is generally bullish on Meta Platforms and Salesforce, and certain analysts anticipate material upside.\n\nMost notably, Barton Crockett at Rosenblatt has set Meta Platforms with a target price of $811 per share. That implies 25% upside from its current price of $647. And Brad Sills at Bank of America has set Salesforce with a target price of $440 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $333. Read on to learn more.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms owns four of the seven most popular social media platforms on the planet. That competitive advantage lets the company collect data and target advertising campaigns for brands. Consequently, Meta is the second-largest ad tech company in the world behind Alphabet's Google, and is projected to gain share through 2026, according to eMarketer.\n\nMeta Platforms reported solid financial results in the third quarter, exceeding Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $40 billion, operating margin expanded 3 percentage points, and GAAP net income increased 37% to $6.03 per diluted share. Those numbers are particularly impressive given heavy spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and Reality Labs.\n\nHowever, CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared encouraging information about those investments on the third-quarter earnings call. \"AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year.\" Also, he said Meta AI has over 500 million monthly active users, such that it was on pace to become the most used AI assistant by the end of 2024.\n\nAdditionally, while Reality Labs is still operating at a substantial loss, Meta recently announced Orion, its first fully holographic augmented reality glasses. And Zuckerberg told analysts, \"We're not too far off from being able to deliver great-looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds.\"\n\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2025. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look tolerable. Investors with a time horizon of at least three years should consider buying a position today.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is a customer relationship management (CRM) software vendor. Its platform includes applications that improve productivity across sales, service, marketing, and commerce. It also includes tools for data integration, analytics, and artificial intelligence. Salesforce has 22% market share in CRM software, more than the next four competitors combined.\n\nThe company reported reasonably good financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in October. Revenue rose 8% to $9.4 billion due to strong growth in sales and service software. And non-GAAP net income increased 14% to $2.41 per diluted share. The company also raised the low end of its full-year guidance, such that sales are projected to increase 9% in fiscal 2025.\n\nSalesforce recently launched Agentforce, a platform that provides businesses with digital labor powered by artificial intelligence. AI agents have autonomy that goes beyond that of AI copilots. They can make decisions and take action without human intervention. CEO Mark Benioff says, \"No other company comes close to offering this complete AI solution for enterprises.\"\n\nWall Street expects Salesforce's adjusted earnings to grow at 12% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026. That makes the current valuation of 34 times adjusted earnings look expensive. But analysts may be underestimating the company's future earnings growth, as they have in the past.\n\nSpecifically, Salesforce beat the consensus earnings forecast by an average of 4% in the last six quarters. That trend may continue in the coming quarters, especially if Agentforce gains tractions with customers. I think that creates an opportunity for patient investors. But it makes sense to start with a very small position given the elevated valuation.",

With AI shaping the next industrial revolution, these honorees represent India\u2019s role in driving deep tech, computing, and digital transformation.\n\nThe Padma Awards 2025 have marked a significant moment in India\u2019s recognition of AI and deep tech innovation, with several leaders from the sector being honoured. While past Padma Awards have recognised contributions to computing, semiconductors, and machine learning, this year sees a more pronounced acknowledgment of AI-driven advancements shaping India\u2019s economic and technological future.\n\nHere are the key AI and technology-focused awardees:\n\nVinod Dham (Padma Bhushan \u2013 Science & Engineering, USA)\n\n\u201cFather of the Pentium Chip\u201d \u2013 Pioneering Semiconductors & AI Hardware\n\nVinod Dham, a semiconductor visionary, played a key role in developing Intel\u2019s Pentium processors, which revolutionized computing.

His Padma Bhushan recognises his lasting impact on computing and semiconductor technology, which continues to evolve with AI acceleration.\n\nSethuraman Panchanathan (Padma Shri \u2013 Science & Engineering, USA)\n\n\u201cDriving AI Research & Science Policy in the US\u201d\n\nAs the Director of the US National Science Foundation (NSF), Panchanathan has been instrumental in shaping AI research, scientific advancements, and innovation policies. He oversees AI investments in fundamental research, workforce development, and cutting-edge computational science initiatives. His recognition highlights AI\u2019s growing importance in policymaking and global research collaboration.\n\nPrashant Prakash (Padma Shri \u2013 Trade & Industry, India)\n\n\u201cThe VC Powering India\u2019s AI Startup Boom\u201d\n\nAs Founding Partner of Accel India, Prakash has funded and mentored some of India\u2019s biggest tech startups, including Flipkart, Swiggy, and Freshworks. He has been a key advocate for AI adoption, sustainability, and deep tech investments in India, helping to position the country as a global AI hub. His Padma Shri acknowledges his contributions to India\u2019s startup ecosystem and his efforts in shaping entrepreneurship.\n\nArundhati Bhattacharya (Padma Shri \u2013 Trade & Industry, India)\n\n\u201cLeading AI Adoption in Indian Enterprise Tech\u201d\n\nAs Chairperson & CEO of Salesforce India, Bhattacharya has led AI-driven digital transformation across businesses. She previously modernised the State Bank of India (SBI), bringing AI-powered automation and digital banking to millions. Her Padma Shri recognises her impact on AI adoption in Indian enterprise tech and the banking sector.\n\n\u201cI am deeply humbled to receive the Padma Shri award, one of India\u2019s most esteemed recognitions. This honor reflects the incredible opportunities I\u2019ve had to contribute to India\u2019s trade and industry. From my journey in banking to leading Salesforce India, I\u2019ve witnessed how vision and innovation can transform lives and businesses,\u201d said Bhattacharya.\n\n\n\n\u201cI spoke about \u2018the dawn of the Indian Era\u2019 at Dreamforce 2024, and this recognition of Arundhati Bhattacharya with the prestigious Padma Shri award is a powerful testament to that vision. Arundhati\u2019s extraordinary leadership\u2014from her transformative impact in banking to her role in driving digital transformation at Salesforce India\u2014embodies the spirit of innovation, resilience, and inclusivity that is shaping India\u2019s incredible growth story,\u201d said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce.\n\nA Growing Trend: AI and Tech Leaders in the Padma Awards\n\nHistorically, the Padma Awards have occasionally recognised AI pioneers, such as: Raj Reddy (Padma Bhushan, 2001) \u2013 One of the earliest AI researchers, known for his contributions to speech recognition and robotics.\n\nSankar Kumar Pal (Padma Shri, 2013) \u2013 A machine intelligence expert who made significant contributions to pattern recognition and fuzzy logic.\n\nHowever, 2025 marks a shift, with multiple AI and semiconductor leaders being honoured in a single year, reflecting India\u2019s growing focus on AI as a transformative force.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to accelerate rapidly, moving from emerging technologies to influencing how businesses carry out operations. As per SAP, the changes occurring in 2025 revolve around autonomous AI agents, specialized AI models, user interface design, and enterprise adoption patterns. On 13th January, an AI behemoth highlighted that the first Trump Administration focused on America\u2019s strength and success in AI, boosting an environment where the broader US industry can compete.\n\nTherefore, mainstream AI is now a critical part of every new application, which helps fuel economic growth, promote US interests, and make sure that America can sustain its leadership in cutting-edge technology. On a related note, Trump announced billions of dollars in private sector investment focused on building AI infrastructure in the country.\n\nTrump Announces $500 Billion Investment for AI Infrastructure\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced a private sector investment of up to $500 billion focused on financing infrastructure for AI, targeting to outperform rival nations in the business-critical technology. Mr. President went on to add that ChatGPT\u2019s creator OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are discussing a JV called Stargate, which is expected to build data centers and create over 100,000 jobs in the US. Notably, these companies, together with several other equity backers of Stargate, decided to commit $100 billion for immediate deployment. The remaining investment is expected to take place over the upcoming 4 years.\n\nAs per Trump, this is the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Also, Stargate is expected to build the physical and virtual infrastructure which will focus on powering the next generation of AI, including data centers around the US.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nAI Rally to Continue in 2025, Says UBS\n\nAs per UBS, the AI rally has aided in driving 2 straight years of healthy returns for the NASDAQ Composite, which also includes a 28% rally last year. The Mag 7 group of technology stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in 2024. In the previous year, continued upward revisions in AI capex from the Big 4 tech giants supported keeping the AI rally on track. UBS expects the upward revisions to continue over the near term.\n\nEven though AI revenues might again lag behind capex in 2025, UBS expects that AI monetization will improve sharply in 2025. The AI adoption continues to accelerate across industries and is well-placed to broaden in 2025. Also, the arrival of more clearly useful AI agents is expected to further support return on investment (ROI).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Wall Street Analysts, we conducted extensive research and scanned through several online rankings. After getting an initial list of 15-18 stocks, we shortlisted the ones in which analysts saw upside potential. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of January 21, 2025. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAverage Upside Potential: ~25.3%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a leading player in the AI industry, which uses AI to enhance CRM platforms and deliver AI-powered solutions to clients. Investment firm TD Cowen upgraded the company\u2019s shares from a \u201cHold\u201d to a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and upped the price target from $380 to $400. Derrick Wood and his team, working at TD Cowen, identified new growth drivers for 2025-2026, including SKU upgrades, a robust renewal pipeline, momentum with AI products, and inorganic growth.\n\nEven though Agentforce is anticipated to have a minimal impact on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s revenue in 2025, Derrick Wood believes that its contribution is expected to increase in H2 of the year and fuel the company\u2019s remaining performance obligations. Furthermore, the analyst expects Agentforce to start contributing more significantly to revenue improvement by 2026. To provide a brief context, Agentforce is a product that has been designed to leverage the next generation of AI via intelligent agents.\n\nWith businesses seeking AI-powered solutions to improve customer interactions and streamline operations, Agentforce is placed favorably to capture this growing demand. Investment management company Vulcan Value Partners recently released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cThere were five material contributors to performance: Amazon.com Inc., Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Carlyle Group Inc., and Alphabet Inc. There were no material detractors. Salesforce is the world\u2019s leading SaaS vendor for customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) software. Salesforce offers many other products including software for marketing automation, customer service automation, analytics, application integration, and enterprise collaboration among others. Salesforce is deeply entrenched within its customer base, has high retention, high recurring revenue, and is a scalable business with high free cash flow and margin potential. Salesforce reported solid earnings and provided several positive data points around its AI strategy.\u201d\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 9th on our list of most promising AI stocks according to Wall Street analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now.\n\nIn recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.\n\nOn January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction.\n\nEurope has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach.\n\nConversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump\u2019s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world\u2019s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback by sustainably-minded investors as the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement.\n\nFor asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise.\n\nUS-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This \u201cgreenhushing\u201d strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nAs the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies. We then looked at their ESG rating from S&P Global and picked 8 companies that have a minimum ESG score of 60. We also used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024 to find the number of hedge fund holders for each company. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 116\n\nESG Score: 61\n\nSalesforce, Inc.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs leaders of some of the biggest companies, economists and world leaders congregated at the 2025 Davos Promenade in Switzerland, artificial intelligence is one topic that featured prominently. It did not come as a surprise, given the AI boom has propelled the market caps of some companies, with some becoming trillion-dollar empires.\n\nThis year's WEF covered both the risks associated with rapidly evolving systems and the latest developments in artificial intelligence. The focus was on current developments with AI agents and artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which describes AI systems that are more intelligent than humans. One thing that came out clear is that a majority of company executives, 58%, expect generative AI solutions to be adopted at scale this year.\n\nHowever, even as AI continues to dominate most spaces, the question remains whether companies and businesses have the infrastructure and skills to get the most out of the revolutionary technology. \u201cFrom boosting operational efficiency to delivering insights and discovering new opportunities, AI has the power to redefine how businesses operate. Yet, for many organizations, this potential remains out of reach \u201cbecause the road to AI adoption is strewn with challenges that often derail success,\u201d said Paul Pallath, vice president of applied AI at technology consulting firm Search.\n\nBusinesses must overcome these obstacles and lay a strong foundation for long-term AI integration if AI is to provide genuine value, according to Pallath. Developing a data infrastructure to support AI initiatives is one of the most difficult tasks.\n\nAccording to an EY survey of 500 senior business executives in the United States last year, 83% of participants stated that having a more robust data infrastructure would speed up their company's adoption of AI. Two-thirds acknowledged that a lack of infrastructure is hampering their companies' adoption of AI.\n\nThe new US administration under Donald Trump has found an answer to the infrastructure concern that some people believe has hampered growth in the sector. A $500 billion Stargate project involving major tech companies could help accelerate the country's AI infrastructure development.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence agents \u2014 tools designed to complete tasks with little or no human supervision \u2014 are dominating technology conversations, stealing at least some of the spotlight from generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\nSoftware executives like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff are lining up behind the technology, rolling out big plans for 2025 and beyond, as they imagine a future in which it\u2019s trusted to perform a variety of key workplace tasks across industries.\n\nSalesforce, for its part, is seeking to unleash one billion agents by the end of 2025, Benioff said in an announcement last fall.\n\nWhile the technology is generating a lot of buzz, some analysts say it may be a while before companies can begin to realize its enormous potential.\n\nAgentic AI offers new opportunities for business leaders but it also poses a host of potential challenges, including the risk of an agent leaking sensitive data or acting based on a \u201challucination\u201d or error, according to analysts. For now, at least, this could hinder adoption, particularly in sensitive parts of a business such as the finance department.\n\n\u201cI think the finance function is going to need to take some time to get comfortable with agentic AI,\u201d Mark McDonald, a senior director analyst at Gartner, said in an interview, adding that rapid adoption among finance teams this year is unlikely.\n\nYears, not months\n\nThe consulting group Forrester in a report late last year stated that AI agents, despite being a top emerging technology for 2024, were effectively not ready for prime time, asserting that it would be another two years before they have \u201cany chance of meeting inflated automation hopes.\u201d\n\nIn addition, some may be underestimating the complexity of running projects that involve multiple agents working together, according to Assaf Melochna, co-founder of Aquant, an AI company based in New York City.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between building something for an experiment versus an enterprise-grade system that needs to be bullet proof to avoid error,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, despite agentic AI\u2019s immediate challenges, analysts say it might also be risky for business leaders to completely tune out the noise around the technology.\n\n\u201cWith agentic AI, the question is not if, but when,\u201d Deloitte said in a 2024 year-end AI report released this week. \u201cAlthough the technology is still in its early stages, it is evolving rapidly and will likely become increasingly capable over the next few years.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, organizations have improved their preparedness for generative AI more broadly when it comes to areas such as tech infrastructure and strategy but have made seemingly little progress on other critical fronts, including risk, governance and talent, the report said.\n\nChatbots versus agents\n\nThe tech industry\u2019s agentic AI push comes amid growing disillusionment over generative AI in the business world as many C-suite leaders grapple with the reality of cost and return-on-investment challenges, analysts say.\n\nFor organizations struggling to see the benefits of generative AI, Cole Stryker, a writer who contributes to IBM blogs, writing in an October piece said he sees agents as potentially \u201cthe key to finding tangible business value.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the vast sums of money currently being poured into a handful of huge LLMs [large language models] will be recouped in real-world use cases, but agentic AI represents a promising framework that brings LLMs into the real world, pointing the way to a more AI-powered future,\u201d Stryker argued.\n\nChatbots \u201ccan interact intuitively with humans, synthesize complex information, and generate content,\u201d according to a November article published by Deloitte\u2019s Center for Technology Media and Telecommunications. \u201cBut they lack the degree of agency and autonomy that agentic AI promises \u2026 AI agents don\u2019t just interact. They more effectively reason and act on behalf of the user.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot, a ChatGPT-like tool, can serve as a personal assistant to business professionals by \u201cjumpstarting\u201d creative projects, but an AI agent can go even further, acting as \u201ca virtual project manager\u201d or tackling complex assignments like reconciling financial statements to close books, Susanna Ray, a features writer who produces online content for Microsoft, wrote in a November blog post.\n\n\u201cAn agent takes the power of generative AI a step further, because instead of just assisting you, agents can work alongside you or even on your behalf,\u201d she said. \u201cAgents can do a range of things, from responding to questions to more complicated or multistep assignments.\u201d\n\nAI agents can choose a course of action, design a plan, gather relevant data, and employ multiple software tools to complete each step, according to an SAP explainer.\n\n\u201cBy learning from evolving information, AI agents improve over time \u2014 analyzing feedback, self-correcting errors, and solving emerging problems,\u201d according to the article. \u201cMultiple AI agents can also work together, even coordinating with humans to achieve different tasks.\u201d\n\nSAP supports the policy that a \u201chuman should always be in the loop\u201d when agentic AI is used, Walter Sun, global head of AI at SAP, told CFO Dive. He said SAP\u2019s AI agents provide recommendations to users, who decide whether or not to take action.\n\nWhile agentic AI models are designed to make decisions and carry out complex sequences of actions, they are not foolproof and can still make mistakes, just as humans do, according to Mark Purdy, managing director of Purdy & Associates, an advisory and thought leadership firm.\n\n\u201cThe agentic AI prize could be great, with the promise of greater productivity, innovation, and insights for the human workforce,\u201d he wrote in a December article published by the Harvard Business Review. \u201cBut so, too, are the risks: the potential for bias, mistakes, and inappropriate use.\u201d\n\nOrganizations were advised in Deloitte\u2019s year-end AI report to prepare for agentic AI by developing a \u201cstrategic roadmap\u201d and crafting risk mitigation plans, among other steps.\n\n\u201c[W]hile there are still many challenges to overcome \u2014 and technical complexities to sort out \u2014 now is the time to start preparing,\u201d the report said.\n\nAI\u2019s \u2018staying power\u2019\n\nMore broadly, AI remains a top priority for C-suite leaders, despite some of the potential challenges and risks around adoption, KPMG found in a survey released this month.\n\nThe majority of corporate executives responding to the poll said they expect AI to \u201cfundamentally\u201d change the nature of their business within a year or two.\n\nAnd nearly seven in 10 respondents said they plan to invest between $50 million to $250 million in generative AI over the next 12 months, up from 45% in first quarter 2024 poll results.\n\n\u201cThe results show the staying power of the technology,\u201d Todd Lohr, head of ecosystems at KPMG\u2019s U.S. advisory division, said in an interview, adding that C-suite leaders have continued down the path of AI investment, by and large.\n\nThe coming year brings an opportunity to scale and advance AI capabilities across the enterprise, and a majority of organizations are looking to AI agents to help do so, KPMG said in a release announcing the study. Over half (51%) of organizations are exploring the use of AI agents and another 37% are piloting them, it found.\n\nBut, once again, it will be up to businesses and their leaders to carefully weigh the risks and the benefits of various AI options.\n\nCFOs and CIOs in particular are responsible for working together to ensure the company is aligned with the right projects, Melochna said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, you have this pressure to invest to avoid falling behind competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you need to be cautious to ensure you\u2019re investing in the right thing.\u201d",

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings.

The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an American cloud-based CRM company. The company operates the Customer 360 platform which offers sales, service, marketing, commerce, integration, AI, analytics, collaboration, automation, and other services. Lately, the company\u2019s AI-powered platform called Agentforce has gained traction.\n\nOn January 17, TD Cowen upgraded CRM to Buy from hold with a price target of $400, up from $380. The analyst believes that the buzz around the company\u2019s AI tool has cooled since its launch and it is a good opportunity to buy the stock. On January 21, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin reiterated an Overweight rating on CRM shares and set a price target of $405. The firm believes that Agentforce brings a competitive advantage to the company and it could sell more services around the AI hype. However, Bracelin expects CRM\u2019s AI agent tool will take time before it starts generating revenue until fiscal year 2027.\n\nOn January 21, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the company\u2019s CEO Marc Benioff highlighted that they closed 200 deals in Q3 FY2025 and expect to close thousands of Agentforce deals in Q4. Companies already have a lot of their data on Salesforce CRM software, allowing a smooth option to explore Agentforce to access existing information and automate the system. The AI agent holds the potential and could unlock a promising opportunity for Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) going ahead.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 6th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) confirmed the development on Tuesday, following high-level discussions between Philippine officials and Salesforce executives.\n\nTrade Secretary Cristina Roque reportedly met with Adam Evans, Salesforce's executive vice president and general manager. Their talks culminated in a commitment from the US-based customer relationship management (CRM) giant to launch operations in the Philippines, heralding a significant boost to the local tech ecosystem.\n\nThe investment by Salesforce highlights the Philippines' emergence as a prominent hub for technology and innovation, paving the way for digital transformation and the creation of countless job opportunities for Filipino talent, according to the DTI.\n\nEmpowering MSMEs and upskilling the workforce\n\nSalesforce's plans include targeted initiatives to empower MSMEs by equipping them with advanced digital tools to enhance their competitiveness. Additionally, the company is set to collaborate with leading universities and organisations to upskill the local workforce.\n\n\n\nSalesforce's decision to invest in the Philippines is seen as a testament to the country's investor-friendly policies, strong economic momentum, and skilled workforce, Roque noted, as reported by local media.\n\nDon't miss: Pertamina NRE to acquire 20% stake in PH's Citicore Renewable Energy\n\nThe DTI attributed Salesforce's investment decision to positive feedback from existing clients about the Philippines' dynamic business environment and government support for digital initiatives. While specific investment figures have yet to be disclosed, the move is seen as a vote of confidence in the country's long-term growth potential.\n\nThis also marks a milestone for Salesforce, further solidifying its position as the global leader in the CRM market, a status consistently recognised by industry experts such as the International Data Corporation (IDC). The company's leadership in cloud-based solutions and its commitment to innovation have established it as a cornerstone of digital transformation for businesses worldwide.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe DTI has extended an invitation to Salesforce to explore the establishment of a shared service facility in the Philippines, with a focus on advancing AI training initiatives. Such a partnership would further solidify the country's role in the regional tech landscape.\n\nFounded in 1999 by Marc Benioff and initially backed by Oracle expertise, Salesforce has since grown into a technology powerhouse. Its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 cemented its status among the world's most influential corporations.\n\nWith Salesforce's entry into the Philippine market, the stage is set for accelerated innovation, economic growth, and an upskilled workforce ready to compete on the global stage.\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGoogle PH says it sees 'amazing growth' in Philippine economy\n\nPhilippine minister files resolution to suspend Cebu Pacific Air over 'unsatisfactory service'\n\nPhilippine bank GoTyme hands creative and CRM mandates to Iris Singapore",

You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often-reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance that consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom-line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nStockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.",

            "content": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has suggested the company may freeze hiring for software engineers amid the firm's growing success with AI agents.\n\nProductivity gains delivered by AI agents internally at Salesforce mean the firm may not need to onboard new staff in this area of the business, Benioff told \u2018The Logan Bartlett Show\u2019 podcast.\n\n\u201cIn engineering this year at Salesforce, we're seriously debating - maybe we aren't going to hire anybody this year,\u201d Benioff said.\n\n\u201cWe have seen such incredible productivity gains because of the agents that work side by side with our engineers,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked about global labor shortages and the economic outlook for the agents, Benioff said that this is a big moment for customers to restructure and ramp up the adoption of AI agents.\n\n\u201cWe are going through a global labor shortage where we see all these declining birth rates. We understand that it is harder to hire - especially people here right in the United States - in sales and service,\u201d Benioff said.\n\nAI agents will give businesses the ability to do more, he added, providing the example of engineering.\n\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Sign up today and you will receive a free copy of our Focus Report 2025 - the leading guidance on AI, cybersecurity and other IT challenges as per 700+ senior executives Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\u201cWe can all agree that software engineering has become a lot more productive in the last two years with basically these new models,\u201d Benioff said.\n\n\u201cThere's no question the world is changing, when it gets down to labor and delivering the next generation of labor,\u201d he added.\n\nSoftware engineering could be in for a rough ride\n\nBenioff isn\u2019t the first big tech CEO to hint at pausing hiring for roles in software engineering due to AI. Others have gone so far as to suggest roles could be lost to the technology in years to come.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently predicted a similar trend at the social media giant. Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast earlier this month, Zuckerberg said AI could be doing the work of mid-level engineers in 2025 .\n\nWhile it will be an expensive change in the short term, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s a move that he thinks will pay dividends in the long run through efficiency gains.\n\nSalesforce was among the first big tech companies to jump on the agentic AI bandwagon last year, and Benioff has been vocal about the potential of AI agents for enterprises, hailing this as essentially the next step in the evolutionary path of AI.\n\nAt the company's Dreamforce conference in September 2024, Salesforce unveiled its Agentforce service, for example, with the company specifically highlighting the use of AI agents in customer service roles.\n\nAgents do represent a step change in the AI \u2018boom\u2019. While AI assistants such as Microsoft\u2019s Copilot tool sit adjacent to the human worker to provide support, agents are fully autonomous and can carry out tasks on behalf of the worker.\n\nBut does this mean software engineers should start looking at potential career changes? Not exactly. Research suggests that while AI will have a transformative effect on the profession, this won\u2019t necessarily equate to widespread job losses.\n\nIn a study by Gartner last year, around 80% of the software engineering workforce could be forced to upskill by 2027 to compensate for the changing demands placed on them by AI tools and agents.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean their jobs will be rendered obsolete, but more the fact that the profession itself will be transformed due to the influx AI, with the consultancy predicting the technology to play an increasingly larger role in daily tasks.\n\nRELATED WHITEPAPER Manage growing data volumes efficiently\n\nThe study noted that, in the short term, AI tools have delivered modest productivity increases by supporting them in their daily workflow.\n\nAn influx of AI agents in software engineering will likely create the biggest upheaval, however. Gartner noted that the integration of agentic AI within teams will enable the full automation of tasks and result in the emergence of \u2018AI-native software engineering\u2019 where most code is AI-generated.",

            "content": "London CNN \u2014\n\nToday\u2019s chief executives are the last generation to manage all-human workforces as companies increasingly adopt artificial intelligence, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said Thursday.\n\n\u201cFrom this point forward\u2026 we will be managing not only human workers but also digital workers,\u201d he said on a panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBenioff provided a recent example from his own business.\n\nHe said Salesforce\u2019s software had been used to help run the annual conference in Davos for more than a decade. But this year, for the first time, the San Francisco-based tech giant incorporated an \u201cAI agent\u201d into its app for Davos attendees to help them decide which panels to attend.\n\nEchoing comments he made at last year\u2019s meeting , about AI augmenting \u2014 but not replacing \u2014 human workers, Benioff also said Thursday that AI and humans can work together \u201cto create a higher level of success.\u201d\n\n\u201cAI is kind of becoming our partner to help us to run our lives, run our businesses, to help us to deliver a new level of productivity,\u201d he added, suggesting that those productivity gains could be achieved without a larger \u201chuman workforce.\u201d\n\nWorries have grown in recent years over AI\u2019s potential to replace human workers. The release of ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot powered by generative AI, in late 2022 demonstrated the power of the technology to produce detailed, human-like responses to users\u2019 prompts \u2014 for example, in the form of essays and articles \u2014 in a matter of seconds.\n\nSpeaking alongside Benioff, Dario Amodei, the CEO and co-founder of AI juggernaut Anthropic, said: \u201cMy guess is that by 2026 or 2027 we will have AI systems that are broadly better than almost all humans at almost all things.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a World Economic Forum survey showed that 41% of employers globally intend to downsize their workforce by 2030 as AI automates certain tasks. According to the poll, published in the Future of Jobs Report, 77% are also planning to reskill and upskill their existing workers between 2025-2030 so they work better alongside AI.\n\nStriking an optimistic note, the report said the primary impact of technologies such as generative AI on jobs might lie in their potential for \u201caugmenting\u201d human skills through \u201chuman-machine collaboration,\u201d rather than in outright replacement, \u201cparticularly given the continued importance of human-centered skills.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Benioff also commented on the $500 billion AI infrastructure project announced in the United States this week, saying it signaled only the start of \u201ctrillions\u201d more in investment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just seeing the very beginning of what will be one of the biggest investment levels in the history of the world,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest in Davos. \u201cBecause this is an opportunity for us to completely transform how we do everything.\u201d",

            "content": "Marc Benioff\n\nAI runs through the thematic DNA of this year\u2019s World Economic Forum gathering in Davos as it inevitably would, with discussions ranging from long term \u2018blue sky thinking\u2019 to the more immediately practical.\n\nOne of the more unexpected examples of the latter came from the moderator of a panel session who said that his Davos app had told him it was time to go home after being out and about and having several drinks the night before.\n\nThank Salesforce for that bossy app, it seems. Salesforce has run information management for Davos for over a decade, as CEO Marc Benioff pointed out:\n\nSo when you're on the Davos app, and you're going through all the lists of all the sessions and who's attending and all that, and you figure out how to make the most productive use of your week, you're using all this Salesforce technology.\n\nBut this year there\u2019s an added element in the mix and anyone who\u2019s observed Salesforce\u2019s pivot to agentic AI in recent months will not be surprised to learn what it is. Benioff explained:\n\nThis is the first Davos that you'll notice that right on the Davos app, there is an agent, and this AI agent is there to help you, to be your guide, to be your partner in making sure that you're able to have a great Davos. What it does is it goes back and it looks at every session you've ever attended, because all of that is recorded as you badge through the conference, and every session that is available, and everybody that's here, and then that agent can say, 'Yes, this is the thing you need to do in Davos to be really successful right now'. It uses the best Large Language Models, but also the best machine learning, the best intelligence. It delivers the highest accurate result. It's delivering a 95% result for Davos attendees because it has access to so much data that has been collected here over so many years. It's a great example of very practical AI.\n\nBenioff added that at Davos this year he\u2019d encountered others making similarly frontline use of agent tech, citing Dave McKay, the CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada:\n\nHe\u2019s got this incredible wealth management business that he runs, and he's a leader in this area, and they've built this agentic layer. Agentic layer means he's built agents around his business that augment his workforce. So in addition to his sales workers and his service workers and his support workers, he uses an agent force, just like we're using here to run\n\nAll of which leads him to another conclusion:\n\nWe're going to be the last CEOs who are only going to be managing humans as our workforce. From this point forward, we will be managing not only human workers, but also digital workers\u2026That's just fascinating to me, that we are at that moment that we're going to say, 'Yeah, this is when humans and AI are working together to create a higher level of success'.\n\nVirtual collaborators\n\nThat\u2019s a scenario that resonates with Dario Amodei, CEO at AI firm Anthropic, which is currently working on what he pitched as a \u201cvirtual collaborator\u201d. This is something that might not be \u201csmarter than a Nobel Prize winner\u201d but:\n\n[It will be] capable of doing relatively high-end tasks in the workplace, that can open up Google Docs, that can use Slack, that can interact with its co-workers to perform tasks over hours to days, and that you only have to check in with every once in a while, like a manager would check in with an employee. We're trying to make that real.\n\nAs to how long this will take, Amodei argued:\n\nThe thing that most distinguishes AI from previous technological revolutions is the speed at which is happening. I've been in the field for for 10 years. I've been watching that curve for 10 years, and me and my co founders at Anthropic were among the first to document what we call the scaling laws, which is the the observation that as you pour more compute into these models, with small changes in the algorithms according to which they're developed, they improve very fast on cognitive abilities. And so, exponentials kind of start to flow, and very quickly pick up speed. I've become, probably in the last three to six months, more confident that we really are heading towards AI systems that are better than almost all humans at almost all tasks.\n\nThere are bumps in the road ahead still to overcome, of course, he acknowledged:\n\nI think what is going to hold us back most in positive applications is the physical world and limitations on human institutions. So I wrote an essay about powerful AI [and] if this really does happen, what will we be limited by? The term I used was marginal returns to intelligence. Economists talk about the marginal returns to capital, to labor, to land. A way we're not used to thinking about things is, what if we have millions of copies? I called it a country of geniuses in a data center, of agents that are better than humans at everything? What limits [are there?] Do we just immediately solve all of the world's problems? I don't think that happens. For example, self-driving cars are difficult. So I think we're going to be limited by the physical world, by deployment cycles, and often by laws.\n\nThat brings in Uber to the debate with CEO Dara Khosrowshahi focusing on how AI will have an impact on the physical world:\n\nUltimately, the future of transportation is going to be autonomous. It'll be electric, and eventually will be shared as well. Congestion on the streets is something that can can be controlled,. Instead of having a human driver, you'll have a robot driver. We're working with [Alphabet] and Waymo and a number of other companies in developing this technology and really bringing it to market so that everybody can experience it.\n\nAnd experience it safely, he added:\n\nThe ultimate promise of AI is literally to save lives, right? This year, there will be a million fatalities on the road as a result of human error. This digital driver is going to have thousands of lifetimes of driving to train [it]. It is not going to be distracted by texting, by watching TikTok, whatever. It will be a driver that's completely focused on the road. It won't have two eyes, it\u2019ll have 10 eyes and many different sensor types. So by definition, over a period of time, this driver is going to get better and better and better, and it will start to be more of a reality in our network. Our view is, we're working with a number of partners to bring this technology to market in a safe and responsible way. It's not going to get there tomorrow, and there will be a very long hybrid road where sometimes you're going to get a human driver, sometimes you'll get an AI driver or robot driver. But fast forward 15 or 20, years from now, the impact of AI in the physical world, and the impact in terms of saving lives and avoiding fatalities is going to be enormous.\n\nMy take\n\nAs we keep saying, practical examples of AI in action in the real world are critical at this juncture in the current hype cycle. The driverless, robocars future is all good and well, but it\u2019s things like the Davos app that people can \u2018touch\u2019 today that start to make sense of the potential of this most disruptive of technology revolutions.",

This includes streamlining citizen inquiries and automating complex processes, such as government aid requests.\n\nThe government is already actively pursuing several AI-driven projects. For instance, the use of generative AI in the chatbot Tina and the integration of AI to automatically interpret document content and automate repetitive tasks through robotic process automation are notable examples, as highlighted by Dar\u00edo Genua, secretary of innovation, science and technology, in a December interview with BNamericas.\n\nFurthermore, the national office of information technologies is developing a platform based on generative AI to optimize the management of exemption notes and technical opinions.\n\n\"This widespread adoption of AI in public services lays the foundation for Argentina to establish itself as a global leader in AI and maintain a competitive edge in this rapidly evolving sector,\" Salesforce said in a release.",

            "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Salesforce, Inc. ( ). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 15% on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Salesforce\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nIs Salesforce Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $453.52, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Salesforce\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Salesforce?\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 58% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Salesforce. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap.

Its revenue growth has slowed as the broader software sector matures and digests the COVID-19-induced surge in growth.

Now, one Wall Street analyst seems to be taking notice.\n\nTD Cowen upgrades Salesforce to a buy\n\nTD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood upgraded Salesforce from a hold to buy, according to media reports, and lifted his price target from $380 to $400. The investment firm noted the recent pullback in the stock, setting up a buying opportunity for Salesforce. It's noticed high levels of interest in Agentforce among Salesforce's customer base and sees other opportunities for growth.\n\nIs Salesforce a buy?\n\nSalesforce's guidance for the fourth quarter didn't indicate a bump from Agentforce, as the company forecast 7%-9% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. However, management is clearly bullish on the potential of Agentforce, which it describes as a \"complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce platform.\" CEO Mark Benioff also said products like Agentforce would revolutionize global labor and reshape how industries operate and scale.\n\nWith its leadership in CRM, reasonable valuation, and potential breakthrough in agentic AI, Salesforce looks like a smart buy.",

            "content": "Retired Salesforce executive and Leavey grad Joe Allanson on why a focus on ESG makes sense \u2013 both for social impact and for business success.\n\nIn the last few years of his career, Joe Allanson lived by ambitious words: \u201cAccountants are going to save the planet.\u201d\n\nIn the last few years of his career, Joe Allanson lived by ambitious words: \u201cAccountants are going to save the planet.\u201d\n\nThat sentence was equal parts job description, guiding philosophy and elevator pitch for Allanson\u2019s work as EVP of finance, ESG for Salesforce. Throughout his 20-plus years at the company before retiring in 2024, he viewed his world of accounting and finance as much deeper than bookkeeping \u2014 much in the same way he sees others rethinking the very purpose of business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation that's been happening at Leavey and other business schools around the nation in the past several years, and at businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the question, \u2018What is the purpose of a corporation?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe way Salesforce answers that question made the company an ideal fit for Allanson, a 1985 graduate of the Leavey School of Business and the 2024 Alumnus of the Year Award winner at the school\u2019s Accounting Awards Banquet.\n\n\u201cOf course the company was founded with the notion that certainly shareholders and investors are important, but so too is our community, our employees, our partners, the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for change, and the power of a company is far greater in what it can do than an individual.\u201d\n\nA New Framework\n\nESG is the latest framework for such a philosophy, following broader movements such as corporate social responsibility in earlier decades. Short for environmental, social and governance, ESG essentially is a set of investment principles focused on environmental and social issues and corporate governance. Interest in ESG has been driven largely by socially-minded investors in recent years.\n\nMore and more of Salesforce\u2019s \u201ctier one\u201d customers have been asking him about ESG, Allanson says. In turn, he would share learning from the company\u2019s ESG reporting \u2014 integrated into its annual report \u2014 plus its longstanding \u201c1-1-1\u201d model. Under the 1-1-1 model, the company dedicates 1 percent of its equity, products and employee time to community and charitable activities.\n\n\u201cThis model has now been replicated by about 20,000 companies,\u201d Allanson says. To him, the value of the model is that its impact scales as a company grows. For example, Salesforce had just under 400 employees when he joined. Now it has more than 73,0000. The 1 percent policy stayed the same, but growth led to a massive increase in employee time dedicated to their communities.\n\nAllanson\u2019s own community work has focused on education. He serves on the advisory boards of Leavey\u2019s accounting program, as well as those at the University of Southern California and the USC Marshall School of Business. He also is a member of the board of trustees for the University of San Francisco, a fellow Jesuit institution.\n\nWhen his work took him to the Salesforce offices around the globe, he always added an item to the travel agenda: meeting the top local volunteers. He wanted to know what community causes most engaged fellow employees. \u201cWe got the opportunity to learn about nonprofits that our employees were so invested in, and I got exposed to more organizations than I can count.\u201d\n\nStill, Allanson knows that many companies view ESG as a potential challenge. Addressing environmental impact in particular can seem a more daunting prospect.\n\n\u201cI try to provide them a nonbiased point of view,\u201d he says. \u201cI really try to provide a point of view from the lens of a business executive. This is good for business. I want to get closer to my customers. I want to get closer to my investors. They\u2019re interested in this. And climate action, for example, represents the world\u2019s largest transformation, with major opportunities for wealth and job creation.\u201d\n\nThe Need for Standards\n\nAllanson also acknowledges the challenges facing ESG practitioners and investors. One is the lack of uniform reporting standards \u2014 or reporting at all in some cases. Salesforce and many other companies include ESG-related data, covering everything from environmental impact to community volunteerism and contributions, in their annual reports. But that\u2019s not true universally.\n\nEven when there is reporting, \u201cthe results are not always comparable,\u201d Allanson says, \u201cwhether it's across industries or across companies in the same industry. The information is not consistently prepared from year to year. It\u2019s not always timely. The social responsibility reporting often comes out several months after a company's fiscal year end, and the information is not reliable.\u201d\n\nAllanson sees rapid efforts to close these gaps and notes that ESG is a young field and framework. In contrast, financial data is fairly uniform across reports because finance and accounting are long-established fields with agreed-upon standards.\n\n\u201cWhether it's investors or policymakers or customers or anyone, they're expecting the same kind of high-grade investor-quality information that we typically find with financial accounting and reporting,\u201d Allanson says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to sort this out.\u201d\n\nPerception and politics present another challenge. Depending where one is in the country or in the political sphere, ESG may be a dirty word. When travelling in certain parts of the country, Allanson would even leave the \u201cESG\u201d out of his job title when he introduced himself, to avoid animosity.\n\nThe key is to take the long view of such work, he says. \u201cYou have to set policies internally that can withstand change. We're building companies to last for decades, not for the just into the next political cycle. So I start off with that point of view. At the end of the day, this is going to be driven by investors, who continue to demand information like this.\u201d",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nIvan Tsarynny, Feroot Security CEO, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 to discuss his Congressional testimony about TikTok. According to Tsarynny, China is collecting information on Americans through applications such as TikTok to train AI. This training is being done in hopes of helping them win the AI race. He said that TikTok is present in a lot of websites and places where it can obtain information on Americans who don\u2019t even use the app. He also said that it is required under Chinese law to disclose data when requested and that companies that are required to share the information may also need to keep it confidential so we may not even know that the data was shared with the CCP.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar\n\nThis is probably why the Supreme Court said that the application needs to be divested considering that it may be collecting information on Americans and diverting it to China. When asked whether Tiktok is the only application that is suspected of doing so, he said that Tiktok is probably the biggest application, but not the only one. Tsarynny also said that the kind of information being collected includes everything you do on the app and anything it might be able to access on the phone. Another area is data collection on websites where tracking pixels collect your details. While not easy or commonly done, users can use privacy browser extensions or tools to block pixel trackers and other tracking tools.\n\nBanned for a short period over data security concerns, TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app\u2019s access in the U.S. after he returns to power, which is today, January 20th. In response, TikTok thanked Trump for \u201cproviding the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive\u201d. This gratitude comes at a tense moment in US-China relations.\n\nAmidst all these events, U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI also submitted a bid on Saturday, January 18, to TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance. The bid suggested Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., creating a new entity by combining the merged company with New Capital Partners. The company believes that its bid may be successful since the proposal is a merger rather than a sale.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The firm said that shares of the company went up at the end of 2024 due to the buzz around Salesforce\u2019s AI tool Agentforce. However, now that they have pulled back, it is a good opportunity to buy them. The firm also revealed that its IT Survey came back positive for Salesforce, and that \u201crecent checks\u201d regarding the interest around Agentforce have also been \u201chighly constructive\u201d. The firm also sees \u201cseveral new growth levers emerging\u201d for Salesforce for 2025 and 2026.\n\n\u201cWe upgrade CRM from Hold to Buy and raise our PT to $400. Following a strong end of \u201924 rally on the heels of Agentforce excitement, shares have pulled back, creating a compelling entry point\u201d.\n\nOverall, CRM ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "content": "Salesforce, Inc. is a cloud-based SaaS company founded by former Oracle exec Marc Benioff in 1999. Mr. Benioff founded the company with 3 partners who will remain active in management until nearly 2020. Larry Elison, a co-founder of Oracle, is a noteworthy early investor who helped propel the company to its success. The company is a leader in CRM or customer relationship management and is largely responsible for the proliferation of digitized CRM solutions that is ongoing today.\n\nThe company was not immune to the DotCom bubble bursting and had to cut back its workforce and plans but the event is nothing but a blip on the radar now. Even then, the company could sustain a hyper-growth rate that saw revenue skyrocket from $0 in 1999 to over $100 million by the end of 2003. The company held its IPO in 2004 and raised $110 million. The hypergrowth continued until 2014 driven by the growing recognition among C-suite executives that digital CRM was the path to accelerated revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company made multiple small acquisitions in the period leading up to 2014, but it was then that investment in other technology accelerated. Total spending in 2016 topped $5 billion and led to the acquisition of Slack in 2020. The company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, instantly becoming the largest technology company in the index. The Slack acquisition came under some criticism due to the elevated cost the company paid. The track record of growth that includes sustained sequential growth through the end of 2022 put an end to the criticism.\n\nToday, Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is the 1st cloud stock to reach $1 billion in revenue, hitting that target in 2009. It is the world\u2019s largest enterprise-level software provider and the 61st-largest company by market cap. In regards to US businesses, it is ranked 136th on the Forbes Fortune 500 list for 2022 when revenue topped $7.7 billion.\n\nThe company offers its services via the Customer 360 platform. The platform is designed to deliver connected experiences for a business's customers in a way that delivers sales. Revenue is generated in 2 channels that include Sales and Service. The Sales offering stores data, monitors leads and tracks traffic progression through the sales funnel. It can forecast and provide other analytics as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices.\n\nThe Service segment allows companies to provide personalized services and support at scale. Scale is the fundamental quality that drives Salesfoce.com\u2019s success because it has been able to scale and aid its clients when they scale. Among Service\u2019s many offerings is the ability to create apps with a drag-and-drop builder tool. This segment also includes Slack which permits easy communication among business associates.\n\nSalesforce.com Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Salesforce.com. It is in business to invest in start-up and early growth phase businesses and has invested more than $5 billion since 2009.",

It's the latest in a string of bullish assessments for Salesforce as analysts start to raise their forecasts.\n\nThe rise in targets in recent days, however, pushes the stock toward $360 after UBS Group raised its target on Salesforce and maintained a \"neutral\" rating, and Needham & Company raised the price target to $400 and afforded a \"buy\" rating. BMO Capital Markets increased its target to $425 and kept the rating at 'outperform', while Loop Capital set its target at $360 and put a 'hold' rating on the stock. Wells Fargo's rating reiterated a \"neutral,\" and the price target was raised to $330.\n\nSalesforce's consensus rating is 'Moderate Buy,' with a consensus price target of $377.6; at least some caution in the market, but still one of optimism.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

Central to the campaign is Agentforce, a pivotal AI-powered component within its suite that optimizes workflows and boosts productivity, resonating with retail businesses, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and non-profits, reveals the Global Ads Platform of GlobalData.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cSalesforce\u2019s advertisements effectively highlight the transformative power of AI, emphasizing its practical benefits across various industries. The ads infer that AI integration with Salesforce solutions can significantly enhance personalized customer experiences, streamline recruitment, and improve overall customer service. By addressing key challenges like optimizing workflows, cutting costs, and increasing efficiency, the campaign reinforces Salesforce\u2019s customer-centric focus.\u201d\n\nBelow are the key focus areas of Salesforce\u2019s advertisements, revealed by GlobalData\u2019s Global Ads Platform:\n\nAI-driven customer experience enhancement: Multiple advertisements highlight Salesforce\u2019s AI capabilities in personalizing customer experiences. This includes using AI to provide tailored product recommendations in retail, enhancing the efficiency of recruitment processes, and improving customer service interactions through AI-powered agents. The focus is consistently on creating more satisfying and efficient experiences for customers.\n\nStreamlined business operations: Several ads focus on increasing efficiency and optimizing workflows through AI-powered tools. This includes faster donation allocation and shipping for non-profits, improving case resolution rates for customer service, and automating time-consuming tasks for recruiters. The overall message emphasizes the timesaving and productivity-enhancing aspects of Salesforce\u2019s solutions.\n\nEmpowering employees: Ads demonstrate how Salesforce\u2019s AI tools empower employees by automating tasks, freeing up time for more meaningful work. This is exemplified in the healthcare sector, where AI aids in patient care, and in education, it supports counselors in providing more personalized guidance. The campaign stresses improved employee morale and satisfaction through efficient workflows.\n\nData-driven decision making: The campaign demonstrates how Salesforce uses data and AI to inform decision-making, driving improved outcomes. This includes personalized product recommendations based on customer preferences, improved patient care through data-driven insights, and more effective allocation of resources for non-profits. The ads emphasize the use of data and AI for positive results across various sectors.\n\nMajumder concludes: \u201cThe ads not only demonstrate the tangible benefits of AI but also emphasize its role in creating more meaningful, data-driven outcomes for businesses and their customers.\u201d",

Last week, the executive claimed Microsoft had disappointed everyone based on how it has handled AI, further indicating:\n\n\"And today, when we look at Copilot and what they've done. They've repackaged OpenAI and dropped it into Excel.\"\n\nMicrosoft has seemingly clapped back at Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's comments downplaying its AI efforts. Marc Benioff recently highlighted a section from a post by Market Watch touting Salesforce's success in the AI landscape with agents:\n\n\"While Microsoft\u2019s Copilot has become the standard-bearer for the first generation of generative AI software, Salesforce Inc. has beaten Microsoft to market on agents. Agentforce 2.0 is rolling out now, and Chief Executive Marc Benioff has been doing the media rounds promising that it is a multitrillion-dollar market.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft vs. Salesforce on social media\n\n\u201cWhile Microsoft Copilot has become the standard-bearer for the first generation of generative-AI software, Salesforce has beaten Microsoft to market on agents.\u201d \ud83e\udd16https://t.co/ARe7RKFnuO Listen to the MarketWatch podcast: https://t.co/Lojn3iAQC0January 17, 2025\n\nThe post also analyzed AI trends and the impact of agents on stocks and the market in general. Charles Lamanna, Microsoft CVP of Business & Industry Copilot and former Metrics Hub founder responded to Benioff's post on X, indicating:\n\n\"We are all excited about agents! And Microsoft has been at it for a while. We launched autonomous agents back in May 2024, and 100,000 organizations had used Copilot Studio to create agents by October 2024.

He added that customers barely use the tool, \"and that's when they don't have a ChatGPT license or something like that in front of them.\"\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

However, Benioff claimed Microsoft's Copilot agents illustrated panic mode, majorly due to the stiff competition in the category.\n\nMicrosoft rebranding Copilot as \u2018agents\u2019? That\u2019s panic mode. Let\u2019s be real\u2014Copilot\u2019s a flop because Microsoft lacks the data, metadata, and enterprise security models to create real corporate intelligence. That is why Copilot is inaccurate, spills corporate data, and forces customers to build their own LLMs. Clippy 2.0, anyone? Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff\n\nTo that end, organizations are quickly hopping onto the AI agents bandwagon with plans to integrate the sophisticated systems into their workflows. For instance, Meta CEO Zuckerberg indicated his vision for the company with mid-level AI engineers taking over software engineering jobs in 2025. The same is also true for Salesforce. CEO Marc Benioff says the company is seriously debating hiring software engineers in 2025.",

(NYSE: CRM), a leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, has caught the attention of analysts following a recent pullback from its all-time high of $369 in December 2024.\n\nThis dip, attributed to broader market trends after a strong rally surrounding its AI platform, Agentforce, is seen as an attractive entry point for investors, according to TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood.\n\nSalesforce one-month price chart. Source: Google Finance\n\nAs of the market close on January 17, Salesforce shares were trading at $324.56, reflecting a 12.20% decline from its December peak and a 5% loss over the past month.\n\nTD Cowen sees opportunity amid pullback\n\nTD Cowen recently upgraded Salesforce stock to \u2018Buy\u2019 from \u2018Hold,\u2019 with analyst Derrick Wood setting a $400 price target.\n\nThe analyst pointed to the company\u2019s sharp year-end rally fueled by excitement surrounding its AI platform, Agentforce. Following this momentum, the recent pullback creates what Wood described as a \u2018compelling entry point.\u2019\n\nWood noted that Salesforce\u2019s IT survey results screened highly favorable, with strong market interest in Agentforce, a customizable AI tool for businesses.\n\nThe firm acknowledged that while Agentforce\u2019s revenue contribution in 2025 will likely be minimal, its impact on remaining performance obligations (CRPO) will become more pronounced in the second half of the year, laying the groundwork for revenue acceleration in 2026.\n\n\u201cIn turn, our IT survey screened favorable for CRM, our recent checks have been highly constructive on interest levels of Agentforce, and we see several new growth levers emerging in the model for CY25/CY26. \u2013 the analyst noted\n\nAdditional growth drivers include SKU upgrades, a robust renewal pipeline, and inorganic expansion initiatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud continues to expand, serving 25% of Fortune 100 companies, including IBM (NYSE: IBM), and playing a central role in the company\u2019s broader AI strategy.\n\nBroad support from Wall Street\n\nBank of America analyst Bradley Sills shares a similarly bullish outlook, assigning a price target of $440 and highlighting Salesforce\u2019s leadership in AI-driven CRM solutions as a key advantage, recognizing it as a \u2018top pick\u2019 for 2025.\n\nNeedham & Co. also named Salesforce a \u2018top pick\u2019 for 2025, reiterating a $400 price target and citing CEO Marc Benioff\u2019s focus on AI and the growing adoption of Agentforce.\n\nAdditionally, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives also views Salesforce as a key player in the rapidly growing AI space, which he predicts will see significant expansion in 2025.\n\nIn the third quarter of last year, Salesforce reported closing 200 paid deals for Agentforce and confirmed surpassing 1,000 paid deals for the platform by December 2024.\n\nAs Agentforce and Data Cloud gain traction, the company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value and capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered CRM solutions.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"",

            "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.",

            "content": "These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) share price is up 78% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Also positive is the 16% share price rise over the last year.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Salesforce achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 46% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 52.33.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings Per Share Growth January 18th 2025\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Salesforce's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nSalesforce shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 12% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can click here to see who has been buying shares - and the price they paid.\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Growth Stocks to Buy for the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nKevin Mahn, President & CIO at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, recently appeared on CNBC on January 6 to discuss the current market momentum and emphasize the need for investors to be selective in 2025 to find growth opportunities. He highlighted that while the MAG7 have led the market recently, their leadership may not continue. Mahn referenced historical data, noting that since 1950, there have been nine instances where the market rallied by 20% or more, with the market rising in eight of those cases. However, he pointed out that gains in the following year averaged only 3.6%, indicating a need for careful selection. He also acknowledged recent market trends, including a decline in the S&P 500\u2019s performance and a potential shift in investor sentiment following events like the Santa Claus Rally.\n\nHe predicted a path of lower interest rates, expecting 50 basis points of cuts this year instead of the previously anticipated 100 basis points. Mahn suggested that this environment would create favorable conditions for stocks and bonds but urged investors to diversify beyond mega-cap tech stocks into sectors like biotech and aerospace. Earlier on January 3 as well, Mahn noted that after two consecutive years of gains, a third year of strong performance appears unlikely. He remarked that it seems the Grinch got in the way of the Santa Claus rally this year.\n\nHe also addressed concerns from investors tempted to time the market or sell their holdings. He warned against trying to time the market, describing it as often futile. Instead, he advocated for rebalancing portfolios to align with long-term goals and risk tolerance. He suggested that the economic landscape is changing, with lower interest rates and stagnant economic growth expected moving forward. Mahn advised investors to take profits from sectors that previously led the market and consider reallocating those funds into different areas poised for future growth. He highlighted biotech as a promising sector, noting bipartisan agreement on the need to lower drug prices. This shift could lead large-cap pharmaceutical companies to seek new revenue sources, making smaller biotech firms attractive.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. We then selected the stocks with high 5-year revenue growth and high analysts\u2019 upside potential. From those we picked 15 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 18.60%\n\nUpside Potential as of January 15: 28.41%\n\nSalesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based software provider that specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. Its core offerings include Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, which integrate advanced AI capabilities. Its Data Cloud is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing AI trend, as businesses increasingly adopt AI-driven CRM strategies.\n\nSalesforce Data Cloud is particularly important for AI transformations and is featured in 8 of the top 10 deals in FQ3 2025. 25% of Fortune 100 are Data Cloud customers, including IBM. The company uses IBM\u2019s reach to boost Data Cloud adoption. Data Cloud has 1.9 trillion weekly AI transactions and 83.2 billion weekly workflows.\n\nConstellation Research\u2019s Ray Wang is of the opinion that software companies that use AI to serve customers who lack the expertise to develop their own AI solutions are rather important. However, analyst Gil Luria warns of modest near-term AI revenue impact due to pricing concerns and the company\u2019s scale. Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) recently raised its FQ4 2025 revenue guidance to $9.9-$10.10 billion, representing a growth of nearly 8%.\n\nThe company\u2019s growing AI integration is a key long-term driver. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn a tough backdrop for software companies, shares of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) cratered after the company reported quarterly results that surprised to the downside due to a tougher spending environment. The company reported revenue growth that missed on expectations, while also lowering its outlook for revenue growth, due to a more measured buying environment from its customers. Salesforce experienced elongated sales cycles, deal compression and elevated budget scrutiny, which pushed some deals to following quarters. Taking a step back, the company\u2019s evolving AI story should not be overlooked as it is integrated across the company\u2019s sprawling suite of cloud and digital assets.\u201d\n\nOverall CRM ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy for the next 5 years. As we acknowledge the growth potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares\n\nCode retrieval has become essential for developers in modern software development, enabling efficient access to relevant code snippets and documentation. Unlike traditional text retrieval, which effectively handles natural language queries, code retrieval must address unique challenges, such as programming languages\u2019 structural variations, dependencies, and contextual relevance. With tools like GitHub Copilot gaining popularity, advanced code retrieval systems are increasingly vital for enhancing productivity and reducing errors.\n\nExisting retrieval models often struggle to capture programming-specific nuances like syntax, control flow, and variable dependencies. These limitations hinder problem-solving in code summarization, debugging, and translation between languages. While text retrieval models have seen significant advancements, they fail to meet the specific requirements of code retrieval, highlighting the demand for specialized models that improve accuracy and efficiency across diverse programming tasks. Models like CodeBERT, CodeGPT, and UniXcoder have addressed aspects of code retrieval using pre-trained architectures. Still, they are limited in scalability and versatility due to their smaller sizes and task-specific focus. Although Voyage-Code introduced large-scale capabilities, its closed-source nature restricts broader adoption. This highlights the critical need for an open-source, scalable code retrieval system to generalize across multiple tasks.\n\nResearchers at Salesforce AI Research introduced CodeXEmbed, a family of open-source embedding models specifically designed for code and text retrieval. These models, released in three sizes, SFR-Embedding-Code-400M_R, SFR-Embedding-Code-2B_R, and 7 billion parameters, address various programming languages and retrieval tasks. CodeXEmbed\u2019s innovative training pipeline integrates 12 programming languages and transforms five distinct code retrieval categories into a unified framework. By supporting diverse tasks such as text-to-code, code-to-text, and hybrid retrievals, the model expands the boundaries of what retrieval systems can achieve, offering unprecedented flexibility and performance.\n\nCodeXEmbed employs an innovative approach that transforms code-related tasks into a unified query-and-answer framework, enabling versatility across various scenarios. Text-to-code retrieval maps natural language queries to relevant code snippets, streamlining tasks like code generation and debugging. Code-to-text retrieval generates explanations and summaries of code, enhancing documentation and knowledge sharing. Hybrid retrieval integrates text and code data, effectively addressing complex queries requiring technical and descriptive insights. The model\u2019s training leverages contrastive loss to optimize query-answer alignment while reducing irrelevant data influence. Advanced techniques like low-rank adaptation and token pooling boost efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n\nIn tests, it has been evaluated across various benchmarks. On the CoIR benchmark, a comprehensive code retrieval evaluation dataset covering 10 subsets and over 2 million entries, the 7-billion parameter model achieved a performance improvement of more than 20% compared to the previous state-of-the-art Voyage-Code model. Notably, the 400-million and 2-billion parameter models also outperformed Voyage-Code, demonstrating the architecture\u2019s scalability across different sizes. Also, CodeXEmbed excelled in text retrieval tasks, with the 7-billion parameter model achieving an average score of 60 on the BEIR benchmark, a suite of 15 datasets covering diverse retrieval tasks such as question answering and fact-checking.\n\nThe models can retrieve code and enhance end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. For instance, when applied to repository-level tasks like code completion and issue resolution, the 7-billion parameter model achieved notable results on benchmarks like RepoEval and SWE-Bench-Lite. RepoEval, focusing on repository-level code completion, saw top-1 accuracy improvements when the model retrieved contextually relevant snippets. In SWE-Bench-Lite, a curated dataset for GitHub issue resolution, CodeXEmbed outperformed traditional retrieval systems.\n\nKey takeaways from the research highlight the contributions and implications of CodeXEmbed in advancing code retrieval:\n\nThe 7-billion parameter model achieved state-of-the-art performance, with over 20% improvement on the CoIR benchmark and competitive results on BEIR. It demonstrated versatility across code and text tasks. The 400-million and 2-billion parameter models offer practical alternatives for environments where computational resources are limited. The models address a broad spectrum of code-related applications by unifying 12 programming languages and five retrieval categories. Unlike closed systems such as Voyage-Code, CodeXEmbed promotes community-driven research and innovation. Integration with retrieval-augmented generation systems improves outcomes for tasks like code completion and issue resolution. Using contrastive loss and token pooling optimizes retrieval accuracy and model adaptability.\n\nIn conclusion, Salesforce\u2019s introduction of the CodeXEmbed family advances code retrieval. These models demonstrate unmatched versatility and scalability by achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CoIR benchmark and excelling in text retrieval tasks. The multilingual and multi-task unified framework, supporting 12 programming languages, positions CodeXEmbed as a pivotal tool for developers and researchers. Its open-source accessibility encourages community-driven innovation while bridging the gap between natural language and code retrieval.\n\nCheck out the Paper, 400M Model, and 2B Model.

            "content": "Silicon Valley, the epicentre of innovation, is now a bitter battleground of rising tensions and fierce rivalries among its tech leaders. Recent clashes between tech giants like Microsoft and Salesforce, Apple and Meta, as well as emerging startups like xAI and OpenAI, show a growing trend of hostility that could impact the industry in the long run.\n\nThe spite is clearly visible in the sharp critiques these tech bosses have been directing at their competitors.\n\nIn a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg took a swipe at Apple, saying that the Cupertino giant hasn\u2019t invented anything great in a while. \u201cSteve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they\u2019re just sitting on it 20 years later. So, how are they making more money as a company? They do it by squeezing people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decline in iPhone sales has provided fresh fodder for Zuckerberg. He argues that Apple compensates for this slump by imposing hefty fees\u2014often referred to as the \u201cApple tax\u201d\u2014on app developers. This practice, he believes, stifles innovation and limits opportunities for smaller companies trying to compete in the app market.\n\nAgentic Wars\n\nMeanwhile, the chiefs of Microsoft and Salesforce have been exchanging verbal volleys over agentic AI. Both companies compete for dominance in the field of autonomous AI agents, which are capable of performing tasks without human intervention.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff, in a recent podcast, slammed Microsoft Copilot. \u201cThis Copilot thing has been a huge disaster for them from a branding and validation standpoint. Customers don\u2019t look at them and don\u2019t take them seriously in AI,\u201d Benioff said.\n\nHe was responding to Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, who also, in a podcast, indirectly took a dig at Salesforce by saying that traditional SaaS companies will collapse in the AI agent era. \u201cI think the notion that business applications exist\u2014that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse in the agent era. Because if you think about it, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u2018Snowbricks\u2019 Saga\n\nIn the data warehousing domain, Databricks and Snowflake have emerged as arch-rivals. The former recently raised $10 billion in one of its largest funding rounds ever. The leading data and AI company is expected to go public this year, a move that may create unease for the AI cloud data company Snowflake.\n\nDatabricks CEO Ali Ghodsi, however, believes the company is far ahead of Snowflake and refuses to acknowledge it as a competitor. \u201cWe had a program called Snow Melt to go after Snowflake, but that\u2019s behind us now,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nAnother time, Ghodsi admitted that Snowflake no longer kept him up at night. \u201cThere was a time they would, but not anymore.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to numbers, Databricks expects to surpass a $3 billion annual revenue run rate by the end of its fourth quarter, which ends on January 31, 2025. The company reported over 60% revenue growth in the third quarter of 2024. Snowflake, on the other hand, expects a product revenue of $3.43 billion in 2025.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why he is so obsessed with Snowflake because I am not obsessed with Databricks,\u201d Michael Scarpelli, CFO at Snowflake, said in an old interview about Ghodsi.\n\nMusk and Sam\u2019s Bromance\n\nTensions also escalated significantly between tech bros Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and Elon Musk, the CEO of xAI, culminating in a series of public disputes and legal confrontations. Altman has openly criticised Musk, labelling him a \u201cbully\u201d in a recent interview.\n\nHe also expressed frustration over Musk\u2019s behaviour, noting that the latter often engaged in public quarrels with other prominent figures in the tech industry, including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.\n\nAltman believes that Musk\u2019s issues with OpenAI stem from a desire for control over the organisation. He said, \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing, I believe Elon would be happy about if he were in control of OpenAI.\u201d\n\nAttacking right-back, Musk criticised OpenAI\u2019s transition from a non-profit to a for-profit model. \u201cOpenAI was funded as an open-source non-profit but has become a closed-source, profit-maximising entity,\u201d he wrote on X.\n\nNew Step Brothers in Town\n\nSurprisingly, Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who have been engaged in fierce competition in the space sector through their companies SpaceX and Blue Origin, recently exchanged friendly messages on X, suggesting a potential thaw in their relationship.\n\nBezos celebrated the successful orbit of his New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight. Although the mission was largely successful, the booster intended for recovery was lost during re-entry.\n\n\u201cCongratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt! Jeff Bezos,\u201d Musk posted. He further lightened the mood by sharing GIFs from the movie Step Brothers, humorously suggesting that they might have just become \u201cbest friends.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Musk\u2019s SpaceX attempted to launch its Starship rocket, which unfortunately exploded shortly after takeoff. However, the Super Heavy booster successfully returned to Earth, a feat that drew praise from Bezos. \u201cKudos to you and the whole SpaceX team on the flawless booster catch! Very impressive,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nThe escalating rivalries in Silicon Valley prove that the race for innovation often comes at the cost of collaboration and unity. However, there is still room for love.",

HubSpot stock dipped a fraction to 716.66.\n\nIn late 2024, Salesforce and other software makers began shifting marketing strategy away from generative AI \"copilots\" to autonomous, goal-driven AI \"agents.\"\n\nCopilots, basically conversational chatbot interfaces, aim to improve worker productivity but rely on human prompts. Agents execute multistep tasks on behalf of users by solving problems and taking action.\n\nSalesforce introduced Agentforce at its Dreamforce customer conference in September. In December, Salesforce announced an upgraded version, Agentforce 2.0, along with its \"Digital Labor Platform.\"\n\nSalesforce Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nSalesforce stock had dipped below its 50-day moving average.\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, CRM stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B-minus. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying and E means heavy selling.

            "content": "Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software development, offering capabilities such as generating code snippets, automating unit tests, and debugging. However, these models often fall short in producing code that is not only functionally correct but also efficient in runtime. Overlooking runtime efficiency can lead to software that performs poorly, increases operational costs, and impacts user experience. This issue is particularly pronounced for less experienced developers, who may rely on AI-suggested code without fully understanding its implications. Salesforce Research addresses these challenges with PerfCodeGen, a framework that aims to improve both the correctness and performance of LLM-generated code.\n\nSalesforce AI\u2019s PerfCodeGen is a training-free framework designed to enhance the runtime efficiency of LLM-generated code. It achieves this by using execution feedback in an iterative self-refinement process. Unlike approaches requiring fine-tuning with extensive training data, PerfCodeGen employs a feedback loop that evaluates and refines code based on runtime metrics during test execution. The framework operates in two key phases: refining correctness and optimizing performance. Initially, it ensures the generated code meets functional requirements by addressing issues identified in unit tests. Once correctness is established, the framework focuses on runtime efficiency, optimizing the code by targeting and refining the most resource-intensive test cases. This iterative process results in solutions that are both correct and efficient.\n\nTechnical Insights and Benefits\n\nPerfCodeGen integrates with existing LLM workflows and begins by generating multiple candidate solutions using nucleus sampling. In the first phase, these candidates are assessed for correctness through unit tests. Feedback from failed tests is used to refine the solutions. Once functional correctness is ensured, the framework moves to the second phase, analyzing runtime metrics to identify bottlenecks. This information is then used to optimize the code further, focusing on the most time-consuming test cases.\n\nThis two-phase process increases the likelihood of producing optimally efficient programs. PerfCodeGen\u2019s methodology mirrors human debugging and optimization practices, making it both effective and intuitive. Additionally, the framework\u2019s reliance on feedback rather than retraining allows it to scale across various LLMs and application domains. It has shown consistent improvements in runtime efficiency and correctness across models such as Phi-3-mini, Llama 3, and GPT-4.\n\nPerfCodeGen has been tested on benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS, demonstrating its effectiveness:\n\nRuntime Efficiency: On HumanEval, GPT-4\u2019s optimization rate (%Opt) increased from 24.54% to 28.83% with PERFCODEGEN, with similar improvements observed across other models. Correctness Improvement: On MBPP, GPT-3.5\u2019s correctness rate (%Correct) rose from 66.38% to 73.36% with a single sample (Best@1). Outperforming Ground Truth: PERFCODEGEN enabled LLMs to generate more efficient solutions than ground truth in approximately 55% of HumanEval tasks and 67% of MBPP tasks. Scalability: Open models such as Phi-3-mini and Mixtral achieved performance comparable to closed models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n\nThese results highlight PERFCODEGEN\u2019s ability to balance correctness and runtime efficiency effectively, making it a valuable addition to LLM-driven code generation workflows.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPerfCodeGen offers a practical solution to a key limitation of current LLMs: their focus on correctness at the expense of runtime efficiency. By incorporating execution feedback into an iterative refinement process, PerfCodeGen enables the generation of code that is both correct and efficient. This approach enhances the usability of LLMs in software development, providing developers with tools to produce higher-quality code without extensive retraining. The framework\u2019s success across diverse benchmarks demonstrates its potential as a step forward in creating efficient, reliable, and accessible AI-driven programming solutions.\n\nCheck out the Paper and GitHub Page.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Salesforce, Inc. (CRM), Shell plc (SHEL) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Salesforce shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+18.1% vs. +14.1%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned it as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing compared to Microsoft Teams. Salesforce\u2019s strategy of continuous expansion of generative AI offerings will help it tap the growing opportunities in the space. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Softening IT spending amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties may hurt its growth prospects. (You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>> ) Shares of Shell have gained +14% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry\u2019s gain of +14.8%. The company remains a global leader in liquefied natural gas. The company leverages its strong LNG position, bolstered by the acquisition of BG Group, to generate consistent earnings by capitalizing on steady demand for this transitional fuel. Shell\u2019s strategic joint venture in the UK North Sea with Equinor enhances its dominance in the region while aligning with high-value objectives. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s strong free cash flow generation and sustained buybacks reinforce shareholder value. However, the underperformance of its Renewable segment is a matter of concern. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Sensitivity to oil prices and the rise of EVS are other negative factors. Therefore, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. (You can read the full research report on Shell here >>> ) Gilead shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. -13%). The company\u2019s flagship HIV therapy, Biktarvy, continues to maintain its strong growth, fueling the top line. The company\u2019s efforts to develop better HIV treatments are commendable. Recent data validate lenacapavir\u2019s potential to prevent HIV. The successful development and approval of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV will be a significant boost for Gilead, given its advantages over existing treatments. Strong quarterly results and encouraging data on lenacapavir data have helped share prices increase past year. According to the Zacks analyst sales estimates for Biktarvy indicate a CAGR of around 5.7% over the next three years. Gilead's efforts to bolster its oncology and virology franchises through internal pipeline development and collaborations are impressive as well. However, recent pipeline setbacks weigh on Gilead.

Subscribe to CalMatters today for nonprofit news in your inbox.\n\nThe current frenzy around artificial intelligence has spread like a shockwave.\n\nIt started among engineers inspired by a 2017 research paper. Next came venture capitalists eager to profit from a new boom. They were followed by government officials racing to impose regulations.\n\nNow it\u2019s labor\u2019s turn.\n\nMore than 200 trade union members and technologists gathered in Sacramento this week at a first-of-its-kind conference to discuss how AI and other tech threatens workers and to strategize for upcoming fights and possible strikes.\n\nThe Making Tech Work for Workers event was convened by University of California labor centers, unions, and worker advocates and attracted people representing dock workers, home care workers, teachers, nurses, actors, state office workers, and many other occupations.\n\nA key takeaway from the proceedings: Workers of all stripes are determined to fight \u2014 during contract negotiations and amid day to day operations \u2014 for the right to negotiate more control over how AI is deployed within companies. Union representatives detailed ways AI threatens jobs, from screenwriting to driving taxis to ringing people up as a cashier.\n\nIt takes a toll on your physical and mental health when tech tracks your every movement, said Luis, an Amazon worker from California\u2019s Inland Empire who asked CalMatters not to use his last name due to fear of retribution. He felt like he couldn\u2019t stop moving or get help from coworkers when lifting heavy objects. That led to back pain that made it hard to sleep at night, and feelings of depression and diminished self-worth.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t deal with being a robot,\u201d he said, describing why he quit. Later he returned to the job because he had no other opportunities.\n\nAmazon spokesman Steve Kelly responded that \u201cemployees are encouraged to work with intention, not speed and can take short breaks at any time to use the restroom, grab water, stretch, or step away from their screen. In addition, there\u2019s nothing unusual about using cameras to help ensure employee safety, inventory quality, or protect against theft\u2014this is common practice at nearly every major retailer in the world. Employees who have questions or concerns about any aspect of this technology or their jobs generally aren\u2019t just permitted, but encouraged on a regular basis, to bring them to their managers and they\u2019re provided several tools to support them in that process.\u201d\n\nThe gathering comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second administration and shortly before a Feb. 21 deadline to propose bills for the current session of the California Legislature. Precisely how Trump will respond to issues related to tech and workers is unclear. He has made some promises that seem favorable to big tech, like vowing to cut regulations he sees as harmful to innovation and promising to repeal an executive order signed by his predecessor that put safeguards on AI.\n\nBut he has also positioned himself as an advocate for blue-collar workers left behind by tech elites: Just last month he called automation harmful to workers. Observers have also been left baffled by where, exactly, the incoming president stands on issues like H-1B visas for foreign tech talent or how he might be swayed by high-profile adviser Elon Musk, the omnipresent tech billionaire.\n\nParticipants at the conference did not focus much on Trump. Instead, they centered discussions on how to protect workers from tech that can exploit them or automate discrimination. Union representatives unanimously urged workers to negotiate how AI and other forms of tech are used in the workplace when bargaining. Many also urged workers to engage more on tech issues by considering how to use tech for organizing or pushing for the establishment of committees where management must discuss tech with workers before implementation.\n\nThe roughly 150,000 United Food and Commercial Workers union members \u2014 folks who work at stores like Kroger and Albertsons \u2014 and the 100,000 National Nurses Union members will both face key fights related to automation this year as they bargain new contracts. The grocery workers will challenge the role of self-checkout stands while nurses contest AI tools they say can influence their duty to care and prioritize profits for health care and insurance companies over patient health.\n\nCorporations have long marketed AI to consumers and investors as a technology that will transform the world for the better. But gatherings like the conference in Sacramento show that unions are also using AI as a way to galvanize workers to organize their workplace.",

This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nJeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. Salesforce is one of the biggest tech companies in the world. Over 25 years, it's grown from a startup that was laughed at for insisting that software didn't need to be sold in boxes, to a cloud behemoth that brought in 35 billion of revenue last year. It's one of just 30 components of the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the youngest company in that elite group. And all of this can largely be credited to one person and his vision, Marc Benioff.\n\nMarc Benioff: I've never been more excited about Salesforce and our industry and what is happening. This is just an incredible time.\n\nJeremy Owens: That's Benioff. He's the co-founder of Salesforce who has served as its chief executive since the beginning. With new AI software rolling out, he agreed to sit down with me and talk about the financial effects of artificial intelligence, why he's calling his new AI software digital labor, and how he's preparing for a second Trump administration. I started by asking Benioff the question I hear the most about his company, what does Salesforce do?\n\nMarc Benioff: What do we do? We help our customers connect with their customers in incredible new ways. And our customers are 135,000 companies all over the world who make all kinds of different products, from the media industry, to the financial services industry, to the consumer product goods industry, to the government, on and on. And they all have customers. And they need tools to connect with those customers-\n\nJeremy Owens: And find data about those customers.\n\nMarc Benioff: Of course. Yeah, that has been our business, really, for 25 years. And this has been a great business, managing data. And I think there is something new and something super great happening, which is a transformation of our business that we are also now become, we already have become, a digital labor provider. So we're providing now digital labor in addition to our software.\n\nJeremy Owens: And the form of that is agents, right? We've talked about this on the podcast, that 2025 is the year of agentic AI, and you're telling there, you're saying these agents are basically little workers that a worker can send out to do what they need to do.\n\nMarc Benioff: I don't know if they're little workers or big workers. I have to ask them how big they are. But what I will say is that we are providing digital labor, and this has got to be an incredible new market. It's a trillion dollar, multi-trillion dollar market, I'm sure, because what you're seeing is that while we were helping customers, for example, manage their call centers and their contact centers and their service organizations and their field service organizations, now we're providing the service personnel that go along with it, digital ones. That is a big shift. And for a company like ours, we are really excited about this because our customers are adopting this at a rate and at a level that we've never seen with any product in our history. And we now have more than 3000 companies that have signed revenue based agreements with us to deliver agent force. Those are agreements where there's revenue associated with it. And those agreements span from probably small agreements to, we've even seen eight digit agent force agreements. So there is a really strong scale. And the other cool thing about it is of course, it brings along all our other products with it. So you need more, actually, of our sales cloud and our service cloud and our marketing cloud and our platform and all of those things as you move these things forward because we're all about humans with agents creating customer success together.\n\nJeremy Owens: And where does that land on the money scale for Salesforce? This is the big talk on Wall Street, Marc, is the monetization of AI. There are analysts who doubt that this will lead to huge new revenue for Salesforce. And I could see the argument. From the customer side, Marc, when I talk to customers of yours or other enterprise software, they don't want to see their software budgets balloon by signing on to a bunch of new AI software. So what does it look like? Are they going to cut out some of their Salesforce?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, those are not the customers that I'm talking to because what I see is something very different. And what I see is a new world of digital labor, and that we are talking to companies about enterprise software. And let's take your premise, \"Well, we don't want our enterprise software budgets to balloon.\" Okay, that's fine. Let's keep them in this box over here. Now let's talk about the second box, which is digital labor. My job, I feel, is to help open the door to really say, \"We're all going to have an agent force.\" And I think Salesforce is probably the first company to deliver this capability at scale. And our goal is to have a billion agents in place within a year. And I feel very excited that we're going to hit that goal because I think we will have tens of thousands of companies, which is maybe, call it 10 to 20% of our customer base, using this product in production and deployed, and that there is going to be a tremendous agentic layer. And I'll tell you that I also feel that it's on me to pioneer this in my own company, which is why I've built help.salesforce.com, which you can go to, log in as a Salesforce customer. It will ground, which means connect you into the AI, we know who you are, we know your products and the agent starts to take over and work with you. And that has been our own use of the agentic layer of agent force, and it has been incredible. We get about 35,000 customer inquiries every single week on help.salesforce.com. And up to this point, about 10,000 of those have to be handled by our support agents, we have about 9,000 support agents. And now, by going to agent force, we've cut that to 5,000. So now that agent force can handle, of the 36,000, 31,000 of them. And 5,000 a week are going to humans. So I actually need less support agents, and I'm rebalancing my workforce into new sales folks and new what we call sales development representatives, business development representatives and other functions because there's just less for the support organization to do because of what we've done already, what help.salesforce.com, and by delivering an agentic layer for our customers. And I think that's going to be an example for other customers to do this. And that I think is very cool.\n\nJeremy Owens: I don't know if everybody would say it's cool though, Marc.\n\nMarc Benioff: Oh, okay.\n\nJeremy Owens: When you're talking about not competing with other enterprise software, but instead creating digital labor, human labor is going to have a little bit of a problem there.\n\nMarc Benioff: Let's take that head on, but first, let's address your first question, which was, \"Hey, is the enterprise software market going to grow?\" And I'm trying to make the case that I think enterprise software market is growing because it's the enterprise software market plus the digital labor market. And that was your first question. So now you're-\n\nJeremy Owens: But the digital labor market would then be competing against a human labor market.\n\nMarc Benioff: Yeah. Yes.\n\nJeremy Owens: And there's problems there, I would say.\n\nMarc Benioff: Yes. Well, I think that this is reality, which is we are entering into a world where there is going to be an opportunity to expand the labor market. I think right now, the labor market, as you know, is very stagnant. We have declining birth rates in a lot of countries. We don't have people to hire, there aren't people to fill a lot of these positions, and it's hard to grow your business. And now, it's going to be much easier to grow your business because you're going to be able to do it with digital labor. I talked to and work with CEOs and companies all over the world, there are opportunities that are appearing for these companies to grow and to expand where they just could not before. And because we provide the digital labor, they're able to go into new territories, or speak languages, or open opportunities that before were just not available. And this is a growth opportunity in all areas.\n\nJeremy Owens: Yeah, and when we talk about digital labor versus human labor and what the financial effects of that, we've really seen it in Silicon Valley over the last couple of years. You and Google and a lot of other companies went through massive rounds of layoffs to shore up the bottom line, and now we're bringing in AI. And it's almost like I see tech setting an example for other sectors on what can be done. But I wonder if all those other sectors follow, are we still going to be a shortage of workers? Are there going to be a lot more workers out there after layoffs that are replaced by agents?\n\nMarc Benioff: I think you're mixing up two things here, and I want to try to tease them apart. So I think that that's really important. So you're right, Salesforce did a layoff exactly two years ago because what happened was there was this thing called the Pandemic. I don't know if you heard about it, but there was this thing called the pandemic. So let me catch you up. And during the pandemic, it was really a moment for the whole tech industry where revenue just accelerated. It was incredible. And all companies, Salesforce, but also even companies like Meta and others in social media, everybody went on this huge hiring surge thinking that, oh, the pandemic is going on forever. And then the pandemic ended. And when the pandemic ended, if you look at Salesforce now versus when the pandemic started, Salesforce is going to do about 38 billion this year. But when the pandemic started, it was 20 billion. So we've almost doubled our company at scale in that period of what is now five years. So that is really important to grok this idea that there was a moment where the whole industry was surging. We were all surging, our employment, and we just went a little too quickly, and we needed to make an adjustment. So let's put that issue aside for just a second because I think that what we're saying when we talk about digital labor is now, we're really saying, \"Oh yeah, look it, we're able to extend what we're able to do as a company.\" I am myself doing this, as I said. And I'm able to do more, grow faster, go into new places, do new things, offer new products faster because I have digital labor and human labor.\n\nJeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, the marketing of AI isn't the only thing changing in tech. We'll talk more about other changes as well as the core issue with AI. Will it make enough money to justify high stock valuations? Stay with us. Welcome back. Before the break, we talked with Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff, about his new agentic AI software, but I also wanted to discuss larger forces with him. Silicon Valley and the tech sector have seen financial, technological and cultural change since the pandemic. Amid that change, rivalries and competitions have ramped up. Benioff has been criticizing the largest software company in the world, Microsoft.\n\nMarc Benioff: Microsoft has been a disappointment in this area. They have delegated their whole AI strategy to open AI. And they just are reselling the open AI product as a repackaged product in the app called Copilot with a prompt and a search field. They have not deployed thousands of customers on the agentic layer as we have. And look, they're a fast follower, that's their business model. I'm sure that they will have a product and do what they can. But there's a reason why Microsoft only has a few percentage points in the CRM market after trying to follow us for 25 years, because they're distracted, they have a lot of things they're working on. Over here, they're competing against Amazon. Over here, they're competing against Google. Over here, they're competing against Oracle. They've got a lot that they're trying to do. But what we are singularly focused to, as I said at the beginning, we're trying to help our customers connect with their customers in new ways. And now, this is a new way, with digital labor, to do that at this agentic layer, this idea that, and you understand this very well, which is that we make the number one service cloud in the world. We have a tremendous business with Service Cloud. And now, this service cloud is agent first. And the service cloud that we're offering our customers today is all agent-first service clouds. And not only do you have the incredible robust functionality that we had, let's say six months ago, which was number one in the world, but it has a huge new agentic layer also. And that is like for our customers, yes, their heads are spinning, our heads are spinning. Everybody's head should be spinning because we just all walk through a door, which is we're moving into the agentic world. And this agentic world is a lot about dollars and cents, and it is a lot about revenue, and it is a lot about expansion of opportunity for our customers and for our whole industry because we are entering a whole new world.\n\nJeremy Owens: Yeah, it's funny that I hear you use that top line and talk about growth because one thing I've noticed with your earnings calls and other things in the past couple of years, Marc, is this very quick shift from talking about revenue growth a lot, talking about profit growth a lot. And that's something, again, I've seen Silicon Valley-wide, big tech-wide, Facebook and Google in selling dividends. And I don't think we talk about this enough, that there's been this sea change from focusing on growth to focusing on profit in tech and Silicon Valley over the past couple of years.\n\nMarc Benioff: Yes. So let's talk about that because you're really doing a good job actually, really, I think, clarifying that there's two worlds, and that we all went through a door. So before we went through that door, what was happening was we were saying, \"Well, okay, this is our product line and this is where we are and this is our business post-pandemic. So we've really grown, so now we're going to optimize cashflow and margin. And we're going to do almost 13 billion in cashflow this year.\" I can't remember the exact guidance we were given, I think it was about 12.8 billion. I'd have to refer you back to the earnings call. \"And we have 32% margins and we're at high revenue levels.\" And these financial metrics are very different than where we were at the pandemic start. So let's say at the pandemic start, we were like this 20 billion company, and our margins were maybe sub-twenty percent, now we're like in this very different place. So there has been a transformation. And look, the whole world has transformed during the pandemic. I think, like you and I realized, the way we work, the way we live, the way we operate, the way we run our companies has changed in the last five years. There's no question. And the business characteristics have changed. And so these companies went through an adjustment. And when you said about layoffs, financial metrics, let's put all that in a box because I think that that is the box we were all living in about a year ago. And when we looked at AI and generative AI, it was still in that box. Now, I'm trying to make a case that there's a new box, and that we're moving from, okay, here we are, and now we're also moving now into this new world. And these two worlds we need to tease apart a little bit. And I can understand how you can merge them together. But they're very different things. And I think, look, as a CEO of a company who's trying to lead our company through all these things, some of these things are exciting, some of them are surprises. But I think we were managing it in one direction. And we are going through I think a financial transformation post-pandemic. And now, you can see we're going through, correctly as you said, a growth transformation with this new product category.\n\nJeremy Owens: And how should the average investor ingest that, Marc, because what I've always seen is there's growth stocks that are growing revenue and growing the share price, and then there's value stocks that are growing the profits and sharing those profits. And now we've seen a switch from Silicon Valley from one to the other, should investors be acting differently? Should investors be treating big tech companies in Silicon Valley differently because of that?\n\nMarc Benioff: You said that perfectly. We went through a company where we went through a financial transformation. So we have new financial characteristics that we can value our company based on what our cashflow is, what our profitability is, what our revenue is, and we can also look at what our growth prospects are, new products and new TAMs. And so these are the two worlds. And you're right, and one can be a value world like that world, and the second world can be a growth world. And when companies start to have both of these characteristics, that's when they can accelerate. And look, a job of a tech CEO is to get into both of those worlds. You want to have great financial characteristics, and you want to have clear growth prospects. And you want to be able to do both and bring them together. And this is the hard part of being a tech CEO, certainly at scale. At our size and our scale, I was excited that we were just going through this incredible financial transformation. And we were excited to talk about a thousand basis points of margin improvement. Now, what's exciting is to say, \"Wait a minute, oh, something just happened, and we're delivering this incredible new product line.\" And technology has radically changed. And what has happened is we've been able to do something that we could not do before. And that is what is exciting. And that's why we're squarely in this agentic world and heading towards this robotic world in some point in the future as well.\n\nJeremy Owens: Yeah, and I really appreciate you walking through the financial and technological changes that we're seeing at this point. Before I let you go, I do want to bring up cultural shift. We've seen a lot of tech execs reach out to Donald Trump as he's about to come into office, offer more to his inauguration fund than they did for Biden or for the first Trump, and really reach out and chat with him, (inaudible) talk. Now, you've said that Salesforce is not donating to the inauguration fund, but have you reached out? Have you had a phone call with Donald Trump? And what do you feel is behind this cultural shift in tech at this point in time?\n\nMarc Benioff: Well, let me say it a couple of different ways. First, I've been the CEO of Salesforce for 25 years, and I've worked with a lot of presidents very successfully, including Donald Trump. And presidents change, administrations change, we don't change. We're the same company, we're the same core values. You know that. You could probably give a lot of the Dreamforce keynote yourself. It doesn't change.\n\nJeremy Owens: But do you jump on those values as much, Marc? You made big news by threatening to pull out of Indiana when they were instituting a trans bathroom law. Do you feel like you can do that now? Are you going to make those stands anymore?\n\nMarc Benioff: Of course. And I'll tell you that we are the same company. I'm the same CEO. And yes, I still feel like I can do everything that I've done, which is number one is, we always have our employees back. And the case that you're making is what happened in Indiana where, at the time, Mike Pence, who was a very good friend of mine actually, signed a law that I did not agree with. And I said, \"Mike, you're going to cause us to disinvest from Indiana.\" Why that's significant is you know that we're the largest tech employer in San Francisco. We're the largest employer in San Francisco, actually. But you may not know we're the largest tech employer in Indiana. And so I'm like, \"Mike, we can't do this.\" And it turned into a little bit of a heat storm. 200 companies took our side, but it only lasted for two or three days, and Mike changed the law. And we negotiated with him, and that really reflects the relationship that we had with Mike, and how things should work. And so yes, we'll always have our employees back. That's extremely important. Look, we work in a lot of countries, and a lot of states, and a lot of cities. So there's a lot of politicians that we have to work with. When our employees have a problem and they call me, and it's happening every day, and they're not happy with something that's going on in their jurisdiction because there's something they don't agree with, look, I'll say, \"Look, I can't do everything for you. And there's a lot of things I can't do politically. I'll try. But what I can do is if you don't like where you are, hey, it's a big world and Salesforce is a big company, I'll move you.\" So I've moved more than 300 employees who are just unhappy with whatever political environment they're in anywhere in the world, and I'll just hit a button and move them somewhere else.\n\nJeremy Owens: Does that include out of California? Have you moved people who are unhappy with California out?\n\nMarc Benioff: Absolutely. We've moved people wherever they want to go, they could move. That's a great thing about being an employee at Salesforce is our values. What are our values? Trust, customer success, innovation, equality, sustainability. These are our five core values. And we're aligned with those five values. Those are the kind of people we want to have in our company. And once you're aligned with us and you're a successful employee, we're going to do whatever we can to help you and support you.\n\nJeremy Owens: And do you feel you have an open line of communication with Donald Trump? Have you spoken to him?\n\nMarc Benioff: I have a good line of communication with Donald Trump, the Trump administration. You may know we just made him person of the year. He was very excited about that. That's a recognition of the huge influence that he's had. I think he's now been on the cover of Time Magazine almost 40 times, maybe more than 40 times.\n\nJeremy Owens: I want to jump in here and note that Marc Benioff has been the owner of Time Magazine since 2018.\n\nMarc Benioff: And this I think was a huge moment for him that he has been reelected as President of the United States. And I congratulated him. And I feel like, of course, I'm going to do whatever I can to support the President of the United States in our country and do whatever's necessary to make us successful.\n\nJeremy Owens: That was an edited version of our conversation, but you can watch the full interview on MarketWatch's YouTube page. I find the massive cultural, financial, and technological changes that are occurring right now in Silicon Valley fascinating. And getting the chance to talk to Marc Benioff about them was a true pleasure. But I came away still doubting that we are going to see huge revenue gains this year as a result of AI. Instead, it's still looking like a way to increase profit, which fits right into the financial changes I've been following for years. Now, I could be wrong on that. Marc certainly disagreed with me at times. But I look forward to following these changes and telling you more about them, and hopefully having Benioff back on in the future to follow up.

The platform offers in-depth reporting and analytics tools \u2014 invaluable for providing actionable insights for sales and marketing managers, reps and C-suite execs . Our detailed HubSpot CRM review explains additional features and functionality.\n\nSalesforce vs. HubSpot Comparison\n\nSalesforce and HubSpot are top-performing solutions in multiple areas. Here\u2019s a direct comparison of their essential CRM features and pricing.\n\nPricing\n\nSalesforce\u2019s pricing is midtier in the CRM market. HubSpot\u2019s most feature-packed service plans are at the upper end.\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce has a vast ecosystem of offerings. The costs below are for its Sales Cloud solutions.\n\nPlan Price Features Starter Suite $25 per user, per month (billed monthly or annually) Account, contact, lead, task, campaign and opportunity management\n\nEinstein Activity Capture\n\nLead assignment and routing\n\nWeb-to-lead capture\n\nMass email\n\nEmail productivity tools\n\nOpportunity management\n\nCustomizable sales processes\n\nCustomizable reports and dashboards\n\nProducts and price books\n\nFiles and case management\n\nEmail integration Pro Suite $100 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Starter Suite, plus: Enhanced customization and automation\n\nSales quoting and forecasting\n\nReal-time chat\n\nForecasting mobile app\n\nOrders and quotes\n\nTopics and recommendations\n\nLightning App Builder\n\nAppExchange Enterprise $165 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Pro Suite, plus: Opportunity splits\n\nOpportunity scoring\n\nDeal insights\n\nPipeline inspection\n\nWaterfall chart\n\nApproval process Unlimited $330 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Enterprise, plus: Predictive AI\n\nSales engagement hub\n\nConversation intelligence\n\nLead scoring\n\nOne partial and one full sandbox per organization Einstein 1 Sales $500 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Unlimited, plus: Generative AI\n\nUnified data\n\nSales planning, programs and collaboration\n\nKnowledge base\n\nSales Elevate with Slack\n\nSalesforce subscriptions range from $25 to $500 per user, per month. You can opt for the Starter Suite on a monthly basis but all other plans require an annual contract.\n\nAdditional features and apps may cost extra. Salesforce offers a generous 30-day free trial so you can test drive the system to see if it\u2019s right for your business.\n\nFYI Did you know All Salesforce plans let you send 5,000 email marketing campaign messages daily \u2014 a generous allowance we haven't seen from any other provider.\n\nHubSpot\n\nHubSpot\u2019s free service level, Free Tools, impressed us \u2014 few competitors offer such a generous free tier (or any free tier). Its features include SEO recommendations, 2,000 monthly emails and live chat.\n\nPaid plan prices, which are by \u201cseat,\u201d or user, are listed below. Note that HubSpot has various iterations; for simplicity, we\u2019re quoting prices from its Customer Platform, which includes marketing, sales, service, content, operations and commerce tools.\n\nPlan Price Features Starter $15 per month, per seat (billed annually) $20 per month, per seat (billed monthly) 1,000 property records\n\n10 dashboards with 10 reports each\n\n25 active and 1,000 static lists\n\n1 shared inbox\n\nOne-to-one email\n\nUp to 1 million products\n\nPayment processing\n\nForm automation\n\nEmail retargeting tools\n\nTwo deal pipelines\n\nUp to 30 landing pages\n\nAI content assistants\n\nDocument storage\n\nSales content analytics\n\nSales automation\n\nRemoval of HubSpot branding Professional $1,170 per month (for five seats, additional seats start at $45; price reflects an annual commitment paid upfront) $1,300 per month (for five seats, additional users start at $50 per month; reflects monthly payment with an annual commitment) Everything in Starter, plus: 25 dashboards with 25 reports each\n\n15 deal pipelines\n\nUp to 100 shared inboxes\n\nUp to 15 million products\n\nWhatsApp integration (1,000 conversations)\n\nUp to 10,000 landing pages\n\nCustomer reporting\n\nContact center attribution\n\nDeal and company scoring\n\nDynamic personalization\n\nA/B testing\n\nSEO analytics Enterprise From $4,300 per month (for seven seats, additional seats start at $75 per month) Everything in Professional, plus: 50 dashboards with 35 reports each\n\nUp to 100 deal pipelines\n\nUp to 200 shared inboxes\n\n10,000 marketing contacts\n\nContent staging\n\nAdditional tools\n\nHubSpot\u2019s Starter level should suffice for businesses with straightforward needs. However, you\u2019ll need the Professional tier if you want to boost your SEO strategy with SEO analytics and add features like A/B testing, deal and company scoring and contact center attribution. This is a significant price jump.\n\nAdditional charges can add up. For example, onboarding fees can range from $3,000 to $8,000, depending on your service level. There\u2019s also a $3,600 annual fee for a dedicated internet protocol for marketing emails and a $7,200 annual fee for transaction emails.\n\nBest for Pricing Salesforce Salesforce wins because its entry-level plan is more feature-packed than HubSpot's and provides 5,000 free daily emails. Additionally, if you need more features, the price jump from Salesforce's Starter Suite to its Pro Suite level isn't as jarring as HubSpot's jump from Starter to Professional. Still, HubSpot does offer a free tier, so it may be worth trying this out first.\n\nTip Bottom line If you're interested in CRMs with free service plans, check out our review of Zoho CRM. This platform offers a three-user free tier with essential features that may work well for very small businesses.\n\nContact Management\n\nContact management tools help small business owners track and monitor real-time prospect and client interactions.\n\nSalesforce\n\nExcellent object control: Objects are spreadsheet fields, such as name, contact email or last purchase date, that add further depth to customer and prospect data. We like that Salesforce lets you create and customize unique customer fields, offering enhanced opportunities to analyze and monitor key metrics.\n\nObjects are spreadsheet fields, such as name, contact email or last purchase date, that add further depth to customer and prospect data.

Data security: Only display the data co-workers must see to do their jobs. We appreciate that this protection helps support California Consumer Privacy Act and General Data Protection Regulation compliance and protects your business from data breaches.\n\nHubSpot\n\nEfficient lead capture: We like that you can capture leads from multiple sources, including website forms, live web chats and mobile devices. Inquirers\u2019 details are automatically placed into a database for follow-up. You can also customize forms to capture unique data fields that will enrich your sales data.\n\nWe like that you can capture leads from multiple sources, including website forms, live web chats and mobile devices.

Robust list management: HubSpot\u2019s dynamic active lists automatically update to show which contacts might be receptive to a sales pitch.

Advanced segmentation: We were impressed that you can segment customers and prospects by demographics, psychographics and past interactions, such as content downloads. To receive special offers, create more complex contact groups with shared characteristics.\n\nBest for Contact Management HubSpot Salesforce offers excellent customization and object control. However, HubSpot's dynamic lead capture and management tools impressed us. We also really like HubSpot's time-saving and intelligent active lists feature that identifies contacts who might be ready to purchase soon.\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is a low-cost, effective way to engage with and sell to your target audience.\n\nSalesforce\n\nGenerous email limit: We were impressed that Salesforce Sales Cloud lets you send up to 5,000 email marketing messages daily from the platform on all plans.\n\nWe were impressed that Salesforce Sales Cloud lets you send up to 5,000 email marketing messages daily from the platform on all plans.

Source: Salesforce\n\nTip Bottom line Email marketing isn't a built-in Salesforce CRM feature. You'll need to install a third-party plug-in or use Salesforce Marketing Cloud for full email marketing functionality. Read our Salesforce Marketing Cloud review to learn more about this robust email marketing solution.\n\nHubSpot\n\nIntegrated emailing: We like that you can create, personalize and optimize email marketing campaigns directly from the HubSpot platform. We also like that HubSpot allows up to 2,000 promotional emails monthly, even on its free level.\n\nWe like that you can create, personalize and optimize email marketing campaigns directly from the HubSpot platform.

If you\u2019re stuck for inspiration, you can use the platform\u2019s in-built AI email writer for help.\n\nBest Email Marketing HubSpot HubSpot wins this round. Unlike Salesforce, HubSpot's email marketing functionality is fully integrated into the platform. Its user-friendly tools make creating and launching campaigns quick and easy. Salesforce's plug-ins are good, but HubSpot's features are better.\n\nWorkflows and Automations\n\nWorkflow automations save you and your team time, so you can focus on improving the business.\n\nSalesforce\n\nAction-contingent steps: We like that Salesforce allows you to turn new objects or fields added to a database into actionable processes. For example, when a new lead enters the system and your rep has made contact, you can require them to gather specific details before advancing the prospect to the next stage of the sales funnel.\n\nWe like that Salesforce allows you to turn new objects or fields added to a database into actionable processes.

It suggests new and more efficient workflows by monitoring how you use Salesforce. (This feature is only available on the Einstein 1 tier.)\n\nHubSpot\n\nWide range of automations: We like HubSpot\u2019s automated workflow-creation flexibility.

The integration of AI into this process enhances accuracy by tracking your data and results over time, leading to better forecasting.\n\nCreating workflows in HubSpot is straightforward, with no coding required. Source: HubSpot\n\nBest for Workflows and Automations Salesforce Salesforce's extensive workflow and automation capabilities are flexible and precise. You can better manage teams, marketing campaign structures and much more. The platform's Process Builder tool is superb. Although HubSpot's visual editors are more user-friendly and you can code in JavaScript or Python, the platform doesn't offer Salesforce's advanced automation capabilities and ease of use.\n\nReporting and Analytics\n\nReporting and analytics tools give SMB owners actionable insights to formulate growth strategies and improve inventory turnaround times.\n\nSalesforce\n\nValuable insights tools: We like how easily Salesforce allows you to uncover actionable insights that can boost overall company performance. You can customize its visual dashboards to display how close managers and team members are to achieving key performance indicators and other targets in real time.\n\nWe like how easily Salesforce allows you to uncover actionable insights that can boost overall company performance.

To get the full picture, you can compare page dwell times, conversion rates and unique visits to analyze pages on an individual level.\n\nBest for Reporting and Analytics Salesforce Salesforce comes out ahead in this category thanks to its comprehensive toolset and visually appealing dashboards. The AI-powered Einstein tool and its predictive analytics and decision-making support add real value. However, HubSpot's reporting and analytics functions are also powerful; they're likely enough for most SMBs.\n\nIntegrations\n\nCRMs can integrate with your other business software apps for better data synchronization across your business.\n\nSalesforce\n\nHuge selection: We were impressed that Salesforce\u2019s AppExchange offers access to over 5,000 apps and integrations.

Among those leveraging AI, 90 per cent report revenue growth, according to a recent report by customer service management vendor Salesforce.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 3,350 SMB leaders across 26 countries, highlights that 75 per cent of SMBs globally are either experimenting with or actively implementing AI, citing its ability to boost revenue, productivity, and customer satisfaction. Singapore is a leader, with 94 per cent of SMBs actively deploying or testing AI solutions.\n\nThe report revealed a stark contrast between growing SMBs and their more stagnant counterparts. Thriving businesses placed a key focus on AI capabilities, while less successful ones focus mainly on cost.\n\nAcross Asia-Pacific, the top three AI use cases are automated service chatbots that can reduce response times, marketing campaign optimisation to improve digital and offline campaigns, and generation of new content.\n\nHowever, the integration of AI comes with challenges. SMB leaders highlight the difficulty of keeping pace with the technology and staying ahead. Forty-two per cent of respondents worry that their company may fall behind if it does not keep up with AI advancements.\n\nIn the region, 63 per cent of SMB leaders say keeping pace with changing technology is a major challenge, and 40 per cent say that their companies lack the time to master the ever-growing array of tools in their tech stack.\n\nData quality is another pressing concern, with 72 per cent of Asia-Pacific SMB leaders believing that improving their data would lead to increased revenue.\n\nYet, as SMBs strive to unlock AI\u2019s potential, trust remains a top priority. Consumer trust in AI remains low, and SMBs are keenly aware of the risks associated with rapid technological change.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific, 74 per cent of SMB leaders are willing to spend more on technology from trusted vendors. Their top concerns around AI include security risks, where protecting sensitive data remains a top priority; the lack of strategy or use cases; and poor data quality.\n\n\u201cSMBs in Singapore are already seeing clear benefits from AI despite having fewer resources than enterprises, proving that growth and innovation are not limited by size,\u201d said Sujith Abraham, senior vice-president and general manager for Salesforce in ASEAN.\n\n\u201cAs AI agents evolve with unprecedented levels of intelligence, they can empower SMBs to build a limitless workforce across business functions,\u201d he added.\n\nThe findings might help to give renewed energy for AI efforts in 2025, a year when many businesses believe AI projects will have to deliver results after early experiments. Some businesses are even rethinking their investments in AI in the new year, according to some reports.\n\nThe uncertainty is not unusual for a nascent technology\u2019s adoption stage. A separate IDC report highlights the growing interest in generative AI (GenAI) among SMBs and midmarket segments in the Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan).\n\nWhile businesses recognise GenAI\u2019s potential to revolutionise various industries, they are still exploring how to capitalise on the benefits of this technology.\n\nTo navigate this landscape, companies are relying on their technology providers/suppliers to embed GenAI into their offerings, to access ongoing support and updates without investing heavily in internal resources.",

            "content": "Fashion\u2019s returns problem is only getting worse. This holiday season, shoppers have already sent back $112 billion in merchandise globally, up 28 per cent on the year prior, per Salesforce. In the post-holiday returns period (from 26 December 2024 to 10 January 2025), people returned more than 850,000 items, amounting to $113.96 million across apparel, cosmetics and personal care categories, according to returns management software Loop.\n\nThe increase is, in part, down to haul culture driving consumers to stock up for social media content (with the intention of returning at least some of the clothes) and the rise of \u2018bracketing\u2019 (ordering multiple sizes to find the right fit). But come holiday season, returns spike as consumers opt to send back unwanted gifts, or products they\u2019d bought before the holiday sales kicked off. Salesforce expects the returns merch value to reach $133 billion worth in the next two weeks, given the lag time between logging or accounting for returns\n\nFor brands and retailers, returns are a year-round problem. They\u2019re costly, bad for the environment and a logistical pain. The ongoing luxury slowdown means returns are even more of an issue \u2014 when brands are already strained, they need to protect their margins and bottom line, with costly and logistically complicated returns making it hard to do so.\n\nIn addition to the tough economic environment brands are operating in, returns are a bigger concern this holiday season because retailers are facing higher supply chain costs than normal, says Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights and strategy at Salesforce. This leaves retailers with lower profit margins. Sea freight costs remain well above pre-pandemic levels, for instance.\n\nConsumers also remain cautious after a year of feeling squeezed, experts agree. This doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019re buying less, but they\u2019re more likely to second guess the items they do purchase. \u201cIn periods of high price consciousness like these, our data shows that consumers are more likely to reassess their purchases, which leads to higher returns rates,\u201d Schwartz explains.\n\nSchwartz expects higher returns to continue for the few weeks ahead given holiday returns often stretch into late January. Post-January, there\u2019s usually a leveling off of returns, she says, noting that Salesforce expects the same pattern this year.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solve?\n\nReturns may be set to level out, but even when lower than the holiday spike, they remain a thorn for retailers.",

Technology publishers and service providers showed off their platforms and tools at the event, showcased customer stories, and used messaging that designed to encourage more retailers to invest in building their first AI-based solutions.\n\nFor business economists, AI\u2019s growth in retail and across the broader economy has the potential to be significant. Speaking at NRF, Greg Daco, chief economist at EY, said his team estimates that over 10 years, generative AI could contribute two to four years of extra growth. \u201cThe thing is, it's not going to be immediate,\u201d he added, explaining that today\u2019s productivity growth is driven by other factors. \u201cProductivity growth [right now] is not AI-driven, it's driven by process efficiency, people staying longer, and more efficient investments.\u201d\n\nFor retailers at NRF 2025 thinking about current and future opportunities to grow their businesses, some might be forgiven for struggling to pick sessions to attend from among the tech giant sponsors. Titles offered up by major brands offered little insight or intrigue at an event heavy in AI talking points. For attendees planning a day full of activities the options might have proved frustrating with session titles like: \u201cDriving value with AI in retail\u201d, \u201cLeveraging AI to improve omnichannel experiences\u201d, \u201cRevolutionize retail with agentic AI\u201d, \u201cReimagining retail with AI\u201d, and \u201cTransform retail with AI\u201d.\n\nOn-stage experiences: Comparing Microsoft and Salesforce\n\nAs in past years, Microsoft and Salesforce were among the most visible vendors sponsoring NRF 2025, each with a massive expo hall presence and prime time booked on the event stages to present their own vision for AI in retail. The teams\u2019 respective presentations and branding revealed notable differences in approach and focus, with Salesforce taking a more product-forward approach and Microsoft focusing on business value priorities.\n\nTo understand some elements of the Microsoft and Salesforce pitches at NRF 2025, we can compare observed differences during on-stage presentations. Let\u2019s examine Salesforce\u2019s sponsored session \u201cSalesforce Agentforce: How autonomous AI agents will redefine unified commerce\u201d and two Microsoft sessions, \u201cRetail ready: AI built for the future, ready now\u201d and \u201cTransform the shopper journey\u201d.

As one of the best performers in the Dow Jones, the index greatly benefited from CRM\u2019s greater than 2% rise.\n\nSalesforce stock news\n\nBoth Needham and Bank of America Securities have named Salesforce as a top stock for the year. While the technology sector has gotten off to a rotten start this year, owing to worries about the incoming Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might steer clear of further interest rate cuts, both firms\u2019 research departments view Salesforce as likely to outperform its sector.\n\nNeedham slapped the company with a $400 price target, about $75 above the current share price, due to CEO Marc Benioff\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence. Salesforce developed and released the Agentforce product in the latter half of 2024, which allows businesses to customize an AI bot that retrieves information or solve issues for customers like a human customer representative.\n\n\u201cOur bullish thesis is highly leveraged to CRM's ability to execute and monetize its new Agentforce strategy,\u201d Needham wrote in its research note.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 paid deals for Agentforce in the third quarter and said the total would reach 1,000 by the end of last year.\n\nIn his third-quarter earnings call, Benioff claimed that Salesforce was using Agentforce itself to resolve 83% of customer queries.\n\nBank of America is also focused on software companies likely to benefit from AI products.\n\n\"The US software sector is not inexpensive after rallying 59% in 2023 and 23% in 2024,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in their research. \"However, revenue multiples and growth expectations remain below [five]-year median and pre-covid levels, indicating that upside from the unfolding Agentic AI wave, inflecting enterprise IT spending and sustained migration to the cloud is unlikely to be fully priced in.\"\n\nBank of America added that some Agentic AI plays offered \"PhD-level intelligence on some tasks and could displace workers as early as 2H25.\"\n\nSalesforce stock forecast\n\nSalesforce stock has been in an uptrend since December 2022, and that long stretch doesn't seem like it's at its end. Shares recently hit an all-time high of $369 in early December and are poised for further gains.\n\nCRM then retreated from that level but discovered support near November's earlier foundation near $316. While the four-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) looks poised to overtake the 13-week counterpart, Q4 earnings and further headlines about Agentforce a sure to excite the market.\n\nExpect CRM stock to reverse course soon and make its way back toward Needham's target of $400 sometime later this year. In the meantime, CRM could find support near the 52-week SMA near $287.",

The news BofA analysts expect 2025 to be a strong year for software stocks, and Salesforce is among their \"top buys\" within the group. The maker of customer relations management software is a \"top AI beneficiary,\" as the company rolls out its new suite of automation tools dubbed Agentforce, analysts argued. With Agentforce, companies can create so-called AI agents that can autonomously complete tasks across their customer service, marketing and sales departments. \"We believe [Salesforce] stock is likely to rerate higher with reaccelerating topline growth and sustainable margin expansion,\" Bank of America analysts wrote to clients Tuesday. Shares of Salesforce rose more than 2.5% on Tuesday \u2014 the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 's modest advance In Salesforce's fiscal 2026, which starts in February, and fiscal 2027, analysts see Agentforce delivering between 1 to 2 percentage points of revenue expansion. On top of that, they said an improved spending environment from clients on front-office software more generally could contribute a similar amount of growth. That should enable Salesforce to further expand margins \u2014 in a continuation of its major profitability push in recent years \u2014 and grow free cash flow north of 20% \"in each of the coming three years,\" analysts wrote. Big picture Salesforce is leaning hard into Agentforce, part of a broader trend within the tech industry toward so-called AI agents, which are seen as the next wave of generative AI beyond chatbots like ChatGPT from OpenAI and Copilot from fellow Club name and Dow component Microsoft . The platform was showcased at Salesforce's splashy annual Dreamforce conference in mid-September, and the rollout has helped improve Wall Street sentiment on the stock. Salesforce shares have gained roughly 26% since Sept. 18, while a popular exchange-traded fund tracking the tech industry known as the XLK has added less than 5% during the same stretch. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in December that the company had already inked more than 1,000 deals for Agentforce and intended to hire 2,000 people to help sell its AI software. Benioff has been critical of Microsoft's Copilot. Microsoft, which has introduced its own AI agents, is forming a new artificial intelligence group to build and run apps for customers. Bank of America's note represents the latest piece of positive commentary on Agentforce . Last week, Goldman Sachs also said Salesforce's stock has the opportunity to command a higher multiple, a sign of investor confidence. Not everyone is buying in, though. Guggenheim Securities downgraded Salesforce to a sell rating from a hold-equivalent on Jan. 6, expressing concerns about Agentforce monetization and the company's growth rate in the upcoming fiscal year. Bottom line Bank of America's commentary on Salesforce is \"important,\" according to Jim Cramer. The analysts echo our belief that Salesforce will be able to deliver both better revenue growth and better profits this year, boosted by AI spending. As Jim noted during last month's Monthly Meeting , the hiring that Salesforce is doing to support the launch of Agentforce should be seen as a bullish sign of the demand environment.

            "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) on Disruptive analytics\u2019 Substack by Magnus Ofstad. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CRM. Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)\u2019s share was trading at $317.85 as of Jan 10th. CRM\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 52.36 and 28.49 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\n2025 will be a defining year for AI, as it shifts from a speculative concept to a core driver of productivity and business transformation. Salesforce, a leader in customer relationship management (CRM), is uniquely positioned at the forefront of this change, acting as a bellwether for AI adoption in the business world. Given its deep ties to customer engagement and data-driven processes, if Salesforce\u2019s clients\u2014those who are already at the cutting edge\u2014fail to embrace AI agents to improve efficiency, it raises the question of who will. This sets the stage for Salesforce\u2019s revenue performance in 2025 to serve as a crucial litmus test for AI\u2019s role in reshaping business operations.\n\nThe journey to AI integration is not instantaneous. It\u2019s a gradual process, requiring both technological innovation and cultural adaptation. For Salesforce, this evolution is reflected in its work with Agentforce 2.0, an AI-driven platform that automates previously time-consuming tasks such as customer support and recruitment. Notably, Agentforce has reduced human intervention in daily support requests by half, allowing customer support teams to focus on more strategic priorities. Additionally, the platform has streamlined recruitment for Adecco, where AI agents sift through millions of resumes, significantly reducing manual workloads and enhancing recruiter efficiency. The same technology has found applications in healthcare with Pristina Health, where AI agents monitor patients\u2019 health in real time, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced hospital readmissions.\n\nThese success stories highlight the immediate advantages that AI agents bring to businesses. By automating routine tasks, companies can free up valuable time for teams to engage in more high-value activities. However, Salesforce emphasizes that the full potential of AI will be realized over a longer period, with three years being the typical timeline for businesses to fully integrate AI into their operations and see maximum benefits. This slow burn presents both an opportunity and a risk for investors, as early AI successes could be overshadowed by the need for long-term strategic adaptation.\n\nThe stock market is divided on Salesforce\u2019s future prospects. Some analysts have raised their price targets, citing the success of Agentforce as a driver for future growth. Others are more cautious, noting economic uncertainties and a potential slowdown in IT spending that could negatively affect Salesforce\u2019s growth trajectory. They also express concerns that CRM may not fully capitalize on the AI space without acquiring additional companies with established AI expertise.\n\nAs we move through 2025, Salesforce\u2019s performance will be a key barometer for the broader market\u2019s response to AI. If CRM continues to drive growth through AI adoption, it will provide a clear signal that AI is truly becoming a mainstream business tool. Investors should watch CRM closely, as its performance will offer critical insights into the pace of AI integration across industries and its ability to reshape business models and productivity.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (CRM) is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 116 hedge fund portfolios held CRM at the end of the third quarter which was 117 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

            "content": "New data by global CRM provider, Salesforce has shown that holiday retail sales in December 2024 surged to a record $1.2 trillion globally and $282 billion in the United States, but high returns could dampen overall profit margins.\n\nThe report which was based on an analysis of 1.5 billion shoppers and 1.6 trillion page views across Salesforce platforms indicates that the better-than-expected holiday shopping season was powered by surges in mobile and social commerce alongside increased consumer spending after months of saving in the first half of 2024.\n\nIt indicates that as retailers increasingly embed AI into search experiences, search drove a nearly 3x better conversion rate. The report also shows that frontline workers also use conversational search during the holiday season to enhance efficiency and service.\n\nIt was observed that imaginative generative AI served up personalized product recommendations to store associates helping customers find the perfect gift. Service agents also benefited from generative AI as well.\n\nThey were used to provide personalized replies \u2013 while dealing with stressed-out customers looking for products, orders, and discounts.\n\nHowever, the report indicates that shoppers have already sent back $122 billion in merchandise. This is up by 28% from the return rate that was recorded last year. This increase is partially due to trending consumer behaviours like \u201ctry-on hauls\u201d and bracketing (buying an extra size above and below your standard size).\n\nBoth consumers and retailers leaned into AI and agents to enhance holiday shopping experiences through product recommendations and personalised order support, influencing $229 billion \u2013 or 19% \u2013 of all online orders.\n\nBelow are some major highlights of the Salesforce holiday spending report:\n\nOnline sales reached $1.2 trillion globally and $282 billion in the U.S. This represents a 3% global year-over-year (YoY) increase and a 4% YoY increase in the U.S. Online sales also grew 1% YoY in the European Union (EU).\n\nSocial media as a traffic-referring channel also grew 8% YoY, driving 14% of all traffic to e-commerce sites during the season. Retailers using social commerce strategies saw 20% of global holiday sales generated through platforms like TikTok Shop and Instagram.\n\n$229 billion of global online sales were influenced by AI and agents in the form of product recommendations, targeted offers, and conversational customer service support.\n\n19% of holiday purchases were influenced by consumers engaging with AI and agents, a 6% increase from 2023.\n\nRetail use of generative AI features like agents increased 25% during the holiday season compared to September and October in 2024.\n\nShoppers used AI- and agent-powered chat for customer service 42% more than they did during the 2023 holiday season.\n\nSalesforce projects that retailers will likely see this number grow to $133 billion \u2013 presenting an important opportunity for brands to use agents to make the returns process easier and more tailored to specific customer needs.\n\n\u201cRetailers had a robust holiday season, but a 28% rise in the rate of returns compared to last year is a cause for some concern,\u201d said Caila Schwartz, Director of Consumer Insights at Salesforce. \u201cRetailers who have embraced AI and agents are already seeing the benefits, but these tools will be even more critical in the new year as retailers aim to minimise revenue losses on returns and reengage with shoppers.\u201d\n\nRead also: Salesforce\u2019s partnership-driven model is revolutionising talent development in Nigeria",

Existing open-source multi-modal language models are found to be wanting in these areas, especially for tasks that involve external tools such as OCR or mathematical calculations. The abovementioned limitations can largely be attributed to single-step-oriented datasets that cannot provide a coherent framework for multiple steps of reasoning and logical chains of actions. Overcoming these will be indispensable for unlocking true potential in using multi-modal AI on complex levels.\n\nCurrent multi-modal models often rely on instruction tuning with direct-answer datasets or few-shot prompting approaches. The proprietary systems, like GPT-4, have demonstrated the ability to reason through CoTA chains effectively. At the same time, the open-source models face challenges from a lack of datasets and integration with tools. The earlier efforts, such as LLaVa-Plus and Visual Program Distillation, were also limited by small dataset sizes, poor-quality training data, and a focus on simple question-answering tasks, which limits them to more complex multi-modal problems that require more sophisticated reasoning and tool application.\n\nResearchers from the University of Washington and Salesforce Research have developed TACO, an innovative framework for training multi-modal action models using synthetic CoTA datasets. This work introduces several key advancements to address the limitations of prior methods. First, over 1.8 million traces have been generated using GPT-4 and programs in Python, while a subset of 293K examples was curated to present high quality after rigorous filtering techniques. These examples ensure the inclusion of diverse reasoning and action sequences critical for multi-modal learning. Second, TACO incorporates a robust set of 15 tools, including OCR, object localization, and mathematical solvers, enabling the models to handle complex tasks effectively. Third, advanced filtering and data-mixing techniques further optimize the dataset, emphasizing reasoning-action integration and fostering superior learning outcomes. This framework reinterprets multi-modal learning by enabling models to produce coherent multi-step reasoning while seamlessly integrating actions, thereby establishing a new benchmark for performance in intricate scenarios.\n\nThe development of TACO involved training on a carefully curated CoTA dataset with 293K instances sourced from 31 different origins, including Visual Genome. These datasets contain a wide range of tasks such as mathematical reasoning, optical character recognition, and detailed visual understanding. It is highly heterogeneous, with the tools provided including object localization and language-based solvers that allow a wide range of reasoning and action tasks. The training architecture combined LLaMA3 as the linguistic basis with CLIP as the visual encoder thus establishing a strong multi-modal framework. Fine-tuning established hyperparameter tuning that focused on lowering learning rates and increasing the number of epochs for training to guarantee that the models could adequately solve complex multi-modal challenges.\n\nTACO\u2019s performance across eight benchmarks demonstrates its substantial impact on advancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities. The system achieved an average accuracy improvement of 3.6% over instruction-tuned baselines, with gains as high as 15% on MMVet tasks that involve OCR and mathematical reasoning. Notably, the high-quality 293K CoTA dataset outperformed larger, less refined datasets, underscoring the importance of targeted data curation. Further performance improvements are achieved through adjustments in hyperparameter strategies, including tuning of vision encoders and optimization of learning rates. Table 2: Results show excellent performances by TACO compared to benchmarks, the latter was found to be exceptionally better in complex tasks involving integration of reasoning and action.\n\nTACO introduces a new methodology for multi-modal action modeling that effectively addresses the severe deficiencies of both reasoning and tool-based actions through high-quality synthetic datasets and innovative training methodologies. The research overcomes the constraints of traditional instruction-tuned models, and its developments are poised to change the face of real-world applications ranging from visual question answering to complex multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\nCheck out the Paper, GitHub Page, and Project Page.

We have provided capital and also developed a robust monitoring and evaluation framework that allows us to track the progress of our entrepreneurs and measure their contributions to their communities and economies.\n\nNo other organisation is implementing entrepreneurship development at this scale across Africa. We have learned, we have refined, and we continue to improve, ensuring that African entrepreneurs\u2014women and men\u2014are at the forefront of solving our continent\u2019s challenges and creating wealth for themselves and their communities. Entrepreneurship is the key to Africa\u2019s prosperity. I wish the 2025 cohort of Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurs success, as they chase their ambitions, and play their part in Africa\u2019s transformation.\u201d\n\nThe Tony Elumelu Foundation is the leading philanthropy empowering a new generation of African entrepreneurs, driving poverty eradication, catalysing job creation across all 54 African countries and ensuring inclusive economic empowerment.\n\nSince the launch of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme in 2015, TEF has lifted over 2 million Africans out of poverty, provided 2.5 million young Africans with access to training on TEFConnect, and disbursed more than $100millon in direct funding to thousands of African entrepreneurs who have gone on to create over 1.5 million direct and indirect jobs and generate over $4.2 billion in revenue.\n\nTony Elumelu Entrepreneur Testimonials from Previous Years:\n\n\u201cI started my agribusiness with nothing but an idea. TEF changed everything. With the funding, training, and mentorship, I have now expanded across three countries and employ 25 people.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Fatima Diallo, Senegal, Agritech Entrepreneur\n\n\u201cAs a woman in the fintech industry, it was difficult to secure funding. TEF not only provided me with capital but also the confidence and skills to build a business that is now attracting international investors.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Mary Okeke, Nigeria, Fintech Founder\n\n\u201cThe TEF Entrepreneurship Programme helped me commercialise my clean energy innovation.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other cloud computing stocks.\n\nCloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025.\n\nGartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\n\nKey Trends to Watch Out in 2025\n\nMoving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization.\n\nAI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks.\n\nFuture developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to. Next, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 10th January. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 30.5%\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides cloud-based software for businesses managing customer relationships, sales, marketing, and customer service. The company continues to enhance its core offerings, such as Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, with AI capabilities. Also, its Data Cloud is well-placed to benefit from the AI trend, with customers exploring AI-driven CRM deployments. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) plans to continue investing in its Data Cloud offerings, which should drive future growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s Data Cloud was included in 8 of the top 10 deals in FQ3 2025, demonstrating its importance in AI transformations. Notably, 25% of the Fortune 100 are data cloud customers. IBM, one of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s valued strategic partners, selected DataCloud to enhance their global client service with a unified view of all client interactions and actionable usage insight that can deliver more efficient personalized experiences. Through leveraging IBM\u2019s global reach, reputation, and expertise, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) can ramp up Data Cloud adoption, foster cross-selling opportunities, and fuel long-term growth throughout its ecosystem.\n\nWith 1.9 trillion weekly AI transactions through Model Builder and 83.2 billion weekly workflows through Flow Builder, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s AI-driven Data Cloud is being regarded as a critical growth driver. Apart from long-term prospects, Goldman Sachs identified near-term tailwinds for the company. These include macroeconomic improvements, elevated AI spending in the application layer, the Data Cloud\u2019s increasing contribution, and anticipated cyclical improvements in the Marketing and Commerce Cloud which can result in reacceleration of growth.\n\nOverall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, in a recent podcast, criticised Microsoft\u2019s Copilot. \u201cThis Copilot thing has been a huge disaster for them from a branding and validation standpoint. Customers don\u2019t look at them and don\u2019t take them seriously in AI,\u201d Benioff said.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Ignite Innovation with Generative AI! \ud83c\udf1f Join AWS AI Conclave 2025 in Bengaluru! >\n\nHe was responding to Microsoft Chief Satya Nadella, who recently, in a podcast, indirectly took a dig at Salesforce by saying that traditional SaaS companies will collapse in the AI agent era. \u201cI think the notion that business applications exist\u2014that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era. Because if you think about it, right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBusiness logic is all going to these agents, and these agents are going to be multi-repo CRUD. They\u2019re not going to discriminate between what the back end is; they\u2019re going to update multiple databases, and all the logic will be in the AI tier,\u201d Nadella added.\n\nFurthermore, Benioff expressed his scepticism about Microsoft\u2019s approach to integrating AI into its enterprise offerings, particularly through its Copilot initiative.\n\n\ud83c\udf20 Spark the Future of AI \ud83c\udf0d \u2013 Free Virtual MiniCon for Visionaries & Innovators! >\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has disappointed everybody with how they\u2019ve approached this kind of AI world,\u201d Benioff said. He suggested that Copilot, which incorporates OpenAI technology into Microsoft\u2019s products has failed to deliver transformative results for customers.\n\n\u201cCustomers are not finding themselves transformed with this Copilot technology,\u201d Benioff said. He added, \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to these customers, they barely use it, and that\u2019s only if they don\u2019t already have a ChatGPT license or something like that in front of them.\u201d\n\nBenioff said Salesforce is making progress in the AI space, highlighting the company\u2019s focus on delivering an \u201cagentic platform\u201d that is already in production and widely adopted by enterprise customers. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering this at scale globally to our customers,\u201d he said, adding that Salesforce is currently handling two trillion enterprise AI transactions per week.\n\nHe suggested that Microsoft\u2019s AI strategy has not resonated with enterprise customers, claiming, \u201cCustomers don\u2019t look at them and don\u2019t take them seriously in AI, nor should they, because they\u2019re not even making the AI themselves.\u201d\n\nBenioff also commented on Microsoft\u2019s business strategy, accusing the company of being a \u201cfast follower\u201d in the software industry. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will try to copy our stuff like they usually do and move towards us, but we\u2019re out there right now in production with thousands of customers,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the recent Microsoft AI Tour in Bengaluru, Nadella said that \u201cbuilding agents should be as simple as creating a spreadsheet\u201d. He introduced a no-code platform called Copilot Studio that allows users to create new agents based on their needs.\n\n\u201cThink of AI as a co-pilot for your work. It\u2019s the UI for AI,\u201d Nadella said, illustrating the role it will play as an interface between employees and the AI. He gave the example of an AI agent in a healthcare setting, describing a scenario where a doctor prepares for a tumour board meeting, and the AI creates the agenda, prioritises cases, and takes detailed notes during the discussion.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce launched Agentforce 2.0 last month, an upgraded version of its digital labour platform designed to augment enterprise teams with autonomous AI agents.",

They will complement the skills Salesforce already offers for merchandisers, marketers and customer service reps.\n\nRetail Cloud with Modern POS will help retailers serve customers online and offline with features like mobile POS, clienteling, endless aisle, mixed cart and omnichannel fulfillment, and inventory management, per the release.\n\n\u201cWith these latest Agentforce skills for retail and a cloud-based, intuitive POS system, Salesforce is helping retailers deliver seamless, unified shopping experiences across both the physical and digital realms of retail that drive productivity advancements and business growth across their entire enterprise,\u201d Mangtani said in the release.\n\nSalesforce is among the software giants that have placed AI agents at the core of their AI plans. While AI copilots have flourished following the popularity of ChatGPT, AI agents are designed to take things further by performing tasks or providing services autonomously.\n\nOn Thursday (Jan. 9), Talkdesk introduced AI Agents for Retail that can perform tasks like customer identification and authentication, real-time order status, tracking and updates, shipping address modifications and connecting customers with in-store specialists.\n\nOn the same day, Zebra Technologies debuted a new set of AI tools for frontline retail workers and said it will add a new suite of AI agents in the second quarter. The suite will include things like a knowledge agent that will give workers the information they need, when they need it, and a sales agent that will help with product-related questions.\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.",

Here\u2019s how their pricing and essential CRM features compare.\n\nPricing\n\nSalesforce and Zoho have competitively priced entry-level subscription services. However, adding services creates a bigger price differential between the vendors.\n\nSalesforce\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Starter Suite plan is available on a month-to-month basis. All other plans require an annual contract. Note that Salesforce has a vast array of offerings. For simplicity, the pricing below is for the Salesforce Sales Cloud solution.\n\nPlan Price Features Starter Suite $25 per user, per month (billed monthly or annually) Account, contact, lead, task and opportunity management\n\nEinstein Activity Capture\n\nLead assignment and routing\n\nWeb-to-lead capture\n\nMass email\n\nEmail productivity tools\n\nOpportunity management\n\nCustomizable sales processes\n\nCustomizable reports and dashboards\n\nProducts and price books\n\nFiles and case management\n\nEmail integration Pro Suite $100 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Starter Suite, plus: Enhanced customization and automation\n\nSales quoting and forecasting\n\nPerson accounts\n\nForecasting mobile app\n\nOrders and quotes\n\nTopics and recommendations\n\nLightning App Builder\n\nAppExchange Enterprise $165 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Professional, plus: Opportunity splits\n\nOpportunity scoring\n\nDeal insights\n\nPipeline inspection\n\nWaterfall chart\n\nApproval process Unlimited $330 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Enterprise, plus: Predictive AI\n\nSales engagement hub\n\nConversation intelligence\n\nLead scoring\n\nOne partial and one full sandbox per organization Einstein 1 Sales $500 per user, per month (billed annually) Everything in Unlimited, plus: Generative AI\n\nUnified data\n\nSales planning, programs and collaboration\n\nKnowledge base\n\nSales Elevate with Slack\n\nWhile Salesforce has a reasonably priced starter tier, it can end up being one of the more expensive CRMs. It has many more available add-ons than most competitors, which tend to bundle features in their pricing tier ranges. Take advantage of Salesforce\u2019s 30-day free trial to test the platform and ensure it\u2019s worth the investment for your business.\n\nZoho\n\nZoho allows you to pay monthly or annually on all tiers. We were impressed that it offers a free tier for up to three users, which many small businesses will appreciate.\n\nPlan Price Features Free Free (up to three users) Basic contact and deal management\n\nEmail marketing\n\nStandard reports\n\nOne web form\n\n2,000 workflow rules\n\n5 tasks per action\n\n1 auto-response rule Standard $14 per user, per month (billed annually) $20 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in the Free plan, plus: 100 custom reports\n\n10 custom dashboards\n\nCharts and key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\n250 emails a day\n\n100 email templates\n\nSocial data enrichment\n\nAutomation workflows\n\nCustom fields\n\n1GB of free file storage plus 512MB per user license\n\nCadences\n\n5 auto-response rules Professional $23 per user, per month (billed annually) $35 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Standard, plus: 500 mass emails daily\n\nUnlimited email templates\n\nInventory management\n\nConfigure, price and quote (CPQ) tool\n\nWebhooks\n\n10 auto-response rules\n\nGoogle Ads integration\n\nAssignment rules Enterprise $40 per user, per month (billed annually) $50 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Professional, plus: 1,000 mass emails daily\n\nAccess to the Zia AI assistant\n\nEmail and call intent, sentiment and emotion\n\nEmail enrichment\n\nCall transcription\n\nMultiuser portals\n\nAdvanced analytics\n\nData enrichment\n\nAttribution\n\nSegmentation\n\n100,000 webform analytics Ultimate $52 per user, per month (billed annually) $65 per user, per month (billed monthly) Everything in Enterprise, plus: 2,000 mass emails daily\n\nEnhanced storage and feature limits\n\nExtended AI capabilities\n\nAdvanced customer support\n\nDedicated database clusters\n\n5GB of free file storage\n\n300,000 webform analytics\n\nYou\u2019ll pay much less for Zoho\u2019s top tier than Salesforce\u2019s top or even middle tiers. However, as with Salesforce, your actual costs will vary if you must buy add-ons. The Standard, Professional and Enterprise tiers have a 15-day free trial; the Ultimate tier offers an extended 30-day trial.\n\nBest for Pricing Zoho Zoho wins this round with its lower pricing. The ability to pay monthly \u2015 albeit at a higher price \u2015 is helpful for many businesses.

            "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed.\n\nIn his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: \u201cI think that\u2019s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I\u2019m aware of that and I\u2019m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone\u2019s, we\u2019re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about \u201cprivate equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.\u201d He added and mentioned, \u201cMarc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA\u2019s performance! So [inaudible] we\u2019ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there\u2019s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!\u201d\n\nHowever, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes \u201cthat will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there\u2019s now reacceleration in tech spend.\u201d\n\nThe CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated \u201cI think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight\u2019s CES talk. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!\u201d\n\nAlong with industrial and material stocks, another sector that\u2019s caught Cramer\u2019s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that \u201cone of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there\u2019s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.\u201d",

When asked if Salesforce would have more or fewer employees in five years, he said he thinks the company will \"probably be larger\".\"We're not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we're using for engineering teams by more than 30% to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can't believe what we're achieving in engineering,\" the CEO said.\"And then, we will have less support engineers next year because we have an agentic layer. We will have more salespeople next year because we really need to explain to people exactly the value that we can achieve with AI. So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term,\" he added.Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India, also told ET last month that AI will enable the workforce to expand their capabilities.\"If you look at people, consumers, all our demands are not met. You go into a state hospital, the doctors are overworked. Workforce is limited by the number of hours that they have at their disposal. What AI actually can do is to unlimit this limitation. Your employment opportunities will go up, maybe the roles will be different. Transition would be a little painful, but it will happen.\" Salesforce doubled its India headcount in the country in the last few years, Bhattacharya told ET in September.",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nOn January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%.\n\nDiscussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth.\n\nLip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range.\n\nLip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term.",

            "content": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In the frothy business of selling artificial intelligence service, Salesforce Inc. has been punching above its own weight. \u201cSalesforce?\u201d I hear you wonder. The folks in the dull business of selling customer relationship management software?\n\nYes, and they\u2019re getting aggressive about AI too. The company has just become the first major tech firm to launch a new breed of generative AI tools known as \u201cagents,\u201d which others on the cutting edge of the field have long talked about without delivering anything. And unlike its peers, Salesforce is explicit about how its novel tools will displace jobs. The approach is bold but could be what\u2019s needed to push the firm ahead in the AI race as younger companies like OpenAI and Anthropic encroach on its territory.\n\nYou can attribute this feistiness to Marc Benioff, the larger-than-life chief executive officer of Salesforce whose maverick strategies helped him spearhead the software-as-a-service (SaaS) revolution, and grabbed him a client base that includes 90% of Fortune 500 companies, including Walt Disney Co. and Ford Motor Co. Salesforce makes money by selling subscriptions to applications like Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, which companies use to keep track of their sales and customer service processes. Salesforce\u2019s big pitch at Dreamforce this week \u2014 its lavish conference that all but takes over downtown San Francisco each year \u2014 was Agentforce, a new service that lets customers deploy autonomous AI-powered agents.\n\nAccording to Salesforce, bots are out and agents are in. The former are the chatbots, powered by technology from firms like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, that sit in the corner of a website and can answer a customer\u2019s questions. Now, instead of just dispensing information, agents can take action. They can file a complaint, book an appointment or change a shipping address on file.\n\n\u201cTaking action\u201d might sound like a huge risk for businesses to make with AI, given that generative models are known to hallucinate, and chatbots have occasionally given erroneous information to customers. Imagine an AI model mishandling a booking.\n\nSalesforce says that won\u2019t be a problem. \u201cHallucinations go down to zero because [Agentforce] is only allowed to generate content from the sources you\u2019ve trained it on,\u201d corporate strategy director Bill Patterson tells me. That makes it more reliable than OpenAI, he adds, which scrapes the public internet and all its false content.\n\nThat\u2019s a daring premise. What\u2019s also daring: Salesforce has become quite comfortable addressing an issue that AI companies until now have mostly tiptoed around \u2014 that success for their business customers is measured by cutting costs, a.k.a. fewer jobs. One executive from a separate AI company recently told me their enterprise customers were hesitant to go public as a case study because they feared reputational blowback. Slashing jobs isn\u2019t a great look.\n\nBut Salesforce had several case studies to point to on Tuesday, like education publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc., which used Agentforce over the last three months to nearly halve the time spent answering customer inquiries. August and September are when Wiley normally hires many more people to handle the spike in demand from students going back to school, but with Agentforce it didn\u2019t have to shell out on new recruits, according to Salesforce.\n\n\u201cWhat if you could surge your service organization and you could surge your sales organization without hiring more people?\u201d Benioff asked in his keynote on Tuesday. \u201cThat's Agentforce.\u201d\n\nBenioff reportedly rewrote his keynote days before the conference because he believed he had to address the \u201cdeep frustration around AI.\u201d One result seems to be that he didn\u2019t hold back. And just to underscore Salesforce\u2019s belief that Agentforce will replace humans, the company has flipped its business model for the service. Instead of charging per head, which would mean its revenue only grows if its customers hired more people, Agentforce charges $2 \u201cper conversation.\u201d So if a client like Wiley hires fewer workers, it can still pay Salesforce more. It\u2019s a shrewd pricing strategy.\n\nTime will tell if businesses record a return on investment from Salesforce\u2019s newfangled tools, particularly when many firms are finding it difficult to measure the success of generative AI. But it marks a clear threat to newer firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have admitted behind closed doors (to me) that they use Salesforce themselves \u2014 and that what they\u2019re offering to customers is an additional service to Salesforce\u2019s CRM software. For many chief innovation officers, it\u2019s far easier to tell their sales staff that they can just keep using Salesforce, which is already plugged into their data and processes, rather than get used to yet another thing on their computers. Nobody wants to have to look at yet another thing.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s entrenched, wide distribution puts it in a strong position at a time when larger companies are generally slow about adopting new tech, including generative AI.

The study shares insights from 3,350 leaders of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) across 26 countries, including 50 from Singapore.\n\nYou might find it interesting that SMBs in Singapore are embracing artificial intelligence (AI) at a remarkable rate. According to the report, 94% of SMBs in Singapore are either experimenting with or have implemented AI in their operations. The top three uses of AI among these businesses are marketing campaign optimisation, automated service chatbots, and lead prioritisation.\n\nMoreover, 87% of SMB leaders in Singapore who use AI say it has increased their revenue. However, 44% are concerned that their companies might be left behind when it comes to AI adoption.\n\nChallenges with technology complexity\n\nAs technology evolves, you may find it challenging to keep up with the changes. In Singapore, 72% of SMB leaders say that keeping pace with changing technology is difficult. Additionally, 40% mention that there isn\u2019t enough time to master all the technology their company uses. A significant 92% believe that improving the quality of their data would increase revenue.\n\nImportance of trust in the AI era\n\nTrust plays a crucial role in technology adoption. You might be among the 80% of SMB leaders in Singapore who would spend more on technology from trusted vendors. However, there are concerns about AI. The top three concerns among SMBs in Singapore are security issues, poor integration with existing technology, and difficulty keeping up with AI as it evolves.\n\nSujith Abraham, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Salesforce ASEAN, commented on the findings: \u201cSMBs in Singapore are already seeing clear benefits from AI despite having fewer resources than enterprises, proving that growth and innovation are not limited by size. As AI agents evolve with unprecedented levels of intelligence, they can empower SMBs to build a limitless workforce across business functions. Solutions like Agentforce 2.0, the first digital labour platform, levels the playing field for SMBs by giving them access to trusted, rapidly customisable AI agents with pre-built skills \u2013 capable of independent, multistep actions to scale their workforce and compete with large enterprises.\u201d\n\nFrom a customer perspective, Mushi Luke, CIO of HEPMIL Media Group, said: \u201cAs the creator economy continues its rapid growth, with an increasing number of creators entering the space and the complexity of business operations generating a significant volume of administrative tasks, the adoption of Agentforce looks promising in scaling up to meet these evolving business needs. AI-driven solutions have the potential to transform traditionally high-touch human interactions into a hybrid human-AI collaboration. By reimagining workforce dynamics and leveraging AI technologies like Agentforce, we are paving the way for a more labour-efficient, innovative, and sustainable approach to managing growth and complexity.\u201d",

The startup\u2019s software aims to help media relations teams manage communications, media requests, and issues more efficiently with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and track the impact of their work.\n\nHeinrich, who is executive director of media relations and issues management at the University of British Columbia (UBC), initially launched Broadsight as a Google Sheet database to satisfy his own needs. Over time, it has spun out of UBC and grown into a standalone company whose software has also been adopted by other large universities and organizations.\n\nLowry said Heinrich recently decided to step aside and recruit a new leader with more experience building tech startups to lead Broadsight through its next stage of growth, but will remain very involved with the business going forward. Broadsight co-founder and CTO John-Jose Nunez rounds out the company\u2019s three-member C-suite.\n\nLowry has previously launched and built two tech startups of his own\u2014in-cab advertising business Play Taxi Media and online ad marketplace Discover Media House\u2014and spent some time working in corporate development roles with two prominent British Columbia tech companies in social media management firm Hootsuite and legaltech scaleup Clio.\n\nRELATED: Clio tops $4-billion CAD valuation with largest software funding round in Canadian tech history\n\nHe also served as vice president of technology banking at Silicon Valley Bank and helped found Vancouver innovation advocacy organization Frontier Collective and the AI Network of British Columbia.\n\nLowry said he hopes to use his experience and network to build Broadsight into \u201ca one-stop shop\u201d for professionals to communicate with journalists and manage their teams.\n\nTo date, Broadsight has largely been self-financed, raising less than $100,000 CAD in external funding from friends and family.\n\nAccording to Lowry, the now nine-person startup has grown 10 percent month-over-month during the last six months, caters to 15 large clients\u2014including four of Canada\u2019s top 10 universities by enrollment and a number of health authorities\u2014and is approaching profitability.\n\nRELATED: Hootsuite to acquire social media analytics firm Talkwalker\n\nLowry indicated that Broadsight is looking to raise $500,000 in pre-seed financing this year, but is mindful of current market conditions and has not yet fully committed to the venture capital route.\n\nBroadsight is currently targeting large organizations faced with managing inbound requests and public scrutiny. In the future, Lowry sees potential for it to meet the needs of clients of all sizes.\n\nLowry also believes there is more room for Broadsight to deploy AI tools, noting the startup is already using the tech to analyze and summarize emails from journalists and help generate key messaging. The goal is to remove busy work and free up communications professionals to focus on crafting responses and building relationships.\n\nFeature image courtesy Broadsight.",

            "content": "We\u2019ve updated our page on Salesforce Agentforce to include details of the release of Agentforce 2dx and otehr Agentforce-related announcements from Salesforce.\n\nSince its launch at the Dreamforce conference in September 2024, Salesforce Agentforce changed the conversation around AI, customer experience and customer service. Shortly after the launch, Salesforce announced it was hiring more than 1,000 employees to meet the demand for Agentforce.\n\nAt the time of the Agentforce announcement, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called Agentforce \u201cthe third wave of AI \u2014 advancing beyond copilots to a new era of highly accurate, low-hallucination intelligent agents that actively drive customer success.\u201d\n\nThe platform is so important to Salesforce that Benioff declared at the Agentforce launch, \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re going to do at Salesforce is Agentforce.\u201d\n\nAsk MarTechBot about Salesforce Agentforce\n\nAsk MarTechBot your questions about Salesforce Agentforce and agentic AI. Ask it how companies are using Agentforce, Agentforce success stories and more.\n\nPlease note that your conversations will be recorded.\n\nMarTechBot is thinking . . . \u00d7\n\nWhat is Agentforce?\n\nAgentforce is essentially a platform layer in the Salesforce ecosystem. Agentforce bots are generative AI bots, but unlike popular genAI platforms like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, Salesforce says its Agentforce bots can be trusted to take action on their own.\n\nUnlike earlier chatbots, AI agents do not follow a prescribed pattern of answers to common queries, but are capable of responding more flexibly to questions or issues because they are trained on internal data and are capable of drawing on the support of a large language model (LLM). Salesforce\u2019s agentic AI, for example, can be trained on data in Salesforce Data Cloud.\n\nAgentforce combines three major Salesforce tools \u2014 Agent Builder, Model Builder and Prompt Builder \u2014 to deliver out-of-the-box bots that work across industries. The bots are customized using inexpensive, low-code tools.\n\nThe initial agents created with Agentforce include:\n\nCampaign Optimizer, which manages and executes full campaign lifecycles.\n\nwhich manages and executes full campaign lifecycles. Service Agent , which replaces chatbots in handling customer service.\n\n, which replaces chatbots in handling customer service.

Sales Development Representative , which engages with potential leads 24/7.\n\n, which engages with potential leads 24/7. Sales Coach, which helps train sales teams and lets sellers practice pitching.\n\nGeneral availability for Agentforce One began on Oct. 25, 2024, with pricing starting at $2 per conversation, with discounts available to large users\n\nSalesforce also announced the Agentforce Partner Network at the launch. It lets other organizations deploy third-party agents or use third-party actions when designing custom agents in Agentforce.\n\nDig deeper: Customer experience management in the age of agentic AI\n\nHow does Agentforce work?\n\nDuring the initial Agentforce announcement at Dreamforce, Benioff said Agentforce is designed for customers who don\u2019t know much about AI or building bots.\n\n\u201cThey are not going to have to be an expert in an LLM, they are not going to have to understand all of these deep capabilities that you would need to know to be a computer scientist,\u201d he said. This is \u201cAI for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nAgentforce is powered by an upgraded version of Salesforce\u2019s Einstein AI called Atlas Reasoning Engine, which is \u201cdesigned to simulate how humans think and plan.\u201d\n\nAt the announcement, Salesforce drew a comparison to self-driving cars. Agentforce can interpret data to adapt to conditions in real time and can act independently within a company\u2019s guardrails.\n\nBenioff said Agentforce has the lowest hallucination rate of any generative AI but did not say what that rate is.\n\nEnhanced Atlas Reasoning Engine\n\nSalesforce announced in December 2024 that its Atlas Reasoning Engine was improved with advanced reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), allowing agents to handle more complex, multistep questions and provide more accurate and precise answers.\n\nThe enhanced RAG capabilities let users verify information by giving inline citations with agent responses. Citing the exact sources builds trust in the AI\u2019s output. It also helps users check for accuracy.\n\nData Cloud\n\nData Cloud provides the customer data that grounds Agentforce, making agents more contextually aware, knowledgeable and adaptable to customer needs. Data Cloud connects, unifies and harmonizes customer data and metadata, giving agents access to the exact information they need to deliver precise, contextual responses. It makes structured and unstructured data \u2013 including emails, transcripts and PDFs \u2013 easily digestible by large language models (LLMs). The RAG functionality allows users to upload files and URLs as data sources for their agent.\n\nCustomer 360\n\nAgentforce is deeply integrated with Salesforce Customer 360, leveraging applications like sales, service, marketing and commerce. A complete view of the customer is critical to seamless hand-offs to human agents with the full conversation history.\n\nMuleSoft\n\nMuleSoft is an integration, automation and API management platform. It extends Agentforce capabilities by enabling Salesforce developers and admins to leverage their APIs and bring in third-party data.\n\nSlack\n\nSlack is a central point for employees to interact with Agentforce. They can access information, trigger workflows and manage tasks directly within Slack, which means they don\u2019t have to jump between applications.\n\nAgentforce also uses Slack Enterprise Search to learn from conversations in Slack channels and direct messages. This helps agents provide more relevant responses and actions based on the context of conversations.\n\nTableau\n\nTableau Einstein is an AI-powered visual analytics platform that includes Agentforce. It is designed to intelligently embed data and insights across the flow of work and encourages employees to use data to drive action.\n\nDig deeper: 4 key features in Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce 2.0\n\nAgentforce Testing Center\n\nIn December 2024, Salesforce announced The Testing Center, which lets businesses test their AI agents before deployment. The Testing Center gives Agentforce users an opportunity to ensure the agents follow instructions, stay factual and work quickly. This helps mitigate risks and ensures agents perform consistently and reliably. It also provides tools that make it easier to test, audit and scale agents.\n\nLibrary of skills and integrations\n\nAlso announced in December 2024, this library spans key business applications like CRM, Slack and Tableau, and integrations from AppExchange partners. These ready-to-use skills simplify the process of building tailored AI agents. The library has pre-built Slack Actions like Create Canvas and Message Channel, which let teams create agents for their Slack workflows.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nThe CRM Skills let you create agents to automate and enhance customer experiences. These agents can do things like lead nurturing, sales coaching, and scheduling service engagements among other functions.\n\nlet you create agents to automate and enhance customer experiences.

It is aimed at facilitating the creation of AI agents by retail brands to supply what Salesforce is calling \u201cdigital labor.\u201d\n\nThe new skills available in Agentforce for Retail include:\n\nOrder management. Self-service order servicing options allowing customers to conversationally update order information like payment or shipping details.\n\nSelf-service order servicing options allowing customers to conversationally update order information like payment or shipping details.

Loyalty promotion creation.

It says agents at help.salesforce.com now handle 83% of customer support queries independently, with human escalations dropping by 50% in the two weeks after it was implemented.\n\nRBC uses Atlas and Data Cloud with Agentforce to help its financial advisors. Salesforce Data Cloud integrates all RBC client data into a unified system, giving advisors a comprehensive view of their clients. Atlas can answer complex client questions using multistep reasoning. It also pulls from RBC\u2019s data and business logic to deliver a reliable answer.\n\nAccenture uses Agentforce to give employees quick updates on important accounts. It helps automate document retrieval and makes recommendations for solving business problems. It also streamlines proposal creation and visualization and enhances employee collaboration by providing real-time updates, retrieving documents, offering proactive recommendations and creating proposals.\n\nOther companies publicly identified by Salesforce as Agentfore customers include:\n\nThe Adecco Group\n\nBACA Systems\n\nOpenTable\n\nSaks\n\nSharkNinja\n\nWayfair\n\nWiley\n\nDig deeper: SharkNinja embarks on its Salesforce AI journey\n\nSalesforce and Google expand partnership around Agentforce\n\nSalesforce customers will be able to build Agentforce agents using Googlr Gemini and deploy Salesforce on Google Cloud, thanks to an expanded partnership between the two compnies.\n\nOne example of the expanded partnership is an integration between Grounding with Google Search through Vertex AI and the zero copy partnership between Salesforce Data Cloud and Google BigQuery. This integration will give Agentforce agents the ability to reference up-to-the-minute data, news, current events and credible citations, substantially enhancing their contextual awareness and ability to deliver accurate, evidence-backed responses.\n\nIn a real-worlkd example from supply chain management and logistics, an agent built with Agentforce could track shipments and monitor inventory levels in Salesforce Commerce Cloud, and proactively identify potential disruptions using real-time data from Google Search, including weather conditions, port congestion and geopolitical events.\n\nBefore the end of 2025, Google\u2019s Gemini models will be available for prompt building and reasoning directly within Agentforce. This will provide users with agents with multi-modal capabilities, expanded contextual understanding and reasoning and increased speed and efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, businesses will be able to use Salesforce\u2019s unified platform (Agentforce, Data Cloud and Customer 360) on Google Cloud\u2019s highly secure, AI-optimized infrastructure, benefiting from features like dynamic grounding, zero data retention and toxicity detection provided by Salesforce\u2019s Einstein Trust Layer.\n\nOnce Salesforce products are available on Google Cloud, customers will also have the ability to procure Salesforce offerings through the Google Cloud Marketplace, the companies announced.\n\nSalesforce introduces Agentforce 2dx\n\nSalesforce released Agentforce 2dx in early March 2025. Agentforce 2dx expands beyond the reactive, user-initiated world of chat interfaces and enables proactive AI agents to work behind the scenes, without constant human oversight, to unlock new customer and employee workflows of any kind.\n\nIn its announcement, Salesforce said Agentforce 2dx will allow organizations to seamlessly integrate autonomous agents into their existing data systems, business logic and user interfaces. These agents will be able to anticipate business needs and dynamically take action\u200c.\n\nOther Agentforce-related announcements made with the release of Agentforce 2dx include:\n\nA set of low-code and pro-code tools for Salesforce developers to confidently configure, test and deploy Agentforce faster, paired with advanced analytics to help teams monitor, debug and optimize agent performance with real-time data and guidance.\n\nAgentforce Developer Edition, a completely free environment where developers can prototype agents using Agentforce and explore the capabilities of Salesforce Data Cloud.\n\nAgentExchange, a trusted marketplace and community for Agentforce that is built into Salesforce, AgentExchange includes a library of ready-to-use templates and actions, saving businesses time and resources while enabling partners to list their components for sale and capture their share of the growing AI agent market. AgentExchange launched with more than 200 partners and hundreds of ready-made actions.\n\nThe Agentblazer community, an inclusive group for Salesforce admins, developers, CTOs, CIOs and other IT leaders where they can share best practices and learn skills on Trailhead to create agent-first companies.\n\nDig deeper: Salesforce & Microsoft square off with new AI sales agents",

Nadella said the rise of agents is going to change enterprise apps. He believes a lot of the functionality currently in enterprise apps will move to agents. Business applications will \u201ccollapse in some way\u201d and surrender a lot of their functionality to agents.\n\n01:15 \u2014 Nadella\u2019s comments about how power will shift away from business apps toward agents were a huge endorsement for the position Marc Benioff and Salesforce have staked out. Benioff\u2019s message has been, essentially, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a master of both copilots and agents.\u201d He views copilots as a cool, simpler tool from yesterday, while agents represent the future.\n\nAI Agent & Copilot Summit NA is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents for mid-market and enterprise companies. It takes place March 17-19 in San Diego, CA. Register now to attend.\n\n02:18 \u2014 Microsoft has a different view and many customers do. By stating what he did, Nadella is going to give a lot of credence to Benioff\u2019s position. Nadella\u2019s comments on the BG2 podcast \u2014particularly the idea that business apps and agents may merge or shift \u2014 have gotten a lot of interest. Over the past six months, Benioff has been all-in on his vision for agents and what they can achieve.\n\n03:32 \u2014 Benioff himself has been as visible as I\u2019ve ever seen during this time. He has described agents as constituting a new resource of digital labor. He believes agents will enable companies to expand into new markets where talent has been difficult to find. This first-mover status is something Salesforce holds right now in the enormous agents market.\n\n04:18 \u2014 Directly or indirectly, Satya Nadella\u2019s comments have given credence to Benioff\u2019s position for Salesfroce. That said, the market is clearly large enough for multiple companies to succeed. But Benioff and Salesforce have taken the high ground as thought leaders here. They\u2019ve laid out the vision, provided the strategy, and openly shared their ideas worldwide.",

            "content": "Sales teams face constant pressure to deliver accurate quotes quickly while catering to increasingly complex customer needs.\n\nSalesforce Revenue Cloud, a solution that combines sales, billing, and CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote), helps meet these demands.\n\nWhile Salesforce Revenue Cloud offers a high-functionality, businesses often find additional value in exploring complementary or alternative tools like PandaDoc, which enhance and extend its capabilities.\n\nHere we\u2019ll get into Salesforce Revenue Cloud, its key features, the role of CPQ, and how PandaDoc provides additional tools to meet your business needs and improve partner relationship management.\n\nWhat is Salesforce Revenue Cloud?\n\nSalesforce Revenue Cloud is a specialized suite within the Salesforce ecosystem designed to manage the entire revenue lifecycle.\n\nIts integration of billing, subscription management, and CPQ capabilities allows businesses to sync their sales and revenue teams and processes.\n\nBy doing this, businesses have smoother running operations, more accuracy, and improved customer relationships.\n\nAt its core, Salesforce Revenue Cloud simplifies traditionally complex processes.\n\nSee also Find the best CPQ software for your business needs\n\nBy automating pricing, configuration, and invoicing, it enables sales teams to focus on closing deals rather than dealing with administrative tasks which can be both time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nIt also supports revenue recognition and subscription management, so you can rest easy knowing you\u2019re compliant with financial standards and recurring revenue workflows.\n\nDespite these advantages, Salesforce Revenue Cloud\u2019s pricing model\u2014often bundled with Salesforce\u2019s broader offerings\u2014can make it an expensive option, especially for smaller businesses.\n\nDue to this, many SMBs (small to medium businesses) search for alternatives or complementary tools to maximize ROI.\n\nWant to take PandaDoc CPQ for a test drive? Start your free 14-day trial\n\nCPQ and Salesforce Revenue Cloud\n\nOne of Salesforce Revenue Cloud\u2019s standout features is Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ), an impressive and highly-useful tool for handling the complexities of pricing and quoting.\n\nCPQ software automates the configuration of products or services, enforces pricing rules, and generates error-free quotes.\n\nSound too good to be true? Luckily for you, it isn\u2019t.\n\nFor businesses with intricate product catalogs, CPQ is indispensable.\n\nHaving it in your back pocket means sales representatives can confidently configure products, even when compatibility rules or customizations are involved. This eliminates the risk of errors that could otherwise derail deals.\n\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all!\n\nCPQ\u2019s ability to update pricing based on discounts, tiered structures, or real-time market changes allows sales teams to stay agile and competitive within the market.\n\nBeyond its technical capabilities, CPQ improves the customer experience through personalized quotes.\n\nCustomers receive tailored pricing and product recommendations, which builds trust and improves the chances of conversion.\n\nSalesforce CPQ also shortens the sales cycle, allowing deals to close faster.\n\nChallenges solved by CPQ\n\nPricing and quoting processes are often fraught with inefficiencies, errors, and delays, especially for businesses that rely on manual methods or are dealing with disconnected systems.\n\nThis can decrease profitability and diminish customer confidence and retention.\n\nSalesforce CPQ addresses these challenges through automation and integration.\n\nBy enforcing product rules, it eliminates the possibility of incompatible configurations, a common issue in industries with complex offerings.\n\nThe system\u2019s pricing automation makes sure quotes reflect accurate pricing, taxes, and discounts, reducing the potential for costly errors.\n\nEven better, Salesforce CPQ connects with the billing system, giving your team a smooth transition from quote to invoice.\n\nThese capabilities significantly transform the quoting process.\n\nFor example, a manufacturing company using Salesforce CPQ could generate a detailed, accurate quote in minutes, complete with product customizations and pricing rules, instead of spending hours manually compiling the information.\n\nSales reps are able to have a better forecasting workflow through salesforce billing.\n\nSee also Fitting CPQ into your sales org architecture\n\nAlternatives to Salesforce Revenue Cloud\n\nWhile Salesforce Revenue Cloud offers impressive features, businesses often look to tools that can complement or provide alternatives to its functionality.\n\nOne such tool is PandaDoc, a document automation platform that enhances CPQ workflows through its emphasis on simplicity, collaboration, and integration.\n\nOur client Avantio sends proposals within 10 seconds and has increased their digital marketing sales 200% in one month since adopting PandaDoc.\n\n\u201cPreviously, we used ancient software that just didn\u2019t provide the user-friendliness and efficiencies we needed to better serve our customers.

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nMobile and social commerce drove holiday sales that beat forecasts, according to a Salesforce report released Monday. The data indicates holiday retail sales reached $282 billion in the U.S., up 4% year over year, and $1.2 trillion globally, a 3% rise from last year.\n\nBoth retailers and consumers used AI to enhance the shopping experience with elements like product recommendations, targeted offers and personalized customer order support. AI and agents influenced 19%, or $229 billion, of all online holiday season orders, per the report.\n\nHowever, the rate of returns for online purchases also rose by 28% to $122 billion globally from last year. Consumer behaviors like bracketing and try-on-hauls may affect profit margins as the total figure for returns may rise to $133 billion, Salesforce said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nArtificial intelligence \u2014 and a rising rate of returns \u2014 are increasingly influencing retail for consumers and businesses.\n\n\u201cRetailers had a robust holiday season, but a 28% rise in the rate of returns compared to last year is a cause for some concern,\u201d Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights, said in a statement. \u201cRetailers who have embraced AI and agents are already seeing the benefits, but these tools will be even more critical in the new year as retailers aim to minimize revenue losses on returns and reengage with shoppers.\u201d\n\nAnalysis from other industry groups appear to confirm trends on returns. In December, the National Retail Federation forecast that shoppers would return $890 billion worth of merchandise in 2024. And a more recent report late last month from Appriss Retail and Deloitte found that retailers lost $103 billion in 2024 due to fraudulent returns and claims.\n\nMeanwhile, use of generative AI features in retail increased 25% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 compared to September and October in 2024, according to Salesforce\u2019s data, which is based on an analysis of 1.5 billion shoppers and 1.6 trillion page views across its platform.\n\nVirtual event / Free to access How the 2024 Holiday Season Fared & What It Says About 2025, from the editorial team at Retail Dive. Go deeper with an exclusive virtual event,, from the editorial team at Retail Dive. Learn more \u2794\n\nMobile and social commerce also shaped the holiday shopping season, Salesforce\u2019s data found.\n\nAlthough the share of global mobile traffic held steady, the percentage of orders placed on mobile rose to nearly 70%, up from 67% the prior year. The analysis also found that mobile buying reached its peak on Christmas Day, comprising 79% of all orders. That\u2019s up from 77% in 2023. Overall, Salesforce said mobile devices accounted for $842 billion in global sales and $195 billion in the U.S. in November and December.\n\nSocial media drove 14% of traffic to e-commerce sites during the holidays, an 8% uptick from last year, while social commerce strategies drove 20% holiday sales on platforms like Instagram and TikTok Shop.\n\nAnd while Salesforce characterized discount offers as \u201clackluster for consumers this holiday season\u201d it noted that loyalty programs appear to be driving customer retention. Seventy-two percent of U.S. shoppers surveyed said a loyalty program increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll keep shopping with a brand.\n\nSalesforce in August had forecast $1.19 trillion in global sales and $277 billion in the U.S. for Nov. 1 through Dec. 31. Salesforce\u2019s forecast contrasts slightly with the National Retail Federation\u2019s October prediction of holiday season e-commerce spending ranging from $295.1 billion to $297.9 billion.",

It\u2019s also worth noting that we tested in the platform quite recently, so we did have access to the newest interface that was released in July 2024.\n\nIn our testing, we found that Salesforce was quite intuitive when it came to navigating the platform, offering excellent guidance tips built in to find exactly what we needed.\n\nThe features that stood out the most for Salesforce were the analytics. The sheer number of data points you can track, organize, and visualize makes Salesforce an absolute must for businesses in need of data-driven insights. Plus, with the customizable dashboards, you can create helpful reports that you actually understand, making it easy to convey information to your team and others. All that data was a bit intimidating, though, so it could scare off beginners, who aren\u2019t adept at this kind of platform.\n\nThe third-party integrations were also a big boon for Salesforce. There are dozens of them, but even the basic ones make life a lot easier. For example, if you connect your Gmail or Outlook account, you can email leads directly in the platform, drafting and sending them in a simple pop-up on the customer page.\n\nSalesforce also has a very available customer support team, allowing users to reach them via email, phone, and live chat. On top of that, the Guidance Center made solving issues easy, providing how-to guides and tips for navigating the system, including pop-ups that demonstrate exactly what you\u2019re trying to do.\n\nAll in all, our test found Salesforce to be a more than suitable CRM for most businesses, particularly those in need of regular customer support, in-depth analytics, and a vast selection of third-party integrations, but it can be a bit complicated for beginners, particularly with all that data.",

Agentforce will help prequalify candidates, enhance CVs, and ensure faster job placements. Agentforce agents also operate 24/7, freeing recruiters to focus on meaningful connections while delivering speed and personalization at scale,\u201d said Greg Shewmaker, Senior Vice President of Global Operations and AI, The Adecco Group.\n\n\u201cAt Accenture, we embrace emerging technologies first so we can help our clients go fast. Our sales team within Accenture\u2019s Salesforce Business Group and Accenture Song are starting to use Agentforce to automate contact and close plan creation, surface insights through enterprise search, and keep teams aligned with dynamic updates. It\u2019s helping to increase time-to-effectiveness, accelerate decision-making, and is allowing them to focus on delivering innovative solutions for their clients,\u201d said Stephanie Sadowski, Salesforce Business Group lead at Accenture.\n\nThe Atlas Reasoning Engine is the brain behind Agentforce, enabling it to retrieve relevant data, then reason and act. With Agentforce 2.0, Salesforce is introducing enhanced reasoning and retrieval to handle deeply nuanced questions, powered by new capabilities in Data Cloud that fuel Agentforce with greater context \u2014 complementing structured and unstructured data with business-specific metadata for greater accuracy across the most complex, multi-faceted requests.\n\nAgentforce\u2019s Atlas Reasoning Engine can now handle a wider variety of interactions, including those with multiple layers that require deeper thought. For example, a question that is straightforward, such as \u201cwhat is the status of my portfolio?\u201d will employ basic reasoning for rapid responses. A deeper question, such as \u201cWhat would be the right investment vehicle for my child\u2019s college fund based on my current income and risk preferences?\u201d would use enhanced reasoning with advanced data retrievers \u2014 improving the answer by refining the query before pulling both relevant data and context-specific metadata in Data Cloud. The Atlas Reasoning Engine assesses its own response and loops through a variety of tools and sources in what\u2019s known as an \u2018agentic loop,\u2019 enabling it to provide a trusted, well-researched response or action to nuanced and more complex requests, and do so without writing custom code.\n\nRAG enables Agentforce to quickly find relevant information in unstructured content. To power enhanced reasoning in the Atlas Reasoning Engine, Data Cloud can now enrich RAG chunks \u2014 the snippets of retrieved data \u2014 with metadata from the Salesforce Platform. Enriching RAG indexes with metadata context adapts Agentforce 2.0 to the unique conventions of your business without additional work, improving accuracy and relevancy for even the most intricate requests, while increasing trust through inline citations that point to the exact sources Agentforce pulled from to answer a given question.\n\nWhat this means for ERP insiders\n\nAgentforce built to integrate with ERP systems. Agentforce seamlessly integrates with ERP systems through Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud, which unifies data from internal and external sources, including ERP and Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems. This integration is facilitated by tools like MuleSoft\u2019s pre-built connectors for enterprise systems such as SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics, enabling real-time data synchronization. As a result, AI agents have access to up-to-date information on inventory levels, order statuses, and financial data, supporting automated workflows and reducing manual data entry. By analyzing ERP and SCM data, Agentforce provides predictive insights that aid in decision-making. In agriculture, for example, it can predict demand and optimize supply chain operations by analyzing data on crop yields, inventory levels, and external factors like weather patterns. Agentforce can handle increased workloads without the need for additional staff. In logistics, for example, AI agents can manage higher order volumes during peak seasons by processing large amounts of shipment and delivery data, maintaining service levels without overburdening the workforce.\n\nCo-pilots may end up being a stepping stone. The outlook for AI agents in the ERP space is transformative, with their role evolving from task-specific automation to becoming central drivers of enterprise operations. As AI agents grow more sophisticated, they will integrate predictive analytics, generative AI, and real-time decision-making into ERP systems, automating complex workflows and enabling businesses to scale efficiently. AI copilots, currently a bridge between human operators and systems, will gradually evolve into autonomous agents capable of self-learning and end-to-end process execution. This transition may eventually reduce the need for copilots as their capabilities are subsumed by fully autonomous ERP systems. These self-adapting agents will not only provide insights but also execute strategies, responding dynamically to market conditions and internal demands, paving the way for hyperautomation and decentralized, self-regulating ERP ecosystems. Autonomous ERP systems will emerge as a natural progression of advancements in AI, machine learning, and automation technologies, combined with the increasing integration of IoT, blockchain, and edge computing. Over the next 3\u20135 years, ERP platforms will evolve from rule-based automation to self-learning systems capable of real-time decision-making, leveraging predictive and prescriptive analytics. By 2030, widespread adoption of AI agents and hyperautomation frameworks will enable ERPs to become fully autonomous, managing end-to-end workflows with minimal human intervention. These systems will proactively adjust to dynamic business conditions, optimize resource allocation, and drive continuous improvement, ultimately transforming ERPs into intelligent, self-regulating ecosystems that underpin agile, data-driven enterprises.\n\nERP leaders have agentic AI in their sights. ERP providers are increasingly integrating agentic AI into their platforms, leveraging both organic development and strategic partnerships to deliver smarter, more autonomous solutions for businesses. Industry leaders like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft are embedding AI-powered capabilities into their ERP systems, enabling real-time decision-making, predictive analytics, and process automation. These innovations are often enhanced through partnerships with AI specialists like OpenAI, UiPath, Salesforce and AWS, which provide advanced tools such as generative AI, conversational assistants, and robotic process automation (RPA). Smaller providers like Infor and Acumatica focus on niche applications, while companies like Workday target specific functions like finance and HR. Together, these efforts are transforming ERP systems into intelligent, adaptive ecosystems that help organizations optimize operations, enhance customer experiences, and achieve scalability with minimal human intervention.",

(NYSE:CRM) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Salesforce\n\nNYSE:CRM Ownership Breakdown January 5th 2025\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nNYSE:CRM Earnings and Revenue Growth January 5th 2025\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Salesforce. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.7% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Marc Benioff directly holds 2.3% of the total shares outstanding.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",

            "content": "Reddit Vote Flip Share 0 Shares\n\nConversational AI has come a long way, but one challenge persists: getting systems to engage proactively in a way that feels natural. Many AI tools either wait passively for direct prompts or overwhelm users by jumping into conversations unnecessarily. This is especially tricky in multi-party settings, where timing and relevance are everything. Striking the right balance is crucial\u2014AI needs to contribute meaningfully without interrupting or taking over the discussion.\n\nA team of researchers from Salesforce, The University of Tokyo, UCLA, and Northeastern University offers a fresh approach with the Inner Thoughts framework. This method gives AI an internal \u201ctrain of thoughts,\u201d allowing it to process the conversation quietly, decide whether it has something valuable to add, and find the right moment to contribute. Inspired by how people engage in dialogue, this framework helps AI systems feel more intuitive and context-aware.\n\nThe framework has been tested in two systems: a multi-agent simulation platform and a chatbot called Swimmy. Both demonstrated clear improvements in how well the AI participated in conversations, especially in maintaining coherence and timing.\n\nTechnical Details and Benefits\n\nThe Inner Thoughts framework consists of five main steps: Trigger, Retrieval, Thought Formation, Evaluation, and Participation. When something in the conversation happens, like a pause or a new message, the AI retrieves relevant memories, forms potential responses, and evaluates them. Only the most relevant and timely thoughts are shared, ensuring the AI\u2019s contributions add value without disrupting the flow.\n\nThis framework uses both quick, instinctive responses and more thoughtful, deliberate contributions, mimicking the way humans switch between instinctive reactions and deeper reflections. This dual approach makes the system adaptable to different conversational styles.\n\nSome key benefits include:\n\nBalanced Participation: AI contributes only when it\u2019s meaningful and appropriate. Natural Flow: Contributions fit smoothly into the conversation. Positive Feedback: Users find the AI\u2019s engagement more thoughtful and less intrusive.\n\nInsights from Results\n\nWhen tested against traditional models, the Inner Thoughts framework consistently performed better. Here are some highlights:\n\nImproved Metrics : The AI was rated higher for coherence, engagement, and adaptability.\n\n: The AI was rated higher for coherence, engagement, and adaptability. User Preference : More than 80% of participants preferred conversations with the Inner Thoughts AI.\n\n: More than 80% of participants preferred conversations with the Inner Thoughts AI. Better Timing: The AI\u2019s ability to join conversations at the right moment was a standout feature.\n\nFor example, during a discussion about weekend plans, the AI chimed in about yoga when it recognized the relevance. This kind of thoughtful participation stood in stark contrast to older models, which often missed opportunities or responded out of context.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Inner Thoughts framework marks an important step in making conversational AI more relatable and effective. By focusing on intrinsic motivations and carefully timed participation, it transforms AI from a reactive tool into an active, thoughtful participant. This approach opens up new possibilities for using AI in collaborative environments and social settings. As these systems continue to evolve, frameworks like Inner Thoughts offer a glimpse of how AI can seamlessly integrate into human conversations.\n\nCheck out the Paper.

In that capacity he produces analyses and advises businesses, governments, universities and civic organizations on global economics, international trade and investment, and comparative innovation systems (R&D, technology, entrepreneurship, and business culture). LESS ... MORE\n\nAs a new year begins let\u2019s revisit where the San Francisco/Silicon Valley Bay Area\u2019s economy stands in its long recovery from the pandemic. What we\u2019re seeing is consistent with patterns over 2023 and 2022: a mixed story of slow progress in addressing underlying structural challenges, combined with resurgent innovation at the research and business levels. Here are some high-level takeaways:\n\nThe Underlying Economy\n\nThe region\u2019s job recovery lags California and the nation, largely due to a pullback in tech employment.\n\nHousing costs are rising, a sign of the region\u2019s continuing failure to produce enough housing but also of strong demand.\n\nCommercial office vacancy is at a high of 37% but appears to be turning a corner.\n\nLarge commercial office buildings are selling for approximately half of what they were purchased for pre-pandemic and are being acquired by investors betting on recovery.\n\nCompanies are signing or renewing leases but with smaller footprints.\n\nReturn-to-work mandates by large companies such as Salesforce are starting to draw workers back to offices.\n\nVenture-invested AI companies are committing to significant blocs of office space in San Francisco. AI leasing won\u2019t all fill the vacant space now but points to a major turnaround.\n\n2025 will be another transition year, with a stronger recovery likely in 2026.\n\nHomelessness is a concern but may also be turning a corner. A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned a lower court ruling that prevented cities from closing street encampments. Cities, with encouragement from the State of California, are moving more aggressively to clear the streets while offering supportive services.\n\nRetail theft also remains a problem in some areas. In the November election fed-up California voters by a large margin approved stricter penalties.\n\nTechnology and Innovation\n\nRegulation and housing costs have driven some companies and workers to leave. When companies leave their hiring in the Bay Area remains robust but tends to grow faster elsewhere. Still, while other tech regions have grown the Bay Area is by far the largest.\n\nTexas is seeing net out-migration and falling property values as fewer migrants from California are arriving and some who left the Bay Area are returning \u2013 drawn by the wealth and density of the region\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nCalifornia, anchored by Silicon Valley, leads the nation in company-funded semiconductor R&D, accounting for more than half of semiconductor R&D nationally.\n\nSunnyvale will soon become the headquarters of the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) and of the CHIPS for America Design and Collaboration Facility (DCF), one of three national semiconductor R&D facilities created under the 2021CHIPS Act.\n\nThe top five cities in the United States for patent generation are in Silicon Valley.\n\nOf the top 4 U.S. universities graduating VC-backed startups two \u2013 Stanford and Berkeley \u2013 are in the Bay Area. Stanford ranks first overall and Berkeley first among public universities.\n\nThe Bay Area continues to dramatically outperform other US regions in its production of unicorns, pentacorns ($5B private companies), and decacorns ($10B private companies.)\n\nThe next transformative technology leap led by Silicon Valley is AI. Young, highly capitalized companies producing foundational models are being joined by large numbers of application-based startups. AI startups in the region are attracting one-fourth of global investment in the field. The density of AI jobs (talent) in the Bay Area is the highest in the United States.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThough slowly, and with variation between cities, metrics for the underlying economy are improving. 2025 will be another transition year. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s innovation economy, led by AI, is expanding and will continue to lead the nation and the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin Email Disclaimer Views expressed above are the author's own.",

            "content": "If 2024 was the year companies gained some clarity on future office needs, 2025 is expected to be the year they start calling workers back to fill them.\n\nFrom corporate giants to smaller professional services firms, employers across the country are stepping up their in-person requirements in an attempt to move past the pandemic-related shift toward increased flexible work arrangements. Office market stakeholders point to the escalated mandates, many of which take effect in 2025, as a signal that demand for office space will be on the rebound after years of depressed leasing activity.\n\nAcross the United States, the debate over flexible work policies has settled somewhat since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains a sticking point between employers and their workers as well as the broader office market. Hybrid work mandates have largely been attributed to contributing to the national vacancy rate rising to a record high of about 14%, according to CoStar data.\n\nUp until now, office attendance has largely flatlined, and employees are spending about 60% of their working days in a corporate office, a marginal increase compared to this time last year, according to Stanford University's Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes.\n\nSome of the country's largest landlords say the stricter in-office mandates are enough to bolster growing optimism that the demand for space will climb as corporate heavyweights push to revert back to their pre-pandemic workweek schedules. The number of CEOs who expected their companies to adopt a full return to a five-day workweek climbed to about 85% from the 64% reported last year, according to a recent KPMG survey.\n\n\"This is a sign of things to come,\" Kilroy Realty CEO Angela Aman recently told analysts. \"We're seeing tenants who had reduced space or were actively planning on reducing space in 2025, come back and sort of begin conversations with us because they believe they've overshot those reductions.\"\n\nEven so, more workers regularly commuting to an office may take some time to result in any corresponding spike in demand that landlords and developers have been hopeful about.\n\n\"For the most part, we haven't seen return-to-office mandates translate in to leasing demand,\" said Phil Mobley, CoStar's national director of office analytics. \"There may be fewer move-outs now, but there hasn't been much of an increase in leasing activity to drive any meaningful growth. The sheer force of math suggests that we\u2019re going to be looking at high vacancy for a long time, and it will probably keep rising over the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nHere are some of the largest companies that will pave the way in 2025 for other office tenants to follow their lead in calling more employees back to physical office space.\n\nAmazon\n\nHeadquarters: Seattle\n\nIn-person policy: The retail giant plans to effectively eliminate its remote-work in 2025 when it begins demanding all corporate workers to return to an office for five days a week starting in January, though it has postponed that requirement for some employees in cities where Amazon says it doesn't yet have enough space. The company had been operating on a hybrid policy that asked employees to be in person at least three days per week.\n\nWho it affects: Roughly 350,000 corporate employees.\n\nWhat they say: \"We've decided that we're going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said of the decision behind adopting the upcoming mandate. \"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant.\"\n\nSouthwest\n\nHeadquarters: Dallas\n\nIn-person policy: Starting Jan. 6, the air carrier is requiring employees to report to its headquarters at least four, if not five, days per week. The escalated policy sheds the company\u2019s pandemic-era flexibility that allowed workers to commute about three days a week.\n\nWho it affects: Corporate employees\n\nWhat they say: \u201cCorporate campus employees who are hybrid will transition to working onsite Monday through Thursday and Friday as needed,\" said Lynn Lunsford, Southwest's senior communications adviser. \"We are working to enhance employee engagement while ensuring we have a vibrant corporate campus that fosters collaboration and promotes Southwest's culture.\"\n\nStarbucks\n\nHeadquarters: Seattle\n\nIn-person policy: The coffee conglomerate plans to ramp up enforcement of its three-day office policy for corporate employees beginning Jan. 1. The company recently issued a warning to its workforce that those who don't meet that requirement will risk possible termination.\n\nWho it affects: The policy applies to about 3,500 corporate Starbucks employees, a small fraction of the company's roughly 380,000-person global workforce, much of which is based in retail outposts.\n\nWhat they say: \u201cWe are continuing to support our leaders as they hold their teams accountable to our existing hybrid work policy,\u201d a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement to CoStar News.\n\nSalesforce\n\nHeadquarters: San Francisco\n\nIn-person policy: The company recently began requiring most of its employees to work from an office four to five days a week. It's a stark reversal for the company, one of the nation's first to implement a pandemic-induced flexible work policy, with CEO Marc Benioff previously saying \u201coffice mandates are never going to work.\u201d\n\nWho it affects: Employees across the company's sales, workplace services, data center engineering and other departments are beholden to the escalated mandate.\n\nWhat they say: \u201cSalesforce has always been a hybrid work company,\u201d a spokesperson said in the statement. \u201cOur guidelines focus on in-person connection, while also recognizing the value of working away from the office.\u201d\n\nIBM\n\nHeadquarters: Armonk, New York\n\nIn-person policy: IBM demands all managerial roles to report to an office at least three days a week, a mandate measured by badging data. Employees that previously worked remotely and lived more than 50 miles from an IBM office or client location were required to relocate.\n\nWho it affects: All executive and manager-level positions.\n\nWhat they say: The company is \"focused on providing a work environment that balances flexibility with the face-to-face interactions,\" a spokesperson told CoStar News. \"Consistent with that approach, we're requiring executives and people managers in the United States to be in the office at least three days per week.\"\n\nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n\nHeadquarters: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn-person policy: Metro employees will no longer be able to work from home starting February 2025, the transportation agency told workers earlier this month. The escalated mandate came several days after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's talk with members of Congress, telling them she was eager to work together to bring federal workers back to the office, a longstanding goal among local officials as they look to aid the city's post-pandemic recovery efforts.\n\nWho it affects: The new mandate applies to the agency's entire workforce, which includes about 13,000 employees. Many of them have been working on site each day, but now remaining employees and directors will return to the office five days a week.\n\nWhat they say: \"We are an essential service to the region,\" Metro told employees in a recent memo. \"The vast majority of our employees work on site every day, and we remain committed to fostering a unified culture where every team member feels valued and supported. As we prepare for 2025, which promises to be a pivotal year for Metro to support large-scale regional events, leadership is focusing on enhancing collaboration and strengthening our efforts to work as one Metro.\"\n\nDell\n\nHeadquarters: Round Rock, Texas\n\nIn-person policy: The tech company now requires its sales staff to return to the office starting five days a week, ditching an earlier policy that allowed its U.S. employees to pick between working remotely or following a hybrid schedule that let them commute at least three days per week. The new mandate is tracked by security badge swipes.\n\nWho it affects: The company's global sales team with the exception of fully remote positions.\n\nWhat they say: \"The sales floor is a unique environment that combined high energy with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,\" Bill Scannell, Dell's president of global sales and customer operations, and John Byrne, its global president of sales told employees in a recent memo. \"To harness this energy and grow skills, we believe our sales teams need to be together in the office. Additionally, our data shows that sales teams are more productive when onsite.\"\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nHeadquarters: Washington, D.C.\n\nIn-person policy: Starting next year, the daily news organization will ramp up its in-person mandate by requiring its workforce to commute to the office Monday through Friday, effectively terminating the remote and hybrid policy it adopted in the early weeks of the pandemic.\n\nWho it affects: Post managers were told they will have to come back starting in early February, with the rest of the newsroom's roles returning in June.\n\nWhat they say: \"I want that great office energy for us every day,\" Publisher Will Lewis wrote in a recent memo viewed by CoStar News. \"You know how much we all must do to improve our company, and I do not believe we can do that successfully via Zoom. We are really good when we are working together in person.\"",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite respectively ended the year higher by 13%, 23%, and 29%, with all three indexes reaching multiple record-closing highs throughout 2024.\n\nCatalysts have been abundant, with hefty stock buybacks, better-than-expected corporate earnings, stock-split euphoria, and President-elect Donald Trump's victory in November all working to drive stocks higher. But the biggest catalyst of all has undeniably been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe lure of AI is the virtually limitless ceiling the technology offers. With AI, software and systems are given the capacity to grow more proficient at their tasks over time, as well as evolve to learn new skills, all without the need for human intervention.\n\nAccording to the analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence can increase global gross domestic product (GDP) by 26%, or $15.7 trillion, by 2030. In Sizing the Prize, PwC breaks down its expectation of a $6.6 trillion boost to global GDP coming from productivity improvements, with the remaining $9.1 trillion associated with consumption-side effects.\n\nWhile the AI revolution has predominantly revolved around semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NVDA 5.27%) and its superior hardware up to this point, 2025 should mark the evolution of this technology to an even hotter trend.\n\nNvidia has prospered immensely from its time in the sun\n\nWhen 2023 began, Nvidia was a $360 billion business that played a distant second fiddle to Wall Street's biggest tech stocks. But as of the end of 2024, it's a nearly $3.3 trillion company with the AI hardware that every business wants.\n\nThe reason Nvidia's sales are expected to have catapulted from $27 billion to an estimated $195 billion in three years is its AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs). Orders for the company's ultra-popular H100 GPU (commonly known as the \"Hopper\") and successor Blackwell chip are backlogged.\n\nWhen demand for a good or service vastly exceeds supply, it's normal for the price of said good or service to rise until demand tapers. In Nvidia's case, it's been able to charge up to a 300% premium for its Hopper chip, relative to the cost of Advanced Micro Devices Insight MI300X GPUs. This combination of AI-GPU scarcity and phenomenal pricing power has helped lift Nvidia's gross margin into the mid-70% range.\n\nIt's also worth noting that no other GPU developer is particularly close to surpassing Nvidia in terms of computing capabilities. For instance, Blackwell is designed to accelerate computing in a half-dozen arenas, including quantum computing and generative AI, and can do so while being more energy efficient than its predecessor chip.\n\nHowever, GPU hardware has been a 2023/2024 story for the artificial intelligence revolution. While Wall Street estimates suggest demand for GPUs will continue to grow, investors' attention will be on the newest AI trend in 2025.\n\nThe next stage of the AI revolution has arrived -- and it offers trillion-dollar potential\n\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence in the new year is less about the hardware powering it and more about its real-world autonomous capabilities. Say hello to the rise of AI agents, which are also known as AI assistants.\n\nAI agents are software programs capable of performing tasks without the need for human intervention. Some examples of agentic AI in action include businesses deploying virtual agents for customer support, financial firms employing machine learning-driven algorithmic stock and cryptocurrency trading, and automakers relying on AI in next-generation vehicles to safely navigate roadways filled with cars, pedestrians, and other obstacles.\n\nThis next step for the AI revolution will see AI agents working side-by-side with humans, as well as with other AI agents, to improve the operating efficiency and profit potential of corporate America.\n\nThe company that's arguably leading the charge for this multitrillion agentic AI opportunity is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) kingpin Salesforce (CRM 2.82%).\n\nAccording to Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff, the addressable market for digital labor is in the trillions. Just three months after launching Agentforce in September, which is the company's suite of autonomous AI agents that assist with service, sales, marketing, and commerce, Benioff's company unveiled Agentforce 2.0.\n\nBenioff noted during the December unveil that Salesforce has been a key benefactor of agentic AI. Among the 32,000 conversations the company averages per week at help.salesforce.com, only around 5,000 are being escalated to a human agent. This means AI agents are resolving 83% of the company's client concerns.\n\nAnd it's not just industry juggernauts that can benefit from this growth wave in AI agents. SoundHound AI (SOUN 16.05%), which sports a modest $7.3 billion market cap, saw its stock surge 836% in 2024. SoundHound's area of expertise is using voice AI and conversational technology in various settings, such as restaurant drive-thrus.\n\nHowever, SoundHound AI has ambitions of expanding its intuitive voice recognition AI solutions beyond traditional settings. In an interview with The Media Leader in July, SoundHound AI's Senior Director of Product, Automotive, and Internet-of-Things, Pedram Faghfouri, pointed to a unifying experience for voice ecosystems in the future. For instance, Faghfouri envisions AI voice integration in next-gen automobiles that can control features in a car based on intuitive commands.\n\nThe agentic AI evolution has one noteworthy concern: history\n\nAs with most next-big-thing innovations and technologies, investor excitement is thick enough to cut with a knife. Having witnessed Nvidia effectively 10X in value in just two years is enough to tickle the fancy of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nBut if history has taught us anything, it's that when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, more often than not they are.\n\nOn paper, the long-term runway for AI is promising. There's little question that this technology can improve the operating efficiency and profitability for businesses across a wide swath of industries around the globe. But when it comes to the early stage expansion of new technologies/innovations, things get a bit dicey and unpredictable.\n\nFor example, the early stages of the internet's mainstream adoption in the mid-1990s spurred the dot-com revolution. While investors were excited about the possibility of how the internet would alter the growth arc of corporate America, it ultimately took years before businesses fully understood how to market and monetize their online presence.\n\nThe internet represents just one example of a next-big-thing innovation where investors overestimated its adoption rate and/or early stage utility. Others include genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse.\n\nTo reiterate, investors overestimating the early stage utility and adoption of game-changing technologies doesn't mean these innovations weren't eventually successful. The internet went on to revolutionize the way companies do business in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nBut what it does show is that it takes time for new technologies to mature. At the moment, most businesses lack concrete plans to generate a positive return on their AI investments, or have yet to realize how best to use AI to improve their company.\n\nWhile AI agents have a clear path to become this year's hottest trend, don't be surprised if artificial intelligence momentum fades by the end of the year.",

            "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have been much discussed in the past few months, with companies such as Google and Salesforce going all in on the technology. They will continue this trajectory in 2025 and be the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in the AI landscape, top executives have said.\u201cWe will see a rise in agent frameworks, where a lot of agents get deployed,\u201d Infosys chief executive Salil Parekh told ET. \u201cA lot of agent work will be done in different industries \u2014 both on vertical and horizontal processes, which will improve efficiency and also innovation within companies.\u201dAgent frameworks can complete task activities deployed across a whole organisation on an AI platform, Parekh explained. \u201cHuge amounts of these tasks are going to be driven by agents with connections from where humans or individuals are supporting them or in many cases driving them, so a huge transformation is coming up,\u201d he said.Experts have said that agents go beyond the language generation capabilities of LLMs (large language models). Agent frameworks can reason, plan and execute. They usher in the convergence of automation technologies with GenAI, enabling the transformation to autonomous systems that can perform complex business tasks. They are also likely to become the mainstream medium for the adoption of GenAI.While LLMs produce responses based only on the data they are trained on, agentic technology uses \u201ctool calling\u201d in the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimise workflows and create subtasks autonomously to achieve complex goals, according to an IBM blog. Autonomous agents also adapt to user expectations over time, storing past interactions as memory as they plan future actions.\u201cIts impact in the coming years is going to be most prominent in its ability to create and deploy new business models and revenue streams with a quick turnaround time,\u201d said Vishal Chahal, vice-president, IBM India Software Labs. \u201cWe will see revolutionised customer experience through automation of newer complex workflows for business processes beyond 2025.\u201dChahal added that while AI agents will change the way people interact with technology, their knowledge foundation will still be based on and driven by LLMs, which will get trained on complex task automations and enterprise processes.The global AI agent market is projected to grow from $5.29 billion in 2024 to $216.8 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 40.15%, according to a report by market research firm Roots Analysis. Tech giants have been moving fast to develop and deploy agents.In December last year, Google released Gemini 2.0, which enables agentic experiences with prototypes of agents that can help with coding, web browser navigation and even playing video games. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is preparing to launch an autonomous AI agent codenamed Operator as a research preview and developer tool early this year, Bloomberg reported. The agent is expected to have the ability to control computers and perform tasks independently.As many as 80% of organisations plan to integrate AI agents by 2026, primarily for tasks that will drive automation and productivity gains, according to PwC. \u201cExpectations for AI agent adoption by businesses and consumers in 2025 are promising, with significant growth predicted across various industries,\u201d said Arnab Basu, partner and leader advisory, PwC India Basu said that AI agents will transition from reactive assistants to proactive problem solvers that anticipate needs, suggest solutions and take action autonomously, making them invaluable collaborators and decision-makers.2024 already saw promising developments such as agents being integrated with human teams and with the internet of things (IoT), besides helping monitor networks and detect cybersecurity threats. \u201cPlatforms like AutoGen, CrewAI and LangChain are democratising the AI agent building process by offering templates, tools and frameworks for developers and non-developers alike,\u201d said Basu.Key trends to watch out for in 2025 include AI agents enabling hyper-personalised experiences for customers, AI agents with multi-modal capabilities and advanced multi-agent systems.\u201cGenAI is entering a transformative phase of \u2018agentification\u2019, evolving from task-specific tools to specialised, interconnected AI agents. These systems are transitioning to higher levels of autonomy, capable of logical reasoning and decision-making,\u201d said Sindhu Gangadharan, MD, SAP Labs India. \u201cThese multi-agent systems will enable businesses to respond to unpredictable challenges with speed and precision. With enhanced accuracy and sophistication, GenAI will drive innovation, making its adoption a competitive imperative.\u201dAI agents can work, not just individually but also collectively, across multiple applications, she said. For instance, to settle a payment dispute, a collection agent, email agent, invoice agent and support case agent can now collaborate to automate the entire workflow. This would free up employees to focus on more strategic, value-driven activities.Agentic frameworks are expected to have an impact across sectors like healthcare , legal services and finance, where dynamic decision-making is critical, in addition to areas like supply chain optimisation and predictive maintenance.\u201cBy 2025, we may witness the emergence of \u2018superagents\u2019, orchestrating interactions between multiple AI systems to enhance collaboration, efficiency and reliability,\u201d Gangadharan said.SAP is building a multi-agent AI with its flagship bot Joule. And Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had said last year that the company was making a \u201chard pivot\u201d toward AI agents. The software-as-a-service major rolled out its AI agent platform Agentforce and sees autonomous agents as the \u201cthird wave\u201d of AI, following traditional AI/ML and generative AI.\u201cIf India is able to organise its data, it can very quickly leapfrog into the second and third wave of AI, meaning that it can start using that data to truly bring about a workforce that is far more enabled and empowered,\u201d Salesforce India CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya had told ET recently.GenAI and the agentic AI piece are concepts that can be easily understood, Bhattacharya said, adding that these are becoming cheaper to implement by the day. All of which means this is a big opportunity for India to get its data in order to unleash productivity.At the same time, experts noted that trust and transparency as well as skilling remain challenges for AI agent adoption.",

David Sewell, Chief Technology Officer at Synechron, shares four technology trends that will have a game changing impact.\n\nDigital transformation is the key to unlocking future success\n\nDigital transformation serves as the backbone for innovation, scalability, and adaptability, enabling organisations to unlock value across all other megatrends. Companies that invest in modern systems, cloud-native technologies, and advanced digital architectures will be better equipped to adapt to market changes and drive efficiency.\n\nFor developers, embracing modern software development methodologies and platforms ensures reliability and agility. Investors will have the chance to support sectors in the early stages of their digital transformation journey to help them remain competitive in a digital-first world.\n\nFurther reading: BCG: Only 1 in 3 digital transformation projects are successful.\n\nAI delivers measurable gains (if adopted responsibly)\n\nAI continues to evolve at a remarkable pace, with many Aussie businesses implementing the technology into their day-to-day. AI no longer confines itself to just the realms of IT; it now permeates various aspects of business operations, from marketing and sales to customer service and product development. This means close collaboration with other departments is key to identifying pain points and understanding how AI can help improve productivity.\n\nAI-assisted tools in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) are increasingly becoming indispensable. Developers can leverage these tools for code generation, testing and design to improve the quality of code, speed up development, and help developers focus on more strategic tasks. With the introduction of these AI-assisted tools, Synechron has seen a 40% improvement in efficiency, and as such, sees the adoption of AI practices as mission-critical for any business hoping to remain competitive in the Australian business environment.\n\nSetting realistic expectations is key \u2013 AI isn\u2019t a complete replacement for humans but instead complements and enhances employee productivity when used effectively.\n\nFor businesses to maximise the benefits of AI, staying ahead of regulatory requirements, being mindful of deploying AI responsibly, and building trust in AI solutions is a top priority in 2025, especially given that a report produced by Fifth Quadrant, in partnership with the National AI Centre (NAIC), found that on average, Australian organisations adopt only 12 of 38 responsible AI practices.\n\nCybersecurity remains key as risks grow\n\nAustralia is now experiencing the highest number of data breaches in 3.5 years. In fact, the Australian Signals Directorate received on average one cybercrime report every six minutes in the 2023/2024 financial year. As such, cybersecurity remains a critical focus as technology evolves.\n\nThe advances in AI and connectivity bring heightened risks, making proactive investments in secure systems, advanced encryption, and threat detection essential for protecting data and maintaining trust.\n\nFor businesses, embedding cybersecurity into development and operational strategies is the best defence against escalating threats. Meanwhile, investors can drive growth by supporting innovative cybersecurity solutions addressing complex and evolving risks.\n\nQuantum computing leads the paradigm shift\n\nQuantum computing, though still in its early stages, promises to revolutionise industries with unprecedented computing power. The Australian government has estimated that quantum computing, communications and sensing could add at least $6.1 billion to Australia\u2019s GDP by 2045.\n\nAs organisations prepare for their eventual maturity, they must secure systems with post-quantum cryptographic methods to mitigate future risks. Forward-thinking investors are encouraged to explore emerging quantum technologies and startups, which hold immense potential in areas like quantum-enhanced AI and post-quantum security.",

Gavin Newsom signed into law bills banning deepfake campaign ads, deepfake content on big online platforms, and disclosure of artificial intelligence content in advertising.\n\nThe governor also signed a bill requiring California schools to limit or ban student use cellphones, codifying statewide a practice that has become increasingly common at the district level as educators look to refocus students. Schools in Los Angeles and San Diego took a more critical look at their use of artificial intelligence after unhappy surprises involving chatbots and grading software.\n\nThe state bureaucracy moved to update enforcement of existing laws to account for AI. The California Civil Rights Department moved to restrict how employers use the technology to screen job applicants while the Government Operations Agency set rules for how state departments themselves use it.\n\nThere were limits to the regulatory impulse: The governor vetoed a bill to make companies test large AI models for their potential to help with mass attacks, reasoning that the bigger threat was overregulating an innovative industry. State agencies, meanwhile, struggled to enforce a law designed to help app workers.\n\n2025 outlook\n\nIn 2025, California lawmakers must decide whether to accelerate their regulation of technology under Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term; Trump has promised to rescind modest AI guardrails installed by the Biden administration and could use the technology to assist with mass deportations. This may include another crack at major AI curbs, given that the governor promised to take another swing at the problem following his veto of the testing bill.\n\nCalMatters.org is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.",

            "content": "\u201cIf the tech stack were an orchestra, which product would be the conductor?\u201d asks Chief Martec Scott Brinker in his first column of the year. To cut to the chase, Brinker thinks there\u2019s an important role for AI agents to play here.\n\nThat will be the case for some businesses certainly \u2014 and almost by default for businesses relying on vendors that have themselves taken the agentic route. Not just Salesforce (Agentforce) but also HubSpot (Breeze AI), where Brinker serves as VP platform ecosystem).\n\nBefore we look forward, it\u2019s revealing to look back.\n\nHow the martech stack became what it is today\n\nIt was almost six years ago (March, 2019) that I sat down with Brinker to talk about the transition from single-vendor marketing cloud versus \u201cFrankenstack\u201d to a platform model. Let me break that down.\n\nThere was a period in the twenty-teens when vendors like Oracle and Salesforce were essentially saying, to the businesses that could afford them, leave it all to us. We will get around to providing all the services you need. Indeed, the late Mark Hurd, then Oracle CEO, predicted in 2015 that, by 2027, two vendors would command 80% of the martech market.\n\n\u201cFrankenstack,\u201d on the other hand, was all about subscribing to individual point solutions and somehow stringing them together (sorry, integrating them) in-house. It was an approach often driven by necessity for businesses that couldn\u2019t afford to become an Oracle or Salesforce shop.\n\nThe transition that was taking place at HubSpot (and indeed Salesforce) that Brinker and I discussed was the emergence of a platform model. One solution would sit at the center of the stack, but through APIs would link to the single point solutions that did things the main platform couldn\u2019t do (or did them better). Thus the development of Salesforce AppExchange and HubSpot App Marketplace.\n\nEssentially, that\u2019s where we still are today, although orchestrating and integrating large collections of apps and making the data flows between them make sense continues to be challenging. But let\u2019s not overlook iPaaS.\n\niPaaS as a solution\n\nIntegration platform-as-a-service set out to ease those challenges by providing cloud-based tools designed to automate the integration and orchestration of martech applications. Take a look at Gartner\u2019s definition:\n\niPaas is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.\n\nOne leading iPaaS vendor, Mulesoft, was acquired by Salesforce in 2018.\n\nIn practice, however, iPaaS solutions promised more than they could always deliver. Despite the promise of automation and even of the possibility that non-technical teams could use them. However, unseen complexities of integration and the frequent need to customize off-the-shelf APIs meant the involvement of developers; and developers, it is said, often preferred to work without the chosen iPaaS.\n\nDig deeper: AI transformation: 2025 predictions\n\niPaaS, meet AI\n\nBut don\u2019t we now have an obvious contender to run iPaaS, or even to handle the orchestration of the stack without iPaaS? Meet your friendly AI agent.\n\nThat\u2019s Brinker\u2019s thesis, anyway. AI agents are already beginning to orchestrate the applications in the stack. As mentioned earlier, big players like Salesforce and HubSpot now have AI agents embedded in their platforms. As Brinker observes, medium-sized vendors are following a similar path (Braze and Zeta, for example).\n\nSounds simple enough. But there\u2019s also a wild west of agent developer solutions providing businesses with the ability to create and customize their own agents for a wide range of purposes. Google and OpenAI support agent development, of course, but so do dozens of other much less familiar vendors (including low- and no-code solutions).\n\nEchoes of Frankenstack? Agentstein?\n\nDig deeper: Customer experience management in the age of agentic AI\n\nOut of chaos, find simplicity \u2014 but not yet\n\nThe potential of AI agents to finally solve stack integration and orchestration challenges is unquestionably exciting. As is their potential to devise and run marketing campaigns and take over 90% (or more) of customer support and service activities. (Automating the personalization of campaigns is \u201ccoming to be known as \u2018AI Decisioning,'\u201d says Brinker; that will come as a surprise to Pega which has been calling it that for years.)\n\nI salute Brinker\u2019s enthusiasm. But he and I have been around the block often enough to know that many developments that promised to fix everything \u2014 from marketing automation to CDPs \u2014 have turned out to be only partial solutions and have often actually added to stack complexity.\n\nThe agentifying of the Salesforces of this world may be a major development for Salesforce customers. But for many businesses, the deployment of AI Agents, whether for integration or other purposes, is going to be a long and complex task.\n\nRead Brinker\u2019s predictions here.",

However, selecting the right CRM system from the multitude of available options can be daunting. Some CRM systems offer just the features essential for small businesses , while others are robust enough to meet the demands of large enterprises. PCMag has been reviewing solutions from leading and lesser-known vendors for over a decade, so we can help ease your decision-making process. Our Editors' Choice winner, Zoho CRM, is full-featured and very customizable, but we also highlight other options that might be a better fit for your business. Make sure to click through to our in-depth reviews of each entry below and read our buying guide for more advice on the category.\n\nTable of Contents Best for Businesses Invested in Zoho Solutions Best for Fast-Growing SMBs Best for Easy to Use CRM for SMBs Best for Small Business Owners New to CRM Best for Larger SMBs Best for SMBs With Basic CRM Needs What Is CRM Software? How to Shop for a CRM System What's the Latest in CRM Software? How to Match a CRM System to Your Business Needs Why Is CRM Data Quality Important? Weigh Your Support Options Do CRMs Support Mobile Devices? Can CRMs Integrate With Your Existing Systems? How to Secure Your CRM Data\n\nGive Freshsales a look if you want a functional CRM that won't overwhelm your sales team with features. Its lightweight approach makes it especially good for organizations with limited or no prior CRM experience. If you already use some of the software on its integrations list, you should also appreciate its interconnectivity.\n\nFreshsales is an easy-to-use, entry-level CRM that's particularly suitable for small businesses and startups. Although it lacks some features of competitors, it does a good job of building integrations with other business software, such as calendars, email marketing services, and tools like DocuSign. It now includes an AI assistant that can analyze your contact profiles and help assess the likelihood of a sale.\n\nIf you aren't content with the flexibility of other CRMs you've tried, Apptivo is worth a look. Its extensive collection of features allows for near-endless customization. However, the sheer number of possibilities also comes with a drawback: complexity. If you lack the time, knowledge, or resources to set up and customize the software, you are likely better off with another service that focuses squarely on CRM. Keep in mind, too, that Apptivo lacks the AI-powered tools of competitors.\n\nApptivo CRM is a highly configurable software platform. It splits its wealth of features into multiple modules, allowing you to combine and arrange them to meet your company's unique needs. In addition to its core CRM capabilities, the platform supports multiple other business tasks, such as accounting, invoicing, and project management, making it a one-stop shop for all your business software needs.\n\nBudget-conscious companies should give Less Annoying CRM a look, but it's also a good choice for businesses that want a stripped-down, easy-to-use CRM that doesn't require a lot of complicated setup and configuration. Just be aware that its design simplicity means it's less feature-rich than more enterprise-ready solutions. For example, Less Annoying's reporting functions are relatively weak compared to those of more sophisticated systems. Although you can extend the system's capabilities with Zapier integrations, that added complexity might negate some of what makes it \"less annoying.\"\n\nLess Annoying CRM is positioned as an affordable turnkey system for small businesses and sole proprietors. It offers a good collection of essential features, combined with flat-rate pricing that's among the cheapest of all the products we tested. Ease of use is its key selling point, which is great for companies with limited CRM experience. Its user interface is straightforward and approachable. Also, Less Annoying's responsive web UI works as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop browsers.\n\nIf you're new to CRMs, HubSpot Smart CRM's free version is difficult to beat. And when you're ready to upgrade, HubSpot's robust ecosystem of sales, marketing, and service tools will serve you well. Just be prepared to spend a lot if you want all the features Smart CRM offers because they require a subscription to HubSpot's premium software products, such as Sales Hub.\n\nHubSpot offers a fairly full-featured version of its easy-to-use Smart CRM at no cost for up to two users. This tier doesn't have any time limits, so it's an excellent choice if you are just starting out with CRMs. HubSpot also makes it easy to upgrade to a paid plan as your business grows. Paying more gets you customizable reports, expanded support options, first-party payment processing, HubSpot's Breeze AI (which can generate reports and blog posts and summarize contact and company data), and more.\n\nIf you insist on a world-class CRM system backed by world-class support, Salesforce Starter is your SMB-friendly onramp to the platform and ecosystem. Just keep in mind that it has limited third-party software integrations and reporting capabilities. It's true that Salesforce scales to meet the needs of any business, but you should prepare to spend a bundle.\n\nSalesforce rewrote the book on CRM when it debuted in 1999, and it remains an industry leader today. Salesforce Starter is the company's entry-level tier, aimed squarely at SMBs. It does a great job of walking new customers through the setup and training process while providing the robust functionality and customization for which the Salesforce platform is known. Although its predecessor, Salesforce Essentials, was limited to small teams, Starter supports up to 325 users per instance. And when you're ready to grow beyond that, Salesforce is more than ready to accommodate you.\n\nZoho CRM has a lot to recommend to any business. If you're already using other products in the Zoho portfolio, it's practically a no-brainer. Only Salesforce will give you more features with a more polished UI. Then again, if you like the idea of the Zoho suite, but feel daunted by Zoho CRM's feature set, you should consider Bigin by Zoho , the company's lightweight CRM designed specifically for small businesses.\n\nZoho offers an extensive suite of SaaS business software, and its CRM offering is a standout tool. Its feature set rivals even behemoth Salesforce. Its latest additions include Zia, an AI-powered analytics engine for spotting sales trends and anomalies; and Canvas, a drag-and-drop interface editor. It doesn't hurt that Zoho CRM is priced within reach of smaller teams.\n\nWhat Is CRM Software?\n\nCRM software helps you track and nurture contacts to build customer loyalty and repeat sales. A good CRM makes the information it gathers accessible to other business platforms via integrations. In this way, CRM becomes the epicenter of how you manage your customer's journey, from the first marketing touch to a closed sale and on to the next engagement.\n\nSome small businesses use spreadsheets to mimic a CRM's functionality. However, this type of home-brewed solution delivers just a tiny subset of the features you get with a CRM and isn't ideal once your customer list grows beyond 100 entries.\n\nThe best CRM solutions are easier to use than spreadsheets and do more than just retain user and contact information. They also automate processes, such as creating calendar events, identifying new sales opportunities, prioritizing the sales pipeline, and setting appointment reminders. They can even rank opportunities by the likelihood of success. Integrating your other customer data so the CRM can access it, such as from your help desk, makes that possible.\n\nThis information is a goldmine of opportunity. It lets you identify prospects for up-sell or cross-sell, convert existing customers to new products or services, target new marketing, and track invoices. The software is also a fail-safe because it prevents multiple salespeople from chasing the same prospect. Choosing the right CRM software can dramatically improve your team's collaboration and productivity, which in turn increases sales.\n\nHow to Shop for a CRM System\n\nChoosing a CRM is a significant investment. Your pricing decision needs to start with knowing how your salespeople operate and having an idea of the features that can help them. You will get the best deal by knowing what you need and then matching that up with the appropriate pricing tier. But there are gotchas beyond that, too.\n\nFor example, the initial setup and training can eat up a chunk of the budget, as can upgrades and ongoing support. Integrating the software with existing systems might call for additional equipment. Does the CRM workflow mean the sales or customer service teams will need new PCs, smartphones, or tablets? These costs can add up quickly.\n\nNote that many CRM vendors are expanding beyond customer relationships. They're moving toward managing the sales lifecycle end-to-end, with CRM representing the customer journey. The more expansive the tool, the more customization you need to make it work.\n\nAs with any software, it's critical to take advantage of free trials. No matter how many reviews you read or demos you watch, you can't fully understand how CRM software works until you use it yourself. Be sure to have colleagues from different departments try out the software, too, so you can know how it works in various situations.\n\nMost vendors offer at least a 14-day trial (30 days is even better). Some, including Zoho CRM, offer free plans, albeit with limited features or users. These can either serve as a full-time solution for small companies or a long-term trial for larger ones.\n\nWhat's the Latest in CRM Software?\n\nCRM software is constantly evolving to help businesses improve their customer interactions and retention. Sometimes, that means adding new features and technologies. Other times, it means casting familiar features in a new light. As competing vendors jockey for position in the market, trends emerge that will define CRMs for the next few years.\n\nOne such trend is customers' tendency to prefer cloud-based CRM systems. All the CRM systems in our most recent tests are available as cloud-based subscriptions, and many aren't available any other way. This model, also called software as a service (SaaS), has several advantages over traditional, on-premises software, including lower upfront costs and greater scalability and flexibility.\n\nAnother recent development is social CRMs, which help businesses engage, manage, and monitor their social media presence and interactions. Social CRM software can also help companies leverage social media data to generate leads, identify influencers, and measure customer satisfaction.\n\nTaking the concept of social CRMs even further, omnichannel CRMs allow businesses to interact with customers across multiple channels and devices, including email, messaging apps, mobile, phone, and web. These aim to provide a unified view of the customer journey and preferences across all touchpoints.\n\nCustomer data platforms (CDP) are another emerging concept. These systems collect and unify customer data from various sources, such as online and offline transactions, social media, third-party platforms, and web browsing. CDP can help businesses create a singular, 360-degree view of a customer.\n\nFinally, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly prevalent. Over the past few years, CRM vendors have increasingly used AI to automate tasks, generate insights from data, and provide personalized recommendations. AI can also enhance customer interactions through chatbots, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants. More recently, some vendors have begun experimenting with generative AI, typically based on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to further improve these capabilities.\n\nHow to Match a CRM System to Your Business Needs\n\nThe most challenging part of making a good CRM choice is understanding what the product can do and what your salespeople need. Sales is a difficult and often fast-paced profession, which means the very tool you choose could actually burden your employees. That'll kill adoption rates, so you must understand what they need before tossing more technology into the mix.\n\nIt's tempting to forgo this homework and simply pay for one of the big, all-inclusive CRM software packages to have access to every feature. That approach will almost certainly wind up costing you more in both time and money while probably delivering less flexibility than you expect. That's because large CRM software packages are often platforms rather than tools. The numerous features they advertise are the product of integrations with various third-party solution providers, not merely options you can turn on. All these features can add cost.\n\nInstead, think about what tools your team is currently using and what processes they follow. Figure out how those tasks map to the CRM software you're evaluating. For example, if a tool forces users to dig through menus and submenus every time they want to log a call or email, it will complicate their jobs instead of simplifying them. An increasing number of CRM tools combine the email and sales experience into a single, smart inbox or centralized dashboard to manage all or most daily communications and tasks.\n\nThe ways in which companies interact with customers are shifting rapidly. Most customers still expect to interact with you via email, but social media is fast becoming a game-changing technology. Understand how your company engages with customers over email and make sure your CRM software complements that relationship. A fully optimized CRM should automatically capture data from email interactions, not force your employees to do that manually.\n\nAfter you look at the requirements from the sales team's perspective, flip it around and think about your customer. Maybe even run an online survey or focus group. What is their best sales experience? Once you know that, you can tailor your CRM to fit.\n\nWhy Is CRM Data Quality Important?\n\nData quality should be a key focus of that tailoring process. You need to pay attention not only to customer information that originates inside the CRM but also to the supporting data from other systems, such as finance or service desk tickets. Ensuring this data is \"clean\" means it needs to be directly on-target to the CRM's queries, in the proper format, and verifiable.\n\nA 2024 study from Validity surveyed more than 600 global organizations that use CRMs. Of the respondents, 24% of CRM admins said less than half of their data is accurate and complete, while 31% reported that poor-quality data costs them at least 20% of their annual revenue.\n\nEnsuring good data quality is a matter of testing and constant vigilance. You need to run regular and repeatable tests on your system. Depending on the size of your staff and your CRM investment, the Validity report recommends appointing a data management professional as the lead in keeping your CRM data clean. That person should manage the entire data flow, including your CRM and any connected apps. They should also handle the full spectrum of data management tasks, including automating data workflows, backup, and data protection. If you feel such a hire is in your future, you should pull that person in as early as possible, preferably at the evaluation stage.\n\nWeigh Your Support Options\n\nAs the saying goes, you should plan for success but prepare for when things go wrong. Whether it's a software bug or simply some difficulty with a particular feature, you'll need support from your vendor. That's why it's important to use your free trial period to evaluate the responsiveness and efficacy of your potential vendor's support team. Some tips:\n\nMake sure to understand the level of support you get with your pricing tier and whether you can modify it.\n\nResearch the provider's support forum. See what questions other customers ask and how long it takes for the company to respond.\n\nCheck for DIY resources. Are there self-service tools for specific issues if there's a support site? If there are, be sure to run through them to see how effective they are. Search the knowledge base to see what kinds of articles are there and whether they are in a useful format.\n\nInvestigate the product's training options. Complex tools usually require some training, so see what your service vendor provides. Is on-site, in-person training your only option, or are there online resources, such as well-organized blogs, recorded webinars, and videos?\n\nDo CRMs Support Mobile Devices?\n\nMake sure to take a close look at the CRM solution's mobile app. This should be a separate app, not just a mobile \"capability\" (which almost always means a mobile-optimized version of the desktop website). In addition, you shouldn't pay extra for it. Mobile devices are an entirely different breed from desktops or laptops. Employees use them differently, and software renders them differently, which means the business processes will also be different.\n\nMake sure your CRM software of choice can support the mobile device platform your team uses. Are you providing every employee an iPhone or is yours a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environment, which inevitably means supporting multiple platforms? Next, carefully evaluate what the app can do. Some apps offer a read-only view of your sales pipeline or contacts but don't let you make updates until you get back to a computer. Others offer a seamless and responsive experience, letting you do everything on a mobile device that you can on a computer. Don't commit to CRM software until you try the mobile app in a way you and your team would do on a day-to-day basis. For many SMBs and their agents, the mobile component of a CRM app might be more critical than the desktop version.\n\nMany CRM vendors cater directly to a mobile workforce. Apps for those are full-featured and responsive on mobile screens. If you have a field sales team that works on tablets and smartphones, you need to prioritize such tools.\n\nCan CRMs Integrate With Your Existing Systems?\n\nSalesforce and other larger CRM platforms have huge feature stacks that are available as modules with related features. If the features are what you need, you can configure your entire solution simply by accessing the right modules. But if something is missing, or your sales staff is simply more comfortable using something else, you may need to use software from third-party vendors to fill gaps.\n\nIntegration takes two basic forms. The easiest is if the CRM system or the system to which you're trying to connect supports the other as a \"native\" integration. That means that the company has a pre-built integration module you can just download and use as needed. You'll have the best luck with big-name targets here, as many companies pre-build integrations for companies such as NetSuite or Salesforce, for example.\n\nThe other method is rolling your own integration. This is easiest if both systems have an open application programming interface (API). The most common standard here is representational state transfer (REST). With a REST API, you can have developers build a custom integration for you. That option certainly provides the most flexibility and customization, but it can also add significant costs depending on the level of your coding talent.\n\nIt's also worth looking at any third-party software you're considering, or indeed any software you already use, to see if there are integrations available from that side. For example, maybe you already have email marketing software that you love, or you want to connect your help desk system to your CRM. It's entirely possible those vendors provide integrations with the CRM you're considering.\n\nHow to Secure Your CRM Data\n\nWhen you work with the sales pipeline and customer data, make sure security is top of mind\u2014especially if you're using a SaaS CRM solution (which means a big chunk, if not all, of your customer data resides in the cloud). You should feel comfortable with the company's security requirements. It's a warning sign when your CRM software lets you select a password but doesn't generate an audit trail whenever someone makes a change or if it doesn't let you define access controls for each user. Customer data is an extremely valuable commodity, especially now that customers are more reluctant to part with it. Securing it isn't just about maintaining privacy; it's about protecting profitable relationships that directly impact your bottom line.\n\nIntegrations play a role here, but it's mostly about research. You can make sure your CRM software integrates with as much of your current IT security software as possible, such as your identity management system, so your employees can take advantage of single sign-on authentication. But even more important than that is doing your homework. That means digging deep into the vendor's SLA and ascertaining exactly where your data resides, who is responsible for its safety, and what happens if there's a problem. Search for any past breaches and how the company responded, too.\n\nGadjo Sevilla contributed to this story.",

            "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com (CRM). Shares have lost about 9.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nSalesforce Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Surpass\n\nSalesforce reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but earnings per share (EPS) missed the same. Its non-GAAP EPS of $2.41 fell short of the consensus mark of $2.43. However, the figure increased 14% year over year, driven by higher sales and the benefits of ongoing cost-restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.\n\nThis enterprise cloud computing solution provider\u2019s quarterly revenues of $9.41 billion increased 8% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $9.34 billion. The top line also improved by 9% on a constant currency basis. CRM has been benefiting from resilient demand for its cloud and business software offerings in an uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe third-quarter top-line performance also reflected the benefits of its go-to-market strategy and sustained focus on customer success. The initiatives to integrate generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its offerings also boosted demand for Salesforce\u2019s solutions during the reported quarter.\n\nSalesforce Q3 Performance in Detail\n\nComing to CRM\u2019s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (94% of total revenues) increased 9% year over year to $8.88 billion. However, Professional Services and Other (6% of total sales) revenues decreased by 2.4% to $565 million. Our estimates for Subscription and Support, and Professional Services and Other segments\u2019 revenues were pegged at $8.79 billion and $537 million, respectively.\n\nUnder the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 11% year over year to $2.12 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud also improved 10% to $2.29 billion. Marketing & Commerce Cloud revenues increased 8% to $1.33 billion. Platform & Other revenues were up 8% to $1.83 billion. The company has renamed the Data sub-segment to the Integration and Analytics division. Revenues from the Integration and Analytics division increased 5% year over year to $1.31 billion.",

            "content": "In this article, we will take a look into Salesforce Inc's (CRM, Financial) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nAs of 2025-01-02, Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $303.13. It's currently trading at a price of $334.33. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -10.29%. The company is fair valued.\n\nThe model\n\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Salesforce Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions\n\nTerm Value Explanation EPS without NRI $9.7 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.54%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 36.90%\n\nYears of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4%\n\nYears of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation\n\nGrowth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 366.25 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 561.77 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 303.13\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model\n\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $378.63. This valuation indicates that the Salesforce Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 11.7%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.\n\nHere are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\n\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\n\nThe DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\n\nGrowth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\n\nThe model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

Salesforce helps companies of every size & industry to connect with their customers through cloud, mobile, social, IoT & artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere are two main revenue streams: Subscription & Support and Professional Services & Other.\n\nSubscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company's enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company.\n\nProfessional Services & Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training.\n\nThe next wave of AI will build further on generative AI's capabilities, enabling AI to make decisions and take actions across applications without human intervention. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff calls it the \"digital workforce.\" And his company is leading the growth in this Agentic AI with its new Agentforce product.\n\nToday, we\u2019re going to look at a bull put spread trade.\n\nA bull put spread is a bullish trade that also can benefit from a drop in implied volatility.\n\nThe maximum profit for a bull put spread is limited to the premium received while the maximum potential loss is also capped. To calculate the maximum loss, take the difference in the strike prices of the long and short options, and subtract the premium received.\n\nCRM BULL PUT SPREAD\n\nImplied volatility is currently sitting at 26.57% which gives CRM and IV Percentile of 36% and an IV Rank of 13.64%.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s expected move between now and February 32 is around 7.17% in either direction. On the downside, that would put CRM stock at around $310.\n\nIn other words, the options market is expecting CRM stock to stay above $310 between now and February 21.\n\nTo create a bull put spread, we sell an out-of-the-money put and then by a put further out-of-the-money.\n\nSelling the February 21 put with a strike price of $310 and buying the $300 put would create a bull put spread.\n\nThis spread was trading yesterday for around $1.65. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $165 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $835.\n\nThat represents a 19.8% return on risk between now and February 21 if CRM stock remains above $310.\n\nIf CRM stock closes below $300 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $835.\n\nThe breakeven point for the bull put spread is $308.35 which is calculated as $310 less the $1.65 option premium per contract.\n\nSalesforce is set to report earnings in late-February, so this trade should have no earnings risk if held to expiration.\n\nConclusion And Risk Management\n\nOne way to set a stop loss for a bull put spread is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $165, so we could set a stop loss equal to the premium received, or a loss of around $165.\n\nAnother way to manage the trade is to set a point on the chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be around $320.\n\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\n\nThis article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

Gavin Newsom signed into law bills banning deepfake campaign ads, deepfake content on big online platforms, and disclosure of artificial intelligence content in advertising.\n\nThe governor also signed a bill requiring California schools to limit or ban student use cellphones, codifying statewide a practice that has become increasingly common at the district level as educators look to refocus students. Schools in Los Angeles and San Diego took a more critical look at their use of artificial intelligence after unhappy surprises involving chatbots and grading software.\n\nThe state bureaucracy moved to update enforcement of existing laws to account for AI. The California Civil Rights Department moved to restrict how employers use the technology to screen job applicants while the Government Operations Agency set rules for how state departments themselves use it.\n\nThere were limits to the regulatory impulse: The governor vetoed a bill to make companies test large AI models for their potential to help with mass attacks, reasoning that the bigger threat was overregulating an innovative industry. State agencies, meanwhile, struggled to enforce a law designed to help app workers.\n\n2025 outlook\n\nIn 2025, California lawmakers must decide whether to accelerate their regulation of technology under Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term; Trump has promised to rescind modest AI guardrails installed by the Biden administration and could use the technology to assist with mass deportations.

By the late 20th century, that was the backbone of many networks. Then computers got cheap, and folks tried copying this concept onto a screen\u2014still a big rotating file, just digital. You might have a field for \u201cName\u201d and \u201cEmail\u201d and a box for \u201cNotes.\u201d It was an improvement in search-ability, but the logic was the same: we never truly tackled the intangible side of \u201cwhy does this relationship matter?\u201d It remained an afterthought.\n\nSalesforce did something big: it proved you can move your \u201cRolodex-plus\u201d to the cloud, charge monthly per seat, and build an ecosystem for third-party integrations. That alone revolutionized how companies saw CRM software. As a result, they soared to a $300+ billion market cap. But as with any empire, they\u2019re now grappling with complexity. The interface is huge, the customizations are endless, and the reliance on manual data entry remains. Whenever you talk to someone who\u2019s used Salesforce, you hear the same story: \u201cWe have a million features, but no one\u2019s using half of them, and we can\u2019t keep the database fully accurate.\u201d It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. You might call it \u201cRome at its apex\u201d: unstoppable in scale, but weighed down by size.\n\nAccounting software thrived because money is universal and skipping entries can lead to fines or worse. Relationship tracking has no similar short term penalty, so it lagged behind. Without strict discipline, the big CRM promise\u2014\u201cnever miss an important conversation\u201d\u2014dwindled into marketing hype. Many teams now revert to shoddy CRMs, personal spreadsheets or group Slack channels, relying on memory instead of a unified ledger that captures record, context, and prompts action.\n\nGood predictions demand consistent inputs. If half your calls are not recorded, the system is clueless. And yet despite this, many CRMs still cling to the Rolodex-like design. They store data, but they don\u2019t do much to capture it automatically or to enforce structured context. They also typically offer \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d fields, rather than letting you shape custom objects or data structures for your unique workflows.\n\nMeet the Clerkenwell Guerillas\n\nThis is where Attio enters the scene, a product that engages with a company\u2019s intangible relationship data with the same discipline finance software does for money. By minimising manual overhead through automation\u2014pulling in communications across an entire company\u2019s calendar and emails, Attio does most of the heavy lifting, so you do not have to rely on memory or repeated reminders to enter details in the correct fields.\n\nAttio merges three distinct layers\u2014system of record, system of context, and an emergent system of action\u2014to go beyond the old \u201cRolodex-plus\u201d model of CRM.\n\nFirst, it builds a complete system of record by automatically capturing all inbound emails and calls in one flexible data model. Next, it adds a system of context that meaningfully tags each interaction (e.g. \u201cConference Intro,\u201d \u201cInvestor Referral\u201d) so every record is truly useful. Finally, these layers converge into a system of action that provides follow-up prompts or tasks (like checking in with a lead who has stayed silent for two weeks).\n\nTake a concrete scenario:\n\nAs soon as a lead makes contact Attio parses the incoming communication. It recognises who sent the email or and immediately attaches the interaction to the correct contact or custom object (e.g., a \u201cDeal\u201d or \u201cReferral\u201d). Attio then uses enrichment and AI researchers in a workflow to identify attributes such as industry, job title, or potential deal size, and automatically tags each record with relevant labels\u2014like \u201cEnterprise Lead\u201d or \u201cHigh Priority Prospect.\u201d This classification means that, down the line, you can segment your contacts by precise criteria\u2014perhaps all referral-based leads from a particular conference, or all high-value prospects in the fintech sector. Proactive tasks can trigger based on signals such as product sign-ups, changes in usage analytics, or status changes on a record or list. If a high-value prospect sits idle for too long\u2014say, they haven\u2019t received a follow-up email in a week\u2014Attio shares a message in your Slack workspace with a nudge to follow up.\n\nThe holy grail\n\nDropbox revolutionised file-sharing by making it so simple that it was practically invisible to the user. Just drag a file into a folder, and it synchronises. That is the ambition for next-generation CRMs: make relationship tracking invisible. If it is seen as an extra chore, people skip it. When data capture occurs automatically behind the scenes, intangible details remain complete enough for accurate analytics. Suddenly, you see which leads stall after the second call, which introductions spark new deals, or which features are driving expansions.\n\nThe CRM game is an execution game, and Attio knows that tight integrations, useful enrichment models, and intuitive workflow automation let it function much like Dropbox did for file-sharing\u2014working in the background so you do not have to think about it.\n\nNail the execution, and we arrive at something interesting: if the previously hidden data in our emails, meetings and calls is now consistently captured, we could even identify previously impossible signals like \u201cDeals that mention Feature X in a second call tend to close 20% faster.\u201d\n\nChallenges in the empire\n\nPaul Graham has written about how successful software can implode under its own weight. The more features you add, the more complicated it gets to the point where, eventually, no one wants to use it. Salesforce teeters on that edge today, with entire teams required just to maintain or configure it. Meanwhile, smaller upstarts like Attio can pick off frustrated customers who only need 80% of Salesforce\u2019s capabilities\u2014but want them delivered in a simpler, more automated way without compromises.\n\nSalesforce can\u2019t just say, \u201cLet\u2019s scrap our architecture and rebuild from scratch.\u201d Their biggest customers rely on complex setups. So they keep bolting new features onto an already layered structure, which only adds further weight to an already complicated product. This is the Innovator\u2019s dilemma in action.\n\nMany teams now want an out-of-the-box solution with 80% of Salesforce\u2019s capabilities but without the overhead. When these smaller teams can scale with a more manageable platform, they avoid the tipping point of migrating to Salesforce altogether. That is precisely how an underdog can dethrone a behemoth: by meeting user needs more simply and holistically.\n\nHistorically, we\u2019ve seen parallels: AOL once dominated the internet access portal, but simpler, open systems eventually overshadowed it. If Attio can replicate that story in the CRM space, we might finally see a change in the guard take place over the next decade.\n\nYou can check Attio out here.\n\nImage credits: Colin O\u2019Brien\n\nThanks for reading!

But have you ever wondered about the Circle City\u2019s heaviest hitters?\n\nConsider this Indy Business 101 \u2014 your guide to our region\u2019s six key industries and three major employers.\n\nNote: When we say Indy metro area, that refers to Marion County.\n\nThe key industries\n\nWe\u2019re breaking down the six key industries that represent the Indy metro area\u2019s economy, based on data from Indy Chamber of Commerce. We\u2019ve listed them in order of top employment numbers.\n\nLogistics | 109,000 employees\n\nIndiana is known as the crossroads of America, so naturally, logistics companies in Indy are mainly involved in transportation and distribution activities. Logistics activities in Indianapolis are concentrated in two areas: air transportation + storage and fulfillment services. Major employers include Express Scripts, Amazon, and FedEx.\n\nManufacturing | 88,000 employees\n\nIndiana has the highest percentage of its workforce employed in manufacturing, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Allison Transmission, Nice Pak, and Red Gold are among the leading manufacturing businesses that operate in the Indy area.\n\nInformation Technology | 22,000 employees\n\nWhen you think of this industry, you may also think of the tallest building in the Indy skyline. Indianapolis has a strong niche in marketing technology, thanks to major employers like Salesforce. According to Techpoint research, almost half of the state\u2019s information technology workforce calls Indy home.\n\nLife Sciences | 21,000 employees\n\nAccording to Indy Chamber, the life sciences sector provides Indianapolis residents with enormous economic opportunities. On average, workers in the life sciences industry in Indy earned more than two times the regional average. Major employers include Eli Lilly & Co., Anthem, Roche Diagnostics, and Corteva.\n\nAgribusiness | 16,000 employees\n\nIndiana is a farming state, so it\u2019s no surprise that agribusiness is a significant economic driver of the state\u2019s economy. Statewide, this industry employs just over 75,000 individuals, not including primary production workers (farming). Indy is home to some major players such as Elanco, Beck\u2019s Hybrids, and AgReliant Genetics.\n\nSports | 16,000 employees\n\nWe love our sports in Indiana. From the NCAA headquarters to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, sports has been a catalyst for development + positive change throughout the Indianapolis area. The city has a rich history of hosting some of the biggest sporting events, so Indy knows a thing or two about competition.\n\nThe major players\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established the major industries, we bet you\u2019re curious for specific names. Whether you\u2019re job hunting (or just \u201ccasually prospecting\u201d), here are three major employers.\n\n\ud83d\udc8a Eli Lilly\n\n43,000 employees | Pharmaceutical | Search jobs\n\nRanked 455 on the Fortune 500 list, the pharmaceutical company was born in Indianapolis on May 10, 1876 and employs 12,000+ people in Indy alone. Today, Lilly is best known for clinical depression drugs like Prozac and Cymbalta, and its products are sold in approx. 125 countries.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Cummins\n\n75,500 employees | Manufacturing | Search jobs\n\nAlthough this company is based in Columbus, it also has a headquarters in downtown Indianapolis. The multinational corporation designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. It\u2019s been on Ethisphere World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies list for 14 consecutive years + ranked No. 24 on Newsweek\u2019s list of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies last year.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Salesforce\n\n72,682 employees | Tech | Search jobs\n\nAlthough the company wasn\u2019t born in Indianapolis, our city has become one of the tech company\u2019s largest outposts with more than 2,300 employees alone, according to Forbes. Salesforce is the world\u2019s No. 1 customer relationship management platform that helps businesses with marketing, sales, commerce, service, and IT teams work together from anywhere.\n\nThis information is derived from the most recent data published by the Indy Chamber of Commerce.",

However, selecting the right CRM system from the multitude of available options can be daunting. Some CRM systems offer just the features essential for small businesses , while others are robust enough to meet the demands of large enterprises. PCMag has been reviewing solutions from leading and lesser-known vendors for over a decade, so we can help ease your decision-making process. Our Editors' Choice winner, Zoho CRM, is full-featured and very customizable, but we also highlight other options that might be a better fit for your business. Make sure to click through to our in-depth reviews of each entry below and read our buying guide for more advice on the category.\n\nTable of Contents Best for Businesses Invested in Zoho Solutions Best for Fast-Growing SMBs Best for Easy to Use CRM for SMBs Best for Small Business Owners New to CRM Best for Larger SMBs Best for SMBs With Basic CRM Needs What Is CRM Software? How to Shop for a CRM System What's the Latest in CRM Software? How to Match a CRM System to Your Business Needs Why Is CRM Data Quality Important? Weigh Your Support Options Do CRMs Support Mobile Devices? Can CRMs Integrate With Your Existing Systems? How to Secure Your CRM Data\n\nGive Freshsales a look if you want a functional CRM that won't overwhelm your sales team with features. Its lightweight approach makes it especially good for organizations with limited or no prior CRM experience. If you already use some of the software on its integrations list, you should also appreciate its interconnectivity.\n\nFreshsales is an easy-to-use, entry-level CRM that's particularly suitable for small businesses and startups. Although it lacks some features of competitors, it does a good job of building integrations with other business software, such as calendars, email marketing services, and tools like DocuSign. It now includes an AI assistant that can analyze your contact profiles and help assess the likelihood of a sale.\n\nIf you aren't content with the flexibility of other CRMs you've tried, Apptivo is worth a look. Its extensive collection of features allows for near-endless customization. However, the sheer number of possibilities also comes with a drawback: complexity. If you lack the time, knowledge, or resources to set up and customize the software, you are likely better off with another service that focuses squarely on CRM. Keep in mind, too, that Apptivo lacks the AI-powered tools of competitors.\n\nApptivo CRM is a highly configurable software platform. It splits its wealth of features into multiple modules, allowing you to combine and arrange them to meet your company's unique needs. In addition to its core CRM capabilities, the platform supports multiple other business tasks, such as accounting, invoicing, and project management, making it a one-stop shop for all your business software needs.\n\nBudget-conscious companies should give Less Annoying CRM a look, but it's also a good choice for businesses that want a stripped-down, easy-to-use CRM that doesn't require a lot of complicated setup and configuration. Just be aware that its design simplicity means it's less feature-rich than more enterprise-ready solutions. For example, Less Annoying's reporting functions are relatively weak compared to those of more sophisticated systems. Although you can extend the system's capabilities with Zapier integrations, that added complexity might negate some of what makes it \"less annoying.\"\n\nLess Annoying CRM is positioned as an affordable turnkey system for small businesses and sole proprietors. It offers a good collection of essential features, combined with flat-rate pricing that's among the cheapest of all the products we tested. Ease of use is its key selling point, which is great for companies with limited CRM experience. Its user interface is straightforward and approachable. Also, Less Annoying's responsive web UI works as well on mobile devices as it does on desktop browsers.\n\nIf you're new to CRMs, HubSpot Smart CRM's free version is difficult to beat. And when you're ready to upgrade, HubSpot's robust ecosystem of sales, marketing, and service tools will serve you well. Just be prepared to spend a lot if you want all the features Smart CRM offers because they require a subscription to HubSpot's premium software products, such as Sales Hub.\n\nHubSpot offers a fairly full-featured version of its easy-to-use Smart CRM at no cost for up to two users. This tier doesn't have any time limits, so it's an excellent choice if you are just starting out with CRMs. HubSpot also makes it easy to upgrade to a paid plan as your business grows. Paying more gets you customizable reports, expanded support options, first-party payment processing, HubSpot's Breeze AI (which can generate reports and blog posts and summarize contact and company data), and more.\n\nIf you insist on a world-class CRM system backed by world-class support, Salesforce Starter is your SMB-friendly onramp to the platform and ecosystem. Just keep in mind that it has limited third-party software integrations and reporting capabilities. It's true that Salesforce scales to meet the needs of any business, but you should prepare to spend a bundle.\n\nSalesforce rewrote the book on CRM when it debuted in 1999, and it remains an industry leader today. Salesforce Starter is the company's entry-level tier, aimed squarely at SMBs. It does a great job of walking new customers through the setup and training process while providing the robust functionality and customization for which the Salesforce platform is known. Although its predecessor, Salesforce Essentials, was limited to small teams, Starter supports up to 325 users per instance. And when you're ready to grow beyond that, Salesforce is more than ready to accommodate you.\n\nZoho CRM has a lot to recommend to any business. If you're already using other products in the Zoho portfolio, it's practically a no-brainer. Only Salesforce will give you more features with a more polished UI. Then again, if you like the idea of the Zoho suite, but feel daunted by Zoho CRM's feature set, you should consider Bigin by Zoho , the company's lightweight CRM designed specifically for small businesses.\n\nZoho offers an extensive suite of SaaS business software, and its CRM offering is a standout tool. Its feature set rivals even behemoth Salesforce. Its latest additions include Zia, an AI-powered analytics engine for spotting sales trends and anomalies; and Canvas, a drag-and-drop interface editor. It doesn't hurt that Zoho CRM is priced within reach of smaller teams.\n\nWhat Is CRM Software?\n\nCRM software helps you track and nurture contacts to build customer loyalty and repeat sales. A good CRM makes the information it gathers accessible to other business platforms via integrations. In this way, CRM becomes the epicenter of how you manage your customer's journey, from the first marketing touch to a closed sale and on to the next engagement.\n\nSome small businesses use spreadsheets to mimic a CRM's functionality. However, this type of home-brewed solution delivers just a tiny subset of the features you get with a CRM and isn't ideal once your customer list grows beyond 100 entries.\n\nThe best CRM solutions are easier to use than spreadsheets and do more than just retain user and contact information. They also automate processes, such as creating calendar events, identifying new sales opportunities, prioritizing the sales pipeline, and setting appointment reminders. They can even rank opportunities by the likelihood of success. Integrating your other customer data so the CRM can access it, such as from your help desk, makes that possible.\n\nThis information is a goldmine of opportunity. It lets you identify prospects for up-sell or cross-sell, convert existing customers to new products or services, target new marketing, and track invoices. The software is also a fail-safe because it prevents multiple salespeople from chasing the same prospect. Choosing the right CRM software can dramatically improve your team's collaboration and productivity, which in turn increases sales.\n\nHow to Shop for a CRM System\n\nChoosing a CRM is a significant investment. Your pricing decision needs to start with knowing how your salespeople operate and having an idea of the features that can help them. You will get the best deal by knowing what you need and then matching that up with the appropriate pricing tier. But there are gotchas beyond that, too.\n\nFor example, the initial setup and training can eat up a chunk of the budget, as can upgrades and ongoing support. Integrating the software with existing systems might call for additional equipment. Does the CRM workflow mean the sales or customer service teams will need new PCs, smartphones, or tablets? These costs can add up quickly.\n\nNote that many CRM vendors are expanding beyond customer relationships. They're moving toward managing the sales lifecycle end-to-end, with CRM representing the customer journey. The more expansive the tool, the more customization you need to make it work.\n\nAs with any software, it's critical to take advantage of free trials. No matter how many reviews you read or demos you watch, you can't fully understand how CRM software works until you use it yourself. Be sure to have colleagues from different departments try out the software, too, so you can know how it works in various situations.\n\nMost vendors offer at least a 14-day trial (30 days is even better). Some, including Zoho CRM, offer free plans, albeit with limited features or users. These can either serve as a full-time solution for small companies or a long-term trial for larger ones.\n\nWhat's the Latest in CRM Software?\n\nCRM software is constantly evolving to help businesses improve their customer interactions and retention. Sometimes, that means adding new features and technologies. Other times, it means casting familiar features in a new light. As competing vendors jockey for position in the market, trends emerge that will define CRMs for the next few years.\n\nOne such trend is customers' tendency to prefer cloud-based CRM systems. All the CRM systems in our most recent tests are available as cloud-based subscriptions, and many aren't available any other way. This model, also called software as a service (SaaS), has several advantages over traditional, on-premises software, including lower upfront costs and greater scalability and flexibility.\n\nAnother recent development is social CRMs, which help businesses engage, manage, and monitor their social media presence and interactions. Social CRM software can also help companies leverage social media data to generate leads, identify influencers, and measure customer satisfaction.\n\nTaking the concept of social CRMs even further, omnichannel CRMs allow businesses to interact with customers across multiple channels and devices, including email, messaging apps, mobile, phone, and web. These aim to provide a unified view of the customer journey and preferences across all touchpoints.\n\nCustomer data platforms (CDP) are another emerging concept. These systems collect and unify customer data from various sources, such as online and offline transactions, social media, third-party platforms, and web browsing. CDP can help businesses create a singular, 360-degree view of a customer.\n\nFinally, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly prevalent. Over the past few years, CRM vendors have increasingly used AI to automate tasks, generate insights from data, and provide personalized recommendations. AI can also enhance customer interactions through chatbots, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants. More recently, some vendors have begun experimenting with generative AI, typically based on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to further improve these capabilities.\n\nHow to Match a CRM System to Your Business Needs\n\nThe most challenging part of making a good CRM choice is understanding what the product can do and what your salespeople need. Sales is a difficult and often fast-paced profession, which means the very tool you choose could actually burden your employees. That'll kill adoption rates, so you must understand what they need before tossing more technology into the mix.\n\nIt's tempting to forgo this homework and simply pay for one of the big, all-inclusive CRM software packages to have access to every feature. That approach will almost certainly wind up costing you more in both time and money while probably delivering less flexibility than you expect. That's because large CRM software packages are often platforms rather than tools. The numerous features they advertise are the product of integrations with various third-party solution providers, not merely options you can turn on. All these features can add cost.\n\nInstead, think about what tools your team is currently using and what processes they follow. Figure out how those tasks map to the CRM software you're evaluating. For example, if a tool forces users to dig through menus and submenus every time they want to log a call or email, it will complicate their jobs instead of simplifying them. An increasing number of CRM tools combine the email and sales experience into a single, smart inbox or centralized dashboard to manage all or most daily communications and tasks.\n\nThe ways in which companies interact with customers are shifting rapidly. Most customers still expect to interact with you via email, but social media is fast becoming a game-changing technology. Understand how your company engages with customers over email and make sure your CRM software complements that relationship. A fully optimized CRM should automatically capture data from email interactions, not force your employees to do that manually.\n\nAfter you look at the requirements from the sales team's perspective, flip it around and think about your customer. Maybe even run an online survey or focus group. What is their best sales experience? Once you know that, you can tailor your CRM to fit.\n\nWhy Is CRM Data Quality Important?\n\nData quality should be a key focus of that tailoring process. You need to pay attention not only to customer information that originates inside the CRM but also to the supporting data from other systems, such as finance or service desk tickets. Ensuring this data is \"clean\" means it needs to be directly on-target to the CRM's queries, in the proper format, and verifiable.\n\nA 2024 study from Validity surveyed more than 600 global organizations that use CRMs. Of the respondents, 24% of CRM admins said less than half of their data is accurate and complete, while 31% reported that poor-quality data costs them at least 20% of their annual revenue.\n\nEnsuring good data quality is a matter of testing and constant vigilance. You need to run regular and repeatable tests on your system. Depending on the size of your staff and your CRM investment, the Validity report recommends appointing a data management professional as the lead in keeping your CRM data clean. That person should manage the entire data flow, including your CRM and any connected apps. They should also handle the full spectrum of data management tasks, including automating data workflows, backup, and data protection. If you feel such a hire is in your future, you should pull that person in as early as possible, preferably at the evaluation stage.\n\nWeigh Your Support Options\n\nAs the saying goes, you should plan for success but prepare for when things go wrong. Whether it's a software bug or simply some difficulty with a particular feature, you'll need support from your vendor. That's why it's important to use your free trial period to evaluate the responsiveness and efficacy of your potential vendor's support team. Some tips:\n\nMake sure to understand the level of support you get with your pricing tier and whether you can modify it.\n\nResearch the provider's support forum. See what questions other customers ask and how long it takes for the company to respond.\n\nCheck for DIY resources. Are there self-service tools for specific issues if there's a support site? If there are, be sure to run through them to see how effective they are. Search the knowledge base to see what kinds of articles are there and whether they are in a useful format.\n\nInvestigate the product's training options. Complex tools usually require some training, so see what your service vendor provides. Is on-site, in-person training your only option, or are there online resources, such as well-organized blogs, recorded webinars, and videos?\n\nDo CRMs Support Mobile Devices?\n\nMake sure to take a close look at the CRM solution's mobile app. This should be a separate app, not just a mobile \"capability\" (which almost always means a mobile-optimized version of the desktop website). In addition, you shouldn't pay extra for it. Mobile devices are an entirely different breed from desktops or laptops. Employees use them differently, and software renders them differently, which means the business processes will also be different.\n\nMake sure your CRM software of choice can support the mobile device platform your team uses. Are you providing every employee an iPhone or is yours a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environment, which inevitably means supporting multiple platforms? Next, carefully evaluate what the app can do. Some apps offer a read-only view of your sales pipeline or contacts but don't let you make updates until you get back to a computer. Others offer a seamless and responsive experience, letting you do everything on a mobile device that you can on a computer. Don't commit to CRM software until you try the mobile app in a way you and your team would do on a day-to-day basis. For many SMBs and their agents, the mobile component of a CRM app might be more critical than the desktop version.\n\nMany CRM vendors cater directly to a mobile workforce. Apps for those are full-featured and responsive on mobile screens. If you have a field sales team that works on tablets and smartphones, you need to prioritize such tools.\n\nCan CRMs Integrate With Your Existing Systems?\n\nSalesforce and other larger CRM platforms have huge feature stacks that are available as modules with related features. If the features are what you need, you can configure your entire solution simply by accessing the right modules. But if something is missing, or your sales staff is simply more comfortable using something else, you may need to use software from third-party vendors to fill gaps.\n\nIntegration takes two basic forms. The easiest is if the CRM system or the system to which you're trying to connect supports the other as a \"native\" integration. That means that the company has a pre-built integration module you can just download and use as needed. You'll have the best luck with big-name targets here, as many companies pre-build integrations for companies such as NetSuite or Salesforce, for example.\n\nThe other method is rolling your own integration. This is easiest if both systems have an open application programming interface (API). The most common standard here is representational state transfer (REST). With a REST API, you can have developers build a custom integration for you. That option certainly provides the most flexibility and customization, but it can also add significant costs depending on the level of your coding talent.\n\nIt's also worth looking at any third-party software you're considering, or indeed any software you already use, to see if there are integrations available from that side. For example, maybe you already have email marketing software that you love, or you want to connect your help desk system to your CRM. It's entirely possible those vendors provide integrations with the CRM you're considering.\n\nHow to Secure Your CRM Data\n\nWhen you work with the sales pipeline and customer data, make sure security is top of mind\u2014especially if you're using a SaaS CRM solution (which means a big chunk, if not all, of your customer data resides in the cloud). You should feel comfortable with the company's security requirements. It's a warning sign when your CRM software lets you select a password but doesn't generate an audit trail whenever someone makes a change or if it doesn't let you define access controls for each user. Customer data is an extremely valuable commodity, especially now that customers are more reluctant to part with it. Securing it isn't just about maintaining privacy; it's about protecting profitable relationships that directly impact your bottom line.\n\nIntegrations play a role here, but it's mostly about research. You can make sure your CRM software integrates with as much of your current IT security software as possible, such as your identity management system, so your employees can take advantage of single sign-on authentication. But even more important than that is doing your homework. That means digging deep into the vendor's SLA and ascertaining exactly where your data resides, who is responsible for its safety, and what happens if there's a problem. Search for any past breaches and how the company responded, too.\n\nGadjo Sevilla contributed to this story.",

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 SaaS Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other SaaS stocks.\n\nAs 2024 comes to a close, the software-as-a-service or SaaS industry has been shaken up quite a bit. Artificial intelligence has defined the stock market in 2024 and ensured that investors can end in the green despite several sectors such as healthcare, real estate, and industrial performing poorly.\n\nThe age of AI has also affected the SaaS industry. These firms rely on margin-friendly revenue and stable recurring revenue through offering software products to businesses. However, AI offers firms the ability to self-develop software, which means that for SaaS firms, their products might not be as in demand.\n\nTo understand the impact of AI on SaaS stocks, consider two key valuation multiples for this sector. These are the enterprise value to revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value measures its market value and net debt, while the Rule of 40 checks whether a SaaS company is growing its revenue and free cash flows sufficiently. Higher readings for both are preferable, with the Rule of 40 in particular demanding a score greater than 40.\n\nResearch from Volition Capital shows that SaaS multiples have undergone seismic shifts throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent high interest rate regime, and the current interest rate era. Ahead of the pandemic, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of SaaS firms, i.e. those with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 and a greater than 30% revenue growth rate had a median revenue multiple of 22.9x. The multiple peaked at 42.3x in September 2020 as the booming demand for digital services meant that investors valued the firms more richly compared to their revenue.\n\nThen, as the Federal Reserve started to hike interest rates, the tables turned. Interest rates are key for SaaS stock performance as low rates mean that enterprises have plenty of cash to dole out for their spending. Additionally, higher rates also mean that since investors have more lucrative investment alternatives available, they place a higher premium for future growth. The high interest rates meant that in December 2022, the SaaS revenue multiple for the top firms was 9.2x, or less than four times its 2020 peak. The tail-end of 2022 also marked the start of Wall Street's current AI euphoria. Back then, only the GPU designer whose chips are powering AI or the software company known for Windows had benefited from investor attention.",

Anything from facial recognition to what you see next in your Instagram feed is driven by machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe second wave came with advancements in generative AI, with large language models built on the predictive capabilities of the first wave to generate new content from those predictions. OpenAI's ChatGPT brought generative AI to the masses in 2022, and its use across industries has exploded over the last two years.\n\nThe next wave of AI will build further on generative AI's capabilities, enabling AI to make decisions and take actions across applications without human intervention. Salesforce (CRM 2.82%) CEO Marc Benioff calls it the \"digital workforce.\" And his company is leading the growth in this Agentic AI with its new Agentforce product.\n\nWhile there's already been some excitement among investors for Salesforce's AI capabilities, sending shares up 39% since early September as of this writing (Dec. 30, 2024), the company is just getting started. Here's why Salesforce could see better-than-expected results in 2025, sending its stock even higher.\n\nAn \"unfair advantage\" in Agentic AI\n\nSalesforce is a leader in enterprise software. Its offerings span a customer relationship management solution, marketing automation, customer service applications, and data organization and analysis. As a result, many companies run a lot of their operations through Salesforce software and use it to store and harness customer and business data.\n\nThat's a big advantage when it comes to AI. Artificial intelligence algorithms are only as good as the data used to train them. Salesforce has accurate and specific data about each of its enterprise customers that nobody else has. While individual businesses could give other companies access to those data, Salesforce's ability to quickly and simply integrate client data as well as its own data sets makes it a top choice for customers looking to add AI agents to their \"workforce.\" During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Benioff called Salesforce's data an \"unfair advantage,\" noting Agentforce agents are more accurate and less hallucinogenic as a result.\n\nBenioff also called out what might be Salesforce's largest competitor in Agentic AI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). While Microsoft has a lot of access to enterprise customers thanks to its Office productivity suite and other enterprise software solutions, it doesn't have as much high-quality data on a business as Salesforce. As a result, Microsoft's Copilot abilities might not be up to Agentforce in many instances. Benioff points out Microsoft isn't using Copilot to power its online help desk like Salesforce.\n\nAgentforce can be used to deflect customer service cases or resolve issues. It can process unorganized data for review and then use it to optimize marketing campaigns it created in the first place. It can qualify sales leads those marketing campaigns bring in before handing them off to a human agent for a sales call, ensuring businesses can close more deals in less time.\n\nThe customer response has been strong. Salesforce signed 200 Agentforce deals in its first week after launching at the end of October. On the third-quarter earnings call, Benioff said there are thousands more transactions in the pipeline.\n\nAnalysts expect a surge in AI agent spending as well. Multiple forecasts call for greater than 40% annual average growth through the end of the decade or beyond. Salesforce is well-positioned to win a significant share of that market.\n\nA stock worth a premium price\n\nSalesforce stock isn't cheap, but compared to other big AI stocks, it trades for an attractive valuation.\n\nInvestors can currently pick up shares of the stock for about 30 times analysts' fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026) estimates. That's a better price than Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 33.\n\nSalesforce's current remaining performance obligations accelerated last quarter, climbing 10% year over year. That suggests Salesforce will see revenue accelerate in the coming quarters. With the strong early demand for Agentforce, that acceleration could continue for several more quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, management's focus on driving profitable growth is paying off. The current forecast for Salesforce's fiscal 2025 (ending in January) operating margin is now 32.9%, up 240 basis points from 2024. Management sees further improvements ahead as it anticipates strong growth in its Data Cloud, driven by Agentforce adoption. Salesforce's profits should grow faster than revenue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile analysts don't see Salesforce taking off significantly in 2025 (earnings estimates call for 12% earnings growth), they seem to be optimistic on the stock price. The median analyst price target is $415, implying 23% upside from here.\n\nBut if there's one thing investors have learned from the last two years of AI innovation, it's that these things often grow faster than anticipated. That could lead Salesforce to outperform analysts' expectations over the next few years, as it leads the third wave of artificial intelligence.",

            "content": "Global enterprise software giant SAP SE SAP has been scratching at all-time highs as its business gets lifted by artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds. SAP is an acronym for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing. The company provides cloud-based business software through its flagship enterprise resource planning (ERP) product.\n\nThis package integrates a comprehensive and synergistic range of business software, including accounting, human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), project management, and procurement functions onto a single unified platform. The company custom tailors its software to meet the needs of each specific industry with AI and machine learning capabilities into their core applications.\n\nSAP is a leader in the computer and technology sector, competing against multinational enterprise software giants like International Business Machines Co. IBM, Microsoft Co. MSFT, Salesforce Inc. CRM and Oracle Co. ORCL. Some of their major corporate clients include The Clorox Company CLX, eBay Inc. EBAY, NVIDIA CO NVDA and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.\n\n30% of Deals in Q3 Involved AI Use Cases\n\nThe updraft was certainly evident in its third quarter 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 6% YoY to $1.33, which beat analyst estimates by 2 cents on 9.4% YoY revenues growth to $9.17 billion, which also beat consensus estimates of $9.15 billion. The current cloud backlog rose 25% YoY to $15.38 billion. Cloud ERP Suite revenue rose 34% YoY to $3.67 billion. Cloud revenue rose 25% YoY to $4.35 billion.\n\nThe company has had ongoing cloud transformation transitioning clients for the past four years, and it's hitting its stride driven by AI. Buoyed by Gen AI Hub, nearly 30% of its cloud order entries in the quarter were deals that had AI use cases. SAP hit its goal of 100 AI use cases across its suite. AI consumption by SAP customers more than quadrupled in the quarter. SAP completed its $1.5 billion acquisition of digital adoption platform WalkMe.\n\nSustained Momentum Moving Ahead\n\nSAP expects the momentum to remain steady moving forward. They bumped up their cloud and software revenue forecast by $433 million at the midpoint to $31.93 billion to $32.24 billion. Cloud revenue is expected to be between $18.41 billion to $18.73 billion, maintaining its previous forecast.\n\nWhile SAP doesn't anticipate margin risks in 2025, it is speculative how AI activity may impact gross margins beyond 2025. However, the company believes AI will be margin accretive. The company has been very consistent in 2024 as the AI trend has been unwavering, which points to a strong Q4 2024.\n\nSAP Forms an Ascending Triangle Pattern\n\nAn ascending triangle is comprised of a flat-top upper trendline resistance converging with an ascending (rising) lower trendline support. The breakout occurs when the stock surges through the upper trendline. If the stock collapses under the lower ascending trendline, then the pattern fails as a breakdown forms.\n\nSAP formed the upper flat-top trendline resistance at $242.10 converging with the lower ascending trendline support which commenced around the $219.55 swing low. SAP tested the upper trendline resistance nearly eight times without managing to break out, and the ascending trendline was tested twice. The daily anchored VWAP support is at $236.35. The daily RSI is rising at the 62-band. Fibonacci (Fib) pullback support levels are at $237.30, $231.10, $224.60, and $214.65.\n\nSAP's average consensus price target is $252.35, implying a 0.96% upside and its highest analyst price target sits at $300.00. It has eight analysts' Buy ratings and one Hold rating. The stock has a miniscule 0.11% short interest.\n\nActionable Options Strategies : Bullish investors can consider using cash-secured puts at the Fib pullback support levels to buy the dip. If assigned the shares, then writing covered call at upside Fib levels executes a wheel strategy for income on top of its 0.69% dividend yield.\n\nThe article \"SAP: AI Tailwinds Accelerating Enterprise Cloud Business\" first appeared on MarketBeat.",

            "content": "Despite a late-year stock market downturn, 2024 was a record-breaking year for U.S. equities, especially in the technology sector. According to Finbold, using data from CompaniesMarketCap, the ten largest U.S. tech companies collectively added $6.6 trillion to their market capitalization\u2014a remarkable 51.31% increase compared to 2023.\n\nApple took center stage as the world\u2019s most valuable company, reaching a market cap of $3.8 trillion. Meanwhile, Nvidia experienced the most dramatic growth, with its valuation surging by more than $2 trillion in 2024\u2014a staggering 175.3% year-over-year (YoY) increase.\n\nU.S. Tech Sector Surges\n\nBroadcom also saw impressive gains, rising from $461 billion in 2023 to $1.1 trillion by the end of 2024. Alphabet overcame challenges such as declining search engine quality and Department of Justice interventions, growing its valuation by $592 billion, or 33.71%, to $2.3 trillion.\n\nMeta Platforms and Tesla Motors returned to the $1 trillion club, with YoY growth of 64.02% and 69.52%, respectively. Even smaller firms like Oracle and Salesforce delivered strong performances, with Oracle\u2019s market cap rising 61.08% to $467 billion and Salesforce growing 26.14% to $321 billion.\n\nAI as a Key Growth Driver\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom was a major catalyst behind this unprecedented growth. Nvidia, supplying microchips pivotal for AI developments, became the sector\u2019s standout performer. Microsoft, credited with jumpstarting the AI trend through its investments in OpenAI, grew more modestly, adding $364 billion (13.03%) to its valuation.\n\nFinbold previously noted that between late 2022 and mid-2024, the top 10 AI companies collectively gained over $5.4 trillion in market cap. As the AI boom continues, tech giants capitalizing on this trend are expected to grow even further.\n\nBubble Concerns Loom\n\nHowever, the meteoric rise of big tech stocks has raised concerns among analysts and investors, drawing comparisons to past market bubbles, including the Dot-com era. Critics argue that the increasing disparity between large-cap tech firms and the broader market could lead to instability.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) latest inflation forecast triggered a sharp $1.5 trillion market correction in a single day, underscoring the fragility of the current environment.\n\nOutlook for 2025\n\nWhile some analysts caution that a bubble may be forming, optimism remains high for 2025. Industry leaders like Nvidia are projected to reach valuations of $4 trillion or more. Whether the tech rally continues or a market correction looms remains to be seen.\n\nSource: Finbold",

            "content": "The year 2024 was a strong one for stocks involved in artificial intelligence (AI), and winners could be found in a variety of areas. For example, Nvidia and Broadcom helped lead the AI chip and infrastructure space higher, while Palantir Technologies was a huge winner in the AI software sector. Amazon and Alphabet helped lead the charge in the cloud computing space.\n\nFor investors looking to invest in AI stocks without trying to pick out the next individual winners, there are a number of solid AI-focused exchange-traded funds (ETF) to invest in for 2025. Let's look at three good options to consider.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. See the 10 stocks \u00bb\n\nRoundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF\n\nThe Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) is an actively managed ETF, meaning that it is managed by a team of investment professionals who can buy and sell stocks within its portfolio based on their research. It currently has 51 holdings, and over 90% of its portfolio is in large-cap stocks that have market caps of $10 billion or more.\n\nThe ETF is fairly new, starting in May 2023. It has been a strong performer in 2024, up about 31%. It has an expense ratio of 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 invested.\n\nThe Roundhill ETF currently has a nice, well-rounded portfolio of top holdings across the AI space that cover all aspects of AI, including semiconductors, cloud computing, system integrators, and software. If you want a mixture of stocks benefiting from AI, this is a great ETF to start with.\n\nIts top holdings as of Dec. 29, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Nvidia NVDA 7.56% Alphabet GOOGL 5.70% Microsoft MSFT 5.29% Meta Platforms META 4.17% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM 3.71% Dell Technologies DELL 3.51% Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE 3.23% Palantir Technologies PLTR 3.05% Broadcom AVGO 3.04% Arista Networks ANET 3.02%\n\nKraneShares Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\n\nThe KraneShares Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AGIX) is a fund that started in July 2024, so it has a very limited history. The fund largely tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, although it can also hold shares in private companies outside of the index as well.\n\nThe Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index includes stocks based on a proprietary AI Exposure Score that is meant to determine how well prepared a company is to benefit from AI. The index includes companies with market caps above $2 billion involved in hardware, infrastructure, and applications.\n\nWhile the ETF is newer, I really like its portfolio heading into 2025. It has exposure to cloud computing providers and the top chipmakers in Nvidia and Broadcom. It also has some solid AI software companies, which could be the next stage of AI winners. However, its 1% expense ratio is on the high side.\n\nIts top 10 holdings as of Dec. 27, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Microsoft MSFT 7.53% Meta Platforms META 7.50% Amazon AMZN 5.20% Nvidia NVDA 4.64% Apple AAPL 4.63% Salesforce CRM 3.93% ServiceNow NOW 3.70% Tesla TSLA 3.67% Alphabet GOOGL 3.58% Broadcom AVGO 3.28%\n\nGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\n\nThe oldest of the ETFs, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ), has been around since May 2018. It tracks the Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index, which includes companies set to benefit from AI. It has an expense ratio of 0.68%.\n\nThe ETF adds a bit of diversity from your typical AI ETF with more of a focus on software, which is about 40% of its portfolio. Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks, which tend to make a large percentage of most ETF funds, represent less than 15% of its holdings. Nvidia is only its 13th-largest holding at 3%. It also adds some international exposure, with companies outside the U.S. representing nearly 30% of its holdings.\n\nIf you're looking to build a portfolio of a few AI ETFs, the Global X Artificial Intelligence ETF is a nice option since it is still investing in AI-related stocks, but its make-up is different. Meanwhile, the ETF has been a solid performer over the years, with an average annual return of nearly 18% over the past five years as of the end of November.\n\nIts top-10 holdings as of Dec. 27, 2024, were:\n\nName Ticker Weighting Tesla TSLA 4.74% Broadcom AVGO 4.00% Netflix NFLX 3.84% ServiceNow NOW 3.83% Saleforce CRM 3.58% Cisco CSCO 3.48% Meta Platforms META 3.33% IBM IBM 3.28% Amazon AMZN 3.25% Oracle ORCL 3.20%\n\nAI ETFs\n\nWhile AI has helped power the market in 2024, the technology still appears to be in its early innings. AI infrastructure stocks have tended to be the big early winners, but there is an expectation that other areas of AI, such as software, could be the next group of stocks to benefit. As such, AI continues to look like a strong theme to invest in for 2025, and these ETFs are a nice way to get some diversified AI exposure.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "content": "Look to US market for capital gains, says investment guru Adam Khoo\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 The US market will continue to suck in liquidity and outperform all others in 2025 but investors must pick the right buys and stay invested for the longer term.\n\nThat is the advice of well-known Singapore investment guru Adam Khoo, whose Adam Khoo Learning Technologies Group is one of Asia\u2019s largest investor training and education companies.\n\n\u201cNo one can predict the market, but if you are looking for growth and capital gains, you won\u2019t find anything close to the US market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only other market that offers anything close to this kind of growth is India, but you have to contend with the potential depreciation of the Indian rupee.\u201d\n\nIndeed, US equities remained a magnet for global capital flows throughout 2024, with around US$500 billion (S$680 billion) in inflows during the year. The S&P 500 had run up about 24 per cent for the year till Dec 30, while the Nasdaq was up by 30 per cent, and the Dow Jones was ahead by 13 per cent.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned 58 per cent over the past two years, and 13 per cent annualised over the past decade.\n\nAnalysts said the surge underscores global confidence in the US economy and market, and has driven the Tina (\u201cThere is no alternative\u201d) narrative as Europe remains weak and China is mired in economic malaise.\n\nBut Mr Khoo, a millionaire who has made a fortune via savvy stock investments, sees more upside on Wall Street.\n\nHe advised investors to identify good companies offering reasonable valuations, high growth and strong free cash flow, and whose products will remain in demand over the coming decade.\n\n\u201cI buy into companies we cannot live without,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe reckoned that despite the sharp run-up, selected consumer discretionaries such as Nike, LVMH and Lululemon are still relatively cheap. US healthcare plays like United Healthcare, which have pulled back sharply in recent weeks, are also in his sights.\n\nAlthough tech has run up sharply, he sees value in high-growth, high-quality tech plays such as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and Amazon.\n\n\u201cIf you look at just Amazon, they are into e-commerce, Prime, cloud computing and advertising,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazing growth drivers.\u201d\n\nMr Khoo said that while valuations from a price-earnings (PE) standpoint for tech stocks seemed high, high growth could justify them: \u201cI\u2019d rather buy a high-growth stock with a PE of 30 or 40, instead of being stuck with a low-growth stock with a PE of just five. The growth will justify the PE.\u201d\n\nHe added that the local bourse offered value, rather than growth: \u201cThe Singapore market is one of the best for yield, and this is tax-free. The banks and S-Reits (Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts), in particular, offer very good returns for yield seekers.\u201d\n\nMr Khoo holds several S-Reits, especially those under the Temasek and Fraser groups.\n\nIndeed, CGS International noted recently that the Singapore market offers an overall forward yield of 4.1 per cent and return on equity of about 12.3 per cent for 2025.\n\nIt recommended that investors focus on high-yield, high-growth stocks and value plays on the Singapore Exchange. Its top calls were Ascendas Reits, iFast, Sembcorp Industries, Seatrium, Singtel, UOB, Sats, ST Engineering, Yangzijiang and Keppel Corp.\n\nAmong the second-liners, favoured stocks cited by various brokers include LHN, Tiong Woon, Grand Banks, Marco Polo Marine and Centurion.\n\nMr Khoo warned that while chasing companies based on profitability and growth, investors should not lose sight of factors like free cash flow.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at Hyflux and Nobel Group, which collapsed some years ago, they had earnings, but were in negative free cash flow. Earnings numbers can be manipulated, but cash flow inadequacy shows up as red flags.\u201d\n\nMr Khoo said the decision between investing for capital gains and dividend yield would also depend on the age of the investor.\n\n\u201cIf you are young, you might want to chase capital gains,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter you build up capital gains, start looking at dividends. So if you are young, look at the US stock market for growth. Pick the top 1 per cent of companies which have consistent and predictable cash flows.\n\n\u201cCompanies which can sustain a competitive advantage in the marketplace for the next 10 years, these would be companies with pricing power that gives them an economic moat. Even if they raise their prices, people will still buy their goods and services.\u201d\n\nCyber-security companies have this moat as well, he added: \u201cThey have barriers to entry into their business, and it is often expensive and inconvenient for customers to switch to another vendor.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Khoo largely avoids commodity, real estate and motoring stocks, citing their thin profit margins, cyclical revenue streams, highly competitive operating environment and high debt.\n\nHe advised investors to do some homework and crunch the numbers. As a general rule, investors should seek out stocks which offer a return on equity of 10 per cent to 15 per cent, a debt-to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of under three times, and a debt servicing ratio (debt to cash flows) of under 30 per cent.\n\nUsing these principles, Mr Khoo has seen his portfolio of Wall Street stock holdings grow 220 per cent since early 2019. This is in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic and interest rate hikes.\n\nMr Khoo, 52, who has authored 14 best-selling books on investment, finance and personal development, does not invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI only invest in what I can value. You can value a real asset, but the value of crypto is purely psychological and hype-driven.\n\n\u201cTo me, crypto is the greatest fool\u2019s game. And the game will go on until the music stops, like musical chairs. You can purchase a painting, put it in a museum, and charge for viewing. How do you make money on crypto, other than via speculative bets?\u201d\n\nMr Khoo, who also founded online investor school Piranha Profit, warned against investing with a Fomo (fear of missing out) mindset: \u201cDon\u2019t rush (into) stocks just because your friend or neighbour says he or she is making money.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to lose money is by listening to people, but not doing your own research. Also, do not get into investments beyond your understanding.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the importance of differentiating between speculating and investing, saying: \u201cThey require different mindsets. In speculative trading, you must have a stop-loss position.\n\n\u201cIn investing, there is no stop loss. You buy and hold for five, 10 or 15 years. Don\u2019t pay attention to short-term volatility.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeculating is like a one-night stand. Investing is like marriage, a long-term commitment,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nDespite the sharp run-up by US stocks in 2024, Mr Khoo remained cautiously upbeat on Wall Street stocks in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are at the early stages of the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution. Meanwhile, the increase in global liquidity will continue amid easing of the monetary cycle. The US market will also be bolstered by tax cuts under the Trump administration and more deregulation across sectors.\u201d\n\nMr Khoo, whose YouTube channel has clocked up over 55 million views and has more than one million subscribers, is now building an AI-driven stock analysis website called Stock Oracle that will be offered to subscribers.\n\nDoes he see a black swan event in 2025 which could upend markets?\n\n\u201cThe two I would watch out for are runaway inflation arising from (US President-elect Donald) Trump\u2019s policies, and geopolitical risks such as (Russian President) Vladimir Putin going after the Baltic states after his Ukraine campaign.\u201d\n\nBut he added that black swans are only such when they cannot be predicted or contemplated.\n\n\u201cBear markets of the past have arisen from things unforeseen. But if you can project and price in the black swan, the impact would be less.\n\n\u201cWhile it is impossible to know what is going to happen, in 78 per cent of all years, the US market has risen. For Singapore, 54 per cent of all years have seen the ST Index rise.\u201d\n\nMr Khoo noted that on average, there have been three stock market pullbacks of 5 per cent in a year, with one pullback possibly as much as 10 per cent. Some of these pullbacks offer opportunities to pick up good names.\n\n\u201cThere has been a bear market once every six years, but we are already overdone during the past six years when we had bear raids during the 2020 pandemic, and in 2022 when the Fed started to hike rates. So I\u2019m hopeful we are done.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Mr Khoo said preparing a balanced portfolio will enable investors to ride through the bumps.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

            "content": "The early winners from artificial intelligence (AI) are largely companies involved in AI infrastructure, but software companies have also begun to benefit. Two of the top AI software companies heading into 2025 are Palantir Technologies (PLTR 8.31%) and Salesforce (CRM 2.82%).\n\nPalantir has already begun to see the benefits from AI, with its AI platform helping its revenue accelerate. This led to an incredible performance in its stock price in 2024. Salesforce, meanwhile, has just recently introduced its important AI solution.\n\nLet's see which stock looks poised to outperform in 2025.\n\nAI-powered growth\n\nWhen it comes to AI software, Palantir is the early leader. The company took its early success with the government, where its analytics platform is used for mission-critical tasks such as fighting terrorism, and integrated AI models into its platform. This helped essentially transform the company's platform into an AI operating system that is able to help customers make data-driven decisions across a multitude of use cases in various industries.\n\nEschewing creating its own AI models, Palantir's focus has been on the application and workflow layers, where its platform can help with logic and functionality to provide the actions needed to complete tasks. It then rigorously tests these custom solutions through tools within its platform to make sure they can be applied to real-world applications.\n\nPalantir's AI platform led to strong growth within the commercial sector. Last quarter, its U.S. commercial revenue climbed 54% to $179 million, while its U.S. commercial customer count jumped 77% year over year. Overall revenue rose 30% to $726 million.\n\nHowever, this could really just be the start of Palantir's success, as much of its early AI success has been through proof-of-concept (prototype) work. Taking customers from proof of concept to real-life applications (production), could be a huge growth driver moving forward.\n\nWhile Palantir got its start as an analytics platform for the government, Salesforce established itself as the leader in customer relationship management (CRM), where its platform acts as a centralized hub to store customer information all in one place. Through its acquisitions of Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack, it has moved into the areas of automation, analytics, and employee communication.\n\nSalesforce, meanwhile, is looking to become the leader in agentic AI. This is often viewed as the next stage of AI, where AI agents can act autonomously without human intervention to help make decisions and take actions to achieve a specific goal.\n\nOn this end, the company recently introduced Agentforce, its autonomous AI agents. These agents can be built and used for various cases. The company uses an example in the financial industry, where Agentforce can research discussion points before a meeting, such as a company's exposure to international markets, or even check power-of-attorney status to ensure proper compliance and then direct any communications to properly licensed supervisors. In the healthcare industry, for example, it can review benefit coverage and approve care requests.\n\nAgentforce was launched just in October, but the company said on its early December earnings call that it already closed 200 Agentforce deals and had thousands of potential deals in its pipeline. Agentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per conversation, and the company sees the potential for having 1 million Agentforce AI agents deployed by the end of fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). As such, this is a huge opportunity for the company over the next few years.\n\nValuations and verdict\n\nPalantir is currently the much faster growing of the two companies, with revenue growth of 30% last quarter compared to 8% for Salesforce. Salesforce forecast similar 7% to 9% revenue growth for Q4, while Palantir guided for 27% revenue growth. If their AI solutions take off, both companies have good potential upside to these forecasts.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Salesforce is the much cheaper stock. It trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of under 8 times next year's estimates, while Palantir trades at nearly a 51 times multiple. That is an extraordinary valuation for a company currently growing its revenue by 30%, and is more than double peak historic software-as-a-service (SaaS) multiples.\n\nWhile Palantir has a potential huge opportunity in front of it, a lot of future growth is priced into the stock and there is not much room for error. As such, for 2025 I prefer the safer and much cheaper Salesforce, which looks like it has its own big opportunity in front of it with Agentforce.",

            "content": "Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this customer-management software developer have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.61 per share, indicating a change of +14% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $10.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.",

Despite the merger, each retailer will continue to operate independently under its existing brand name, according to the announcement.\n\nEquity contributions from Amazon and Salesforce partially funded the transaction. As an investor, Amazon will focus on driving innovation for customers and brand partners, Saks Global said in the release. As well, Salesforce will use AI and first-party data to create a \u201chighly customized shopping experience,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cBy uniting Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, and Saks Fifth Avenue, we have created an unparalleled multi-brand luxury portfolio with tremendous growth potential,\u201d Richard Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global, said in a statement. \u201cWith data and innovation at our core and a portfolio of prime real estate, we aim to redefine the luxury shopping experience.\u201d\n\nNeiman Marcus acquisition cements Saks Global as a luxury retail powerhouse\n\nThe acquisition follows a definitive agreement signed in July between Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. (HBC), the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, and Neiman Marcus Group, parent of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. Saks Global is the U.S. division of Toronto-based HBC.\n\nUnder the deal, Saks Global said it also gains control of both HBC\u2019s U.S. real estate assets and Neiman Marcus Group\u2019s real estate assets, creating a combined $7 billion portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, HBC\u2019s Canadian business will now operate as a standalone entity, separate from Saks Global. The division ensures that HBC\u2019s Canadian business and real estate assets and Saks Global are separately financed, the company said.\n\nHudson\u2019s Bay, which includes its brick-and-mortar stores and TheBay.com, has been recapitalized and will continue executing its business plan. According to the announcement, the company will continue to own or lease a CAD$2 billion real estate portfolio, either entirely or with its joint venture partner, RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust.\n\nHudson\u2019s Bay Co. (HBC) is No. 27 in the Top 1000. The database is Digital Commerce 360\u2019s ranking of North America\u2019s largest online retailers. Nieman Marcus is No. 62 in the database.\n\nAmazon and Salesforce drive innovation and personalization\n\nThe deal\u2019s financing includes equity contributions from a group of prominent new investors. Among them are Amazon, Salesforce, Authentic Brands Group, M. Klein & Company, and G-III Apparel Group.\n\nAmazon, which ranks No. 1 in the Top 1000, \u201cwill work with Saks Global to innovate on behalf of customers and brand partners,\u201d Saks said. The ecommerce giant also holds the No. 3 spot in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s Global Online Marketplaces Database, which ranks the 100 largest such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value.\n\nSalesforce will also play a crucial role in advancing Saks Global\u2019s technology strategy, using first-party data and AI to deliver a more personalized shopping experience, according to the announcement.\n\n\u201cAs one company, we have an opportunity to transform the way we serve consumers, blending art and science to ensure each customer\u2019s experience is unmistakably their own,\u201d said Marc Metrick, CEO of Saks Global Operating Group, in a statement. \u201cWith deep relationships across the industry, cutting-edge personalization and strategic technology partnerships, we are poised to drive innovation and growth.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, G-III Apparel Group, the owner of brands like DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld, will continue as a key merchandising partner for Saks Global, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile, Authentic Brands Group, which owns more than 50 brands including Brooks Brothers and Eddie Bauer, will extend its collaboration with Saks Global through the previously announced Authentic Luxury Group (ALG) joint venture.\n\nAccording to the companies, ALG combines the strengths of Authentic and Saks Global to expand the reach of Authentic Brands\u2019 luxury brands across sectors such as fashion, retail, digital platforms, hospitality, real estate, art, and travel.\n\nDebt financing and ownership structure support the deal\n\nSaks Global said it also financed the acquisition through $2.2 billion in senior secured notes and an asset-based revolving credit facility,\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, HBC launched a $2 billion-plus, five-year junk bond offering in December to help fund the acquisition.\n\nExisting investors, including Rh\u00f4ne, Insight Partners, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, and Abrams Capital, will maintain their ownership stakes in the restructured entity.\n\nSaks Global leadership structure refined for growth\n\nAs part of the acquisition, Metrick, the former Saks CEO, is now CEO of Saks Global Operating Group. Ian Putnam, former president and CEO of HBC Properties and Investments, becomes CEO of Saks Global Properties & Investments. Both will report directly to Baker.\n\nBergdorf Goodman will remain a standalone business in the deal. Tracy Margolies, previously Saks\u2019 chief merchandising officer, will step into the role of Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cTracy\u2019s deep expertise and track record of leading results-driven strategies will propel Bergdorf Goodman into the future while honoring its unique legacy,\u201d Metrick said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, Saks Global has created the role of president and chief commercial officer. Emily Essner, formerly Saks\u2019 chief marketing officer, will take on this new position, overseeing \u201cthe company\u2019s go-to-market strategy by aligning key commercial functions to enhance the customer experience and drive revenue,\u201d according to Saks.\n\nTo further support its transformation strategy, Saks Global has also appointed Bill Bine as its chief transformation officer, a newly created role.\n\nBine joins Saks Global from Neiman Marcus Group, where he previously served as chief supply chain officer.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

            "content": "Big Tech\u2019s been shedding talent like a snake sheds its skin, and Salesforce is no exception. In fact, the cloud software titan laid off a jaw-dropping 8,000 employees earlier this year. But here\u2019s the twist: they\u2019re still paying Matthew McConaughey an astounding $10M a year. While the workforce is getting slimmed down, McConaughey\u2019s cashing in as Salesforce\u2019s \u201ccreative adviser and TV pitchman.\u201d Talk about a Hollywood-sized paycheck amid Silicon Valley cuts.\n\nSo how did The Lincoln Lawyer star end up in the Salesforce mix? Well, back in 2022, McConaughey teamed up with the tech giant to co-create #TeamEarth, a campaign designed to get businesses and individuals to take action for a fairer, more sustainable world. The goal? Inspirational, noble even\u2014but not exactly the usual techie talk. McConaughey didn\u2019t just ride in on a white horse, though. Salesforce reportedly paid him $10 million to dish out creative advice, front slick campaigns, and be, well, McConaughey. That\u2019s a pretty hefty paycheck for a guy more used to directing traffic on The Dark Knight than managing cloud software.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Salesforce HQ, things weren\u2019t quite so glamorous. While McConaughey was rolling in the green, 8,000 Salesforce employees were shown the door, receiving nothing more than a 3 a.m. Slack message to break the news. If you\u2019re one of those workers, seeing McConaughey pocket millions for his creative genius probably stings a little. But hey, maybe it was all part of the plan, right? Right.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff\u2014known for referring to his employees as \u201cfamily\u201d\u2014was apparently not the mastermind behind McConaughey\u2019s deal. He insisted to The Wall Street Journal that he didn\u2019t have a hand in signing the actor, nor did he get involved in what McConaughey\u2019s being paid. Instead, the deal went through Salesforce\u2019s compensation committee, leaving Benioff off the hook.\n\nMcConaughey didn\u2019t just appear in Super Bowl ads wearing an astronaut suit (though that was a highlight). Salesforce dropped a reported $5 million to air the ad, and Benioff was reportedly cool with the spend. It was a small price for him to pay for a little McConaughey magic. Let\u2019s face it: you can\u2019t really put a price on that kind of star power.\n\nAnd McConaughey wasn\u2019t just a pretty face. Talk about a duo that screams techie meets rockstar. This wasn\u2019t just an ad gig; McConaughey was, in some way, helping to shape the future of the company.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s big-name marketing strategy has been a staple for years, and McConaughey is just the latest in a line of flashy figures the company\u2019s used to build its brand. While the average consumer might not use Salesforce\u2019s products directly, they sure know the name\u2014and McConaughey\u2019s involvement certainly didn\u2019t hurt. But when the company\u2019s cutting jobs left and right, it makes you wonder if the cost of star power is starting to outweigh the benefits.\n\nIn the end, McConaughey\u2019s $10M paycheck might look a little out of place in a company slashing thousands of jobs, but in Silicon Valley, anything can be justified. Maybe it\u2019s all part of the \u201cfamily\u201d plan or just about keeping up appearances. Either way, is McConaughey living the good life while Salesforce\u2019s former employees are not? Not so much.\n\nFor more such stories, check out Hollywood News\n\nMust Read: Is The Real Housewives Of Rhode Island In The Works?

Ives, a frequent guest on CNBC throughout 2024, reiterated his confidence in the sector, predicting a 25% increase in tech stocks in the new year. He pointed to key players like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR) as his top picks, emphasizing that we are still in the early stages of AI\u2019s impact on technology.\n\nIves likened the current phase of AI development to being in the \u201csecond inning\u201d of a nine-inning game, suggesting that there\u2019s significant growth yet to unfold. He highlighted the multiplier effect of AI spending, explaining that for every dollar invested in AI chips, there\u2019s an $8 to $10 return across the tech sector, illustrating the profound economic impact of AI adoption.\n\nThe conversation also touched on investor expectations for tangible returns from the massive investments in AI by tech giants. Ives believes we\u2019re at an inflection point where companies like Palantir and Salesforce (CRM) are demonstrating real-world applications of AI, signaling that the sector is beginning to justify its investment. He mentioned an increase in AI use cases within enterprises, with deployment rates growing fivefold in the last six months, underscoring software\u2019s pivotal role in this transformation.\n\nWhen asked about skepticism regarding certain software companies\u2019 AI potential, Ives named Adobe (ADBE) as one where he sees less immediate impact from AI, although still acknowledging its potential. He contrasted this with his confidence in companies like Palantir, Salesforce, MongoDB (MDB), Snowflake (SNOW), and Oracle (ORCL), which he believes are at the forefront of AI integration into their business models. He also predicted a surge in mergers and acquisitions in tech, suggesting that with less regulatory scrutiny, major tech players would grow even stronger.\n\nRegarding concerns about Palantir\u2019s high valuation\u201450 times sales\u2014and insider selling, Ives advocated for a long-term view, arguing that if Palantir can emulate the growth path of companies like Oracle or Salesforce, its current metrics could be justified. \u201cI think this is a stock that has potential to be 3 digits and higher,\u201d he stated, dismissing short-term noise and emphasizing the company\u2019s ability to expand its AI platform (AIP) and increase its revenue share from AI solutions.\n\nIves\u2019s discussion on CNBC paints a picture of a tech sector on the cusp of a significant growth phase, fueled by AI\u2019s transformative potential. His insights provide a roadmap for investors looking to navigate the complexities of technology investments in the coming year, emphasizing execution, innovation, and strategic acquisitions as key drivers of success.",

(ticker: GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) that aren't technically classified as tech companies by the Global Industry Classification Standard have businesses that revolve around disruptive technology, such as artificial intelligence and cloud services. Here's a look at the 10 biggest U.S.-listed public tech companies:\n\nCompany Market Capitalization Apple Inc. (AAPL) $3.8 trillion Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) $3.32 trillion Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) $3.15 trillion Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) $1.09 trillion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) $1.03 trillion Oracle Corp. (ORCL) $454 billion Salesforce Inc. (CRM) $320 billion SAP SE (SAP) $290 billion ASML Holding NV (ASML) $280 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) $236 billion\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nNot only is Apple the most valuable company in the world, it is also one of the most profitable companies. While Apple's revenue growth has slowed, it reported a whopping $93.7 billion in net income in fiscal 2024. Its massive profits supported $94.9 billion in annual buybacks. One of Apple's next profit growth opportunities could be the rollout of its long-awaited, internally designed cellular modem chips starting in 2025. Apple's vertical integration strategy and ongoing product innovation could help the company improve iPhone profit margins in the next several years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.8 trillion\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nHigh-end semiconductor maker Nvidia has been one of the most spectacular growth stories in the entire stock market since the 2008 financial crisis. In March 2009, Nvidia's market cap was under $5 billion. Just 16 years later, Nvidia's historic bull run has sent the stock's market capitalization soaring above $3 trillion, and the company continues to churn out impressive growth numbers thanks to booming AI infrastructure demand. Not only was Nvidia the best-performing stock on this list in 2024, it was the third best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 for the year.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.32 trillion\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest software company and is known for its Windows operating system, Azure cloud services, LinkedIn social media platform, Office professional software suite and Xbox gaming brand. Microsoft is one of the oldest companies on this list. The company was founded in 1975 and went public in 1986. Nearly half a century after its founding, Microsoft's pivot to subscription-based software, professional cloud services and AI technology has helped it maintain the revenue growth long-term investors have come to expect. Microsoft is hoping its investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will help usher in its next era of growth.\n\nMarket capitalization: $3.15 trillion\n\nSponsored Brokers 1 Interactive Brokers Account Minimum $0 Fee $0 Low commission rates start at $0 for U.S. listed stocks & ETFs*.

(AVGO)\n\nBroadcom is a diversified designer, developer and supplier of analog semiconductor devices. Broadcom has been a 20-bagger stock for investors in the past decade, gaining more than 2,234%. Those returns don't even include the stock's 1.1% dividend. In addition to its impressive organic revenue growth, Broadcom's 2023 acquisition of VMware could significantly boost its software capabilities. Broadcom is highly exposed to Apple device sales and should also continue to benefit from growth in data center networking and AI infrastructure spending. VMware could help Broadcom diversify into higher-margin, recurring software sales, providing additional financial visibility for investors.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.09 trillion\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest contract chipmaker, producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips designed by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) and other customers. Taiwan Semiconductor was founded back in 1987 and has been the leading dedicated global semiconductor foundry ever since, generating a 793% return for investors in the past decade. In recent years, Taiwan Semi's foundries have become even more important to the tech world given Intel Corp. (INTC) has struggled with its in-house manufacturing processes. Taiwan Semiconductor holds an impressive 64% share of the global semiconductor foundry market.\n\nMarket capitalization: $1.03 trillion\n\n\n\nOracle Corp. (ORCL)\n\nOracle is one of the world's largest enterprise software and cloud services providers, specializing in database management software. Oracle has stable top-line growth, generates consistent profits, has an attractive valuation and is reinvesting excess income in stock buybacks and its 0.8% dividend. Oracle has world-class data center infrastructure, and its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system helps manufacturers manage their processes, including planning and purchasing materials. The company claims its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Supercluster is currently the largest, fastest AI supercomputer available in the cloud. AI chipmaker Nvidia is one of Oracle's major cloud computing customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $454 billion\n\nSalesforce Inc.

While Salesforce's revenue growth has slowed in recent years, its profits and margins have increased. Salesforce was a pioneer of the software-as-a-service model, and the company's aggressive acquisition strategy has allowed it to build the most comprehensive portfolio of CRM products in the market. Salesforce's large customer base creates opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, and the company has a history of high customer retention rates. Salesforce automation remains a high-growth market, and AI technology investments could help Salesforce capture even more market share in the coming years.\n\nMarket capitalization: $320 billion\n\nSAP SE (SAP)\n\nSAP is a global leader in ERP software. The company offers several AI-driven business solutions to help companies optimize finance, supply chains, procurement, sales and marketing. SAP's Qualtrics segment sells experience management cloud solutions. The company's intelligent spending category includes Ariba and Concur, which focus on procurement, travel and expense reporting. SAP is transitioning its business to a cloud-based model, and it has reported early success with its AI products, including its digital copilot, Joule. SAP's ability to consistently secure large-scale deals is a testament to its value to customers.\n\nMarket capitalization: $290 billion\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML)\n\nASML is headquartered in the Netherlands and is one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers. The global semiconductor market could become a $1 trillion industry by 2032, and ASML is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Chipmakers use EUV technology to print increasingly smaller chip designs. ASML doesn't design or produce any chips itself, it simply designs the machines that create cutting-edge chips for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and other chipmakers. Given ASML's key role in semiconductor manufacturing and its lack of competition, the company has plenty of growth opportunities ahead.\n\nMarket capitalization: $280 billion\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)\n\nCisco Systems provides networking, cloud, and cybersecurity hardware and software. Cisco is a rare value among mega-cap tech stocks given its shares trade at just a 16 forward earnings multiple. It also pays an attractive 2.7% dividend. Cisco is a market leader in enterprise networking, including switching, routing and wireless access. The company also has complementary businesses in security and collaboration services, adding diversification and cross-selling opportunities. While the rise of the public cloud has threatened Cisco's legacy business, the company has successfully pivoted its networking business to focus more on software and public cloud services.",

The company aims to enhance automation and reduce costs for businesses by integrating customer data with next-generation AI agents.\n\nAnalysts estimate this AI monetisation phase could add approximately $80 per share to Salesforce\u2019s valuation in the next 12 to 18 months, pushing through the $400 mark. Salesforce stock looks set to end the year at around $335, having risen 31% during 2024.\n\nWedbush also mentioned other notable players benefiting from the AI wave, including Oracle, IBM (IBM:NYSE), Snowflake (SNOW:NYSE), MongoDB (MDB:NASDAQ), Elastic (ESTC:NYSE), and Pegasystems (PEGA:NASDAQ).\n\nWhile Wedbush analysts remain optimistic about the sector\u2019s growth potential, they highlight economic and technological risks, urging investors to consider these dynamics when making decisions.\n\nFind out how to deal online from \u00a31.50 in a SIPP ISA or Dealing account\n\nIssue Date: 31 Dec 2024",

            "content": "Wall Street will be expecting Salesforce (CRM) to improve profit margins for CRM stock in 2025 amid higher investments in artificial intelligence. But revenue growth from AI products most likely will be the biggest factor for Salesforce stock.\n\nIn 2024, CRM stock has gained 28%. Salesforce stock hit a high of 369 on Dec. 4 but has retreated during December. Shares trade near the 50-day moving average of CRM stock.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV), an industry index that includes many big-cap software companies, has advanced 26% in 2024. The S&P 500 has gained 25%.\n\nSalesforce Stock: Agentforce Momentum\n\nIn late 2024, Salesforce and other software makers began shifting marketing strategy away from generative AI \"copilots\" to autonomous, goal-driven AI \"agents.\"\n\nCopilots, basically conversational chatbot interfaces, aim to improve worker productivity but rely on human prompts. Agents execute multi-step tasks on behalf of users by solving problems and taking action.\n\nSalesforce introduced Agentforce at its Dreamforce customer conference in September. In December, Salesforce announced an upgraded version, Agentforce 2.0, along with its \"Digital Labor Platform.\"\n\nSalesforce is incorporating AI agent technology into its broad array of customer management, customer service and marketing automation products.\n\nAI Product Revenue Impact\n\nThe software maker's new Agentforce business model is \"consumption\" based. That means customers will be charged based on usage.\n\nThe big question is how much revenue growth will come from Salesforce's new AI products. In fiscal 2026, which starts with the March quarter, Wall Street projects only 9% revenue growth to $41.4 billion for CRM stock.\n\n\"We estimate Agentforce could provide incremental 1% to 2% points of revenue growth in fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 each,\" said Bank of America analyst Brad Sills in a report.\n\nWall Street also expects AI products to boost a key financial metric: current remaining performance obligations. CRPO bookings are an aggregate of deferred revenue and order backlog.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce reported third-quarter earnings that missed estimates amid a one-time investment loss, while revenue and a key metric came in above expectations.\n\nCRM Stock: Acquisitions Back\n\nWhat's more, Salesforce is once again making acquisitions, albeit smaller ones. In its biggest deal since Slack, Salesforce in September acquired Own, a data protection and data management vendor, for $1.9 billion in cash. Further, Salesforce recently bought Zoomin, an unstructured data management company with existing ties with Salesforce.\n\nLast year, a Salesforce reportedly was in talks with Informatica (INFA) but a deal did not materialize.\n\nFurther, Salesforce sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. The company has expanded into marketing, e-commerce and data analytics. It's making a big push into the life sciences market.\n\nStill, Microsoft's (MSFT) Dynamics software has gained traction as a lower-priced alternative to Salesforce tools, analysts say\n\nThe customers of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies like Salesforce purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than on-premise software licenses. Also, customers receive automatic software updates via the web.\n\nSalesforce Stock: Acquisition Spree\n\nIn 2023, Salesforce refocused on improving operating margins amid cost-cutting spurred by activist investors.\n\nFurther, a Salesforce acquisition spree that began in 2013 has complicated its margin outlook for over a decade.\n\nIn 2018, Salesforce bought MuleSoft for $6.5 billion in cash and stock. MuleSoft's software automates the integration of new tools with legacy enterprise platforms and speeds application development.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce in 2019 agreed to buy data analytics firm Tableau for $15.7 billion in an all-stock deal. Tableau provides data visualization software. In addition, it enables customers to build databases, graphs and maps using time series analytics, a technique that analyzes a series of data points ordered in time.\n\nThen came the Slack Technologies deal. Amid growing competition with Microsoft, Salesforce paid $28 billion for the workplace collaboration software maker.\n\nIs CRM Stock A Buy?\n\nAccording to IBD Stock Checkup, CRM stock currently has a Relative Strength Rating of 87 out of a best-possible 99. The best stocks tend to have ratings of 80 and above.\n\nMeanwhile, CRM stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, Salesforce stock is not in a buy zone. CRM stock needs to build a fresh base to be actionable.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and 5G wireless.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nLearn How To Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nHow To Use The 10-Week Moving Average For Buying And Selling\n\nGet Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech Report | How To Invest",

(NYSE:CRM) stands against the other long-term stocks.\n\nTo select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals.\n\nOn December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a \"barbell\" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities.\n\nIn the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year.\n\nPettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment.",

Photo from PwC Israel\u2019s Exit Report 2024\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at the top 10 deals that defined this groundbreaking year:\n\n1. Own acquired by Salesforce ($1.9b)\n\nOwn, a Tel Aviv-based data protection platform, was acquired in a blockbuster $1.9 billion deal. Founded in 2015, the startup offers enterprise cloud data protection that caught the attention of Salesforce, a global customer relationship management leader with over $31.4 billion in annual revenue.\n\nBy acquiring Own, Salesforce is likely aiming to strengthen its data protection capabilities by integrating the startup\u2019s backup and recovery technologies directly into its cloud ecosystem. An additional benefit offered by the deal is that they can now tell cocktail party guests that they \u201cown Own.\u201d\n\n2. Resident acquired by Ashley Home ($1b)\n\nResident is an online furniture and mattress sales company that uses advanced algorithms for personalized product recommendations and virtual room design. The $1 billion acquisition by Ashley Home, a leading furniture retailer with over 1,000 North American locations, is a sign that some people really do need a computer brain to tell them which big fluffy slab they\u2019d best like to sleep on.\n\nBy acquiring Resident, Ashley Home gains access to e-commerce tech that could majorly enhance its online shopping experience, which is only becoming more important as people grow less willing to leave their homes and flop around in mattress store showrooms.\n\n3. BioCatch acquired by Permira ($750m)\n\nThe majority stake of BioCatch, a behavioral biometrics cybersecurity company founded in 2011, was acquired for $750 million by Permira, a global investment firm managing over $65 billion in assets. The Tel Aviv-based startup has developed technology that analyzes how users interact with their devices to enhance online security and prevents digital fraud.\n\nFor Permira, the deal adds a sophisticated fraud detection platform to its portfolio, which seems like a decent pie to have a finger in, what with all the phishing and vishing and smishing going around these days (those are all real terms, look it up).\n\n4. Run:ai acquired by Nvidia ($720m)\n\nFounded in 2018, Run:ai has emerged as a serious player in AI infrastructure, developing platforms that help organizations efficiently manage and scale their machine-learning workloads. They\u2019ve definitely been doing a bang-up job of that, considering that they drew the attention of Nvidia, the world\u2019s current leader in AI computation and chip development. The $720 million deal positions Nvidia to provide better solutions for enterprise AI.\n\nA graphics processing unit produced by Nvidia. Photo by Stas Knop/Pexels\n\n5. SuperPlay acquired by Playtika ($700m)\n\nSuperPlay, an Israeli mobile game development studio, was acquired by Playtika for $700 million in a deal that proves that there\u2019s still a lot of money to be found in phone games that try to take your money. For Playtika, the acquisition reinforces its position as a leader in the competitive mobile gam(bl)ing industry.\n\n6. V-Wave acquired by J&J ($600m)\n\nV-Wave is a developer of minimally invasive solutions for structural heart diseases. Its flagship product, an implantable device designed to treat chronic heart failure, was cool enough to convince Johnson & Johnson to shell out a cool $600 million to add it to their portfolio.\n\nV-Wave\u2019s tech provides J&J with a significant opportunity to advance medical treatment options within the cardiovascular space.\n\n7. Variscite acquired by Telysis ($589m)\n\nVariscite develops computing boards for embedded systems and devices in industrial and automotive applications. The $589 million buyout by global technology investment firm Telysis just goes to show that, even though your company may not be easily explainable over the dinner table, it could still be worth a hefty chunk of change.\n\n8. HiredScore acquired by Workday ($530m)\n\nHiredScore is developing a platform that uses AI algorithms to optimize hiring processes. This hot technology seemed like a worthy $530 million acquisition to Workday, which specializes in providing cloud applications for finance, human resources and planning.\n\nIntegrating AI-driven recruitment and talent management directly into its existing HR platform will help Workday give corporate clients the enterprise human management solutions they so desperately crave.\n\n9. Dazz acquired by Wiz ($450m)\n\nDazz is an Israeli cybersecurity company that focuses on simplifying and automating security remediation processes, aiming to make cybersecurity teams more strategic and developers more efficient. The company was acquired for $450 million by Israeli cybersecurity unicorn Wiz in what could reasonably be described as \u201ca steamy Israeli-on-Israeli affair,\u201d assuming you were writing about it and wanted to have a little fun. Woo-hoo.\n\nWiz employees have good reason to be happy after the company reached a $10b valuation. Photo courtesy of Wiz\n\n10. Noname Security acquired by Akamai ($450m)\n\nSince it started doing business in 2020, Israeli cybersec startup Noname Security has become a leader in API (application programming interface) security \u2014 which is a kind of security that is fervently desired by people who know what API is.

            "content": "ZDNET\n\nIncreasingly, we hear about AI agents being the new \"digital workers\" -- a concept that arose before agentic or generative AI hit the mainstream in areas such as robotic process automation. Digital workers are designed to serve the discipline and obedience, but just like human workers, they, too, have their quirks.\n\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024 - and how I plan to use it in 2025\n\nThe movement toward a digital workforce has been taking big leaps lately, marked recently by Salesforce's unveiling of Agentforce 2.0, a digital labor platform for enterprises. The platform enables \"a limitless workforce through AI agents for any department, assembled using a new library of pre-built skills, and that can take action across any system or workflow.\" The platform also takes steps well beyond RPA, featuring \"enhanced reasoning and data retrieval to deliver precise answers and orchestrate actions in response to complex, multi-step questions,\" according to a statement from Salesforce. The agents even interact in Slack.\n\nAugmenting teams with digital labor\n\nMajor organizations are leveraging the platform to augment their teams with digital labor, the vendor added.\n\nTalent is scarce and expensive to train, so organizations are turning to AI to help with customer interactions and deal with workflow backlogs, but can no longer afford \"inadequate solutions that provide generic responses,\" Salesforce stated. \"Existing solutions such as copilots struggle to provide accurate, trusted responses to complex requests -- such as personalized guidance on a job application. They cannot take action on their own -- like nurturing a lead with product recommendations.\"\n\nAutonomous digital workers can now perform such work at many levels, industry leaders agree. \"The convergence of skilled innovators, rapidly-deployable cloud tools, customer awareness and executive support has created an ideal environment for agentic AI to thrive in 2025,\" Chris Bennett, director of AI transparency and education at Motorola Solutions, told ZDNET.\n\nFor example, Motorola Solutions has begun leveraging agentic AI \"to improve public safety and enterprise security, with applications that analyze and surface data in real-time to provide crucial, immediate support to first responders and security personnel,\" Bennett stated. \"AI agents never get bored, tired, or distracted, automating repetitive tasks and freeing responders for critical responsibilities and community engagement. AI agents can accelerate tasks like reviewing historical video footage, helping investigators quickly find missing persons through natural language search.\"\n\nThis works via AI agents intuiting processes to \"create a series of steps, or a recipe to solve a problem,\" said Viswesh Ananthakrishnan, co-founder and vice president of Aurascape. They can also \"take actions to execute these steps and even collaborate with other agents to do so. When combined together, this data gives the agents a view of how the enterprise functions.\"\n\nAlso: OpenAI's o3 isn't AGI yet but it just did something no other AI has done\n\nThe AI agents then \"develop and execute complex processes, like viewing demand forecasts and taking proactive action to generate and submit order forms for more inventory before supplies run low,\" he continued. \"This type of automation saves workers significant time and frees them up from repetitive tasks.\"\n\nAI agents need to be thoughtfully managed\n\nAt the same time, AI agents need to be thoughtfully managed, just as is the case with human work, and there's work to be done before an agentic AI-driven workforce can truly assume a broad range of tasks. \"While the promise of agentic AI is evident, we are several years away from widespread agentic AI adoption at the enterprise level,\" said Scott Beechuk, partner with Norwest Venture Partners. \"Agents must be trustworthy given their potential role in automating mission-critical business processes.\"\n\nThe traceability of AI agents' actions is one issue. \"Many tools have a hard time explaining how they arrived at their responses from users' sensitive data and models struggle to generalize beyond what they have learned,\" said Ananthakrishnan.\n\nUnpredictability is a related challenge, as LLMs \"operate like black boxes,\" said Beechuk. \"It's hard for users and engineers to know if the AI has successfully completed its task and if it did so correctly.\" In addition, he cautions that there is still unreliability in AI agents. \"In systems where AI creates its own steps to complete tasks, made-up details can lead to more errors as the task progresses, ultimately making the outputs unreliable.\"\n\nAlso: Why ethics is becoming AI's biggest challenge\n\nHuman workers also are capable of collaborating easily and on a regular basis. For AI workers, it's a different story. \"Because agents will interact with multiple systems and data stores, achieving comprehensive visibility is no easy task,\" said Ananthakrishnan. It's important to have visibility to capture each action an agent takes. \"This means deep visibility into activity on endpoint devices and the ability to process data in a vast variety of formats.\" Then, it's important to be able to \"quickly combine this context from endpoints with network-level traffic to determine the data informing the agent's actions,\" as well as \"recognize the type of AI agent interfacing with your data, whether it's a trusted entity, or a brand-new agent.\"\n\nThe AI systems engineer\n\nThis may boost an emerging human-centered role -- the AI systems engineer. \"This new quality assurance and oversight role will become essential to enterprises as they manage and continuously optimize AI agents,\" Beechuk said.\n\nIn multi-agent environments, \"AI agents will be interacting and evolving constantly, consuming a steady diet of new data to perform their individual jobs,\" he explained. \"When one of them gets bad data -- intentionally or unintentionally -- and changes its behavior, it can start performing its job incorrectly or with less precision, even if it was doing it perfectly well just one day before. An error in one agent can then have a cascading effect that degrades the whole system. Enterprises will hire as many AI systems engineers as it takes to keep that from happening.\"\n\nAlso: Generative AI is now a must-have tool for technology professionals\n\nCompanies and tech teams may be \"well-positioned to support agentic AI, but we still need time and experience to strike the right balance between agentic and human workflows,\" Bennett advised. \"Our advice is to view AI as an augmentation to human experts, not a replacement.\"",

The directors for SFDC Ireland state revenues continued to rise due to increased performance in the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) along with Asia Pacific (APAC) regions.\n\nThe directors say that they expect the business to continue to grow in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company achieved the return to profit despite the costs associated with Salesforce progressing a group wide restructuring plan that included a reduction in its workforce by 10% and select real estate exits and office space reductions. The directors state that in January 2024 a further 1% workforce reduction was announced impacting a number of global teams.\n\nThe directors say that the impact of both initiatives is reflected in the Full Year 2024 accounts. The company sells Salesforce products and services in Europe, Middle East and Africa along with Asia Pacific along with providing consulting services and support to customers.\n\nThe company recorded an operating profit of $5.33m after recording an operating loss of $997.5m in the prior year. Net interest receivable of $49.7m compared to interest costs of $5.66m in the prior year resulted in the pre-tax profit of $54.94m.\n\nThe company recorded a post-tax loss of $53.55m after incurring a $108.49m corporation tax charge.

            "content": "The future of customer support lies in the hands of AI. Over the past few years, companies across the world have assessed the feasibility of using AI to interact with their customers \u2013 and as of today, their attempts have been quite successful.\n\nSalesforce, the cloud-based sales applications provider, has slashed human escalations in its support infrastructure by a whopping 50%, CEO Marc Benioff revealed on a podcast. He explained that the company plans to realign its workforce, needing fewer support engineers, thanks to a new \u201crobotic support layer\u201d introduced through Agentforce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said.\n\nAgentforce is an AI-focused platform that helps businesses create and deploy agents that leverage language models and tools within the Salesforce ecosystem. The company also announced its second iteration, Agentforce 2.0 and has been actively integrating Agentforce internally. At the Agentforce 2.0 launch event, Benioff said, \u201cI\u2019m not just managing human beings, but also managing agents.\u201d\n\nBarely a few months ago, he had said that his vision was to empower one billion agents with Agentforce by 2025. This isn\u2019t Benioff\u2019s prediction; it is the reality that many startups and companies are living in today.\n\nFor instance, Klarna, a Swedish payment company, said it eliminated hundreds of human jobs by integrating AI to handle customer queries. It was also reported that Klarna reduced the query resolution time from 11 minutes to 2 minutes. Moreover, the AI integration reduced repeat inquiries by 25%.\n\n\u201cAI can do all of the jobs that we humans do. It\u2019s just a question of how we apply and use it,\u201d said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna.\n\nIn another case, BT Group, the British telecommunications company, said that their virtual assistant \u2018Aimee\u2019 handles up to 60,000 customer conversations per week. \u201cOver 30 separate customer experiences have been defined within Aimee so far, with more to follow,\u201d said the company in an announcement.\n\nVCs Bullish on AI Customer Support\n\nCertainly, AI chatbots will sound robotic and won\u2019t have the human touch. Therefore, the onus is on using voice models that are more empathetic in their conversations.\n\nA report from Zendesk suggests that building confidence in AI agents is mostly dependent on how engaging and friendly they are. \u201cMore than two-thirds [of 5,000 surveyed] of consumers say they\u2019re more likely to engage with and trust AI agents that exhibit these human-like traits\u2014behaviours that, ultimately, lead to improved CX metrics.\u201d\n\nSalesforce also revealed that a majority of customers do not reuse a company\u2019s chatbots after just one negative experience. \u201cCustomers\u2019 expectations continue to increase. They want faster, more personalised service and expect companies to adapt,\u201d it said.\n\nA huge amount of capital is being poured into startups building AI-focused customer support. According to Tracxn, over $6 billion dollars have been invested globally in AI customer service and support platforms over the last four years.\n\nY Combinator led 31 investment rounds, and Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, a16z and Khosla Ventures led 32 rounds collectively.\n\nSierra, a conversational AI platform for businesses, raised a record $175 million in 2024. Founded by OpenAI chairman Brett Taylor, Sierra helps companies build AI \u201cagents\u201d that can automate tasks such as customer service and voice calls.\n\nWhat Does It Mean for India?\n\nAs per a report published in December 2024, India\u2019s call centre, or customer support market, is valued at $33 billion.\n\n\u201cBy 2028, more than 50% of customer interactions will likely be handled by AI-enabled systems, helping companies reduce operational costs by over $400 million annually,\u201d read the report.\n\nTata Consultancy Services\u2019 CEO, K Kirthivasan, believes that AI can push the call centre business to its grave. In an interview earlier this year, he said, \u201cIn an ideal phase, there should be minimal incoming call centres. At present, the technology should be able to predict a call and proactively address the customer\u2019s pain point.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eighteen Indian startups building AI-related customer service platforms have collectively raised over $600 million in the past four years. Gupshup led the pack and raised over $400 million in the same duration.\n\nGupshup, a conversational messaging platform founded in 2004, recently partnered with the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to power the AI chatbot \u2018Jagriti\u2019 to enhance the complaint-filing process in India.\n\nMoreover, leading e-commerce and payment platforms have also turned to AI customer support. Last month, Meesho, an Indian e-commerce platform, unveiled an AI-powered voice bot.\n\nThe company said that the bot handled around 60,000 daily calls and observed a 50% improvement in handling time. It was also able to resolve 95% of the queries.\n\nWhile Meesho did not report any job cuts, the company did say that the bot freed up time for humans to solve more complex issues.\n\nHowever, PhonePe, one of India\u2019s leading payment apps, took a rather brutal approach. Over the last five years, the company has cut its customer support team by 60%.\n\n\u201cThis efficiency was achieved by increasing automated customer service issue resolutions powered by AI-driven chatbots to over 90%,\u201d read their 2024 annual report.\n\nOn the other hand, Ixigo, a travel platform, uses its voice bot, Tara. It handles over 1,000 conversations that sum up to 100 hours daily. The voicebot is also said to resolve 86.95 % of customer complaints without any human intervention.\n\nHowever, AI in customer support comes with its share of other problems. Earlier this year, an EY report said that \u201c61% [of those surveyed] are more inclined to share personal information with a human rather than through automated processes\u201d.\n\nThe report also revealed that 78% of consumers preferred to shop on platforms that provided human customer service support.\n\n\u201cWhile Indian consumers are putting a lot of faith in artificial intelligence and other technologies, the human touch through authentic, trustworthy connections and engagement is becoming more important than ever before,\u201d said Angshuman Bhattacharya, EY India, national leader \u2013 consumer product and retail sector.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for humans? Benioff recently said that Salesforce is adding 2,000 employees to sell the company\u2019s AI-focused products. Perhaps the next big opportunity is to help humans understand why they need AI products.",
