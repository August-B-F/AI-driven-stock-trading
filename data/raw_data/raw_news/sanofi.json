            "content": "In this Pharmaceutical Executive video interview, Kimberley Chiang, vice president of biopharma commercial solutions at CoverMyMeds, discusses \"The 2025 Medication Access Report.\" She highlights gaps in data-sharing and cross-functional collaboration as major bottlenecks that cause delays, rework, and increased patient burden. Chiang shares that only 3% of patients utilize support programs due to a lack of awareness. A large majority of the report's respondents plan to expand funding for patient support programs within the next 5 years due to large number of new therapies expected to come to market.\n\nPharmaceutical Executive: Beyond traditional copay assistance programs, what innovative solutions or strategies does the report show are emerging to address the rising cost of medications and improve patient access?\n\nKimberley Chiang: Beyond traditional copay programs, innovating in this area is going to be critical in the next few years. The challenge is to rethink the journey. We need to see patients in more dimensions than we\u2019re seeing them today. We need to see more than just their ability to pay. There are more things that are critical drivers of adherence and access to medication that should be considered along the patient journey.\n\nWe are big advocates for a comprehensive view of the patient, expanding that view, and then bringing that into the data. For folks that are bringing and designing projects and financial support programs, this means figuring out how to design those dimensions in to ensure that we\u2019re not just looking at pure affordability. This means going beyond asking if they have coverage and what their copay is. Expanding beyond that is one of the most critical elements to evolving the state of patient affordability programs.\n\nThe way to do that is in the design. Traditional co-pay programs only look at two dimensions: do you have a copay and can you afford to pay. We have to look at a couple of different elements. Using patient education as an example, we can educate patients to self-advocate and declare the challenges they might be experiencing in a community. The ability for a person who\u2019s living on their own to pay for a taxi to take them to receive their medication at a distant clinic impacts whether they even consider taking the medication.\n\nHow can we look at all of the dimensions of a patient and plan those assessments into program design to ensure adherence from the beginning? We think of adherence as perpetually being on the medication and living well. A lot of the work in the past 5 years has been around structing adherence support programs for patients who have agreed to go on a prescription and have no affordability issues.\n\nAddressing adherence issues at the very beginning is a change to that paradigm. We\u2019re moving off of the linear patient journey and looking at dimensionalizing the patient experience. How do we plan forward and proactively identify those gaps? What algorithms can we use with predicative analytics to look at a patient\u2019s profile and show what a support program looks like that has the best chances of that patient getting, staying on, and doing well with medication? What levers do we need to play with in a support program to ensure that the patient\u2019s holistic needs are managed? This includes educating them, managing travel concerns, and pre-planning all of that.\n\nThe journey doesn\u2019t look like a straight line. We need to constantly review if the patient\u2019s needs have changed as their journey improves or time passes. Are there ways to intervene early using predictive analytics? Should we intervene with certain types of patients on certain dimensions early in their healthcare journey to have the best outcomes? This is the important element in designing patient support programs. We\u2019re going to spend the money, but how do we do that differently going forward?\n\nThe other element is bringing the concept of digital healthcare forward so that patients have digital solutions and tools at their fingertips. Patients today can do all of their other needs on their phones. This is the mobile phone culture which we talk about quite extensively in the report. However, a patient who\u2019s experiencing illness can\u2019t pick up their phone to search for help with their questions or find affordability options. They don\u2019t have tools to monitor where they should be in their healthcare journey. There is an overwhelming appetite for innovative tools.\n\nHowever, digital solutions come with a bit of a paradox: more digital solutions mean less human touch. The industry is going to be challenged with striking that balance between putting efficient digital tools in the hands of the patients while also allowing for the human touch when it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s a balance that we need to strike, and it\u2019s going to be a challenge that the industry is going to face. Eighty percent of patients say they prefer something digital, but how many are actually using digital tools when available?\n\nWhat we need to monitor as we bring these brilliant, innovative solutions forward is the balance with the patient\u2019s access to a human touch.",

In early clinical studies, DR-0201 has demonstrated the ability to strongly deplete B cells, an effect that according to Sanofi\u2019s release on Thursday gives it the \u201cpotential to reset the adaptive immune system.\u201d\n\nUnder Thursday\u2019s agreement, Sanofi has also promised to hand over up to $1.3 billion in certain development and launch milestone payments. The companies expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2025, contingent on regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. It remains unclear what the arrangement for royalties will be.\n\nHouman Ashrafian, head of research and development at Sanofi, said in a statement that this approach of inducing deep B cell depletion \u201cis at the forefront of treating autoimmune diseases\u201d and has \u201cthe potential to elevate the treatment effect for patients,\u201d especially those who show poor or suboptimal response to existing therapies.\n\nDR-0201 is currently in a Phase I trial for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as a Phase I basket trial for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases.\n\nWith the DR-0201 buy, Sanofi moves closer to its ambition of becoming an \u201cthe leading immunology company,\u201d as Ashrafian said in a May 2024 statement. The pharma already has an imposing presence in this space with its Regeneron-partnered blockbuster drug Dupixent, originally approved in 2017 for atopic dermatitis and racking up additional immune-related indications, most recently for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Dupixent is the first biologic to be approved for this indication.\n\nTo add to its success with Dupixent, Sanofi has made a number of recent deals to bolster its immunology portfolio. In June 2024, the company linked up with Belharra Therapeutics to develop small-molecule drug candidates against undisclosed immunology target. The pharma paid $40 million upfront and pledged nearly $700 million in additional payments under this contract.\n\nIn October 2023, Sanofi inked a potential $1.5 billion partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals to develop TEV\u2019574, an investigational anti-TL1A agent being studied for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. A few months earlier, Sanofi teamed up with Recludix Pharma, putting more than $1.3 billion on the line to advance oral STAT6 inhibitors for immunology and inflammatory indications.\n\nClarification (March 20): This story has been updated from its original version to clarify that $1.9 billion is the total potential value of the deal and that DR-0201 is being studied in a Phase I trial for autoimmune disease.

DR-0201 has demonstrated a favourable preclinical safety profile in multiple non-human primate studies with no observed cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity.\n\nDR-0201 is currently being evaluated in a Phase I study in B-NHL patients and is ready to be safety tested in various autoimmune indications.\n\nAccording to Dren Bio, DR-201 is a bispecific antibody that induces potent depletion of pathogenic cells, protein aggregates, and other disease-causing agents by engaging a novel phagocytic receptor that is selectively expressed on myeloid cells. Bispecific antibodies generated from the platform are specifically engineered to enable controlled myeloid cell activation only in the presence of the target antigen, which may result in greater therapeutic indexes and offer superior safety profiles compared to other therapeutic modalities such as T-cell engagers and Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs).\n\nAfter the deal is complete, Dren Bio will continue to independently develop antibody therapeutics that target and eliminate harmful cells and disease-causing agents. According to GlobalData, DR-0201 is under development for the treatment of hematologic neoplasms, including relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), polymyositis, dermatomyositis, primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (pSS).\n\nHBM Healthcare Investments, which holds a stake of around 9% in Dren Bio, assessed that the transaction will increase the net asset value per HBM share CHF 8.70 (+3.6%) with a cash inflow of approximately US$50m for HBM Healthcare Investments from the upfront payment.",

            "content": "Bispecific antibodies first reached patients as cancer treatments, but a growing number of companies are working to expand these therapies to autoimmune diseases. Sanofi is adding a new contender, agreeing to pay $600 million for a bispecific drug with an approach that could be first in class.\n\nThe sum announced Thursday is an upfront payment for Dren Bio\u2019s drug candidate, DR-0201. The privately held biotech, which is based in Foster City, California, could receive up to $1.3 billion more if the drug achieves development and product launch milestones.\n\nBispecific antibodies work by simultaneously binding to two targets, one on an immune cell and the other on the target cell. These drugs were initially developed to treat blood cancers by depleting cancer-driving B cells. But B cells also drive certain autoimmune disorders, making these rogue immune cells attractive for bispecific drug R&D.\n\nOn B cells, DR-0201 targets a protein called CD20. The drug leads to depletion of these cells via phagocytosis, a process in which an immune cell engulfs a pathogen, eliminating it. DR-0201 prompts this action by activating a specific phagocytic receptor on myeloid cells, a type of immune cell. Dren Bio contends this approach may offer safety and dosing advantages. The phagocytic receptor is activated only in the presence of the targeted antigen, so DR-0201 may be able to offer a wider therapeutic index and a superior safety profile compared to other targeted antibody therapies, such as T cell engagers (TCEs) and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs).\n\nThe Dren Bio drug is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1 studies, one in healthy volunteers and the other in a range of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, dermatomyositis, and scleroderma. Dren Bio has not formally reported results from these studies, but Sanofi said recent data in the autoimmune disease study \u201csuggest that deep B-cell depletion might have the potential to reset the adaptive immune system, leading to sustained treatment-free remission in patients with refractory B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus, where significant unmet medical needs remain.\u201d\n\nIn a prepared statement, Houman Ashrafian, Sanofi\u2019s head of research and development, said DR-0201 has the potential to elevate the treatment effect for patients, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies. Safety could be another key advantage. Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a research note that clinicians have told the firm that safety is particularly critical for lupus patients. While B cells can be addressed by drugs that go after targets such as CD19 and BCMA, those therapies also affect plasma cells, which secrete antibodies important for immunity. Targeting CD20 spares plasma cells, so a CD20-targeting bispecific drug, such as DR-0201, should preserve a patient\u2019s immunity and lower the risk of developing infections.\n\nSanofi\u2019s DR-0201 acquisition is the latest in a line of deals for bispecific drugs for potential applications in autoimmune disease. Last summer, Merck agreed to pay $700 million up front for rights to a Curon Biopharmaceutical bispecific antibody with potential applications in oncology and immunology. Soon after, startup Candid Therapeutics launched with $370 million in financing and two in-licensed TCEs. Last October, GSK paid $300 million up front for rights to a TCE developed by Chimagen Biosciences. GSK was also involved in the formation of Ouro Medicines, a startup that launched in January with $120 million to reach the clinic with an in-licensed TCE.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nThe Sanofi pipeline currently lists one bispecific antibody, SAR446422. This drug, which is designed to target CD28 and the OX4O receptor, is in Phase 1 testing for potential applications in inflammation. Sanofi said it will finance the DR-0201 acquisition with its available cash. The deal, which is still subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.\n\nPhoto: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg, via Getty Images",

It\u2019s designed to engage specific immune cells that can prompt the body to deplete disease-causing B cells. It\u2019s shown promise in preclinical and Phase 1 studies, Sanofi said.\n\nAs part of the deal announced Thursday, Sanofi agreed to pay as much as $1.3 billion more to privately held Dren Bio if DR-0201 succeeds in reaching certain development and launch goals. The French drugmaker expects to take over the DR-0201 program in the second quarter.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe Dren Bio therapy is part of a growing trend of research into autoimmune disease medicines that can reset the immune system instead of suppressing it. The work is built on promising results in lupus patients first seen in Germany.\n\nFor years, scientists have been using cell therapy to fight cancer, but now they are studying its potential in battling a range of diseases caused when the body\u2019s immune system goes haywire. And companies like Dren Bio are testing new ways to engage cells, hoping to offer treatments that are less complicated and easier for patients to handle than the CAR-T therapy used in the German study.\n\nCompanies including Candid Therapeutics, Cullinan Therapeutics and Zenas Biopharma are trying approaches similar to Dren Bio\u2019s. And top industry players such as Merck & Co. and Sanofi are buying their way into early research with hefty upfront payments.\n\nStill, there have been setbacks for companies working on immune cell engagers. Earlier this year, IGM Biosciences halted development of an experimental therapy known as imvotamab because it failed to deplete B cell counts as much as hoped. The company also dropped a similar experimental treatment, IGM-2644, and laid off almost three-quarters of its staff.\n\nSanofi is looking to DR-0201 to bolster its growing immune drug business. The company has seen success with acquisitions and is raking in sales from the blockbuster medicine Dupixent.\n\nDren Bio, meanwhile, is continuing to advance its pipeline of treatments for both autoimmune diseases and cancer. It is working with Pfizer and Novartis on oncology programs.",

The French company will pay $600m upfront, with milestone payments of $1.3bn.\n\nAfter Dren-0201 gets under Sanofi\u2019s control, Dren Bio will continue to advance the rest of its pipeline independently. The deal is expected to close during Q2 2025.\n\nInvestor reaction to the deal was tepid, with shares in the Paris-listed Sanofi opening with a 0.3% deficit. Global stock markets are still recovering from the effects of US government tariffs, meaning current links between company activities and share prices are tenuous.\n\nSanofi will fund the transaction with cash resources \u2013 an indication the company is in a financially strong position considering it is also undertaking a $5.1bn share buyback initiative this year.\n\nSanofi has been spending big money recently to bolster its immunology presence. This includes a collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals, which included a $500m upfront payment in December 2023, for the co-development of chronic inflammatory disease treatment TEV-\u2018574. The company also agreed to a licensing deal worth up to $700m in June 2024 to use an immunology-centric small molecule drug discovery platform developed by Belharra Therapeutics.\n\nDren Bio\u2019s DR-0201 is a bispecific myeloid cell engager (MCE), which is being evaluated in a Phase I trial (NCT06392477) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug works by trafficking myeloid cells to induce deep B cell depletion. While DR-0201 clinical data has not been disclosed, Sanofi said it has \u201cshown deep and robust B cell depletion in non-clinical and clinical settings.\u201d\n\nDren Bio\u2019s lead candidate is DR-01, an antibody designed to deplete T cells, which are known to play a role in haematological and autoimmune diseases. The therapy, which is currently being investigated in leukaemia and cytotoxic lymphoma patients in a Phase II trial (NCT05475925), produced positive Phase I data.\n\nFor Sanofi, the acquisition of DR-0201 represents the continuation of a push into the immunology space. Historically known for its plethora of vaccines, the company has seen financial success from anti-inflammatory blockbuster Dupixent (dupilumab). The drug, which is co-marketed with Regeneron, generated sales of \u20ac3.5bn ($3.8bn) in 2025.\n\nCommenting on the Dren Bio deal, Sanofi\u2019s head of research and development, Houman Ashrafian, said: \u201cThis is yet another important step in Sanofi\u2019s ambition to bring breakthrough medicines to patients, and further strengthens our robust pipeline focused on the immune system. Through our own research and strategic licensing and acquisitions, we continue to advance our goal of becoming the leader in immunology.\u201d",

The consideration involves an upfront of $600 million and a milestone payment of $1.3 billion, to be paid using the company's cash resources.\n\nSanofi believes this deal could lead to the company becoming a leading immunology company.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nAfter the deal is complete, Dren Bio will continue working on its own to develop antibody therapeutics that target and eliminate harmful cells and disease-causing agents.\n\nThe clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company's DR-0201 has shown B-cell depletion in pre-clinical and early clinical studies. The MCE is a potential CD20-directed bispecific antibody that targets and engages specific tissue-resident and trafficking myeloid cells to induce deep B-cell depletion via targeted phagocytosis.\n\nWednesday, Sanofi's stock had closed at $58.60, 0.86% lesser on the Nasdaq. In the after-market hours, the stock traded 1.01 lesser before ending the trade at $58.01.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

            "content": "In the pursuit of producing roughly 4.3 billion units of medicines and vaccines per year, French pharma giant Sanofi invests roughly \u20ac1 billion annually to transform and modernize its Manufacturing & Supply (M&S) division.\n\nIn recent years, the investment has had a strong focus on digitization, Ramila Peiris, Sanofi\u2019s global head of Process Data, ML, and AI Platform, MSAT, told delegates at the BioProcess International West conference in San Diego, California on Wednesday.\n\nHe explained the firm\u2019s mission is to build a modern manufacturing network to reliably launch and supply affordable and sustainable products. \u201cSanofi has 12 big products launching in the next five years that demand us to use data from R&D to manufacturing in a more efficient way,\u201d he said.\n\nBy introducing and investing in digitization \u2013 including the use of automation, data analytics, real-time manufacturing, digital twins, and advanced control systems \u2013 Sanofi can achieve its mission \u201cto improve product quality, reduce costs, and ensure regulatory compliance through more precise and reliable operations.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Peiris highlighted numerous drivers for digitization including cost efficiency, enhanced flexibility, quality assurances, improved decision-making, and regulatory compliance.\n\nRelated:Repligen lays down $70m to buy analytics tech from 908 Devices\n\nSanofi\u2019s vision mirrors those of others in the industry, including a Digital Technology Roadmap from the BioPhorum Operations Group (BPOG) and a Deloitte survey looking at biopharma digital transformation, both published in 2022.\n\nHowever, there is a big difference between visualizing a strategy and implementing the mission, stressed Peiris. Thus, for Sanofi to translate this into its \u201cConnected Smart Factories\u201d vision, the firm must enable digitization through \u201cstrategic planning and investment in multiple areas.\u201d\n\nThis consists of five considerations including 1) Plant-floor data systems such as manufacturing execution systems (MES), laboratory information management systems (LIMS), and others; 2) Cloud data foundations, including data warehousing and data ingestion/integration; 3) Contextualized data 4) Process/product monitoring (statistical process control yield monitoring, and golden batch monitoring); and 5) Predictive and prescriptive analytics, incorporating machine learning and AI for process insights, predictive analytics, and agentic AI.\n\nBut it is the third consideration \u2013 contextualized data \u2013 that is critical to the whole process, according to Peiris. Contextualized data is synonymous with ready-to-use data. \u201cWhatever solutions you may have, without proper data, digitization innovations cannot be implemented in a sustainable way.\u201d As such, it is the foundation of any digitization roadmap. \u201cOnce the data is clean, aggregated, and organized, only then can we implement it into process/product monitoring and predictive models.\u201d\n\nRelated:Lilly goes hybrid to drive Kisunla productivity\n\nDigitizing a global network\n\nSanofi has a large global network. It operates seven specialty care manufacturing sites, 10 vaccine manufacturing sites, and 23 general medicines manufacturing sites.\n\nPeiris showed delegates that at Sanofi\u2019s next-generation \u201cModulus\u201d sites in Neuville, France and Singapore the firm has followed a five-step plan to build data systems around the contextualized data concept:\n\n1) Identify the need: Raw data originating from several source systems (eg SAP, MES, LIMS, paper logbooks, manual data) must be converted into meaningful actionable data.\n\n2) Enhance the source system contextualization: Foundational contextualization enables parameter mapping\n\n3) Build the ETL (extract, transform, and load ), and expose to end-users: A \u2018business specification\u2019 document that captures the parameter list, which is converted to an \"ETL specification\"\n\n4) Build visualization capabilities: Including timeseries and discrete trending, overlays and CMC or legacy baseline comparison needs\n\nRelated:Alois Jungbauer: A life in biotechnology\n\n5) Advanced analytics: The contextualized data acts as a foundational enabler and can be fed into other analytics tools. It allows process troubleshooting, statistical analysis, prescriptive analysis etc.",

The lenders are aiming to launch a general syndication as early as next week, said the people, who asked not be identified because the information is private.\n\nRepresentatives for CD&R and Citigroup declined to comment. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe sale will come at an interesting time in financial markets. US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars have triggered volatility and economic uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic. In recent days, companies in both Europe and the US have shelved plans to tap the riskiest corner of the loan market.\n\nPre-marketing processes allow underwriters to get an idea of what kind of appetite there is ahead of an official launch. The Sanofi deal was Europe\u2019s biggest buyout debt transaction last year and, despite the recent volatility, many investors are still eager to put money to work amid robust inflows into credit funds and a dearth of M&A activity.\n\nAgonizing Wait\n\nThe group of twenty-two lenders have faced an agonizing wait to sell on the debt. The banks extended an upfront commitment to CD&R last year so the firm could buy part of Sanofi\u2019s consumer arm, called Opella. But they had to keep the debt on their balance sheets until at least late March because of a rule on timely financials that prevents underwriters from approaching investors without recent-enough financials to show.\n\nThe debt package consists of euro- and dollar-denominated leveraged loans and high-yield bonds. Global co-ordinators on the financing include Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale SA, along with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.\n\nRepresentatives for Barclays, BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale declined to comment.\n\nBanks have signed funding commitments for a \u20ac5.45 billion term loan B split between euros and dollars, with target pricing of 350 basis points over Euribor for the euro component, and 325 basis points over SOFR for the US dollar tranche, Bloomberg previously reported.",

The data so far show Curevo\u2019s adjuvant technology has the attributes to succeed in this endeavor.\u201d\n\nAlso joining Curevo\u2019s Board of Directors will be Giovanni Mariggi, PhD, co-founder and Partner at Medicxi, an experienced infectious disease investor and board member. \u201cPatients, doctors, and payors are very clear a new shingles vaccine like amezosvatein would be welcome in the global marketplace. Amezosvatein\u2019s activity and improved tolerability profile could allow it to be a significant product in the shingles vaccines market. We are excited to support Curevo\u2019s plan with a streamlined path to approval,\u201d stated Dr. Mariggi.\n\nTal Zaks, MD/PhD, will be joining Curevo\u2019s Board of Directors on behalf of OrbiMed. Dr. Zaks is the former Chief Medical Officer of Moderna, where he led development of their mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. He previously held senior leadership positions in drug development at GSK and Sanofi. \u201cOrbiMed has a long history of investing in biotech companies like Curevo seeking to improve healthcare outcomes while creating long-term shareholder value,\u201d said Dr. Zaks. \u201cThe fact amezosvatein contains an optimized version of the TLR4 agonist with a known mechanism of action reduces biological risk while providing the competitive advantage of potentially improved tolerability, which should position it as the first choice for people who want to be protected from shingles.\u201d\n\nAbout amezosvatein\n\n\u2018Amezosvatein\u2019 is the assigned non-proprietary name for CRV-101, a non-mRNA adjuvanted subunit vaccine under investigation by Curevo. Like Shingrix, amezosvatein uses a subunit protein antigen called glycoprotein \u2018E\u2019 (gE). Targeting the gE antigen is proven to elicit a long-term, protective immune response to prevent shingles. Amezosvatein\u2019s adjuvant contains an optimized version of the TLR4 agonist proven by Shingrix to be biologically active in shingles vaccination. Amezosvatein was engineered to maintain exceptional efficacy and have a best-in-class tolerability profile. The SLA-SE adjuvant formulation was developed at Seattle-based Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI) and amezosvatein was licensed from the Mogam Institute for Biomedical Research, a research institute funded by South Korea\u2019s GC Biopharma.\n\nAbout Curevo\n\nCurevo is a privately held, clinical-stage biotechnology company based near Seattle dedicated to reducing the burden of infectious disease by developing vaccines with improved tolerability and accessibility. Curevo\u2019s lead product is amezosvatein, a non-mRNA adjuvanted sub-unit vaccine to prevent shingles, a serious medical condition involving a painful, blistering skin rash where 10-18% of people also develop serious, long-lasting nerve pain. The current $4+ billion shingles vaccine market is characterized by accessibility issues and vaccine hesitancy/dose avoidance related to vaccine tolerability.

            "content": "BRIDGEWATER, N.J. , March 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi announced today the immediate adoption of influenza strains selected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to advance the manufacturing and delivery of its vaccine portfolio for the 2025-26 flu season in the US. As the world leader in flu vaccines, Sanofi had already begun its annual production of vaccines to ensure that robust supply is ready for the coming season. Strains selected by the FDA match those already used in production by the company to help protect eligible patients against flu and its potentially severe complications.\n\nSanofi plans to begin shipping flu vaccines this summer so that health systems, hospitals, pharmacies, physician practices, nursing homes and other facilities can begin administering vaccines at the onset of the next flu season.\n\nThomas Grenier\n\nHead of Vaccines, North America\n\n\"The US is weathering one of its most severe flu seasons in decades, underscoring the need to protect people against seasonal influenza infection. As the world leader in flu vaccines, Sanofi works relentlessly to ensure we are prepared, which is why our manufacturing does not miss a beat as we provide eligible Americans with a portfolio of immunizations to help protect against flu infection and the potentially serious complications it can cause.\"\n\nIn addition to declining vaccination rates, the US is currently experiencing one of the worst flu seasons in decades and rates of flu-related hospitalizations are at a 15-year high. According to estimates by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 40 million illnesses, 520,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths from flu through the week ending March 1. Public health authorities nationwide recommend eligible people six months of age and older be vaccinated every year to help protect against flu and its complications. Sanofi offers a range of vaccine options supported by extensive data to help protect eligible patients from flu and its complications, providing protection beyond flu by meeting immunization needs across the lifespan, from children as young as six months of age through adults 65 years of age and older. The 2025-26 US influenza season portfolio will include FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine), FLUBLOK\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine) and FLUZONE\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine).\n\nIndication and Important Safety Information for FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine), FLUBLOK\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine) and FLUZONE\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine)\n\nWhat are FLUZONE\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine), FLUBLOK\u00ae (Influenza Vaccine), and FLUZONE\u00ae High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine)?\n\nFLUZONE, FLUBLOK, and FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE are vaccines indicated for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained (or in the case of FLUBLOK, represented by antigens contained in) the vaccine. FLUZONE is given to people 6 months of age and older. FLUBLOK is given to people 18 years of age and older. FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE is given to people 65 years of age and older.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR FLUZONE\u00ae (INFLUENZA VACCINE), FLUBLOK\u00ae (INFLUENZA VACCINE), AND FLUZONE\u00ae HIGH-DOSE (INFLUENZA VACCINE)\n\nFLUZONE, FLUBLOK, or FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including eggs or egg products for FLUZONE and FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE). In addition, FLUZONE and FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.\n\nTell your health care provider if you have ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination.\n\nIf FLUZONE, FLUBLOK, or FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE are given to people with a compromised immune system, including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system, the immune response may be lower than expected.\n\nVaccination with FLUZONE, FLUBLOK, or FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.\n\nFainting has occurred following vaccination with FLUZONE, FLUBLOK, and FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.\n\nFor FLUZONE, in children 6 months through 8 years of age, the most common side effects were pain or tenderness and redness where you got the shot, irritability, drowsiness (6 month through 35 months), and muscle pain (3 years through 8 years). In adults 18 years through 64 years of age, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, headache, and muscle pain. In adults over 65 years of age, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, headache, muscle pain, and general discomfort.\n\nFor FLUBLOK, in adults 18 through 64 years of age, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, headache, tiredness, and muscle pain. In adults 65 years of age and older, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE, in adults 65 years of age and older, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, muscle pain, tiredness, and headache.\n\nFor FLUZONE, FLUBLOK, and FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE, other side effects may occur.\n\nFor more information, talk to your healthcare professional and refer to the full Prescribing and Patient information for FLUBLOK, FLUZONE or FLUZONE HIGH-DOSE.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

Jim Shannon MP contributed to this article and retained full editorial control.\n\nUrgent action is needed to address the significant impact of COPD on patients and the NHS\n\nRippon Ubhi, General Manager, Sanofi UK and Ireland\n\nRippon Ubhi, General Manager,\n\nSanofi UK and Ireland\n\nCOPD is a progressive lung disease affecting around 1.4 million people in the UK \u2013 with a disproportionate impact on people from deprived communities, causing respiratory health inequalities.1,2 Despite its prevalence and being the fifth leading cause of death, it is overlooked by policymakers and stigmatised in society.3\n\nCOPD is caused by airflow obstruction, which leads to debilitating symptoms such as breathlessness, frequent lung infections and reduced energy.4 These symptoms impose a substantial burden on patients and make everyday tasks like getting dressed, climbing stairs, or even just breathing feel like significant challenges.\n\nAs well as potentially experiencing daily symptoms, people with COPD are at risk of \u201cexacerbations\u201d or \u201cflare-ups\u201d. These vary in severity but are a worsening of the usual symptoms patients face. They can be short or last for weeks. Not only are they distressing or life-threatening in the moment, but in the longer term they can lead to a further decline in lung function in already-ill patients.5\n\nCOPD exacerbations are also the second most common cause of emergency hospital admissions, accounting for one in eight.6 As a potentially life-threatening episode which could in some cases be prevented through better management of a patient, there is a lot to be gained from policy and clinical measures to improve patient management.\n\nDelving into these opportunities to improve outcomes for COPD patients is a report Sanofi launched in November 2024: Breathe Equal: Policy recommendations to reduce the burden of COPD. To build on this, we recently convened expert clinical, patient group and policy stakeholders in Parliament to discuss these opportunities further, with a particular focus on actions which could address the health inequalities linked to the disease.\n\nWhat became clear at our roundtable is that COPD could be the perfect test case for the government\u2019s key healthcare ambition to bring healthcare from hospitals to the community. Community settings have a vital role to play in diagnosing and managing COPD, especially by identifying cases in marginalised groups who may be less engaged in their healthcare. In addition, services that are closer to home should be empowered to manage patients, with support from specialist centres that may be further away.\n\nIncreased focus on addressing COPD\u2019s profound burden through policy and clinical practice reform could support the NHS and government to make significant strides in improving population health and alleviating NHS services.\n\nImproving the management of COPD patients\n\nJim Shannon MP, Chair of the Respiratory Health All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG)\n\nJim Shannon MP, Chair of the Respiratory Health APPG\n\nUnfortunately, COPD is another addition to the long list of conditions which disproportionately affect deprived communities: the most socially deprived 20 per cent of the population are 2.5 times more likely to have COPD than the least deprived groups.2 When we consider that the key diagnostic tool for COPD, spirometry, is less likely to be available in GP surgeries in more deprived areas, this reality becomes more concerning.7\n\nI was therefore delighted to host a roundtable in February with healthcare experts and patient representatives to understand what priority actions could be taken by the government, national NHS leadership and local healthcare systems to address the disproportionate impact of this highly burdensome disease.\n\nWithin the three key stages of the patient journey \u2013 diagnosis, management and access to specialist care \u2013 the group we brought together identified priority actions. For example, the group agreed that geographically consistent funding and quality of key interventions like exercise and smoking cessation were key to ensuring high-quality care, no matter where a patient lives. The role of community healthcare settings in delivering this was heard loud and clear \u2013 with experts calling for the government to ensure sufficient resourcing as part of its push to deliver more care in the community.\n\nThe group also discussed the preference of COPD patients to be managed closer to home, such as by local hospitals or primary care, rather than a specialist team which could be hundreds of miles away for some patients. While specialist care teams remain critical to overseeing management, delegated responsibilities could reduce the burden of travel on ill patients and support better outcomes.\n\nMany more tangible and pragmatic recommendations were put forward by the group, building on the Breathe Equal report. In my role as Chair of the APPG on Respiratory Health, I look forward to continuing to advocate for improved management of COPD patients. The policy recommendations identified by those managing patients daily, and the advocates representing their best interests, should be recognised and implemented as a priority.\n\nTo learn more about COPD, please visit: https://rb.gy/j4b795\n\nThis article was fully funded, initiated and written by Sanofi and Regeneron.\n\nMAT-XU-2500814 (v1.0) March 2025\n\nReferences\n\nAsthma and Lung UK (2022).

According to Yen, the findings from the second part of the trial, presented at AAD 2024, are particularly exciting.\n\nIn the trial, a significant proportion of patients maintained their response for 28 weeks. Specifically, 74% of those who continued on amlitelimab retained a Patient-Reported Itch Numerical Rating Scale (PPRNRS) score of \u22654, indicating a meaningful reduction in itch. In total, 63% of patients who were withdrawn from treatment also maintained this score.\n\n\"In those patients continuing on amlitelimab, 74% maintain this PPNRS greater than or equal to 4 score,\" Yen said. \"In the withdrawal arm, even more impressively, 63% of those patients still maintain their PPNRS greater than 4 score, demonstrating that amlitelimbab has the potential to provide durable, sustained efficacy, not just in patients on drug, but potentially off drug, as well.\"\n\nRIVER-AD Study: Promising Results for Patients Who Initially Did Not Respond\n\nThe RIVER-AD study served as an extension to the STREAM-AD trial and included patients who did not meet response criteria in part 1. These patients were given the opportunity to continue treatment in part 2 or, for those who had been on placebo, receive active treatment in the RIVER-AD extension study.\n\n\"What we showed is that with continued treatment, the majority of these patients actually did achieve a clinical response,\" Yen said.\n\nYen also pointed out that these results highlight amlitelimab's ability to provide clinical responses even in patients who had previously not responded to treatment.\n\nAmlitelimab\u2019s Mechanism of Action: Targeting OX40 Ligand\n\nOne of the key factors that sets amlitelimab apart from other treatments for AD is its novel mechanism of action, Yen said. Unlike many current therapies that target cytokines involved in inflammation, amlitelimab targets the OX40 ligand (OX40L), a critical mediator in immune cell signaling.\n\nThis upstream mechanism offers several advantages, including a reduced risk of off-target effects like immunosuppression, a common concern with some biologics. Additionally, targeting OX40L, rather than the OX40 receptor itself, spares regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in immune regulation and long-term disease modification.\n\nAmlitelimab and the Future of AD Treatment\n\n\"Amlitelimab has the opportunity to target a broader population than some of the existing therapies,\" Yen said. \"It also has this unprecedented opportunity to potentially have off-treatment, it can maintain off-treatment response, which is really very, very exciting for patients.\"\n\nSanofi is also exploring amlitelimab in other dermatologic conditions, including alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and systemic sclerosis.\n\nLooking ahead, Sanofi\u2019s ongoing phase 3 clinical program, OCEANA, aims to further investigate the safety and efficacy of amlitelimab in AD, including its long-term benefits and potential for off-drug remission.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "\n\nThis article was funded and reviewed by Sanofi for compliance with the ABPI Code of Practice\n\nAs the UK endures another harsh winter, the combination of plummeting temperatures and a surge in respiratory infections \u2013 including flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus \u2013 is placing unprecedented strain on our healthcare system (Campbell, 2024).\n\nIndividuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are particularly vulnerable, as cold weather exacerbates their symptoms and increases susceptibility to infections (Lima, 2023).\n\nAlarmingly, respiratory diseases now account for more emergency NHS admissions than any other condition (Asthma + Lung UK, 2024), underscoring the critical need for proactive primary and community care interventions to mitigate this seasonal burden.\n\nCOPD, a progressive lung disease, affects approximately 2.2% of the UK adult population, equating to over 1.2 million individuals (Mosgrove and Lonergan, 2022). The disease accounts for the second highest number of emergency hospital admissions (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2025), particularly during winter months, exacerbating pressures on the NHS (NHS England, no date).\n\nLate diagnosis and the stark differences between the rich and the poor\n\nLate diagnosis and frequent exacerbations lead to increased healthcare utilisation, including hospital admissions and workforce strain. A recent study demonstrated that late diagnosis, a significant issue in COPD, incurred a 15.7% increase in direct costs per patient during the two years following diagnosis, emphasising the economic impact of delayed detection (NHS England, 2022).\n\nThe disparities in COPD prevalence and outcomes are stark between so-called poorer and richer groups of people (Williams et al, 2022).\n\nIndividuals residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas face higher risks of developing COPD and experiencing severe exacerbations. Factors, such as limited access to healthcare resources, exposure to environmental pollutants and higher smoking rates, contribute to these disparities. Research indicates that neighbourhood disadvantage may reflect the prevalence of stressors that negatively impact COPD health, underscoring the need for targeted interventions in these communities (Williams et al, 2022).\n\nThe role of primary and community care, and patient education, in improving outcomes\n\nPrimary and community care providers are pivotal in mitigating the impact of COPD.\n\nEarly and accurate diagnosis is crucial; for example, utilising spirometry to aid identification of COPD in its initial stages, allowing for timely intervention (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, 2024). Regular patient reviews should be conducted to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment plans accordingly.\n\nEducating patients on self-management strategies, such as recognising early signs of exacerbations and adhering to medication regimens, empowers them to take control of their condition.\n\nEncouraging smoking cessation through support programmes and considering referrals to pulmonary rehabilitation can significantly improve patient outcomes (Man et al, 2023). Additionally, addressing socioeconomic factors by connecting patients with community resources where they may be more comfortable can help alleviate some of the external pressures that exacerbate health disparities (Williams et al, 2022).\n\nPrimary and community care providers are incredibly valuable in chronic conditions such as COPD, and effective support can significantly reduce the winter burden of COPD, improving patient outcomes and alleviating pressures on the NHS. Proactive, patient-centred care is essential to navigate the challenges of the winter season.\n\nCollaboration at the heart of improving COPD care\n\nAt Sanofi, we are committed to standing with the respiratory health community to address the challenges posed by COPD and ensure equitable respiratory care for all. We aim to highlight and tackle the disparities in respiratory health, advocating for improvements in recognition, diagnosis and quality of care across the UK, so that everyone can breathe equal. We believe that only through true collaboration between patients, health professionals, policymakers and industry, can we create a future where everyone has the opportunity to breathe equal.\n\nReferences\n\nAsthma + Lung UK (2024) Breathing issues are leading cause of all emergency admissions. asthmaandlung.org.uk, 11 November (accessed 7 March 2025).\n\nCampbell D (2024) Breathing issues cause more emergency NHS admissions than any other condition. guardian.co.uk, 11 November (accessed 7 March 2025).\n\nGlobal Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (2024) GOLD Spirometry Guide.

            "content": "Sanofi Korea said on Friday that its atopic dermatitis drug Dupixent (dupilumab) has expanded its indication to include add-on maintenance therapy for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have an elevated blood eosinophil count and are not adequately controlled by standard inhaled therapy.\n\n(Credit: Sanofi Korea)\n\nCOPD is characterized by shortness of breath, fatigue, and acute exacerbations, which can significantly reduce patients' quality of life and even lead to death.\n\nDespite the availability of inhaler-based three-drug combo therapies, about 50 percent of patients still experience severe exacerbations, highlighting an unmet need.\n\nAs \u201cthe first and only approved targeted biologic for COPD,\u201d Dupixent is expected to offer new clinical benefits for patients whose condition remains uncontrolled by existing therapies, Sanofi Korea said.\n\nIn two phase 3 studies, Dupixent reduced the annualized exacerbation rate of COPD and significantly improved lung function and patient quality of life. In the BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies, which formed the basis for the indication expansion, moderate-to-severe annualized exacerbation rates of 0.78 and 0.86 for Dupixent at week 52 were 30 percent and 34 percent lower, respectively, than placebo rates of 1.1 and 1.3, meeting the primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nImprovements in lung function occurred rapidly from week 2 of treatment with Dupixent and were maintained through week 52. In the BOREAS and NOTUS studies, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before bronchodilator use was 160 and 139 mL, respectively, compared to 77 and 57 mL, respectively, in the placebo group at week 12, and 153 and 115 mL, respectively, compared to 70 and 54 mL, respectively, at week 52.\n\nThe proportion of patients with at least a 4-point improvement in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was 51.5 percent and 51.4 percent in the Dupixent arm, compared to 43 percent and 47 percent in the placebo arm.\n\n\u201cCOPD is a disease with a high burden due to acute exacerbations and declining lung function that remains uncontrolled by existing therapies, resulting in a significant unmet need for treatment,\u201d said Bae Kyung-eun, General Manager Pharma Multi-Country Office South Korea and Austrailia/New Zealand & MCO Lead. \u201cAdditionally, under-diagnosis prevents patients who need treatment from receiving appropriate care. As the first and only approved targeted biologic for COPD, Dupixent represents a new paradigm in COPD treatment. We hope this approval will enable more people with COPD to receive appropriate treatment and improve their symptoms and quality of life.\u201d\n\nDupixent is an immunomodulator that selectively blocks type 2 inflammation, unlike broad-spectrum immunosuppressants. It targets the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) cytokines, which are key drivers of type 2 inflammation. IL-4 and IL-13 are known to be critical factors in type 2 inflammation, a major cause of conditions such as COPD, atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and nodular pruritic rash.",

            "content": "Diamyd Medical AB\n\nDiamyd Medical, in collaboration with Mainly AI and ASSET partners, highlights meaningful progress in AI-driven screening and risk prediction for Type 1 Diabetes at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) conference in Amsterdam (March 19-22, 2025). Dr. Gun Forsander (Institute for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy) will present the findings at an invited presentation at the industry symposium sponsored by Sanofi: BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE, Exploring How Innovation Can Evolve the Early Detection and Management of T1D.\n\n\"Screening of Type 1 Diabetes has become a hot topic and is discussed at every international diabetes meeting since a couple of years back\", says Gun Forsander. \"The vision is to diagnose persons already at an early stage and be able to offer a personalized follow-ups and treatment to prevent or at least delay the clinical onset. Research has proved that Type 1 Diabetes is not one single disease but rather a composite of subgroups that will respond differently to offered interventions. Precision medicine is therefore of utmost importance to achieve best possible impact of interventions and care for people at risk for Type 1 Diabetes\".\n\nA key highlight of the development work is the use of individual survival prediction (ISP) models, which move beyond traditional statistical strategies for risk determination by offering personalized insights into when a subject is likely to develop Type 1 Diabetes. The models have been trained and validated using data from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY; https://teddy.epi.usf.edu/index.html) study and demonstrated the potential to optimize screening frequency and improve follow-up strategies. The predictor models have been developed for possible implementation on the MainlyAI platform, a one-stop-shop for secure and collaborative work with AI/ML (https://www.mainly.ai/).\n\nAI-based models leverage individual data, including genetics (such as HLA typing), autoantibody profiles and patient history to predict risk.\n\nUnlike traditional statistical approaches, which assess risk at the population level over standardized intervals, the novel ISP enhances predictive accuracy by estimating the likelihood of disease onset at an individual level.\n\nThe models offer significant potential in clinical decision-making, allowing healthcare providers to customize screening schedules and follow-up frequency on an individual level. High-risk individuals may benefit from closer, more frequent monitoring, optimizing early detection and intervention strategies.\n\n\"The notion of a precision medicine ecosystem, where AI-powered screening and risk prediction seamlessly integrate with targeted interventions, is a game changer, says Ulf Hannelius, CEO of Diamyd Medical. \"It has the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes and reshape pharma and biotech, leading to better treatments and more sustainable healthcare. By using AI for earlier diagnosis, personalized risk assessment, and tailored treatments, we are paving the way for meaningful improvements throughout the patient journey.\"\n\nUsing AI for early disease detection\n\nThe ASSET project, funded by the Swedish Innovation Agency (Vinnova) since 2021 and coordinated by Diamyd Medical, is focused on evaluating how AI can enhance Type 1 Diabetes screening strategies by integrating genetic data, clinical and digital biomarkers to predict disease onset with greater precision.\n\nAs AI-driven approaches continue to evolve, the ASSET consortium envisions a future where such strategies can also support the implementation of a precision medicine approach to Type 1 Diabetes, through personalized interventions and improved disease management. Further research will focus on refining predictive models and showcasing how AI could be used in facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment selection within Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nASSET is a collaboration between Diamyd Medical, Mainly AI, Lund University, Sahlgrenska and \u00d6rebro University hospitals, the National Diabetes Registry and Leading Healthcare foundation.\n\nAbout Diamyd Medical\n\nDiamyd Medical develops precision medicine therapies to prevent and treat Type 1 Diabetes and LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults).

            "content": "Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi is once again in the eye of the storm. This time, it's its Mourenx plant in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques region that's being singled out for uncontrolled toxic emissions. Although it was indicted in late 2024 for several environmental offenses, the company has, for now, escaped charges of endangering the lives of others.\n\nThe case dates back to 2018, when the France Nature Environnement (FNE) association revealed alarming levels of bromopropane and sodium valproate emissions, the active ingredient in Depakine, an anti-epileptic drug infamous for its devastating effects on children exposed in utero. According to FNE, these pollutants were emitted in astronomical quantities because Sanofi only controlled one of the three emission columns present in the factory.\n\nThe company defends itself, claiming that no regulatory threshold was exceeded and that it fully cooperated with the authorities. But the facts are there: in 2018, the plant was shut down before restarting under increased surveillance.\n\nToday, the courts are investigating the potential health consequences for local residents. About fifteen of them are filing civil suits, some of whom claim to have been contaminated by Depakine. A mother of two children with neurobehavioral disorders, who worked near the site during her pregnancies, filed a complaint in 2023.\n\nThe case comes on top of another major legal case, opened in 2016, in which Sanofi is being charged with aggravated deception and unintentional injury related to the harmful effects of Depakine on thousands of children. To date, the French National Office for Compensation for Medical Accidents (ONIAM) has already paid \u20ac120 million to victims\u2014a public bill that should, however, fall to the pharmaceutical group.\n\nSanofi, for its part, is trying to keep the files separate, claiming there is no link between Mourenx's toxic emissions and the other scandals surrounding Depakine. However, health authorities estimate that this molecule is responsible for malformations in 2 to 150 children and neurodevelopmental disorders in another 4 to 100.\n\nA damning assessment that could well weigh heavily in the judicial balance, while pressure from victims' associations continues unabated.",

            "content": "When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Sanofi ( ) share price is up 43% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Some buyers are laughing, though, with an increase of 24% in the last year.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Sanofi managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Sanofi the TSR over the last 5 years was 73%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Sanofi shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before forming an opinion on Sanofi you might want to consider the cold hard cash it pays as a dividend.

The campaign was officially launched by the French Ambassador to Thailand, underscoring the international commitment to combating Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSV infection underlies a significant burden of disease especially in infants. As a common viral respiratory infection, it can be easily mistaken for the common cold, with the appearance of symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat appearing within 4-6 days after exposure. However, unlike a cold, it can progress rapidly to become a serious lung infection and cause severe complications like bronchiolitis or pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 90% of infants and young children will contract RSV within their first two years of life. Although RSV can infect anyone in the general population, all infants under one year old, regardless of being born pre-term or healthy and full-term, are at highest risk of severe RSV infection requiring hospitalization. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally, 33.8 million children under the age of 5 are infected with RSV annually, resulting in 160,000 deaths. Additionally, two-thirds of infants and young children worldwide experience acute respiratory inflammation due to RSV infection.\n\n\n\nDr. Surangkana Techapaitoon, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Samitivej and BNH Hospital Group and Director of Samitivej International Children\u2019s Hospital, under Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (BDMS), stated that Samitivej International Children\u2019s Hospital is leading international center for advanced pediatric care, committed to ensuring that every child grows up strong and healthy from birth. Samitivej integrates cutting-edge Smart Hospital technology with the expertise of a multidisciplinary medical team to deliver comprehensive, age-appropriate care.\n\nIn celebration of the inauguration of Samitivej International Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s new facility, the hospital is honored to collaborate with Sanofi in launching the \u201cTogether Against RSV\u201d campaign and establishing the \u201cCenter for Comprehensive RSV Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment\u201d. As the first healthcare institution in Southeast Asia to introduce and provide the Monoclonal Antibody against RSV, Nirsevimab, for all infants, this initiative marks a significant advancement in pediatric healthcare. Nirsevimab is expected to reduce RSV infections, and prevent severe complications such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Our goal is to ensure that Thai children develop strong immunity because we want to see them grow up healthy and disease-free. #SavingYoungLives\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs. Zainab Sadat, General Manager \u2013 Vaccines, Sanofi South-East Asia & India said, \u201cSanofi is proud to initiate the \u201cTogether against RSV\u201d awareness campaign here in Thailand, marking a significant milestone for Southeast Asia. We are thrilled to see the collaborative effort of medical experts, policy makers, and hospital partners joining hands to kick-start this crucial project. This campaign represents our commitment to addressing the significant health challenge posed by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), particularly its impact on infants. Through this united effort, we aspire to see a tangible impact on protecting Thai infants from RSV, embodying our mission of improving lives through the power of science and collaboration.\u201d\n\nProf. Kulkanya Chokephaibulkit, President of PIDST, highlighted the critical role of early intervention and education in preventing RSV-related hospitalizations. \u201cRSV infection is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in Thailand among children under one year old. The disease burden is substantial. By increasing awareness and promoting preventive strategies, we can significantly reduce the impact of RSV on infants and their families.\n\n\n\nRecent advancements in RSV prevention have introduced two options: vaccination of expectant mothers to transfer immunity to babies after birth, and administration of RSV Monoclonal Antibody directly to infants. It is recommended that all infants receive this RSV protection, as severe illness can occur to any child regardless born healthy, at term or pre-term. In fact, data indicates that the majority of children hospitalized with severe RSV were previously in good health.\u201d\n\nThe campaign \u201cTogether Against RSV\u201d aims at raising RSV awareness and educating lay public about RSV severity, especially in infants, recognized as high-risk groups. It also calls for preventive measures, including immunizations, by referring to the Clinical Practice Guideline against RSV issued by the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand (RCPedT). Prof. Somsak Lolekha, President of RCPedT, emphasized the importance of timely prevention. \u201cThe RSV outbreak typically occurs from June to October, so prevention should be initiated before the RSV season begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the RCPedT, along with their medical allies, has issued the Clinical Practice Guideline Nirsevimab to reduce severity from RSV infection as follows: administer Nirsevimab to all healthy infants under 8 months of age, and it may be considered for healthy infants aged 8-12 months, as a single dose before the outbreak season. It can provide protection for up to 5 months, covering the entire RSV season (June-October). Infants born during the outbreak season can receive the injection immediately, together with other pediatric vaccines.\u201d (NNT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She is a pediatric endocrinologist. Today\u2019s KevinMD article is \u201dImproving type 1 diabetes screening awareness among women is critical: here\u2019s why.\u201d Shara, welcome to the show.\n\nShara Bialo: Thank you. It\u2019s so lovely to be here.\n\nKevin Pho: All right. So let\u2019s start by briefly sharing your story and journey.\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, so I\u2019m Shara. When I was nine, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. My story, I don\u2019t think, was altogether unique. I presented with the typical symptoms: the drinking, the peeing, the weight loss. We didn\u2019t have type 1 in the family.\n\nMy parents weren\u2019t sure what was going on and dutifully took me to my pediatrician. Outpatient labs were ordered. I went home to take a nap and did not wake up from that nap. I had fallen into diabetic ketoacidosis. My father had to carry me into the emergency room, where luckily pediatric endocrinology was able to meet us because of the prior questioning and seeking of medical care.\n\nIt was a pretty traumatic entrance to a chronic disease for my family and for my nine-year-old self at the time. From there, I embarked on life with this sort of unrelenting chronic illness, which has changed drastically over the 30 years that I\u2019ve had it, mostly for the better.\n\nUndoubtedly, it inspired me to pursue a career in pediatric endocrinology. I think I tried to stay away from it actually for a while\u2014pursued other areas, even hem/onc and nephrology\u2014but ultimately ended back in peds endo. I thought that if there was a silver lining to this, my own experience might be able to help pediatric patients.\n\nI personally struggled a lot with the disease in my teenage years and early twenties, with denial and not really wanting to take care of myself in the way that was required. So I pull from those experiences in clinic with my patients. A couple of years back, I had the opportunity to expand my reach by joining Sanofi as a T1D immunology field medical director, where I oversaw and worked with a team of people who help educate other clinicians about early type 1 diabetes detection and intervention.\n\nKevin Pho: All right. So before we talk about the article, what are some of the most common misperceptions\u2014or misconceptions\u2014that you hear about type 1 diabetes?\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, there are many. Type 1 impacts almost two million Americans, but so many more are impacted by type 2 diabetes. So oftentimes there\u2019s this misunderstanding that type 1 is similar to type 2. It is autoimmune in nature, right? Of course, it\u2019s impacted by diet and exercise, but the genetics of type 1 are different, given that it\u2019s an autoimmune disease.\n\nBecause of that, and because of this additional misconception that it only impacts children, it actually can be diagnosed at any age\u2014and over half of new cases are diagnosed over age 20. Because of those two points, it\u2019s often misdiagnosed in adults. About 40 percent of adults with type 1 are told initially that they have type 2 diabetes, and then their whole introduction to their care is altered and not optimized for type 1 diabetes.\n\nWe\u2019re just doing a lot of work to try to spin the story in the right direction. Another misconception about type 1, or maybe just a misunderstanding or a gap in knowledge, is that it feels like it comes out of the blue. People start having symptoms, and very quickly, they may devolve into diabetic ketoacidosis. If they\u2019re caught early enough, we can avoid that, but they definitely need insulin, and they\u2019re usually pretty sick when they\u2019re identified.\n\nWhat a lot of people don\u2019t realize\u2014both laypeople and those in the medical profession\u2014is that there are three stages of type 1 diabetes that actually roll out silently under the surface. This was first defined in 2015 in a big publication by the American Diabetes Association, detailing stages 1, 2, and 3. But it\u2019s just not widely known or accepted yet that we have the opportunity to catch the signal of that autoimmune destruction of the beta cells before blood sugars become abnormal and before people experience symptoms or the ill effects of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\nKevin Pho: So, just to follow up on that, as listeners know, I\u2019m an internal medicine physician, so I see patients in the adult stage. If I have a patient in front of me who is newly diagnosed with diabetes, are there any questions I can ask in the history that may make me suspect this was previously undiagnosed type 1?\n\nShara Bialo: Great question. This is also an area that the American Diabetes Association is putting a lot of effort into educating on and even created a sort of mnemonic for it. One consideration is age\u2014if they\u2019re on the younger side, you always want to consider type 1 diabetes, even though it can be diagnosed at any age.\n\nBody habitus is another historical consideration, although with the obesity epidemic, that\u2019s becoming less useful. Other comorbidities, like a history of autoimmune disease\u2014most pointedly autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto\u2019s or Graves)\u2014or something like celiac disease, which tends to cluster in the same family as type 1 diabetes, would also raise suspicion. Either personal or family history of these conditions could be relevant.\n\nThose are all considerations for obtaining diabetes autoantibodies, which are blood tests that can be ordered through commercial labs or through various research studies. There are five total autoantibodies that can be ordered, and if two or more are positive, that means you have a diagnosis of autoimmune type 1.\n\nKevin Pho: All right, your KevinMD article is titled \u201dImproving type 1 diabetes screening awareness among women is critical: here\u2019s why.\u201d Tell us more about this article for those who didn\u2019t get a chance to read it.\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, so it\u2019s a little bit personal. I\u2019m clearly steeped in type 1; I live with it, I\u2019m a pediatric endocrinologist, and my other gig is making sure other clinicians understand type 1. Despite all of that intimate awareness, when it came to screening my own children\u2014because I have type 1, my children have up to a 15-times increased risk of developing it\u2014I hesitated. They\u2019re five and seven years old; it\u2019s just a matter of taking them for a blood test. But I hesitated, and it took some soul-searching to figure out why.\n\nI think type 1 diabetes\u2014more so than a lot of chronic illnesses\u2014brings with it some heaviness, guilt, and shame, even though it\u2019s nonsensical. Especially as clinicians and scientists, we know we don\u2019t have any control over passing faulty genes on. But there\u2019s still this feeling of guilt, at least for me, that came with screening my kids and potentially uncovering their risk. It didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t always worried about it; it was just like opening Schrodinger\u2019s box and confirming it.\n\nI should be ashamed to say it took years for me to be OK with screening my kids. My husband finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s our job as parents to give our kids every possible advantage in life, and screening for type 1 diabetes is one of those advantages. Knowing earlier empowers us to make moves and prepare them to have the best possible outcome.\u201d I already knew this intellectually, but it took that conversation for me to realize I needed to get over my own emotional hump.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one. I talk to parents in clinic all day long about screening their family members. Some are very gung ho\u2014information is power\u2014and they want to do it. Others, like me, shy away because they\u2019re scared. It\u2019s an interesting topic for me, especially layered on what the field of endocrinology is trying to do right now: raise awareness about these earlier stages. It\u2019s a hot topic for research and for developing ways to target the autoimmune nature of the disease rather than simply putting an insulin bandage on the unavoidable.\n\nIn this vein, there was a survey conducted by Beyond Type 1, a patient advocacy group with a large focus on type 1 diabetes, and it was commissioned by Sanofi. It polled 1,000 adults living with type 1 and 1,000 caregivers of those under 18 with type 1 about their awareness and feelings regarding screening. I was very interested in this because it\u2019s close to home. It showed that women in particular lag behind men in their awareness that autoantibody screening for type 1 is even available. They were less likely to get screened themselves, more likely to learn of their own diagnoses only after symptoms had started\u2014which means losing a lot of time to prepare\u2014and then they were also more likely to have regrets once they did learn of this option.\n\nA lot of people end up changing big aspects of their life around a new diagnosis\u2014work plans, vacation plans, hobbies, relationships\u2014because it turns everything upside down. The survey was pretty telling, and I\u2019m on a mission to get the word out and make as many people as possible aware of this, because a lot of it starts with us as clinicians. We have these trusting relationships with our patients and can really be a positive influence.\n\nKevin Pho: Give us a sense of the gender disparity you mentioned. You said that women with type 1 diabetes are screened less often\u2014by about how much compared to men?\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, so about half of women consider themselves very proactive, but about 80 percent of women did not screen versus close to 70 percent of men. They were also less likely to be aware\u2014only around 22 percent of women were aware of testing compared to about 40 percent of men.\n\nMore of these women regretted not having it done, though not by huge margins: about 71 percent of women versus 65 percent of men. Nearly all of the women said their health would have improved if they\u2019d known earlier, and about 60 percent said they\u2019d recommend the test to understand risk, compared to about 45 percent of men.\n\nSo it seems avoidable. At the end of the day, people will make the decisions that suit them best, but they should at least be offered and made aware of the option to detect the disease. Another misconception is what screening even entails. A lot of doctors assume they already screen because they order an annual A1C or a fasting glucose along with a lipid panel. That\u2019s great, but it will only catch someone in the later stages of disease\u2014best case, stage 2 with classic dysglycemia; worst case, stage 3 where you already require insulin. Stage 1 is silent in every sense\u2014no blood sugar changes, no symptoms, just positive autoantibodies.\n\nLayering on autoantibody testing for those with a family history or personal history of autoimmune disease can catch many more people earlier and give them more options for how they want to roll out their life with type 1.\n\nKevin Pho: And in general, if one were to screen with an autoantibody test, at what age would they start?\n\nShara Bialo: That\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s still an active area of research. A lot of the large-scale studies, both in the U.S. and internationally, have been done in younger populations, so we have more data around children. The idea is that screening at ages 2, 6, and close to 10\u2014if you do all three\u2014catches about 80 percent of cases of type 1. If you only screen at age 10, or only one or two of those ages, the percent goes down a bit.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that adults who develop type 1 will have already had seroconversion (the appearance of autoantibodies in their blood) as children, but we just don\u2019t know for sure. If there\u2019s an adult with a significant family history of type 1\u2014either a first- or second-degree relative\u2014or a personal or family history of autoimmune disease, it\u2019s worth screening at least once. We\u2019ll learn a lot more as research progresses, like when it\u2019s safe to stop screening. Those are big question marks we still need to explore.\n\nKevin Pho: And in terms of the autoantibody test, what exactly should we order?\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, great question. There are five autoantibodies available, though four of them are recommended by the American Diabetes Association. The fifth is less reliable. The four are:\n\nInsulin autoantibody (IAA)\n\nGlutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibody\n\nIslet antigen 2 (IA2)\n\nZinc transporter 8 autoantibody\n\nThe fifth, ICA, was one of the first autoantibodies ever discovered, but the assay is not as easily reproducible. Commercial labs like LabCorp and Quest do offer panels that bundle these under different names, like \u201cdiabetes autoimmune panel\u201d or \u201cislet autoantibody screening.\u201d Usually searching for \u201ctype 1 diabetes\u201d or \u201cautoantibody\u201d can pull up the options.\n\nKevin Pho: So, tell us some paths forward that you\u2019re seeing or that you\u2019re working on, in terms of that type of messaging\u2014not only screening for autoantibodies but perhaps specifically targeting women, since they\u2019re screened less often.\n\nShara Bialo: Yeah, exactly. It\u2019s a lot of clinician outreach because I think overall awareness is important, but for women in particular there are certain conferences, forums, and podcasts like this, plus social media and infographics. It\u2019s such a fast-paced world that we need to get information out in a variety of formats to different audiences.\n\nOnce patients themselves have an experience or realize this is a possibility, they can become mini-advocates and talk to their relatives, especially female relatives. I think it\u2019s hard for women because of the mental load that often accompanies traditional roles\u2014being a mother, spouse, or caretaker of aging parents. That\u2019s not to minimize the role of men, but historically the mental load can fall more on women. When it comes to screening, getting family members screened, making appointments, and following through, it often lands on the matriarch. Validating that and providing information in a way that\u2019s easy to digest and act on is key.\n\nThere are also testing options through large research studies like TrialNet or ASK (out of the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado). If you have a family history of type 1\u2014and some of these studies don\u2019t even require that\u2014you can have a test mailed to you for free, so you don\u2019t have to go to a commercial lab. Socializing all these different ways to get testing done is important. Of course, it can also be done at annual physicals or children\u2019s checkups. Making it as accessible as possible is going to be the key.\n\nKevin Pho: We\u2019re talking to Shara Bialo. She\u2019s a pediatric endocrinologist. Today\u2019s KevinMD article is \u201dImproving type 1 diabetes screening awareness among women is critical: here\u2019s why.\u201d Shara, let\u2019s end with some take-home messages you want to leave with the KevinMD audience.\n\nShara Bialo: Excellent. So, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that can be detected before it causes any ill effects on the body and the family. A blood test can detect those autoimmune roots, which gives people options and empowers them to take steps to live well with type 1. If there\u2019s a family history, there\u2019s up to a 15-times increased risk of getting diagnosed with type 1, so that\u2019s low-hanging fruit to consider testing. Also keep in mind that 90 percent of people diagnosed with type 1 each year do not have a family history, so I think we\u2019ll eventually need to move toward broader screening.\n\nKevin Pho: Shara, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight. And thanks again for coming on the show.\n\nShara Bialo: Thank you.",

            "content": "March is shaping up to be a busy month for the FDA, with nearly ten target action dates across a wide variety of disease areas. The more highly anticipated verdicts due this month include a next-generation antibiotic for urinary tract infection and two RNA interference therapies.\n\nRead below for more.\n\nScienture Targets First Liquid Losartan Approval\n\nScienture is advancing a liquid formulation of the popular blood pressure drug losartan, for which the FDA has a target action date of March 17.\n\nThe asset, dubbed SCN-102, is being proposed for the treatment of hypertension and to lower blood pressure both in adults and in children aged 6 and older. Scienture\u2019s New Drug Application also covers the use of SCN-102 to reduce the likelihood of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, and to treat diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo back its application, Scienture filed Phase I pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that SCN-102 achieves \u201cclose comparability\u201d to immediate-release tablets in terms of losartan exposure. Additionally, compared with the pill form of losartan, SCN-102 achieved peak concentration earlier, an outcome that is \u201cexpected\u201d due to its liquid formulation, as per the company\u2019s SEC document.\n\nIf approved, SCN-102 will be the first liquid formulation of losartan to hit the market, according to Scienture.\n\nElevar Eyes First-Line Nod in Liver Cancer\n\nBy March 20, the FDA is set to release its verdict on Elevar Therapeutics\u2019 investigational VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor rivoceranib, which the biotech is proposing for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Elevar is combining rivoceranib with the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab.\n\nRivoceranib\u2019s data package includes findings from the Phase III CARES-310 trial, a May 2024 readout that showed the rivoceranib combo resulted in significantly longer median overall survival than sorafenib alone. The study also noted progression-free survival, treatment response and duration of response benefits in patients treated with camrelizumab plus rivoceranib.\n\nElevar first tried to secure approval for rivoceranib in 2023, which ended in a rejection in May 2024. In its Complete Response Letter, the FDA pointed to manufacturing problems at a third-party provider, as well as incomplete clinical site inspections brought about by FDA travel restrictions. Elevar resubmitted its application in September 2024.\n\nAlnylam\u2019s RNAi Therapy for ATTR-CM Nears Judgment Day\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated FDA decisions this month is for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which is seeking to expand the label of its RNAi therapy vutrisiran to include transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) with cardiomyopathy. The FDA\u2019s decision is due on March 23.\n\nVutrisiran is approved under the brand name Amvuttra, though its use is limited to the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary ATTR. The drug works by targeting and knocking down both the wildtype and mutant forms of the transthyretin RNA, in turn lowering the expression of the protein. As per Alynlam, this mechanism of action allows vutrisiran to address the underlying pathological cascade of ATTR and its cardiomyopathy manifestations.\n\nAlnylam\u2019s bid for label expansion is backed by the HELIOS-B study, data from which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2024. Results showed a 28% and 33% drop in the risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events, respectively, after vutrisiran treatment.\n\nIf approved, vutrisiran will be the first treatment cleared for both the polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy manifestations of ATTR, according to Alnylam.\n\nTheratechnologies Tries Again for HIV Lipodystrophy Drug\n\nAfter suffering a rejection last year, Theratechnologies is once again awaiting the FDA\u2019s verdict for its F8 formulation of tesamorelin, a peptide therapy that the biotech is proposing for the reduction of stomach fat in people with HIV and lipodystrophy. The regulator\u2019s decision is expected on March 25.\n\nIn its Complete Response Letter, the FDA pointed to problems related to tesamorelin\u2019s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, particularly with impurities and the stability of the drug. In its resubmission, filed in November 2024, Theratechnologies said it had addressed the FDA\u2019s concerns and provided additional data regarding tesamorelin\u2019s immunogenicity risk.\n\nTesamorelin works by mimicking the growth hormone-releasing factor, promoting the secretion of growth hormone and, in turn, facilitating the breakdown of abdominal fat. The drug was first approved in 2010 and an F4 formulation, which is four times as concentrated as the original product, was given the go-ahead in 2018. Theratechnologies\u2019 drug application is seeking approval for a formulation that is eight times stronger than the initial product.\n\nGSK Pushes First-in-Class Antibiotic for Uncomplicated UTI\n\nBy March 26, the FDA is scheduled to release its verdict on GSK\u2019s investigational antibiotic gepotidacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adult women and adolescents 12 years and up weighing at least 40 kg.\n\nGepotidacin is a first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that works by targeting and preventing the replication of bacterial DNA by binding to a unique site. Because gepotidacin utilizes a novel mechanism to target bacteria, it has shown activity against most uropathogens such as E. coli and S. saprophyticus, as well as N. gonorrhoeae, including strains that have become resistant to currently available treatments.\n\nGSK is backing its application with data from the Phase III EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 studies, which in April 2023 found gepotidacin to be non-inferior to a current first-line treatment option, nitrofurantoin. EAGLE-2, for instance, demonstrated a 50.6% treatment success rate in patients given gepotidacin versus 47% in nitrofurantoin counterparts. The respective success rates in EAGLE-3 were 58.5% and 43.6%.\n\nMilestone Proposes Tachycardia Nasal Spray\n\nMilestone Pharmaceuticals\u2019 lead pipeline asset is Cardamyst, an etripamil nasal spray the biotech is developing for the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). The FDA is expected to release its decision on Cardamyst by March 27.\n\nIn October 2023, when the FDA accepted Milestone\u2019s first new drug application for Cardamyst, the biotech said it had submitted \u201cthe largest data package ever studied in PSVT.\u201d The company at the time had filed what it called a \u201ccomprehensive data package\u201d suggesting that its investigational calcium channel blocker was \u201ctwice as effective and three times as fast as placebo\u201d in normalizing heart rhythm.\n\nDespite an extensive evidence base, however, the FDA in December 2023 hit Milestone with a Refusal to File letter for Cardamyst, noting that the company\u2019s filing was not sufficient to a warrant a full review. Milestone refiled its drug application in March 2024, which the FDA accepted in May of the same year.\n\nAfter Delay, Soleno\u2019s Prader-Willi Drug Nears Regulatory Decision\n\nThe FDA is scheduled to release its verdict on Soleno Therapeutics\u2019 investigational Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) drug diazoxide choline by March 27.\n\nSoleno\u2019s diazoxide choline drug is an extended-release formulation of diazoxide, which has long been used to treat various rare diseases, though the molecule has yet to be cleared for PWS, according to the biotech. Soleno\u2019s drug application, which it filed in June 2024, is supported by Phase III data pointing to the candidate\u2019s potential in addressing hyperphagia and other hallmark symptoms of PWS, including aggressive behaviors and fat buildup.\n\nSoleno also submitted findings from five Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and three Phase III trials.\n\nIn November 2024, the biotech announced that the FDA needed more time to review its application for diazoxide choline, especially following the company\u2019s responses to certain information requests. The regulator considered these additional submissions as major amendments to the drug application and pushed its deadline back by three months.\n\nSanofi, Alnylam Hope for Hemophilia Approval for RNAi Therapy\n\nAlnylam\u2019s second showing on this list is for its Sanofi-partnered siRNA therapy fitusiran, which the companies proposed for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. The FDA\u2019s verdict is expected on March 28.\n\nTo back the RNAi therapy, Sanofi and Alnylam ran the ATLAS clinical development program, publications from which went live in The Lancet and The Lancet Hematology in April 2023. In one study, dubbed ATLAS-INH, fitusiran treatment resulted in zero monthly bleeding episodes in 66% of patients who were also on factor VIII inhibitors. The other study, called ATLAS A/B, found that in patients without inhibitors, 51% achieved zero monthly bleeds after fitusiran.\n\nFitusiran is given via an injection under the skin and works by binding to and lowering the expression of antithrombin, a protein that inhibits clotting.",

Positive results from the pivotal ADEPT phase 2/3 study evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with moderate-to-severe bullous pemphigoid (BP) were shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. BP is a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and characterized by intense itch and blisters, reddening of the skin, and painful lesions.\n\nVictoria Werth, MD\n\nChief of the Division of Dermatology at the Philadelphia Veterans Administration Hospital, Professor of Dermatology and Medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Veteran's Administration Medical Center, and principal investigator of the study\n\n\u201cPeople with bullous pemphigoid live with unrelenting itch, blisters, and painful lesions that can be debilitating and make it difficult to function daily. Moreover, current treatment options can be challenging for this primarily elderly patient population because they work by suppressing their immune system. By targeting the underlying type 2 inflammation, which is a key driver for bullous pemphigoid, Dupixent is the first investigational biologic to show sustained disease remission and reduce disease severity and itch compared to placebo in a clinical study.\u201d\n\nThe ADEPT study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, enrolling 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP who were randomized to receive Dupixent 300 mg (n=53) every two weeks after an initial loading dose or placebo (n=53) added to standard-of-care oral corticosteroids (OCS). During treatment, all patients underwent a protocol-defined OCS tapering regimen if control of disease activity was maintained. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by week 16 without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period.\n\nAs presented at AAD, results for Dupixent-treated patients at 36 weeks, compared to those treated with placebo, were as follows:\n\n20% experienced sustained disease remission, the primary endpoint, compared to 4% (p=0.0114)\n\n40% achieved \u226590% reduction in disease severity compared to 10% (p=0.0003)\n\n40% achieved clinically meaningful itch reduction compared to 11% (p=0.0006)\n\n1678 mg reduction in cumulative OCS exposure (p=0.0220) on average and a 54% lower risk of rescue medication use (p=0.0016)\n\nIn this elderly population, overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 96% (n=51) for Dupixent and 96% (n=51) for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo in at least 3 patients included peripheral edema (n=8 vs. n=5), arthralgia (n=5 vs. n=3), back pain (n=4 vs. n=2), blurred vision (n=4 vs. n=0), hypertension (n=4 vs. n=3), asthma (n=4 vs. n=1), conjunctivitis (n=4 vs. n=0), constipation (n=4 vs. n=1), upper respiratory tract infection (n=3 vs. n=1), limb injury (n=3 vs. n=2), and insomnia (n=3 vs. n=2). There were no AEs leading to death in the Dupixent group and 2 AEs leading to death in the placebo group.\n\nIn February, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent to treat BP. The FDA decision is expected by June 20,2025. Dupixent was previously granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for BP, which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Additional applications are also under review around the world, including in the EU.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout BP\n\nBP is a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation that typically occurs in an elderly population. It is characterized by intense itch and blisters, reddening of the skin, and painful lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust, resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning. Approximately 27,000 adults in the US live with BP that is uncontrolled by systemic corticosteroids.\n\nAbout the Dupixent BP pivotal study\n\nADEPT is a randomized, phase 2/3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP for a 52-week treatment period. After randomization, patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks, with OCS treatment. During treatment, OCS taper was initiated after patients experienced two weeks of sustained control of disease activity. OCS tapering could start between four to six weeks after randomization and was continued as long as disease control was maintained, with the intent of completion by 16 weeks. After OCS tapering, patients were only treated with Dupixent or placebo for at least 20 weeks, unless rescue treatment was required.\n\nThe primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients achieving sustained disease remission at 36 weeks. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of OCS taper by 16 weeks without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. Relapse was defined as appearance of \u22653 new lesions a month or \u22651 large lesion or urticarial plaque (>10 cm in diameter) that did not heal within a week. Rescue therapy could include treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids, OCS (including increase of OCS dose during the taper or re-initiation of OCS after completion of the OCS taper), systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressive medications, or immunomodulating biologics.\n\nSelect secondary endpoints evaluated at 36 weeks included:\n\nProportion of patients achieving \u226590% reduction in Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (scale: 0-360)\n\nProportion of patients with \u22654-point reduction in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (scale 0-10) score\n\nTotal cumulative OCS dose\n\nTime to first use of rescue medication\n\nAbout Dupixent\n\nDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\nDupilumab development program\n\nDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid, and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Regeneron\n\nRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

            "content": "Dublin, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Insulin Pen Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe Insulin Pen market is expected to reach US$ 11.50 billion by 2033 from US$ 6.60 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 6.36% from 2025 to 2033\n\nThe increasing number of people with diabetes worldwide, improvements in insulin delivery technology, the need for more user-friendly devices, increased accuracy, improved patient convenience, and a move toward individualized, self-managed diabetes care are the main factors driving the insulin pen market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rising incidence of diabetes worldwide, especially Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, has led to a notable expansion in the insulin pen market. Compared to conventional syringes, insulin pens provide a more accurate and convenient way to administer insulin, making them a popular option. They are intended for both novice and seasoned patients and enable simpler, more reliable dosing. Insulin pens are the perfect option for individuals who need to control their disease while leading active lives because they are small, discrete, and portable. The need for insulin pens is growing as diabetes treatment becomes more patient-centered, especially with the introduction of prefilled and disposable models.\n\n\n\nInnovations in technology that increase injection comfort and accuracy have further stimulated the insulin pen market. A rising number of people are using smart insulin pens, which link to smartphone apps for data sharing and tracking. By giving information about insulin use, nutrition, and activity, these gadgets help patients better control their blood glucose levels. The global drive for improved diabetes care and more access to healthcare in both developed and developing nations is also fueling the expansion of the insulin pen market. The market for insulin pens is predicted to expand despite obstacles including exorbitant prices and restricted insurance coverage. This growth will be fueled by technological developments, rising patient awareness, and the demand for more effective diabetes treatment options.\n\n\n\nA chronic condition known as diabetes type 1 occurs when the pancreas produces little to no insulin. In the past, it was known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. For persons with diabetes to survive, they must have access to reasonably priced medical treatment, especially insulin. Everyone agrees that the rise in obesity and diabetes must be stopped by 2025. The majority of the 422 million people with diabetes worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, and the disease is directly responsible for 1.5 million deaths each year. Both the incidence and prevalence of diabetes have steadily increased over the last few decades.\n\n\n\nGlobally, the prevalence of diabetes has risen to 10.5%, with more than half (44.7%) of people still undiagnosed, according to the most current IDF Diabetes Atlas. By 2.04 trillion adults, or one in eight people, would have diabetes, according to IDF projections. This may be a 46% increase, more than twice the 20% predicted population growth for the same time frame.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Insulin Pen Market\n\nRising Patient Preference\n\n\n\nInsulin pens have become more and more popular as diabetes care becomes more patient-centered because of their convenience, comfort, and confidentiality. Insulin pens are more portable than traditional syringes and provide precision dosing, which is crucial for improved blood glucose control. Insulin pens are more convenient and less frightening for many patients than needles, which increases the likelihood that they will follow their treatment regimens.\n\nHealthcare Infrastructure and Access\n\n\n\nThe market for insulin pens is growing internationally as a result of better access to diabetes care and advancements in healthcare infrastructure. Insulin pens are becoming accessible through pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals in both developed and emerging nations. Compared to conventional syringes, insulin pens provide a more accurate and efficient method of administering insulin as healthcare systems advance and patient care shifts toward long-term treatment.\n\nAdditionally, increased insurance coverage in many nations supports the growing accessibility of insulin pens, lowering their cost for patients. More people will have access to insulin pens for improved diabetes treatment as healthcare infrastructure continues to advance, especially in emerging nations.\n\n\n\nGovernment and Healthcare Initiatives\n\n\n\nThe market for insulin pens has grown significantly as a result of government programs and healthcare regulations aimed at enhancing diabetes care. Insulin and related items are progressively being subsidized in many nations, which lowers the cost of insulin pens and increases their accessibility for a larger population. By guaranteeing that patients have access to dependable and efficient treatment alternatives, these programs seek to lessen the burden of diabetes on public health systems.\n\nThe demand for insulin pens is also being driven by government agencies and health groups that are running awareness campaigns on the advantages of managing diabetes properly. Insulin pens are becoming an essential component of diabetes treatment plans all across the world as a result of the government's increased funding for diabetes care.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Insulin Pen Market\n\nTechnological Limitations\n\n\n\nWith the advent of smart pens that track dosages and provide sophisticated functionality, insulin pens have advanced, but there are still technological constraints. Their full functionality may be hampered by factors like poor connectivity, trouble synchronizing with other health monitoring equipment, or issues with mobile app compatibility.\n\nAdditionally, some patients could find it difficult to adjust to these cutting-edge technologies, particularly those who are not tech-savvy or are hesitant to use new gadgets. Manufacturers must provide seamless user experiences and seamless connection with other medical devices as insulin pens get more advanced. To fully utilize the promise of sophisticated insulin pens in the treatment of diabetes, these technological obstacles must be removed.\n\n\n\nPatient Education and Awareness\n\n\n\nAlthough insulin pens are more practical than conventional syringes, their use requires adequate training and teaching. Patients may abuse the device and miss doses or administer insulin incorrectly if they are not given enough instructions on how to use the pens, including how to handle, store, and dose them. This can raise the risk of problems and lead to poor blood sugar control. Programs for patient education are crucial to ensuring that people are knowledgeable and comfortable using insulin pens to manage their diabetes. To guarantee that patients get the most out of the precision and simplicity of insulin pens in their treatment, healthcare professionals must set aside time to teach patients effective practices.\n\nKey Questions Answered in Report\n\n1.

            "content": "David Risinger, an analyst from Leerink Partners, maintained the Buy rating on Sanofi (SNYNF \u2013 Research Report). The associated price target is \u20ac120.00.\n\nDavid Risinger has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that highlight Sanofi\u2019s potential for growth and innovation. A key element in his analysis is the promising outlook for amlitelimab, an anti-OX40L antibody, which is being developed for multiple indications, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Sanofi has identified amlitelimab as one of its top pipeline assets, with potential peak sales exceeding \u20ac5 billion, particularly in the atopic dermatitis market.\n\nRisinger notes that while there is some caution regarding the timing of the asthma data readout, the broader potential of amlitelimab across various conditions presents significant upside. The drug\u2019s ability to address underserved populations and its competitive efficacy profile could enhance its market position. Additionally, Sanofi\u2019s strategic focus on amlitelimab and its ongoing trials in other indications, such as alopecia areata and celiac disease, further support the Buy rating, reflecting confidence in Sanofi\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nIn another report released on March 4, Berenberg Bank also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a \u20ac120.00 price target.\n\nSNYNF\u2019s price has also changed slightly for the past six months \u2013 from $116.830 to $121.292, which is a 3.82% increase.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

            "content": "Dublin, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Lung Cancer Diagnostics Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe global lung cancer diagnostics market is expected to grow significantly with an estimate of reaching US$ 38.00 billion by 2033 from US$ 20.28 billion in 2024. This growth has been due to a compound annual growth rate of 7.23% from 2025 to 2033.\n\nGrowth has been spurred by the increased prevalence of lung cancer and awareness about early detection along with improved diagnostic technologies. Innovations in imaging, biomarkers, and non-invasive methods are among the reasons for the market's expansion. Innovation in minimally invasive methodologies such as liquid biopsies, which analyze circulating tumor DNA for non-invasive detection, drives the market. Growth is fueled by rising lung cancer cases and the demand for early diagnosis and personalized treatment approaches. However, procedure-related risks, high costs, and limited accessibility in developing regions are barriers to the wider adoption of the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvancement in Diagnostic Technologies\n\n\n\nDeveloping cutting-edge diagnostics such as liquid biopsies, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and AI-driven imaging systems propels the market forward. Such new technologies improve on accuracy and allow non-invasive tests that also improve on early detection of lung cancer. For instance, liquid biopsies test circulating tumor DNA, giving crucial information regarding genetic mutations and treatment plans. AI algorithms improve imaging techniques, allowing for more accurate detection of tumors. Such technological advancements are bringing about more efficient diagnosis, reduced risks, and more personalized treatment plans, hence becoming an essential part of the growing market.\n\n\n\nGrowth in Lung Cancer Prevalence\n\n\n\nThe incidence of lung cancer is increasing globally and is one of the most significant growth factors. Higher incidence rates are attributed to factors such as smoking, pollution, occupational hazards, and aging populations. Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, according to global health organizations, and hence, requires strong diagnostic systems. The increasing patient population demands better diagnostic tools for early detection and better treatment outcomes.\n\nThis trend will motivate health care providers and governments to invest in high-tech diagnostic infrastructure and public awareness campaigns, which will boost the market. As forecasted in February 2024, lung cancer was ranked the highest in cancer prevalence worldwide and affected 2.5 million people, which is likely to represent 12% of the total new cases.\n\n\n\nGrowing Interest in Early Detection and Screening Programs\n\n\n\nGovernments and health organizations are focusing on early detection through mass-screening programs. Programs like low-dose CT scanning target high-risk populations such as heavy smokers and individuals with a history of lung disease. Early detection of cancer has significantly improved the survival rate by detecting cancer at treatable stages.\n\nThese programs are supported by public and private funding, encouraging research and development in diagnostic solutions. Increased awareness and availability of screening technologies promote adoption, in turn stimulating further growth of the market. This aggressive strategy resonates with worldwide initiatives aimed at reducing mortality rates due to lung cancer, positioning diagnostics as a key part of healthcare delivery systems.\n\n\n\nDifficulties in the Lung Cancer Diagnostics Market\n\nExpensive Diagnostic Techniques\n\n\n\nThe high cost of the advanced diagnostic tools in lung cancer includes molecular testing, liquid biopsies, and imaging technologies. These procedures often require specialized equipment, highly trained personnel, and sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, making them expensive for healthcare providers and patients. The financial burden in low- and middle-income countries limits access to these diagnostic services. Even in developed nations, affordability can hinder widespread adoption. High costs also affect reimbursement rates, creating barriers for providers and patients, ultimately slowing market penetration and hindering the widespread implementation of cutting-edge diagnostic solutions.\n\n\n\nLimited Access in Developing Regions\n\n\n\nInadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited access to advanced diagnostics in developing regions continue to be a challenge. Many low- and middle-income countries lack the resources, trained professionals, and facilities to implement modern lung cancer diagnostic tools. In addition, geographic disparities in healthcare services contribute to unequal access, with rural and remote areas being the most underserved. Moreover, low awareness of lung cancer symptoms and diagnostic options contributes to late-stage diagnoses in these regions. This calls for significant investments in infrastructure, training programs, and public awareness campaigns to ensure equitable access and improved outcomes worldwide.\n\nKey Questions Answered in Report:\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Shareholders appeared unconcerned with Sanofi India Limited's ( ) lackluster earnings report last week. We did some digging, and we believe the earnings are stronger than they seem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamining Cashflow Against Sanofi India's Earnings\n\nOne key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.\n\nTherefore, it's actually considered a good thing when a company has a negative accrual ratio, but a bad thing if its accrual ratio is positive. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. Notably, there is some academic evidence that suggests that a high accrual ratio is a bad sign for near-term profits, generally speaking.\n\nFor the year to December 2024, Sanofi India had an accrual ratio of -0.19. That implies it has very good cash conversion, and that its earnings in the last year actually significantly understate its free cash flow. To wit, it produced free cash flow of \u20b94.3b during the period, dwarfing its reported profit of \u20b93.14b. Sanofi India's free cash flow improved over the last year, which is generally good to see.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Sanofi India's Profit Performance\n\nHappily for shareholders, Sanofi India produced plenty of free cash flow to back up its statutory profit numbers. Based on this observation, we consider it possible that Sanofi India's statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! On the other hand, its EPS actually shrunk in the last twelve months. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. At Simply Wall St, we found and we think they deserve your attention.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Sanofi India's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. Some people consider a high return on equity to be a good sign of a quality business.

Compared to conventional syringes, insulin pens provide a more accurate and convenient way to administer insulin, making them a popular option. They are intended for both novice and seasoned patients and enable simpler, more reliable dosing. Insulin pens are the perfect option for individuals who need to control their disease while leading active lives because they are small, discrete, and portable. The need for insulin pens is growing as diabetes treatment becomes more patient-centered, especially with the introduction of prefilled and disposable models.\n\n\n\nInnovations in technology that increase injection comfort and accuracy have further stimulated the insulin pen market. A rising number of people are using smart insulin pens, which link to smartphone apps for data sharing and tracking. By giving information about insulin use, nutrition, and activity, these gadgets help patients better control their blood glucose levels. The global drive for improved diabetes care and more access to healthcare in both developed and developing nations is also fueling the expansion of the insulin pen market. The market for insulin pens is predicted to expand despite obstacles including exorbitant prices and restricted insurance coverage. This growth will be fueled by technological developments, rising patient awareness, and the demand for more effective diabetes treatment options.\n\n\n\nA chronic condition known as diabetes type 1 occurs when the pancreas produces little to no insulin. In the past, it was known as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. For persons with diabetes to survive, they must have access to reasonably priced medical treatment, especially insulin. Everyone agrees that the rise in obesity and diabetes must be stopped by 2025. The majority of the 422 million people with diabetes worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, and the disease is directly responsible for 1.5 million deaths each year. Both the incidence and prevalence of diabetes have steadily increased over the last few decades.\n\n\n\nGlobally, the prevalence of diabetes has risen to 10.5%, with more than half (44.7%) of people still undiagnosed, according to the most current IDF Diabetes Atlas. By 2.04 trillion adults, or one in eight people, would have diabetes, according to IDF projections. This may be a 46% increase, more than twice the 20% predicted population growth for the same time frame.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers for the Insulin Pen Market\n\nRising Patient Preference\n\n\n\nInsulin pens have become more and more popular as diabetes care becomes more patient-centered because of their convenience, comfort, and confidentiality. Insulin pens are more portable than traditional syringes and provide precision dosing, which is crucial for improved blood glucose control. Insulin pens are more convenient and less frightening for many patients than needles, which increases the likelihood that they will follow their treatment regimens.\n\nHealthcare Infrastructure and Access\n\n\n\nThe market for insulin pens is growing internationally as a result of better access to diabetes care and advancements in healthcare infrastructure. Insulin pens are becoming accessible through pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals in both developed and emerging nations. Compared to conventional syringes, insulin pens provide a more accurate and efficient method of administering insulin as healthcare systems advance and patient care shifts toward long-term treatment.\n\nAdditionally, increased insurance coverage in many nations supports the growing accessibility of insulin pens, lowering their cost for patients. More people will have access to insulin pens for improved diabetes treatment as healthcare infrastructure continues to advance, especially in emerging nations.\n\n\n\nGovernment and Healthcare Initiatives\n\n\n\nThe market for insulin pens has grown significantly as a result of government programs and healthcare regulations aimed at enhancing diabetes care. Insulin and related items are progressively being subsidized in many nations, which lowers the cost of insulin pens and increases their accessibility for a larger population. By guaranteeing that patients have access to dependable and efficient treatment alternatives, these programs seek to lessen the burden of diabetes on public health systems.\n\nThe demand for insulin pens is also being driven by government agencies and health groups that are running awareness campaigns on the advantages of managing diabetes properly. Insulin pens are becoming an essential component of diabetes treatment plans all across the world as a result of the government's increased funding for diabetes care.\n\n\n\nChallenges in the Insulin Pen Market\n\nTechnological Limitations\n\n\n\nWith the advent of smart pens that track dosages and provide sophisticated functionality, insulin pens have advanced, but there are still technological constraints. Their full functionality may be hampered by factors like poor connectivity, trouble synchronizing with other health monitoring equipment, or issues with mobile app compatibility.\n\nAdditionally, some patients could find it difficult to adjust to these cutting-edge technologies, particularly those who are not tech-savvy or are hesitant to use new gadgets. Manufacturers must provide seamless user experiences and seamless connection with other medical devices as insulin pens get more advanced. To fully utilize the promise of sophisticated insulin pens in the treatment of diabetes, these technological obstacles must be removed.\n\n\n\nPatient Education and Awareness\n\n\n\nAlthough insulin pens are more practical than conventional syringes, their use requires adequate training and teaching. Patients may abuse the device and miss doses or administer insulin incorrectly if they are not given enough instructions on how to use the pens, including how to handle, store, and dose them. This can raise the risk of problems and lead to poor blood sugar control. Programs for patient education are crucial to ensuring that people are knowledgeable and comfortable using insulin pens to manage their diabetes. To guarantee that patients get the most out of the precision and simplicity of insulin pens in their treatment, healthcare professionals must set aside time to teach patients effective practices.\n\nKey Questions Answered in Report\n\n1.

            "content": "As economic historian Carlota Perez has described, there is typically a significant time lag between when the promise of a novel technology begins to emerge and the productive deployment of this technology at scale; TR readers will recall the discussion here.\n\nToday, we are seeing this with generative AI, an emerging technology that everyone is still trying to get their arms around (see this TR discussion). The inevitable uncertainty associated with these early days has hardly discouraged large consulting firms, who have all developed \u201cAI playbooks\u201d and are busy persuading potential corporate clients that they are lagging their peers in AI and risk impending extinction.\n\nA Cautionary Tale From Big Pharma\n\nNevertheless, meaningful (vs performative) adoption of generative AI with most large enterprises has been predictably sluggish (see this TR discussion).\n\nZiv Bar-Joseph, the former VP-Head of R&D Data and Computational Sciences at Sanofi, candidly and generously shared on LinkedIn lessons learned from his recent experience at the large French pharma. These takeaways include (emphasis added):\n\n\u2013 Pharma moves slowly. It takes over 10 years to develop a drug. So its not surprising that planning and decision making at big pharma can look very long and frustrate potential partners (and our own employees). Some of it is just bureaucracy. But much of it is intentional. These are often decisions that will have long lasting impact and its important to get them right.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Adoption remains a major challenge. Not because of any principled objection to AI or new technology. But rather because it is very hard to change the way people work. Other issues affecting adoption of new technology are changing needs, people leaving and change in priorities and focus.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Sanofi is not an AI company. While it continues to develop cutting edge AI tools, Sanofi would prefer to purchase or partner rather than build AI products internally. This makes economic and business sense. But it can be frustrating for our internal teams, especially when the decision comes after internal work already started on a similar product (usually because at the time we started the external solution was not available).\n\nThese findings are neither unique to Sanofi nor likely to shock regular TR readers. Yet Bar-Joseph\u2019s insights emphasize a real challenge faced by the field: how to most effectively leverage AI when it\u2019s brutally difficult to meaningfully implement AI in large corporations at a non-glacial time scale.\n\nDon\u2019t Make The Tool \u2013 Implement It\n\nOne answer that seems to be emerging \u2013 at least among impassioned AI investors \u2013 is to identify focused and more manageable opportunities (vs transforming a giant pharma corporation) and drive the AI mediated change yourself.\n\nCass Mao, a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, wrote recently on LinkedIn:\n\nI know 10 different people leaving venture investing right now to do a PE [private equity] play with AI.\n\nThe basic thesis being: more opportunity than ever right now to drive value in SMB [small and medium sized businesses] using technology. But adoption is slow, super fragmented market, a ton of competition with 100s of new tools launching every week.\n\n\u201cEasier\u201d to buy a small company, drive adoption, and reap rewards via direct ownership of the bottom line \u2013 a few million in personal upside within a few years.\n\nvs. be deploying capital in the fast moving froth, high vals, high churn, high competition. so many tools funded and fighting the distribution war, competing with similar tools to seek adoption.\n\nyou\u2019re seeing tools that cost $20/month eliminate **tens of thousands of dollars of cost**.\n\nbetter to be the SMB with 50 different ways to save $30,000, than one of 50 SaaS cos charging $240/year..\n\nIn short, she\u2019s suggesting that:\n\n(a) Cheap AI tools can save a significant amount of money if deployed effectively and in the right context;\n\n(b) If you can identify the right opportunity (basically a job amenable to your tool, and a small organization where you can actually implement the technology), you can do better implementing the AI yourself and pocketing the revenue from the efficiency gains vs trying to sell a particular AI tool in a very crowded market.\n\nThe question, of course, is how (or whether) this can be applied to biopharma.\n\nConsider the following approach, suitably anonymized, but inspired by a real techbio example (there are probably a number of startups trying something similar).\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve identified a specific, valuable aspect of drug development where you believe your technology (AI or something else) gives you an economically valuable competitive advantage. You might believe, for example, you have a more efficient way of running clinical trials. Such a company might then seek to in-license clinical-stage assets from pharmas, execute efficient clinical development past a value inflection point, and then out-license the further de-risked assets back to pharma at a higher valuation.\n\nThe basic strategy itself isn\u2019t particularly original, and startups, with conviction around one asset or another, in-license molecules all the time. The difference in this case is that because you believe your technology allows you to prosecute assets more efficiently, you focus on leveraging this perceived advantage, ideally by raising sufficient money (from entranced tech VCs, say) to fund enough shots on goal.\n\nThrough your superior efficiencies of clinical development, you hope, you have a high chance of clinical, and hence financial success. (You, and especially your tech investors, may also hope your technology allows you to identify more promising assets than skilled drug developers alone, though I\u2019m still very skeptical about this part.)\n\nBeware of Pyrrhic Technological Victories\n\nThe success of this type of approach will depend, of course, both on how well the technology works and how much of competitive advantage it actually delivers \u2013 does it really move the needle for the tech-enabled company?\n\nConsider this example from genetics: metabolism of the blood thinner warfarin is strongly influenced by two genes, CYP2C9 and VKORC1. Genetic testing can determine whether are you likely to be a \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cslow\u201d metabolizer. Yet, utilizing genetic testing turns out to offer at best minimal advantages to the traditional clinical approach of \u201cgoing low and going slow,\u201d to arrive empirically at a therapeutic dose. Thus, while it might seem in theory that genotyping technology could improve care, in practice, most doctors haven\u2019t embraced it because the impact seems less than the aggravation.\n\nSimilarly, techbio companies need to be sure both that their technology really works and that it imparts a meaningful advantage. It\u2019s a tough ask, but one that\u2019s clearly attracted the interest of both investors and entrepreneurs who are convicted about the promise of AI in biopharma and are intensively pursuing the highest-leverage place in which to deploy it.",

Sanofi SA gets it.\n\nAfter all, the French company pocketed Rs 240 crore ($27.5 million) in dividends from its Indian subsidiaries in 2024, including its newly spun-off consumer-health arm. Not bad for a company watching its core pharma business in India lose some steam.\n\nAnd yes, things aren\u2019t exactly rosy for Sanofi India. Its annual earnings report, out on 27 February, showed a 14% drop in profit to Rs 314 crore for the year ended December 2024. It was also the year Sanofi listed its demerged consumer healthcare unit on the Indian stock market. The good news? Sanofi Consumer Healthcare is picking up some of the slack, with profit growth being mostly flat.\n\nIt declared a Rs 55-per-share dividend to shareholders, while Sanofi India\u2019s pharma division handed out Rs 117 per share.

Consumer healthcare is doing exactly what Sanofi wanted it to do: offset the pharma slowdown with the faster, smoother world of over-the-counter products.\n\nAnd those hefty dividends are more than just about keeping shareholders happy. This is part of a bigger shift. Pharma is slow, complicated, and tangled in regulatory approvals and compliances. Consumer healthcare, on the other hand, is faster-moving, has fewer rules, and enjoys better margins. Sanofi even gave it a shiny new label: FMCH, or fast-moving consumer healthcare. It\u2019s the FMCG playbook applied to medicine cabinets.\n\nOf course, Sanofi didn\u2019t invent this move.

            "content": "While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Sanofi Consumer Healthcare India Limited ( ).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sanofi Consumer Healthcare India is:\n\n66% = \u20b91.8b \u00f7 \u20b92.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every \u20b91 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20b90.66 in profit.\n\nDoes Sanofi Consumer Healthcare India Have A Good Return On Equity?\n\nBy comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sanofi Consumer Healthcare India has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the .\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nSanofi Consumer Healthcare India's Debt And Its 66% ROE\n\nSanofi Consumer Healthcare India is free of net debt, which is a positive for shareholders. Its high ROE indicates the business is high quality, but the fact that this was achieved without leverage is veritably impressive. At the end of the day, when a company has zero debt, it is in a better position to take future growth opportunities.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

            "content": "The South African government is investigating alleged anti-competitive practices by Novo Nordisk and Sanofi in connection with human insulin pens, Bloomberg reported on Monday evening.\n\nThe Competition Commission of South Africa, the government\u2019s anti-trust agency, is scrutinizing the companies\u2019 device patents and proprietary designs to determine if these are being exploited to limit competition and block the entry of other developers and suppliers, as per Bloomberg. The watchdog is currently in the process of coordinating with Novo Nordisk\u2019s and Sanofi\u2019s local entities.\n\nBioSpace has reached out to Sanofi and Novo Nordisk for their statements and will update this article accordingly.\n\nThe insulin market has seen some heavy upheaval over the last few years, driven by key policy changes around the world. Chief among these is the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, and the Affordable Insulin Now Act, both of which seek to dramatically minimize Americans\u2019 out-of-pocket spending for insulins. Pressure from lawmakers have also helped lower insulin prices in the U.S.\n\nThe Competition Commission\u2019s investigation comes shortly after it fined Google about $30 million per year for the next five years, while also investigating Meta and the social media network X (formerly Twitter), all for business practices that harmed South African media.\n\nEli Lilly in March 2023 announced that it would lower insulin prices by 70% and cap out-of-pocket costs at $35 per month. Novo and Sanofi followed suit soon after, enacting their respective price cuts in the subsequent weeks.\n\nMonths later, however, Novo announced that it would discontinue its long-acting insulin product Levemir, removing both the vials and pen from the market by the end of 2024. Lilly in Mach 2024 announced that due to marketing constraints, availability of two of its inulin products\u2014Humalog an Lispro\u2014would be limited.\n\nSanofi also discontinued its pre-mixed insulin product Insuman, though this move mostly affected the U.K. and came in February 2023, a month before it announced the insulin price cuts.\n\nIn a May 2024 interview with BioSpace, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said that Novo \u201ccan\u2019t make a product they\u2019re losing money on, which may be the case with some insulins, and at some point they need to be smart with capital.\u201d\n\nStill, the drugmakers continue to innovate on insulins. Lilly, for instance, is advancing a once-weekly insulin injection, Phase III readouts for which showed it could lower A1C by 1.34%, as compared with the 1.26% reduction for once-daily insulin degludec. Novo is also working on its own once-weekly product, dubbed insulin icodec. In July 2024, however, the program hit a regulatory road bump when the FDA rejected its drug application, flagging issues with the use of the product in type 1 diabetes.",

            "content": "This transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nToday I will discuss the new recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in adults. First we\u2019ll make it easy and straightforward, and then we\u2019ll get a little more complicated. The recommendations come from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and were published in the CDC MMWR.\n\nBig new recommendation: All adults aged 50 or older who have not received pneumococcal vaccination or whose immunization status is unknown should receive a single dose of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).\n\nAdults aged 19-49 who have underlying conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease also should receive PCV.\n\nConditions that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease include alcoholism; cerebrospinal fluid leak; chronic heart, liver, or lung disease; chronic renal failure; cigarette smoking; cochlear implant; congenital or acquired asplenia; diabetes mellitus; generalized malignancy; HIV; Hodgkin disease; immunodeficiency; iatrogenic immunosuppression; leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma; nephrotic syndrome; solid organ transplant; or sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies. That\u2019s a long list, so let me repeat the ones that we see most commonly that might not be obvious: alcoholism, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cigarette use, and diabetes.\n\nI also want to point out the language here: \u201c All adults aged 50 or older who have not received pneumococcal vaccination or whose immunization status is unknown should receive a single dose of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).\u201d Notice the phrase \u201cwhose immunization status is unknown.\u201d That means don\u2019t fret if someone is in an eligible group and you don\u2019t know for certain whether they received pneumococcal vaccine in the past; if you don\u2019t know, just go ahead and give them the shot.\n\nOptions for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine include a few choices:\n\nPCV 21 (Capvaxive) (Merck)\n\nPCV 20 (Prevnar20) (Wyeth)\n\nPCV 15 (Vaxneuvance) (Merck), followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23) (Merck)\n\nPatients might ask about how these different vaccines compare. I\u2019ll point out the important differences. PCV21 contains eight pneumococcal serotypes that are not included in the other pneumococcal vaccines, but it does not contain certain pneumococcal serotypes that are contained in other pneumococcal vaccines. One of those serotypes is serotype 4.\n\nIn most US geographic areas, PCV 21 is expected to cover more circulating pneumococcal strains than PCV 20 or PCV 15. Of note, this is not true everywhere, specifically in geographic locales where serotype 4 cases are frequently seen among adults aged < 65 years who have underlying conditions. The CDC recommends that when the prevalence of pneumococcal serotype 4 exceeds 30%, then PCV 20, or PCV 15 and PPSV 23, may provide broader coverage against the locally circulating strains of pneumococcal bacteria. The areas of the country where more than 30% of circulating strains are made up of serotype 4 include Alaska, Colorado, Navajo Nation, New Mexico, and Oregon.\n\nLet me go over a limited number of additional circumstances. If an eligible adult received PPSV23 (Pneumovax23) previously, they should receive a single dose of PCV 21, PCV 20, or PCV 15 at least 1 year after the last PPSV23 dose. For a limited number of other scenarios we have explicit guidance in the MMWR. When there is a question, I find it helpful to look up the CDC guidance either on the web at PneumoRecs \u2013 VaxAdvisor or on their easy-to-use app, available for either iOS devices or Android devices.\n\nWhy did they change the recommendations? About 30%-50% of adults aged 50-64 years have one or more risk conditions that qualify for risk-based pneumococcal vaccination, but we are not very good at following risk-based preventive recommendations. Under the previous recommendations, only a third of high-risk individuals received a pneumococcal vaccine. For the age group (> 65) for whom blanket coverage is recommended, the uptake is twice as high. Blanket recommendations lead to better coverage. In addition, invasive pneumococcal disease peaks at a younger age, 55-59 years old, in Black adults compared with rates among non-Black adults. The shift to recommending pneumococcal vaccine for all adults over age 50 should increase vaccination rates for those at highest risk and should reduce disparities of care. Safety data show PCV to be very safe. Postlicensure data indicate that with PCV 20 there may be a small increase in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (less than 1 in a million doses), although the data here are uncertain.",

The company is refocusing its efforts from COVID-19 vaccine commercialization to pipeline expansion and strategic partnerships. A significant part of this plan is a co-exclusive licensing agreement with Sanofi that could potentially bring in payments totaling up to $1.2 billion. Novavax\u2019s clinical-stage pipeline is also advancing, with ongoing Phase 3 trials for a COVID-19 and influenza combination vaccine. While Novavax is currently transitioning its focus, it also reported a strong cash position sufficient for two years of operations and predicts it will reach operating profitability by 2027.\n\nDiscover the Best Stocks and Maximize Your Portfolio:\n\nSee what stocks are receiving Strong Buy ratings from top-rated analysts.\n\nFilter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener.\n\nChange in Washington Poses a Potential Challenge\n\nNovavax, a biotech company, has faced several challenges despite developing a successful COVID-19 vaccine. It entered a lucrative agreement with Sanofi, which granted the France-based firm the rights to market Novavax\u2019s vaccine worldwide and utilize Novavax\u2019s adjuvant technology for their vaccine candidates. This timely agreement gave Novavax an upfront payment of $500 million, with a potential of $700 million more tied to milestones, not including royalties from products developed using its technology.\n\nThe company\u2019s leading programs, an influenza vaccine and a combined COVID/flu vaccine, currently face competition from several other companies in an industry that isn\u2019t growing as rapidly as others. Novavax\u2019s share price fell significantly after the U.S. FDA placed their lead programs on clinical hold due to suspected adverse events and has not yet fully recovered.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department, under the new leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is undergoing a comprehensive review of contracts and vaccine advisors. Kennedy is assembling a list of potential new committee members to recommend future vaccination guidelines for Americans.\n\nAnalysts Cautious About Upside\n\nNovavax reported revenue of $88.31 million, surpassing analysts\u2019 forecast of $83.47 million. However, this figure signifies a 69.68% decrease year-over-year, down from $291.34 million, as the company transitions its primary focus from its COVID-19 vaccine to enhancing the worth of its technology platform via pipeline expansion and partnerships. The diluted earnings per share of -$0.51 fell short of consensus projections of -$0.43, though marked an improvement from -$1.44 in Q4 2023.\n\nAnalysts following the company responded to the most recent round of earnings with some caution. For instance, Bank of America\u2019s Alec Stranahan reiterated a Hold rating while maintaining a price target of $12.00, noting that the recent pivot towards expanding its early-stage portfolio is positive but recognizing that challenges remain. Exploration in areas like avian flu, RSV, and other vaccine candidates shows promise but necessitates clinical validation, balancing the potential upside against the risks and uncertainties in pipeline development.\n\nNovavax is rated a Moderate Buy overall, based on the recent recommendations of five analysts. The average price target for NVAX stock is $16.20, which represents a potential upside of 105.32% from current levels.\n\nSee more NVAX analyst ratings.\n\nDisclosure",

The inquiry aims to determine whether the companies are using multiple device patents and proprietary designs to stifle competition and block alternative suppliers, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe commission is engaging with the local subsidiaries of both drugmakers as part of its initial probe, with further investigation expected to delve into the companies\u2019 business strategies. The focus is on whether the two companies\u2019 practices limit the entry of more affordable options into the South African market, per Bloomberg.\n\nNovo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker, expressed its willingness to cooperate with authorities. In an emailed statement, the company affirmed that it adheres to all relevant laws and \u201cstrongly supports a competitive market.\u201d Novo Nordisk decided not to bid for South Africa\u2019s 2024 public tender for human insulin pens, instead opting to phase out the easier-to-use pens and offer an older vial-based insulin product, which requires patients to administer the drug via syringe. The company stated that the decision followed \u201cthorough discussion\u201d with the South African Department of Health and ensured sufficient insulin access through this method.\n\nRelated: FTC Seeks Delay in PBM Case Over Alleged Insulin Price Gouging\n\nDiabetes remains a significant health issue in South Africa, ranking as the leading underlying cause of death among women and straining public healthcare facilities. The discontinuation of insulin pens sparked protests last year, with hundreds marching to Novo Nordisk\u2019s Johannesburg headquarters to demand greater access to human insulin and lower prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanofi, which also opted out of the government\u2019s tender to supply insulin pens, left the government to procure a limited number of insulin analogue pens at a higher price, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Insulin analogue pens, which offer adjustable absorption rates, are generally more expensive than human insulin. MSF criticized the lack of bulk supply agreements, which could have provided broader access to the medication.\n\nThe Competition Commission\u2019s investigation will assess whether the drugmakers\u2019 actions contributed to inflated prices and restricted access to life-saving medication in a country already grappling with a high diabetes burden.\n\nSource: Bloomberg",

(Nasdaq: RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in microRNA-targeted therapies, announced the completion of patient enrollment in the fourth cohort of its Phase 1b MAD study of RGLS8429 for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), with 26 patients enrolled.In May 2024, Rege Nephro CO., Ltd. announced that patient enrollment for the second stage of its Phase II clinical trial evaluating tamibarotene (RN-014) for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) began in April. The decision to proceed was based on a thorough review of safety data from the first stage, which commenced in December of the previous year.In March 2024, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Nasdaq: VRTX) announced that the FDA has cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for VX-407, an investigational first-in-class small molecule corrector designed to address the root cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in patients with specific PKD1 genetic variants. ADPKD, the most common inherited kidney disease, affects approximately 250,000 individuals across the U.S. and Europe, yet no existing treatments currently target its underlying biological cause.In January 2024, Regulus Therapeutics completed the recruitment of patients for the third cohort in the Phase Ib multiple-ascending dose (MAD) trial of RGLS8429, a prospective therapy for ADPKD. RGLS8429 aims to block miR-17 and specifically target the kidneys. This Phase Ib MAD study is structured to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RGLS8429 in adults diagnosed with ADPKD.Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease OverviewAKPKD stands for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. It is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to progressive kidney damage and impairment of renal function over time. Autosomal dominant means that only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is sufficient to cause the condition. AKPKD is the most common inherited kidney disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide.Get a Free Sample PDF Report to know more about Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Pipeline Therapeutic Assessment-delveinsight.com/sample-request/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-pipeline-insight [Emerging Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Drugs Under Different Phases of Clinical Development Include:AL1311: AceLink TherapeuticsDINAK 001: DiNAQOR AGPXL770: PoxelAL01211: AceLink TherapeuticsRGLS8429: Regulus TherapeuticsBardoxolone methyl: ReataPharmaceuticalsTesevatinib/KD019: SanofiGLPG2737: Galapagos NVAT-20494: Janssen PharmaceuticalsXRx-008: Xortx TherapeuticsBardoxolone methyl: Reata PharmaceuticalsAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Route of AdministrationAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease pipeline report provides the therapeutic assessment of the pipeline drugs by the Route of Administration.

            "content": "Gary Monteiro speaking during Bioversity graduation in 2024. (Photo by John Wilcox)\n\nCan you share a bit about your background and how you got involved with Bioversity?\n\nI am a Northeastern University Mechanical Engineering graduate with 30 years of experience in biotech manufacturing at Sanofi-Genzyme. Over the course of my career, I progressed from Manufacturing Operator to Director of Manufacturing, gaining firsthand insight into the industry at multiple levels. Throughout this journey, my most rewarding experiences came from training teams, helping them solve problems, and improving their overall work experience.\n\nIn 2019, I left Sanofi-Genzyme (now Sanofi) to focus on applying my process improvement and lean training in a more personal, hands-on way as a contract trainer. In support of this transition, I became a certified Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt and spent a year and a half honing my skills as a corporate trainer.\n\nI first learned about Bioversity through a friend at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (MCPHS). We immediately saw how well it aligned with my experience and passion for training. He introduced me to Bioversity Executive Director Zach Stanley and MCPHS Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships and Dean of the School of Professional Studies Carol Stuckey, and the rest is history!\n\nTell us about the content you teach and what role it plays in helping Bioversity students prepare to start their new career in the life sciences.\n\nI am currently instructing my fourth Bioversity cohort, teaching Job Application Prep. This course helps students develop a skills-based r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that highlights their valuable and highly sought-after transferable skills, create and maintain an eye-catching LinkedIn profile and understand and respond effectively to common interview questions. Students also participate in practice interviews with industry volunteers, refining their communication and interview skills to build confidence for real-world job opportunities.\n\nIn addition, I teach Laboratory Inventory Management, a course that has proven to be highly relevant for recruiters seeking candidates for lab operations roles.\n\nIn your experience, what sets Bioversity students apart from those you\u2019ve taught or worked with in the past?\n\nHaving been on both sides of corporate training, I know that employees are often distracted by being away from their work and may not always be enthusiastic about spending extended time in a training room.\n\nAt Bioversity, however, the difference is striking. The students want to be there. They bring a strong sense of motivation and determination to succeed, fully engaging in the learning process and embracing the opportunity to build a new career. For them, this program is truly life-changing\u2014and for me, being part of their journey is incredibly rewarding.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson or piece of wisdom you hope to impart to your students during their time in the program?\n\nMy title slide for each Job Application Prep session features a quote attributed to John Wooden: \u201cConfidence comes from being prepared.\u201d Bioversity students have already demonstrated initiative and commitment by applying and being accepted into the program\u2014an essential first step toward their new careers.\n\nAs they progress through the program, they build not only technical knowledge and familiarity with lab equipment, but also critical professional skills to effectively market their value. It is truly inspiring to witness their transformation from week one to graduation, growing in both competence and confidence.\n\nMy goal is for every student to leave Bioversity knowing that they have the skills, knowledge, and preparation to successfully step into an early-career role in life sciences with confidence.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot to offer this industry, and you will be ready\u201d.\n\nThis blog was originally posted to the Bioversity website.\n\nGary Monteiro with a Bioversity graduate and staff during a Bioversity Graduation ceremony.

Sales to Other Clients declined by 1.7%. The positive momentum from the cross-selling strategy (contributing to approximately 9.5% of API Solutions sales to Other Clients in 2024) and from the addition of 37 new clients was offset by the temporary suspension of API production in Brindisi, and lower sales of Vitamin B12, due to reduced demand and a timing impact (some sales originally scheduled in Q4 were postponed to 2025).\n\n\n\nCDMO\n\nCDMO sales decreased by 13.1% to \u20ac248.3 million, with 58 active contracts at the end of 2024, down from 69 in 2023. Sixteen new projects were signed, 65% with new customers. The decline in the number of projects was due, notably, to the successful completion of eight projects, which are suspended until the next phase, and the discontinuation of seven mature pre-carve-out commercial projects.\n\nSales to Sanofi rose by 7.0%, driven by the ramp-up of a sizeable commercial phase contract in Large Molecules and by the production of BTK inhibitor starting materials for Sanofi, following the positive results from the phase 3 study.\n\nSales to other clients decreased by 24.8% due to the temporary suspension of production in Brindisi, which affected a commercial phase contract in biochemistry. The 2024 performance was further impacted by the downsizing of two large historical commercial phase contracts (approximately \u20ac40 million), which more than offset the revenue increase from new contracts.\n\nNet Sales per type of molecule\n\n(in \u20ac million) FY-2024 FY-2023 Change Large molecules 90.5 76.5 18.3% Highly potent molecules 91.0 96.4 -5.6% Biochemistry molecules derived from fermentation 110.1 184.1 -40.2% Complex chemical synthesis molecules 620.3 656.2 -5.5% Net Sales 911.9 1,013.2 -10.0%\n\nLarge molecules increased by 18.3% to \u20ac90.5 million.

The core EBITDA margin was 5.5% compared to 9.2% in 2023.\n\nThe decrease in Core EBITDA margin was driven by several factors, including the exceptional impact of stock clearance for Buserelin in the first half of the year, the revision of the global MSA with Sanofi, reduced energy and raw materials prices, and enhanced industrial performance. These positive effects were offset notably by unfavorable fixed-cost absorption triggered by the release of products produced during the peak inflation cycle of the past 24 months.\n\nKey components of the change in Core EBITDA margin FY24/FY23 in percentage points (rounded figures) FY 2023 Core EBITDA margin 9.2% Volume +0.8 pts Price and Mix -0.4 pts Impact of Buserelin\u2019s stock clearance +1.0 pts Industrial performance +0.8 pts Energy and Raw Materials +0.8 pts Unfavorable fixed cost absorption -2.6 pts Other Gross Margin impacts -2.4 pts OPEX -0.3 pts Haverhill and Brindisi sites -1.4 pts FY 2024 Core EBITDA margin 5.5%\n\nEBITDA was \u20ac(43.6) million compared to \u20ac68.6 million in 2023, including \u20ac87.1 million of exceptional items7, of which\n\n\u20ac62.5 million of idle costs 8 linked to the execution of FOCUS-27, including the ramp-down of two workshops in Frankfurt that started in 2024 and reduced inventories in Vertolaye,\n\nlinked to the execution of FOCUS-27, including the ramp-down of two workshops in Frankfurt that started in 2024 and reduced inventories in Vertolaye, \u20ac11.3 million in expenditures linked to the transformation of the company and the initial implementation of FOCUS-27, including consulting fees,\n\n\u20ac12.3 million of employee-related expenses, including redundancy plans in Germany and the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Income was \u20ac(120.4) million compared to \u20ac(234.3) million in 2023. Financial income was \u20ac(19.2) million, compared with \u20ac(8.5) million in 2023, due to the increase in interest rates and the impact of the refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility.

Months on Hand at the end of December 2024 was 6.9, down from 7.6 at the end of 2023. DSO reached 39 compared to 56 in December 2023 thanks to enhanced Cash Collection. Other current assets and liabilities include a \u20ac23 million variation in VAT tax reimbursement and \u20ac18 million paid by Sanofi to reserve a minimum available capacity for five selected products as part of the financing of FOCUS-27. An additional \u20ac36 million will be paid in 2025.\n\nCapex reached \u20ac(108.0) million (11.8% of Net Sales), of which 53% were dedicated to growth projects, including increased capacities for Peptides and Oligonucleotides, Vitamin B12, Hormones, and Prostaglandins.\n\nFree Cash Flow before financing activities was \u20ac15.0 million, compared to \u20ac(132.2) million at the end of 2023.9 Cash flow from financing activities includes \u20ac197.3 million of Deeply Subordinated Hybrid Bonds subscribed by Sanofi in October 2024 to support the execution of the FOCUS-27 plan. This non-dilutive instrument has been classified as \u201cEquity.\u201d The \u20ac(10.9) million Cost of Debt comprises \u20ac4.8 million transaction cost linked to the renewal of the \u20ac451 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).\n\n(in \u20ac million) 31 December 2024 31 December 2023 Bank Cash Balances 75.2 34.5 Revolving Credit Facilities (50.0) (205.5) Net Debt Position 25.2 (171.0)\n\nUpdate on FOCUS-27 strategic plan\n\nLaunched in February 2024, FOCUS-27 is a four-year strategic initiative aimed at enhancing EUROAPI's competitiveness and achieving sustainable, profitable growth. In 2024, we began implementing the plan, and various initiatives have been introduced across the plan's four pillars to improve the organization\u2019s agility and effectiveness. On this foundation, the Group reaffirms the FOCUS-27 targets of \u20ac75 to \u20ac80 million in annual run-rate incremental Core EBITDA generated by the plan by the end of 202710, with restructuring costs estimated between \u20ac110 and \u20ac120 million11 from 2024 to 2027.\n\nStreamlined APIs portfolio: 61% of sales12 in differentiated APIs\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of December 2024, differentiated APIs represented 61% of EUROAPI\u2019s portfolio, up from 57% at the end of December 2023. This growth was mainly driven by double-digit increases in Large Molecules and heightened sales momentum in Opiates.\n\nThe terms for the discontinuation of the 13 APIs have been finalized with customers, including strategic stockpiling planned for 2025. By the end of December 2024, the 13 APIs scheduled for discontinuation accounted for approximately \u20ac68 million in sales (7.5% of total sales) and \u20ac(9) million in Gross Profit.\n\nFocused CDMO: 60% of current projects in late-stage\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the year, we concentrated on de-risking our CDMO business and enhancing our technology platforms. By the end of December 2024, 60% of our projects were in late-stage phases. Additionally, large pharmaceutical companies represented 55% of our CDMO portfolio, up from 46% in 2023.\n\nAs proof of the growing interest from existing clients and prospects, we received 215 incoming RFPs, up from 211 in 2023, with a median value per RFP13 up double-digits year-on-year. Of these RFPs, 13% came from prospects.\n\nWe experienced accelerated momentum in Large Molecules, with six new projects in 2024, including with large pharmaceutical companies. This includes four contracts in oligonucleotide and one peptide-PMO conjugate project with a large pharmaceutical company. To provide our customers with a comprehensive one-stop-shop experience, we signed a partnership with StrainChem, a French Contract Research Organization (CRO) specializing in organic green chemistry and recognized for its Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SLiPPS) technology.\n\nRationalized manufacturing footprint and high-return Capex: 53% of 2024 CAPEX dedicated to growth14\n\n\n\n\n\nThe site divestments and workshops mothballing roadmaps have been initiated. The Haverhill site disposal process is in progress.\n\nThe FOCUS-27 plan provides \u20ac350 to 400 million CAPEX, around 60% dedicated to growth. In 2024, \u20ac108 million was invested, with growth projects accounting for 53%. Progress was made on key strategic initiatives:\n\nBy the end of 2025, the initial expansion of peptide and oligonucleotide capacities in Frankfurt will be completed, focusing primarily on oligonucleotide capacities, including complex conjugated large molecules to address growing market demand and align with the Group\u2019s emphasis on high-value projects. Additionally, the newly signed partnership with StrainChem significantly enhances peptide capacities through liquid-phase synthesis.\n\nCapacity increase projects in Vitamin B12, Prostaglandins, Corticosteroids, Hormones, and Opiates are progressing well and should significantly enhance EUROAPI\u2019s growth profile by the end of the plan. A new project has been initiated in Elbeuf, combining substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and a significant decrease in water withdrawal. Overall, \u20ac19 million will be invested between 2024 and 2029 (approximately \u20ac8 million until 2027) to support the Group's commitments to the Paris Agreement and help reduce our GHG emissions. This initiative replaces the steam generation biomass boiler project that was initially planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational transformation and more efficient ways of working\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral initiatives have been launched throughout the year to transform the company into a more agile organization and to enhance ways of working across all areas. In 2024, a streamlined and centralized Procurement organization was established to help reduce both direct and indirect costs. Excluding the Brindisi and Haverhill sites, which are planned to be divested by the end of the plan, the headcount has been decreased across all functions. Approximately 180 positions have been removed out of the 550 targeted for reduction by the end of 2027.\n\nEnvironment \u2013 Social - Governance\n\nChange in Board of Directors\u2019 composition\n\nAt the March 3, 2025, Board meeting, Claire Giraut announced that she will be stepping down as Independent Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, effective at the Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 21, 2025. The Board of Directors acknowledged her decision and appointed Rodolfo Savitzky as the new Chair of the Audit Committee, effective May 21, 2025. The percentage of independent directors will remain compliant with the AFEP-MEDEF code.\n\nRodolfo Savitzky is a seasoned finance executive with extensive experience in the Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) industry and finance. He joined EUROAPI\u2019s Board as an Independent Director on September 1st, 2022, and became a member of the Audit Committee in January 2023.\n\nEmmanuel Blin, Chair of the Board, and the Directors of EUROAPI would like to express their sincere gratitude to Claire Giraut for her guidance and active contributions to the Board.\n\nESG Roadmap\n\nCommitments Initiatives 2024 score Accelerate innovation for environmental sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100% sites ISO14001/50001 certification 100% ~ 100% sites with purchased electricity from renewable sources 83% (100% since January 2025) -42% of CO2 emissions reduction (vs. 2022) by 2030 (scope 1&2) \u2013 Objective revised in 2024 -13% Create a safe and multicultural workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30% women in the Extended Leadership Team (ELT) 34.2% LTI \u2013 Lost Time Injury frequency rate to 1.5 by 2025 3.1 TRI \u2013 Total Recordable Injury frequency rate to 2.5 by 2025 4.6 Uphold best-in-class corporate governance\n\n\n\n\n\n100% completion of code of ethics and compliance training 95.9% 100% completion of anti-corruption trainings (3 training), among the functions at risks 96.7%\n\nThe LTI (Lost Time Injury) frequency and TRI (Total Recordable Injury) frequency rates did not meet the targets of 1.5 and 2.5, respectively, set for 2025. Our injury indicators were affected by a few minor accidents (such as stair falls or back injuries) that resulted in situations where employees could not return to physical activity for a more extended period than in 2023, which has impacted the severity rate. Actions have been implemented to enhance the safety of our employees, including a new accident prevention plan and the roll-out of the LEX project (Learning from Experience) to improve knowledge sharing, collaboration, and accident investigation.\n\nDecarbonization targets for 2030, aligned with the Paris Agreement SBTi commitment\n\nTo align with the 1.5\u00b0C trajectory, the Group has set new, more ambitious 2030 decarbonization targets and committed to SBTi. The revised targets are\n\n42% GHG emissions reduction for scope 1 and scope 2 by 2030 (vs. 2022)\n\n25% GHG emissions reduction for scope 3 by 2030 (vs. 2022)\n\nCarbon neutrality in 2050\n\n\n\n\n\nAmended contractual commercial terms with Sanofi\n\nIn February 2024, Sanofi and EUROAPI agreed on several revisions of the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement signed in October 2021. These revisions include:\n\nThe cancellation of the mutual performance clause that required notably EUROAPI to retrocede to Sanofi a portion of the fixed and variable cost savings realized on APIs sold to Sanofi annually\n\nPrice increases on five selected APIs\n\nThe evolution of the pass-through clause for key raw materials and solvents, with full compensation by Sanofi in case of an above 20% price increase\n\nThe narrowing of the Price-Volume corridor, an annual compensation mechanism protecting both parties from annual revenue fluctuation\n\nShortened payment terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther amendments were agreed as part of the financing of FOCUS-27 plan, including secured volumes for Sevelamer. These revisions are Regulated Agreements pursuant to the French Commercial Code and will be submitted to the next Annual General Meeting on 21 May 2025.\n\nFY 2025 Guidance operational and financial main drivers\n\nEUROAPI full-year guidance was built on the following assumptions:\n\nNet Sales are expected to range from slightly decreasing to steady. This should notably be driven by solid growth in API sales to clients other than Sanofi, particularly in HP APIs, and Opiates, and by double-digit growth in sales from early-phase CDMO, offset by continued reduced API demand from Sanofi, particularly for Sevelamer, a slight decrease in Vitamin B12 sales, and the discontinuation of several pre-carve-out mature CMO projects.\n\n2025 sales will also include a positive impact of the build-up of strategic inventories by customers affected by the discontinuation of the 13 APIs.\n\nThe Core EBITDA margin improvement to a 7% to 9% range should be supported by further industrial efficiencies, enhanced procurement, and cost-effectiveness across all functions. EBITDA should be impacted by further exceptional items (including idle costs), though to a lesser extent than in 2024.\n\nCash flow before financing should include ongoing improvement of working capital, although slower than in 2024, and the positive impact of Sanofi\u2019s investment in securing future product capacities (\u20ac36 million for the full year). The 2025 CAPEX should be slightly lower than the 2024 level as a result of the optimization of maintenance CAPEX.\n\n\n\nGlossary and definition of non-GAAP indicators\n\nNet Sales at Constant Exchange Rate (CER)\n\nFY 2024 sales at FY 2023 Exchange rates\n\nOn a comparable basis\n\nAt constant perimeter and constant exchange rates\n\nEBITDA and Core EBITDA\n\nEBITDA corresponds to operating income (loss) restated for depreciation and amortization and net impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nCore EBITDA thus corresponds to EBITDA restated for restructuring costs and similar items (excluding depreciation and write-downs), allocations net of reversals of unutilized provisions for environmental risks, and other items not representative of the Group\u2019s current operating performance or related to the effects of acquisitions or disposals.\n\nCash Flow before Financing activities\n\nCash Flow before Financing activities corresponds to the sum of Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Cash Flow from Investing Activities as presented in the consolidated statement of Cash Flow.\n\nMonths on Hand (MOH)\n\nNet Inventory value at the of the period divided by Net Sales\n\nNew clients\n\nClients representing at least \u20ac50 thousands of net sales on the year.\n\nCross Selling\n\nSelling a different product to an existing client that is already buying one or several products from EUROAPI.\n\nEarly-stage and Late-stage projects\n\nEarly-stage: pre-clinical, phase 1, and phase 2\n\nLate-stage: phase3, in validation, and commercial\n\nPresentation of 2024 results\n\nEUROAPI\u2019s management will hold an audio webcast presentation (04 March 2025) at 8 :30 a.m. CET.

Drug manufacturers, insurers, economists and diabetics took notice. It had the potential to disrupt the market, bring down drug costs and save patients\u2019 lives.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom promised a \u201c2024 delivery\u201d for the insulin.\n\nIt still is not here, and the American Diabetes Association says the lag is hurting diabetics who need a low-cost option for the medicine.\n\n\u201cWe are more than a year behind schedule with no end in sight,\u201d said Christine Fallabel, regional director for government affairs for the association, during a recent Senate oversight hearing on the initiative.\n\nDuring the hearing, representatives for the Newsom administration said they could not provide a timeline for when the state\u2019s insulin would be for sale. Fallabel said Californians could be waiting until 2030.\n\nMore than 3.5 million Californians have diabetes, and insulin is a life-saving part of their disease management and treatment.\n\nCivica, Inc., the nonprofit drug manufacturer contracted to develop five types of insulin for the state, has not yet started clinical trials or applied for drug approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CalMatters reported last month.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association expects further delays in the insulin project, known as CalRx, given the length of clinical trials and unforeseen challenges that are typical of the regulatory process. Multiple drug manufacturing experts told CalMatters that the FDA\u2019s drug review process takes a year \u201cif nothing goes wrong.\u201d A clinical trial could also add another year or more.\n\n\u201cBased on the status that CalRx presented (during the hearing), we expect a significant delay in their timeline for when insulin will be available through the program,\u201d Fallabel told CalMatters.\n\nCivica did not participate in the hearing but previously told CalMatters that the company has started manufacturing insulin, which is one of the steps that must be completed before submitting for FDA approval.\n\n\u201cWe want to be careful about setting expectations,\u201d said Allan Coukell, chief government affairs officer at Civica. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual in a complicated program that stuff happens and you have to adapt.\u201d\n\nDuring the oversight hearing, Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the state Department of Health Access and Information, said the pace of the CalRx insulin development has been slower than the state anticipated but \u201cnot outside of industry norms.\u201d Landsberg\u2019s department is tasked with leading the insulin initiative.\n\n\u201cI wish I could sit here today and say we have a date certain,\u201d Lansberg said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announces a partnership with Civica Rx to provide insulin to Californians for $30 for 10 milliliters, which he said was as little as one-tenth of the current cost. Photo by Ringo Chiu, Sipa USA via Reuters\n\nNewsom rejected cap on insulin costs\n\nNewsom unveiled the $100-million insulin initiative as a radical way to disrupt the pharmaceutical marketplace, where the price of insulin nearly tripled between 2012 and 2021, according to the Health Care Cost Institute. The goal was to increase competition in an area where three manufacturers \u2014 Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi \u2014 have controlled the market for decades.\n\nHalf of the state money would go to Civica, Inc. to manufacture both long- and fast-acting insulins for California in its Virginia plant. The other half would be used to help open a manufacturing plant in California. The insulin would be sold for $30 per 10 milliliter vial or $55 for a box of five 3 milliliter pens.\n\nRecent analyses suggest that the average out-of-pocket spending for a month\u2019s supply of insulin is $58, although some people pay far more than that particularly if they are uninsured. Some manufacturers have also independently capped costs at $35 per month.\n\nLandsberg said during the hearing there was no update on the manufacturing facility.\n\nAt the same time, Newsom has vetoed bills that would have capped out-of-pocket spending on insulin and regulated pharmacy benefit managers, the mediators between drug manufacturers and insurers that determine which drugs are covered for beneficiaries. Evidence suggests these benefit managers are partially responsible for inflated drug prices.\n\nIn veto messages for those bills, Newsom cited CalRx as part of his reasoning for rejecting the health care measures.\n\n\u201cI think it sometimes sends a message that CalRx is like the complete solution to everything when it comes to the cost of health care,\u201d said Sen. Scott Wiener, chair of the Senate budget committee, during the hearing. \u201cThat is absolutely not the case.\u201d\n\nWiener, a San Francisco Democrat, authored the most recent attempts to cap patient spending on insulin at $35 per month and regulate pharmacy benefit managers, both of which passed nearly unanimously but were vetoed by the governor.\n\nWiener said that he supports the CalRx program but it is not the \u201conly solution to driving down drug costs.\u201d He has reintroduced versions of both bills.\n\nInsulin manufacturers dropping prices\n\nCalifornia\u2019s efforts to make insulin more affordable have fallen behind other states and the federal government.\n\nLast year, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi dropped their insulin prices between 65% to 80%. Industry experts attribute the drop to a Medicaid rule change linking drug prices to inflation, meaning the drug companies would have owed the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars because of insulin\u2019s high prices.\n\nBut those price drops haven\u2019t helped everyone, Fallabel said. An individual\u2019s insurance benefit design as well as high deductibles mean many people still can\u2019t afford their insulin. In a recent survey, the association found that about 16% of insulin using adults ration the medication because of cost.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association is advocating for California to institute an out-of-pocket cost cap for insulin in addition to completing the CalRx program.\n\nTwenty-five states and the District of Columbia have implemented monthly price caps for insulin, and some Medicare users have costs capped at $35 monthly.\n\nSupported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

Caused by an H1N1 virus that emerged from pigs, likely in Mexico, it spread quickly around the globe.\n\nThe world got lucky in 2009. Doubly so. The \u201cswine flu\u201d virus was distinct enough from previous H1N1 viruses that it could cause a pandemic, but it had enough genetic similarities to viruses that had circulated for decades that many people had some immune defenses, which blunted its severity.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe other truly lucky break was that multiple flu vaccines targeting H1N1 were already licensed in the U.S., so the Food and Drug Administration could fast-track approval of pandemic vaccines. That tool, used regularly when seasonal flu shots require updating, sidestepped the need to run a series of clinical trials that could have added as much as a year to the race to get vaccines into arms.\n\nEmergency response planners in the federal government have long hoped to use the same approach if the dangerous H5N1 bird flu virus ever triggers a pandemic. But news that the Trump administration is reconsidering a government-funded study of an experimental H5N1 vaccine is generating fears that it may be on the chopping block, and that could take the fast-track option off the table, at least for one of the manufacturers of messenger RNA vaccines \u2014 the fastest vaccines to make and the easiest to mass produce.\n\nAt a time of elevated concerns about the potential for an H5N1 pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed that it is reevaluating a nearly $600 million contract issued to Cambridge, Mass.-based Moderna by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a division of HHS. The contract, signed in the final days of the Biden administration, is designed to help Moderna develop and test the safety and efficacy of vaccines to protect against five subtypes of influenza that could prompt pandemics, including H5N1. The review of the contract was first reported by Bloomberg News.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile it is crucial that the U.S. Department and Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration\u2019s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production,\u201d Andrew Nixon, the HHS director of communications, said in an email when asked about the decision.\n\nThe swipe at the previous administration aside, there has been no specific rationale disclosed for the reevaluation. While it is common for new administrations to review some of the spending plans of their predecessors, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s distrust of vaccines and the companies that make them has sparked concerns this could be a prelude for cancelling a contract experts believe is critical to the country\u2019s efforts to be ready for a bird flu pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think the government\u2019s investment in alternative vaccine technologies that could be brought to bear rapidly in a major public health emergency is very important,\u201d said Jesse Goodman, a former head of the FDA division that regulates vaccines, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and later the agency\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cI think funding those large-scale studies was a really wise decision.\u201d\n\nMost flu vaccines are currently made using a decades-old approach where viruses are grown in hen\u2019s eggs, then inactivated \u2014 a process that can sometimes result in mutations that undermine the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness. Production is slow and reliant on huge quantities of eggs \u2014 the supply of which could be threatened by outbreaks of H5N1 or other bird flu viruses, as is happening now. Wide-scale outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry are occurring in multiple parts of the country, forcing the culling of flocks and driving egg costs to historic highs.\n\nGoodman said developing flu vaccines made with approaches other than eggs is key to being able to mount a rapid response when the next influenza pandemic occurs. \u201cI would say the biggest priority would be to get an approved alternative technology flu vaccine to use in the pandemic. We need that.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith the current modes of production, there isn\u2019t sufficient capacity to rapidly produce enough doses to meet global demand in a pandemic. \u201cSo that\u2019s why the need for alternative technologies and mRNA is one of them,\u201d said Goodman, who is now director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University.\n\nStudies have shown that vaccines made to protect against H5N1 do not trigger a strong immune response, unless the dose of vaccine used is very high, or an adjuvant \u2014 a compound that amplifies the response to the vaccine \u2014 is used. Even then, each person would require at least two doses of vaccine, complicating the job of getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible in what could be a devastating event.\n\nRelated Story Finland to offer bird flu vaccine to select groups of people, a possible global first\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic showed the importance of the mRNA vaccine platform, which had never before been used. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, and Moderna, were able to develop, test, scale, and deliver vaccines within 11 months of the posting of the genetic sequence of the virus, using the mRNA platform. Though public distrust of this type of vaccine has grown, fueled by baseless rumors questioning mRNA\u2019s safety, the fact remains that the production speed this platform offers will be needed again, if H5N1 succeeds in transitioning from a bird virus that occasionally infects humans to one that spreads easily among us.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe the timeline for delivery of mRNA pandemic flu vaccine would be shorter still, if the makers of mRNA vaccines can license H5N1 vaccines before a pandemic. That\u2019s because all the trials to determine if the vaccine triggered an adequate immune response and to generate the safety data the FDA would want to see would be done in advance.\n\n\u201cI suspect because mRNA flu vaccines are a relatively new technology, that for a pandemic strain type like H5 \u2026 they\u2019d probably want to see a substantial safety database,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nLaying that groundwork would mean that if an H5N1 pandemic started, manufacturers could quickly update the version of the virus the vaccine targeted and get expedited authorization under the same FDA rule manufacturers use when they update seasonal shots.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of preparation,\u201d said Phil Krause, a virologist and a former deputy director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research and Review. \u201cBy creating that advanced safety data, we can give this vaccine with more confidence to people initially.\u201d\n\nDoing the preparatory work doesn\u2019t mean safety studies wouldn\u2019t be needed as the vaccines were being used, \u201cbut it gives you that head start,\u201d Krause said. Among other things, it would allow regulators to make decisions based on safety data from thousands of recipients of mRNA influenza vaccines, Goodman noted.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go into an emergency where you\u2019ve had thousands of people who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine, so you have that degree of confidence? I would think RFK Jr. would want that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to broadening the number of potential suppliers of pandemic vaccines, having one or more mRNA options would be a hedge against unforeseen outcomes \u2014 for instance, if the egg-based vaccines did not work as well as expected, or a safety signal arose about possible side effects associated with their use, Krause said.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how mRNA vaccines can be used in this setting is very important,\u201d he said, adding \u201cif we don\u2019t have this additional option \u2026 all of our eggs are basically in one basket of egg-produced vaccines.\u201d\n\nDoing this advance work could help assuage concerns some people might have if they were again presented with a new vaccine that was perceived to have been developed in a hurry, said Luciana Borio, a former director for medical and biodefense preparedness policy at the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a situation where we\u2019re in a data-free zone and having to make educated guesses when it involves the health of so many people. We don\u2019t want to be in a situation where people don\u2019t have confidence in a vaccine that is forced through because we haven\u2019t done the work ahead of time,\u201d said Borio,\n\nwho is now a partner at ARCH Venture Partners and a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBorio, alluding to Kennedy\u2019s promise to bring \u201cradical transparency\u201d to the operation of HHS, said it is important that the department explain \u201cexactly what the rationale is\u201d for reviewing the Moderna contract, to \u201cmake sure that it\u2019s not just because there is this belief that vaccines are not important or that vaccines can be made in real time\u201d from a standing start.\n\nUsing the fast-track approval process requires there to be a licensed vaccine for that specific subtype of flu. At this point, there are no licensed mRNA flu vaccines of any type. True, both Pfizer and Moderna have been working on seasonal flu shots. But breaking into the seasonal flu market poses challenges for both these companies \u2014 there are already established manufacturers who produce adequate supply for the seasonal market demand, which has been declining in the post-Covid era.\n\nThe BARDA funding that is currently in suspended animation is to help Moderna do the advanced studies that would be required to license an H5N1 vaccine. It\u2019s work that the company would be unlikely to be willing or even able to do without federal help, given that there is no guarantee there will ever be a need for H5N1 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t make things that may not be used,\u201d said Kathryn Edwards, a retired pediatrician who has studied vaccines for decades.\n\nThere are currently three licensed H5N1 vaccines on the books, made by GSK, CSL Seqirus, and Sanofi. The GSK and Sanofi vaccines are made in eggs; the CSL vaccine, Audenz, is produced using viruses grown in cell culture. While this platform doesn\u2019t rely on eggs, the requirement to grow large amounts of virus means its production time isn\u2019t as quick as mRNA vaccines, which do not require growing viruses.\n\nAll three companies have received substantial BARDA assistance in their H5N1 work. The vaccines they have tested and licensed are not commercially available, though the U.S. government has some supplies in the National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSome other countries have also bought doses for stockpiling, or to vaccinate at-risk agricultural workers. Last year Finland bought some H5N1 vaccine to offer to workers on fur farms that have experienced outbreaks of the virus. Earlier this month, Canada announced it was purchasing a half-million doses of H5N1 vaccine for a similar purpose.\n\nStimulating the preparatory work to develop the medical tools that would be needed in emergencies \u2014 pandemics, outbreaks of rare diseases, or possible bioterror attacks \u2014 is the reason BARDA was created, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cBARDA is there to prepare us for pandemics, so that \u2026 pilot lots can be made \u2026 these vaccines can be tested and made and then they can be scaled up and licensed,\u201d she said, adding that if the Moderna contract is canceled \u201cit could be a very big blow.\u201d",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) stands against other best immunology stocks to buy now.\n\nThe Growing Market for Immune System Treatments\n\nImmunology is a rapidly advancing field with significant potential for growth, especially in the realm of biotech and pharmaceutical companies. As the global demand for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases, cancer immunotherapies, and vaccines continues to rise, immunology stocks present lucrative investment opportunities. The market for immunotherapy medications is expected to rise at a high pace, from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion in 2033. The rise in chronic illnesses like infections, autoimmune diseases, and various forms of cancer worldwide is what is causing the surge.\n\nThe prevalence of cancer in particular is rising worldwide. In its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, the American Cancer Society has brought attention to the rising global cancer burden. About 9.7 million individuals lost their lives to cancer in 2022 alone, while an estimated 20 million new cases were identified. About 35 million new cases of cancer are predicted to occur annually by 2050, increasing the need for cutting-edge therapies like immunotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy is a viable substitute for conventional treatments, and as research progresses, its uses are growing. It can be used alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy or other treatments for a variety of cancer types. A form of non-specific immunotherapy called immunomodulating drugs aids in enhancing the body\u2019s immune system\u2019s capacity to identify and combat cancer cells.\n\nInvestments and Advancements in Immunotherapy Treatments\n\nLeading pharmaceutical companies are also making significant investments in research and development to increase the variety of immunotherapy medications available due to the rising demand for treatments. These consist of monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T cell treatments, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapy is being used in novel ways and is poised to transform cancer treatment and other medical fields by combining several therapies and customizing care for each patient.\n\nMedical breakthroughs and regulatory approvals, especially in the US, propelled North America to the top of the worldwide immunotherapy medication market in 2023, accounting for about 48.19% of total revenue. The region\u2019s expertise in cutting-edge treatments including tumor-agnostic medicines is highlighted by the FDA\u2019s approval of immunotherapy for tumors with particular genetic features, regardless of origin.",

When observing literature trends over the past twenty years, the amount of rare disease literature being published each year has more than tripled (Figure 1).1\n\nFollowing the current trend, there has been a significant rise in the number of documents mentioning both artificial intelligence (AI) and rare diseases. For documents published in 2014 this number was just six; in 2024 it was 157 (Figure 2).1\n\nRegionally, the US is dominating rare disease research. Over the past decade, the country has increased the output of any other country by over fifty percent (Figure 3).1\n\nThe rare disease therapy landscape in the UK\n\nIn the UK however, challenges remain when it comes to providing rare disease patients with the medicines they need.\n\nThe Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) recently reported on a survey of its member companies conducted in collaboration with the BioIndustry Association (BIA).\n\nThe UK Department of Health summarised the findings on the UK Rare Diseases Framework Board and Forum. One question enquired about the responding company\u2019s rare disease pipeline and which proportion of the medicines were planned for launch in the UK. Data showed that out of the 18 companies that responded, 11 reported that they expected to launch less than 75 percent of their rare disease pipeline in the UK over the next five years, ABPI explained.\n\nABPI, Britain\u2019s pharma industry body added: \u201cMedicines policy over the past two decades has locked the UK medicines market into managed, long-term decline\u2026 Cost effectiveness thresholds in England are amongst the lowest in the world and have declined around 50 percent in real terms over the last twenty years.\n\n\u201cUnless we fix rocketing VPAG rates and improve recognition of value in NICE\u2019s evaluation methods, UK rare disease patients face an increasing risk of not getting access to new medicines, which often represent their only treatment option\u201d.\n\nRare disease clinical trials\n\nWhile 300 million people worldwide live with rare diseases, they affect a small number of individuals, making it difficult to find eligible participants for clinical trials.2\n\nTo overcome the challenges of patient enrolment when there is widespread geographic distribution of eligible participants, key solution to address this includes optimising investigator site selection. Moreover, choosing trial sites based on proven enrolment capability means trials are more efficient and delays are limited.2\n\nRegulatory compliance remains stringent in rare disease trials, despite limited patient numbers. However, sponsors can improve patient recruitment, optimise study design, and accelerate trial timelines while adhering to regulatory requirements.2\n\nThis can be achieved in several ways, for instance:\n\n\u2022 Using advanced analytics, real-world data insights, and evidence-based investigator site selection strategies\n\n\u2022 Using advanced trial design models to optimise study parameters to align with regulatory expectations while maintaining patient-centricity.\n\nAs each patient in a rare disease clinical trial has unique requirements, selecting standardised study endpoints and inclusion/exclusion criteria can be challenging.2\n\nan adaptive, data-driven approach [is required to ensure] that rare disease trials are both scientifically robust and operationally feasible, ultimately leading to faster development and approval of life-changing therapies\u201d\n\nResearch shows that rare disease Phase II protocols average 4.3 substantial amendments, nearly 65 percent more than the average for non-rare diseases. In Phase III, rare disease protocols average 3.8 substantial amendments, 19 percent higher than non-rare diseases.3\n\nTo minimise the needs for protocol amendments, understanding patient heterogeneity can enable more precise clinical trial design. Additionally, refining inclusion criteria and can be achieved more effectively through development of a detailed Digital Patient Profile.2\n\nIn summary, these approaches require an adaptive, data-driven approach, ensuring that rare disease trials are both scientifically robust and operationally feasible, ultimately leading to faster development and approval of life-changing therapies.2\n\nWith a pipeline including treatments for various rare anaemias and thrombocytopenias, alongside recent approvals, Sanofi is progressing with its efforts to address unmet needs in the rare disease treatment landscape.\n\nHere, the company\u2019s Head of Rare Diseases for Central South Europe, discusses major developments in the sector and what is needed to address current gaps. She highlights the importance of cross-collaboration, which technologies are shaping the future of rare disease therapies, and more.\n\nWhat has been the biggest development in the rare disease treatment landscape over the past year and what could be done to accelerate this progress?\n\nThe past year has been a time of intense change in the treatment of rare diseases, with a key element being the rapid development of gene and RNA therapies. These innovative approaches allow healthcare professionals to precisely target the genetic mutations that cause many rare diseases.\n\nAt the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasingly important tool in the development of targeted and enzyme-based therapies, resulting in better treatment outcomes and personalisation of therapies. The increased availability of reimbursed drugs should also not be overlooked, as a result of increased budgets and a better understanding of patients\u2019 needs.\n\nParticularly in Europe, it is equally important to increase investment in biotechnology and build stronger cooperation between science and industry for the benefit of European citizens\u201d\n\nFrom my perspective, the biggest development in rare diseases has been the tremendous increase of awareness around them! This required hard work by all the key stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, the scientific community and the pharma industry, to increase visibility and understanding not only of the underlying disease mechanisms but also of the disease burden for patients and caregivers.\n\nHowever, greater progress requires action on many fronts. First and foremost, patients suffering from rare diseases need more flexible regulations for clinical trials and more efficient drug approval processes.\n\nParticularly in Europe, it is equally important to increase investment in biotechnology and build stronger cooperation between science and industry for the benefit of European citizens. It is also crucial to create public-private partnerships that will enable faster deployment of innovative therapies; we must highlight the continued unmet need for rare disease patients.\n\nMost significant challenges in the rare disease sector? What solutions should pharma professionals focus on?\n\nThe most pressing challenge in our sector is undoubtedly bridging the gap between scientific breakthroughs and patient access, but this is particularly vital in rare diseases. Pharma professionals should focus on several key areas, including partnering with regulatory authorities and keeping focused on patient benefits.\n\nThere is a need to invest heavily in real-world evidence generation [to support rare disease sector]\u201d\n\nThere is a need to invest heavily in real-world evidence generation. This means developing robust data collection methods post-approval to demonstrate the long-term value and effectiveness of novel therapies in everyday clinical practice.\n\nBy analysing vast datasets of genetic and molecular information, AI can uncover novel drug candidates or repurpose existing treatments for rare conditions. Machine learning models are already being applied to predict protein structures, facilitating the development of targeted therapies for conditions with limited treatment options.\n\nLastly, fostering collaborative ecosystems with regulators, payers and patient advocacy groups is crucial. We need to move towards value-based pricing models and innovative reimbursement strategies that ensure sustainable access to life-changing treatments. Science is making miracles in rare diseases treatment but society needs access to them; the health sector ecosystem must allow humanity to benefit from science.\n\nWhat could improve collaboration between industry experts and regulators regarding rare disease therapies?\n\nEarly regulatory involvement in clinical trials and collaboration with research institutions would enhance adaptability. Expanding accelerated assessment programmes, digitalising approvals (eg, the clinical trials information system (CTIS)) and aligning EMA/FDA requirements will also streamline processes.\n\nTo ensure fruitful collaboration, we need education, transparency and ongoing dialogue. Training and educational programmes for both sides, focused on the latest developments, build common understanding\u201d\n\nEffective collaboration between industry experts and regulators in rare disease therapy development requires a unified European regulatory framework for simultaneous therapy registration across multiple markets.\n\nSpecifically, strengthening cooperation between Rare Disease Expert Centers (OECRs) at national and international levels can help create common guidelines. The important element is to have a common ground of understanding that both industry\u2019s and regulators\u2019 mission is to serve patients and develop mutual agreements that deliver a better quality of life to the population.\n\nTo ensure fruitful collaboration, we need education, transparency and ongoing dialogue. Training and educational programmes for both sides, focused on the latest developments, build common understanding. Joint educational initiatives for patient organisations bring regulatory processes closer.\n\nEngaging patient organisations and industry stakeholders helps to identify clinical needs and drives innovation. Rapid consultations and initiatives like the Life Science Strategy promote knowledge sharing, strengthen research translation, and accelerate modern therapy availability.\n\nIn the next few years, what do you anticipate will shift the treatment landscape for rare disorders in Europe the most, and why?\n\nLooking ahead, I believe several key factors will dramatically reshape the rare disease treatment landscape in Europe. Firstly, the continued acceleration of gene and cell therapies will be transformative. As these technologies advance, treatment will shift from symptom management to targeting root genetic causes.\n\nseveral key factors will dramatically reshape the rare disease treatment landscape in Europe. Firstly, the continued acceleration of gene and cell therapies will be transformative\u201d\n\nSecondly, the integration of AI and big data will revolutionise diagnostics and drug development. AI-driven platforms will enable faster, more accurate diagnoses, crucial for rare diseases where time is often critical, and big data will speed up the discovery of new drug targets and repurposing therapies.\n\nThirdly, enhanced collaboration and data sharing across European countries will be vital. Initiatives like the European Rare Disease Platform5 and increased investment in cross-border clinical trials will facilitate the pooling of resources and expertise, leading to faster progress.\n\nFinally, a growing focus on patient-centric care and regulatory flexibility will improve access to innovative therapies. Regulators are increasingly recognising the unique challenges of rare diseases and are adapting their frameworks to expedite approvals.\n\nAnything else you would like to share?\n\nI would like to emphasise the importance of sustained public awareness and education about rare diseases. While scientific advances are crucial, they can only truly benefit patients when combined with public understanding and support.\n\nProgress in rare disease therapies is not just about scientific breakthroughs \u2013 it is a testament to the power of collaboration. From basic research to clinical trials and regulatory approvals, this is a collaborative effort that requires the dedication of scientists, clinicians, industry professionals and patient advocates.\n\nAbout the interviewee Christina Gkousgkouni is the Head of Rare Diseases for Central South Europe at Sanofi.

Please visit novavax.com and LinkedIn for more information.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe Company has used a non-GAAP financial measure in this press release, which is Adjusted Licensing, Royalties and Other Revenue. Non-GAAP financial measures refer to financial information adjusted from financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The Company believes that the presentation of this adjusted financial measure is useful to investors as it provides additional information on comparisons between periods by including certain items that affect overall comparability. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial measure for business planning purposes and to consider underlying trends of its business and believes presenting this measure also provides useful information to investors and others for understanding and evaluating trends in the Company's expenses in the same manner as the Company's management. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from similar measures reported by other companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures. The Company is unable to reconcile this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because the Company is reliant on Sanofi sales forecasts for certain revenue categories, which are not available.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nStatements herein relating to the future of Novavax, its mission; its corporate strategy and operating plans, objectives and prospects; its value drivers and near-term priorities, its partnerships, including expectations with respect to potential royalties, milestones, and cost reimbursement, and plans for additional potential partnering activities; its expectations regarding manufacturing capacity, timing, production and delivery for its COVID-19 vaccine; the transition of the lead responsibility for commercialization of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine to Sanofi beginning with the 2025-2026 vaccination season; the development of Novavax's clinical and preclinical product candidates and innovation expansion opportunities, including with respect to new Matrix formulations; the conduct, timing and potential results from clinical trials and other preclinical studies; scope, timing and outcome of future and pending regulatory filings and actions, including the potential BLA approval for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine; full year 2025 financial guidance and revenue framework; negotiations regarding Novavax's existing advance purchase agreements; and Novavax's future financial or business performance.

            "content": "Paris: Sanofi has announced that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has approved Sarclisa, in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nOlivier Nataf, Global Head, Oncology said, \u201cIn recent years, new multiple myeloma cases have increased steadily in Japan and other Asian-Pacific nations, creating a need for new treatment approaches, particularly in the front-line setting. While Sarclisa-based combinations have been approved for relapsed or refractory patients in Japan, this approval represents the first indication for certain newly diagnosed patients. We are pleased to offer physicians an important new option for their patients earlier in the treatment journey, building upon our continued commitment to advancing innovative oncology treatments in difficult-to-treat hematologic malignancies around the world.\u201d\n\nIn Japan, Sarclisa was launched in August 2020 and has been approved for four different treatment regimens (in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, as monotherapy, in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, or in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma). In addition, Sarclisa has front-line approvals in the EU and the US. In the Asia Pacific region, Sarclisa combination regimens were also recently approved by the National Medical Products Administration in China, specifically Sarclisa-VRd in NDMM patients who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, as well as Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including in the US, EU, Japan, and China, across multiple indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in the US, EU and Japan in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u2265two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US, EU, UK, and China, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. This combination is also approved in Japan for patients with NDMM.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous (SC) administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. In January 2024, Sanofi reported positive results from the IRAKLIA phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa SC formulation administered via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with Pd compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa in patients with R/R MM. In December 2024, additional positive results from the program, including the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy in transplant-eligible NDMM patients, were also presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.",

It was nerve wracking trying to navigate middle school and what my day was going to look like with a recently diagnosed disease where I didn't know if I was going to have symptoms.\u201d\n\nNoah\u2019s story reflects the all-too-common experience associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). Characterized by persistent inflammation, IBD can lead to an accumulation of scar tissue in the intestinal wall, known as fibrosis, which may cause narrowing and obstruction that often requires hospitalization and surgery.1 Over time, this damage can increase the risk of other serious conditions, such as colon cancer, and can eventually require surgical resections of the intestines and use of an ostomy bag, further exacerbating the impact on quality of life.1\n\n\u201cI've been on a lot of different medications, and there was always hope when I was put on a new one,\u201d said Randa, a patient living with UC.

The atmosphere was tense as presiding judge Ronny Thomas opened the first hearing on the merits concerning second medical use at the UPC (ACT_597355/2023 and CC_24999/2024, UPC_CFI_505/2023).\n\nIn many ways, the scene embodied what generations of lawyers had imagined a UPC hearing would look like before the court began: high stakes, copious lawyers and patent attorneys from different countries, and English as the language of proceedings.\n\nPrevious success for Sanofi\n\nThe race to develop cholesterol-lowering drugs based on PCSK9 inhibitors has been fierce among major pharmaceutical companies. Both plaintiff Sanofi, which partnered with Regeneron, and defendant Amgen were among the first to develop marketable products. In summer 2024, Sanofi and Regeneron already prevailed at the UPC in a case concerning patents for the same drugs. The Munich central division declared Amgen\u2019s EP 3 666 797 invalid for the entire UPC area.\n\nHowever, at this week\u2019s hearing at the D\u00fcsseldorf local division, Sanofi and Regeneron had sued Amgen for infringement of Regeneron\u2019s second medical use patent EP 3 536 712. Amgen had filed a counterclaim for revocation. The court heard both cases together.\n\nThe patent concerns methods for reducing lipoprotein(a) levels by administering a PCSK9 inhibitor. Much of the hearing focused on how standard it was to measure LP(a) levels in clinical research and patient treatment. Regeneron\u2019s second medical use patent seeks to claim the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on a specific lipoprotein, Lp(a).\n\nExtensive legal teams\n\nNiels H\u00f6lder from Munich firm Hoffmann Eitle and Daniel Wise from UK firm Carpmaels & Ransford led arguments for Sanofi.\n\nThe Carpmaels team included Agathe Michel-de Cazotte, Emily Nikoli\u0107, Ekaterina Langford, Hiske Roos, Elizabeth Taylor, and Hadi Godazgar. From Hoffmann Eitle the team comprised Mike Gruber and Michael Pfeifer. J\u00f6rk Zwicker led the patent attorney team from ZSP.\n\nFor Amgen, Johannes Heselberger from Bardehle Pagenberg in Munich and Koen Bijvank from Brinkhof in Amsterdam presented the defence. Bijvank and Heselberger had already led the earlier UPC proceedings in Munich along with Daan de Lange from Brinkhof and Bardehle Pagenberg\u2019s Axel Berger.\n\nIn addition, the extensive team included patent attorneys from df-mp around Ulrich D\u00f6rries. Will James and Trevor Crosse from Osborne Clarke and Lauren Martin from Quinn Emanuel also played a role.\n\nThe bench comprised presiding judge Ronny Thomas, judge rapporteur B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Thom, LQJ Andr\u00e1s Kupecz and TQJ Xavier Dorland-Galliot.",

This milestone payment will be received in cash at the end of Q2 2025 as per the payment terms of the Licensing Agreement. The expected amount net of withholding tax to be received is around \u20ac8.5 million.\n\nOver the same period in 2023, revenues of \u20ac2.15 million reflected revenues related to feasibility studies on AdOral\u00ae, as well as services provided by Adocia under the collaboration with Tonghua Dongbao for conducting three studies in Europe on the BioChaperone\u00ae Combo project.\n\nNet Cash Position\n\nThe Company's cash position stood at \u20ac7.5 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to \u20ac13.0 million as of December 31, 2023. This position includes \u20ac2 million received from the private placement in March 2024 and \u20ac9.8 million from the use of the equity financing line signed in March 2024 with Vester Finance in the form of a PACEO1 (via the issuance of 1.35 million shares out of a maximum of 1.7 million shares set in the contract).\n\nThe cash burn related to activities for 2024 amounted to \u20ac16.2 million, compared to \u20ac14.5 million in 2023 (excluding financing). Adjusted for the positive impact of the 2023 Research Tax Credit (CIR) of \u20ac3.4 million, cash burn amounted to \u20ac19.6 million, down slightly by \u20ac0.8 million compared to last year.\n\nNet financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 impacts), consisting exclusively of state-guaranteed loans (PGE), amounted to \u20ac4.5 million as of December 31, 2024, down \u20ac0.7 million compared to September 30, 2024, following the resumption of repayments of the PGE in August 2024, with the loans\u2019 maturity remaining unchanged at the end of August 2026.\n\nThe cash position as of December 31, 2024, of \u20ac7.5 million allows the Company to fund its activities until the end of 2025 taking into account the Tonghua Dongbao $10 million milestone to be received at the end of Q2 2025, the receipt of the Research Tax Credit of \u20ac2.8 million, and considering the utilization of the PACEO signed in March 2024 with Vester Finance2, but does not consider other potential revenues generated by existing or future partnerships.\n\nPost-Period Event\n\nAs of today, the PACEO financing agreement with Vester Finance has now been completed.

The final dosing of the last Type 2 Diabetes patient was announced on December 12, 20243, triggering a $10 million payment to be received by Adocia at the end of Q2 2025. The last patient dosed in the Type 1 Diabetes study took place in January 2025, leading to the expected announcement of top-line results in mid-2025. Assuming successful Phase 3 results, Tonghua Dongbao plans on submitting Ultra-Rapid Insulin BioChaperone\u00ae Lispro for Chinese regulatory review in 2025. The granting of Marketing Authorization would lead to an additional milestone payment of $20 million and double-digit royalties on sales to Adocia.\n\nBioChaperone\u00ae GLP-1 \u2013 Amylin / BioChaperone\u00ae CagriSema\n\nThe preclinical development of BioChaperone\u00ae CagriSema, which offers a stable combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide in the same delivery chamber, continues as planned. Data generated to date is promising regarding its commercial and manufacturing benefits over the combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide currently being developed by Novo Nordisk which requires each peptide to be in separate chambers, of a single-use pen device. BioChaperone\u00ae CagriSema is expected to offer significant manufacturing advantages, such as enabling it to be included in existing multi-use pen platforms, allowing for four weekly injections.\n\nNovo Nordisk is conducting twelve Phase 3 clinical trials with its dual-chamber CagriSema, in over 15,000 people, including a 400-patient long-term efficacy study that was initiated in February 20254.\n\nM1Pram \u2013 Ongoing exclusive discussions with Sanofi\n\nM1Pram is a fixed combination of insulin and amylin analogs aimed at addressing the unmet medical need of obesity in insulin-dependent individuals.\n\nA Phase 2b clinical program in the United States, involving 140 patients with Type 1 Diabetes and a BMI5>30kg/m\u00b2, is in preparation.\n\nAdocia has completed the manufacturing of clinical batches. The launch of the clinical trial is conditional on entering an agreement for its financing.\n\nAdocia granted Sanofi an exclusive right to negotiate a partnership on M1Pram for \u20ac10 million6. This exclusive right remains in place with ongoing discussions for a global partnership.\n\nAdoShell\u00ae Islets\n\nThe AdoShell\u00ae platform, an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell therapy, is attracting interest from potential pharmaceutical partners. The preclinical development continues and preparatory work to submit a clinical trial application to the regulator, remains on track for 2025.\n\nAdocia continues to provide updates about AdoShell\u00ae to the medical community and recently presented data at the EPITA Symposium, in January 2025, in Austria. The project attracted support and interest from physicians involved in pancreatic islets transplantation. Additionally, the AdoShell\u00ae Islets program has been selected for various presentations at the following congresses:\n\n- H.C. Wainwright 3rd Annual Cell Therapy Virtual Conference (February 25, 2025)\n\n- ATTD 2025 conference (18th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes, 19-22 March, 2025, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)\n\n- SFD 2025 congress (Congress of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone du Diab\u00e8te, April 1-4, 2025, Paris, France)\n\n- ISCT 2025 (International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy, May 7-10, 2025, New Orleans, U.S.A.)\n\nAdOral\u00ae\n\nAdocia has developed an oral delivery technology for peptides, enabling the transition from injectable to oral forms, and has achieved promising preclinical results on semaglutide (GLP-1). Data on AdOral\u00ae Sema will be presented at the ATTD 2025 conference (18th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes, 19-22 March, 2025, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).\n\nThe only GLP-1 commercially available in oral form to date, Rybelsus\u00ae, achieved $3.4 billion in global sales in 20247. Oral delivery is a key factor in increasing patient adherence for those with diabetes and/or obesity.\n\nFollowing an initial assessment phase, the AdOral\u00ae technology is currently covered by an R&D collaboration agreement for an application to a novel incretin. All costs related to this agreement are to be covered by the partner.\n\nAdoGel\u00ae\n\nDesigned to enable long-term peptide delivery, AdoGel\u00ae is currently being studied for a once-monthly dosing of semaglutide (GLP-1). GLP-1, a market that generated over $53 billion in global revenue in 2024, is almost exclusively formulated for weekly injections8. AdoGel\u00ae's unique technology could enable monthly or even quarterly injections. New preclinical results have been selected for a poster presentation at the ATTD 2025 conference (18th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes, 19-22 March, 2025, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and for an oral presentation at the SFD 2025 congress (Congress of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone du Diab\u00e8te, April 1-4, 2025, Paris, France).\n\nAbout Adocia\n\nAdocia is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of therapeutic solutions in the field of metabolic diseases, primarily diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe Company has a broad portfolio of drug candidates based on four proprietary technology platforms: 1) The BioChaperone\u00ae technology for the development of new generation insulins and products combining different hormones; 2) AdOral\u00ae, an oral peptide delivery technology; 3) AdoShell\u00ae, an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell transplantation, with an initial application in pancreatic cells transplantation; and 4) AdoGel\u00ae, a long-acting drug delivery platform.\n\nAdocia holds more than 25 patent families.

Ms. Lawver holds an MBA from Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business and a B.S. in linguistics from Georgetown University.\n\nMs. Lawver stated, \u201cIt is an honor to join Altimmune\u2019s Board at such an exciting time in the Company\u2019s evolution. Pemvidutide has shown what I believe to be compelling direct liver effects plus robust weight loss with significant lipid reductions and preservation of lean muscle mass. I am excited to work alongside the other Board members and the leadership team to continue advancing pemvidutide toward a potential commercial launch.\u201d\n\nJerry Durso brings over 30 years of results-oriented leadership experience in the life sciences industry, with expertise in corporate and commercial strategy and business operations. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Intercept Pharmaceuticals, where he built a successful rare liver disease franchise and ultimately led the company through its successful acquisition by Alfasigma.

He holds a BBA in marketing from the University of Notre Dame.\n\nMr. Durso added, \u201cPemvidutide is a very exciting product candidate that not only drives significant liver defatting, but also has been shown to promote clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in serum lipids, potentially offering a benefit across a range of liver and metabolic diseases. I look forward to contributing my late-stage clinical and commercial experience to work with the Board and the management team to help bring pemvidutide to patients in need.\u201d\n\nAbout Altimmune\n\nAltimmune is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative next-generation peptide-based therapeutics.

            "content": "Detailed trial results could help Sanofi and Teva Pharmaceuticals make a case that a drug they\u2019ve been developing will be competitive with rival treatments from Merck & Co. and Roche.\n\nThe data, presented over the weekend at a medical conference in Berlin, show the drug led to higher rates of clinical response, remission and improvement on endoscopic imaging than placebo among participants with either Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\nThe companies had previously summarized findings from their Phase 2b study and indicated they\u2019d advance their drug, called duvakitug, into late-stage testing. Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a Monday note to clients that, apart from a few nuances, the results remain very good.\n\nDuvakitug is an important asset for both Sanofi and Teva. It\u2019s one of a class of drugs that target a protein called TL1A, which is implicated in the inflammation seen in diseases like Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis. Sanofi paid Teva $500 million in October 2023 to join forces on duvakitug\u2019s development.\n\nMerck and Roche, which each acquired their respective TL1A drugs through dealmaking as well, appear to be somewhat ahead in testing. Sanofi and Teva, therefore, hope to make the claim that duvakitug could be \u201cbest in class.\u201d\n\nThe data presented at the 20th Congress of the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organization don\u2019t prove that yet, as they come from a mid-stage trial. Still, they\u2019ve encouraged analysts following the drug. David Risinger, an analyst at Leerink Partners who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Sanofi\u2019s stock, wrote to clients that the data bolster duvakitug\u2019s \u201cexceptional profile.\u201d\n\nIn both the ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s patient groups, a high dose of duvakitug helped about half meet the study\u2019s primary endpoint: clinical remission or endoscopic response, respectively, at week 14. Placebo response rates were respectively 20% and 13%.\n\nOn Saturday, the companies disclosed additional results showing treatment led to higher clinical remission rates than placebo in ulcerative colitis patients who had previously received advanced therapies as well as in those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nRaffat, of Evercore ISI, argued that the Crohn\u2019s data \u201cleaves a bit more to be desired.\u201d He pointed out that, while the primary endpoint data were solid, the placebo-adjusted clinical remission rates weren\u2019t as strong in this patient group.\n\nTesting of duvakitug in this setting is the first randomized test of a TL1A drug in Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nSanofi and Teva said treatment was \u201cgenerally well tolerated,\u201d and noted there were no serious adverse events. The companies expect a Phase 3 study, which will be led by Sanofi, to begin in the second half of the year.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Merck MRK, Sanofi SNY, Regeneron REGN and Ionis Pharmaceuticals IONS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nPharma Stock Roundup: EU Nod to Key Drug and Q4 Earnings Results\n\nThis week, the European Commission granted approval to Merck\u2019s novel HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitor, Welireg, for two indications. The FDA granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster drug, Dupixent, for a new indication, bullous pemphigoid. Ionis Pharmaceuticals announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results.\n\nHere's a recap of the week\u2019s most important stories.\n\nIONS\u2019 Better-Than-Expected Q4 Results\n\nIONS reported better-than-expected top and bottom-line numbers for the fourth quarter. Its loss of 66 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.12 per share. Total revenues of $227 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137.5 million. However, revenues declined 30.2% year over year. Commercial revenues were $86 million in the fourth quarter, up 8.9% year over year. R&D revenues declined 42.7% year over year to $141 million.\n\nIonis issued fresh financial guidance for 2025. The company expects total revenues to be more than $600 million in 2025. Adjusted operating loss is expected to be less than $495 million.\n\nEU Approval to Merck\u2019s Welireg for Two Indications\n\nThe European Commission approved Merck\u2019s Welireg as a monotherapy for certain previously treated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. Approvals for these two indications were based on data from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 studies. Welireg is already approved for both indications in the United States.\n\nFDA\u2019s Priority Tag to SNY\u2019s Dupixent sBLA for Bullous Pemphigoid\n\nSanofi and Regeneron announced that the FDA has accepted and granted priority review to an sBLA seeking approval of Dupixent for treating bullous pemphigoid, a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing skin disease. The FDA\u2019s decision on the sBLA is expected by June 20, 2025. The sBLA is based on data from a pivotal study, which demonstrated that Dupixent led to significant improvements in sustained disease remission compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe bullous pemphigoid.\n\nDupixent is currently approved in several countries, including the United States and EU, for six type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and prurigo nodularis. If approved for bullous pemphigoid, Dupixent will become the first medicine approved for this chronic and relapsing skin disease in the United States.\n\nMRK, REGN and IONS have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, while Sanofi has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 1.4% in the past five trading sessions.\n\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return\n\nIn the last five trading sessions, Novo Nordisk rose the most (6.2%), while Novartis declined the most (0.4%).\n\nIn the past six months, all the stocks were in the red except AbbVie, which rose 2.3%.\n\n(See the last pharma stock roundup here: NVS, ABBV M&A Deals, FDA Nod to RHHBY, PFE Drugs)\n\nWhat's Next in the Pharma World?\n\nWatch this space for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The placebo-adjusted rates were 16% (450 mg) and 27% (900 mg).\n\nHigher remission rates were seen in both advanced-therapy (AT)-experienced and AT-na\u00efve subgroups of patients.\n\nThe investigational drug also showed positive results when additional endpoints were evaluated, including clinical response, endoscopic improvement (Modified Endoscopic Score), and histological-endoscopic mucosal improvement (HEMI).\n\nIn the CD cohort of the RELIEVE UCCD study, 26% of patients treated with Duvakitug at 450 mg and 48% at 900 mg achieved an endoscopic response at week 14, compared to 13% in the placebo group.\n\nThe placebo-adjusted rates were 13% (450 mg) and 35% (900 mg).\n\nHigher response rates were observed in both advanced-therapy-experienced and na\u00efve subgroups.\n\nDuvakitug was generally well tolerated in both UC and CD cohorts, with no new emergent safety signals.\n\nRELIEVE UCCD study lead investigator Vipul Jairath said: \u201cEvery day, I see patients with Crohn\u2019s disease who continue to suffer from the often-severe symptoms of the disease despite available treatments.\n\n\u201cThe endoscopic response rates seen in this study support the potential of duvakitug as an effective new option for these who are in desperate need of relief.\u201d\n\nTeva and Sanofi are collaborating to co-develop and co-commercialise the drug candidate for UC and CD. The French pharmaceutical company licensed the asset from Teva in a deal valued at approximately $1.5bn in October 2023.\n\nBoth companies will equally share global development costs and profit-sharing in major markets, with royalty-based agreements in other regions.\n\nThe findings from the RELIEVE UCCD study will form the basis for a Phase 3 clinical programme, expected to begin in the second half of 2025.\n\nIn a separate development, Teva and Alvotech have announced the availability of Selarsdi (ustekinumab-aekn) injection in the US.\n\nSelarsdi, a biosimilar to Stelara, is approved for treating psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, paediatric plaque psoriasis, and paediatric psoriatic arthritis.\n\nThis marks the second biosimilar launched through their partnership in the US.",

            "content": "Sarclisa approved in Japan for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma\n\nApproval offers access to new treatment options for newly diagnosed MM patients\n\nApproval based on positive results from the IMROZ phase 3 study that demonstrated Sarclisa in combination with VRd significantly improved progression-free survival, compared to VRd alone in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma\n\nParis, February 25, 2025. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has approved Sarclisa, in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nOlivier Nataf\n\nGlobal Head, Oncology\n\n\u201cIn recent years, new multiple myeloma cases have increased steadily in Japan and other Asian-Pacific nations, creating a need for new treatment approaches, particularly in the front-line setting. While Sarclisa-based combinations have been approved for relapsed or refractory patients in Japan, this approval represents the first indication for certain newly diagnosed patients. We are pleased to offer physicians an important new option for their patients earlier in the treatment journey, building upon our continued commitment to advancing innovative oncology treatments in difficult-to-treat hematologic malignancies around the world.\u201d\n\nIn Japan, Sarclisa was launched in August 2020 and has been approved for four different treatment regimens (in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, as monotherapy, in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, or in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma). In addition, Sarclisa has front-line approvals in the EU and the US. In the Asia Pacific region, Sarclisa combination regimens were also recently approved by the National Medical Products Administration in China, specifically Sarclisa-VRd in NDMM patients who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, as well as Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nAbout Sarclisa\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including in the US, EU, Japan, and China, across multiple indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in the US, EU and Japan in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u2265two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US, EU, UK, and China, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. This combination is also approved in Japan for patients with NDMM.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous (SC) administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. In January 2024, Sanofi reported positive results from the IRAKLIA phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa SC formulation administered via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with Pd compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa in patients with R/R MM. In December 2024, additional positive results from the program, including the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy in transplant-eligible NDMM patients, were also presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.\n\nIn striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally, Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline, leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat often rare cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, certain types of lymphomas, as well as gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and other gastrointestinal and lung cancers.\n\nFor more information on Sarclisa clinical studies, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter.\n\nDetailed trial results could help Sanofi and Teva Pharmaceuticals make a case that a drug they\u2019ve been developing will be competitive with rival treatments from Merck & Co. and Roche.\n\nThe data, presented over the weekend at a medical conference in Berlin, show the drug led to higher rates of clinical response, remission and improvement on endoscopic imaging than placebo among participants with either Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe companies had previously summarized findings from their Phase 2b study and indicated they\u2019d advance their drug, called duvakitug, into late-stage testing. Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a Monday note to clients that, apart from a few nuances, the results remain very good.\n\nDuvakitug is an important asset for both Sanofi and Teva. It\u2019s one of a class of drugs that target a protein called TL1A, which is implicated in the inflammation seen in diseases like Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis. Sanofi paid Teva $500 million in October 2023 to join forces on duvakitug\u2019s development.\n\nMerck and Roche, which each acquired their respective TL1A drugs through dealmaking as well, appear to be somewhat ahead in testing. Sanofi and Teva, therefore, hope to make the claim that duvakitug could be \u201cbest in class.\u201d\n\nThe data presented at the 20th Congress of the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organization don\u2019t prove that yet, as they come from a mid-stage trial. Still, they\u2019ve encouraged analysts following the drug. David Risinger, an analyst at Leerink Partners who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Sanofi\u2019s stock, wrote to clients that the data bolster duvakitug\u2019s \u201cexceptional profile.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn both the ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s patient groups, a high dose of duvakitug helped about half meet the study\u2019s primary endpoint: clinical remission or endoscopic response, respectively, at week 14. Placebo response rates were respectively 20% and 13%.\n\nOn Saturday, the companies disclosed additional results showing treatment led to higher clinical remission rates than placebo in ulcerative colitis patients who had previously received advanced therapies as well as in those who hadn\u2019t.\n\nRaffat, of Evercore ISI, argued that the Crohn\u2019s data \u201cleaves a bit more to be desired.\u201d He pointed out that, while the primary endpoint data were solid, the placebo-adjusted clinical remission rates weren\u2019t as strong in this patient group.\n\nTesting of duvakitug in this setting is the first randomized test of a TL1A drug in Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanofi and Teva said treatment was \u201cgenerally well tolerated,\u201d and noted there were no serious adverse events. The companies expect a Phase 3 study, which will be led by Sanofi, to begin in the second half of the year.\n\nRecommended Reading",

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA), and Sanofi today presented new, detailed results from the RELIEVE UCCD Phase 2b study of duvakitug (TEV\u2019574/SAR447189), a human IgG1-\u03bb2 monoclonal antibody targeting TL1A, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), the two most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These results were shared in two oral presentations at the 20th Congress of the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) in Berlin, Germany.1, 4\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nIn the UC cohort of the RELIEVE UCCD study, 36% (450 mg dose) and 48% (900 mg dose) of patients treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission (mMS)* at week 14 compared to 20% treated with placebo; placebo-adjusted rates were 16% (450 mg) and 27% (900 mg) (p=0.050 and 0.003, respectively).1-3\n\nIn addition, higher clinical remission rates were observed for both doses of duvakitug versus placebo in both advanced therapy (AT)-experienced and AT-na\u00efve subgroups of patients.\n\nAT-experienced: 29% (450 mg) and 36% (900 mg), with placebo-adjusted rates of 22% (450 mg) and 29% (900 mg).\n\nAT-na\u00efve: 39% (450 mg) and 53% (900 mg), with placebo-adjusted rates of 12% (450 mg) and 26% (900 mg).1-3\n\nAdditional endpoints observed*:\n\nClinical response (mMS): 81% (450 mg) and 70% (900 mg) compared to 52% treated with placebo.\n\nEndoscopic improvement (MES): 45% (450 mg) and 50% (900 mg) compared to 23% treated with placebo.\n\nHistological-endoscopic mucosal improvement (HEMI): 30% (450 mg) and 33% (900 mg) compared to 16% treated with placebo.1-3\n\n\u201cPatients, many of whom have spent years in a recurring cycle of remission and relapse, have been waiting a long time for better options in treating ulcerative colitis. We\u2019re highly encouraged by the significant treatment response, compared to placebo seen in the study, both in advanced therapy na\u00efve-and experienced patients,\u201d said Walter Reinisch, MD, PhD, Medical University of Vienna, and lead investigator of the RELIEVE UCCD study. \u201cWith this potential of duvakitug to reduce inflammation, we could truly transform treatment for patients with IBD in a safe manner.\u201d\n\nCrohn\u2019s disease\n\nIn the CD cohort of the RELIEVE UCCD study, 26% (450 mg) and 48% (900 mg) of patients with CD treated with duvakitug achieved the primary endpoint of endoscopic response (SES-CD)* compared to 13% on placebo; placebo-adjusted rates were 13% (450 mg) and 35% (900 mg) at week 14 (p=0.058 and <0.001, respectively).\n\nIn addition, higher endoscopic response rates were observed for both doses of duvakitug versus placebo in both AT-experienced and -na\u00efve subgroups of patients.\n\nAT-experienced: 11% (450 mg) and 48% (900 mg), with placebo-adjusted rates of 7% (450 mg) and 44% (900 mg).\n\nAT-na\u00efve: 47% (450 mg) and 47% (900 mg), with placebo-adjusted rates of 25% (450 mg) and 25% (900 mg).2-4\n\nAdditional endpoints observed:\n\nEndoscopic remission (SES-CD): 17% (450 mg) and 26% (900 mg) compared to 9% treated with placebo.\n\nClinical remission (CDAI): 50% (450 mg) and 54% (900 mg) compared to 41% treated with placebo.\n\nClinical response (CDAI): 61% (450 mg) and 62% (900 mg) compared to 41% treated with placebo.\n\nClinical response (PRO2): 50% (450 mg) and 53% (900 mg) compared to 29% treated with placebo.2-4\n\n\u201cEvery day, I see patients with Crohn\u2019s disease who continue to suffer from the often-severe symptoms of the disease despite available treatments,\u201d said Vipul Jairath, MBChB, DPhil, FRCP, FRCPC, Professor of Medicine in the Departments of Medicine, Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Western University, and lead investigator of the RELIEVE UCCD study. \u201cThe endoscopic response rates seen in this study support the potential of duvakitug as an effective new option for these who are in desperate need of relief.\u201d\n\nRELIEVE UCCD safety data summary\n\nIn both the UC and CD cohorts, duvakitug was generally well tolerated with no emergent safety signals observed.1-4 No dose dependent or adverse event (AE) pattern was observed for treatment-related AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to discontinuation or adverse events of special interest (AESIs).\n\nDuvakitug is currently under clinical investigation, and its efficacy and safety have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nTeva Investor Call\n\nTeva will hold an investor call and live webcast on Monday, February 24, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. ET. During the conference call, Eric Hughes, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer, and external IBD key opinion leaders (KOLs) will discuss new data presented for duvakitug (Anti-TL1A) positive Phase 2b results at the 20th Annual Congress of the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organization (ECCO). In order to participate, please register in advance here to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.

Following the conclusion of the call, a replay of the webcast will be available within 24 hours on Teva\u2019s website.\n\nAbout Inflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nUC and CD, the two main types of IBD, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the GI tract resulting in debilitating and persistent symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fatigue and weight loss.5,6 Prolonged inflammation can lead to damage within the GI tract, including fibrosis, a common complication of IBD characterized by an accumulation of scar tissue in the intestinal wall, which may cause narrowing and obstruction often requiring hospitalization and surgery. There is currently no cure for IBD \u2013 the goal of treatment is to induce and maintain remission and prevent flares.7\n\nAbout the RELIEVE UCCD Phase 2b Study\n\nRELIEVE UCCD was a 14-week Phase 2b, randomized, double-blinded, dose-ranging study to determine the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of duvakitug in adults with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). The study was an innovative and efficient basket study design allowing the inclusion of patients with either type UC and CD. It is also the first and only randomized, blinded and placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to investigate the impact of TL1A in CD.\n\nIn the study, patients who met pre-specified inclusion criteria were randomized to receive one of two duvakitug doses or placebo, administered every two weeks subcutaneously, in a 1:1:1 ratio for each indication (UC or CD) stratified by previous exposure to advanced IBD therapies [yes (either biologics/small molecule) or no] for 14 weeks. The UC cohort comprised adults with moderately to severely active disease with inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to previous conventional and/or advanced therapies (ATs). The CD cohort comprised adults with moderately to severely active disease with documented inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to conventional and/or advanced therapies (ATs).\n\nPrimary efficacy endpoints are the number of participants who show clinical remission (as defined by the modified Mayo score) in the UC cohort or the number of participants who show endoscopic response (as defined by the SES-CD endoscopic score for CD) in the CD cohort. The study includes sites in the U.S., Europe, Israel, and Asia.2,3\n\nAbout Duvakitug\n\nDuvakitug is a potential best-in-class human IgG1-\u03bb2 monoclonal antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), also known as TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15). TL1A signaling is believed to amplify inflammation and drive fibrosis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through binding its receptor, death receptor 3 (DR3).\n\nDuvakitug is uniquely designed to inhibit preferentially TL1A signaling via DR3, with the potential advantage of reduced TL1A-DcR3 inhibition.8\n\nDuvakitug is currently in a Phase 2b clinical study for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), the two most common types of IBD. The safety and efficacy of duvakitug have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout the Teva and Sanofi Collaboration\n\nTeva and Sanofi are collaborating to co-develop and co-commercialize Teva\u2019s duvakitug for the treatment of UC and CD. Each company will equally share the development costs globally, and the net profits and losses in major markets, with other markets subject to a royalty arrangement. Sanofi will lead the Phase 3 clinical development program. Teva will lead commercialization of the product in Europe, Israel and specified other countries, and Sanofi will lead commercialization in North America, Japan, other parts of Asia and the rest of the world.\n\nAbout Teva\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

(Photo: VNVC)\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, both parties agreed to work together for public health, aiming to enhance scientific research collaboration, clinical studies, professional training for healthcare staff, and community awareness about disease prevention, especially HFMD in children.\n\nHerv\u00e9 Profit, CFO at Substipharm Biologics, emphasized that the partnership with VNVC marks a significant step in expanding opportunities to bring high-quality vaccines to Vietnam, in an attempt to address the increasing demand for safety and quality. He expressed hope that the HFMD vaccine would soon be available in Vietnam to protect children, reduce severe complications, and ease the burden of the disease on families and society.\n\nNgo Chi Dung, CEO of VNVC, praised the collaboration as a crucial milestone in the joint effort to introduce a much-needed vaccine to Vietnam. He highlighted the urgency of preventing this dangerous disease, which has caused high mortality rates among children for years.\n\nAccording to Dr. Bach Thi Chinh, medical director of VNVC, the HFMD vaccine is recommended for children aged 2 months to under 6 years. It has been proven safe and provides up to 97% protection, offering long-term immunity against HFMD caused by the EV71 strain. The vaccine is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Health for distribution.\n\nClinical trials for the vaccine began in Taiwan (China) in 2010, with Phase 3 trials conducted in Vietnam since 2019. If approved, this would be Vietnam\u2019s first HFMD vaccine, significantly improving disease prevention efforts.\n\nHFMD occurs year-round, and peaks between March-April and September-December. The most recent outbreak in 2023 saw over 180,000 cases, 2.7 times higher than in 2022, with 31 fatalities. In 2024, more than 76,000 cases were reported nationwide.\n\nCurrently, there is no specific treatment for HFMD, only supportive care to help children through severe stages. The Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City has identified HFMD as a major public health challenge in Vietnam.\n\nThe disease has three severity levels. Mild cases (Level 1) can be managed at home, while Levels 2-4 require hospitalization. Levels 2b, 3, and 4 may involve complications, necessitating close monitoring to prevent fatal outcomes.",

The TCHD investigated his actions and referred the matter to federal law enforcement. The TCHD also instituted a number of additional protocols and accounting controls to prevent this from happening again. The TCHD would like to sincerely thank the US Attorney\u2019s Office, HHS-OIG, and FBI for their diligent work on this matter to ensure the return of stolen taxpayer funds and to hold the former employee accountable.\n\nThe original full release below is from the United States Attorney's Office Western District of Missouri:\n\nA former official with the Taney County Health Department pleads guilty in federal court to a scheme to embezzle approximately $260,000 from the agency.\n\nHugo Ricardo Huacuz, 51, waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to a five-count federal information. Huacuz pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, two counts of stealing federal funds, one count of money laundering and one count of aggravated identity theft.\n\nHuacuz was the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer of the Taney County Health Department until he resigned on Nov. 14, 2023. Huacuz had been employed by the health department since 2011.\n\nBy pleading guilty today, Huacuz admitted that he stole from the Taney County Health Department in a scheme that lasted from March 23, 2022, to Nov. 14, 2023. Huacuz caused the health department to write checks to Argon Investments, LLC, a company organized by Huacuz and his wife. Huacuz forged the signatures of health department members, using their identities without their permission. Huacuz caused the health department to issue 15 checks totaling approximately $259,000, which were deposited into the bank account of Argon Investments.\n\nHuacuz used the stolen funds for personal expenses charged to his personal credit card, including automobile insurance, maintenance, repair and parts; restaurants; home construction items; gasoline; airline tickets and travel, including to Chicago, Illinois, New York State, San Diego, California, College Station, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Portland, Oregon; utilities; dry cleaning; clothing; dental and medical care; and payments to the Missouri Secretary of State\u2019s office for Argon\u2019s LLC fees.\n\nHealth board members were not aware of the existence of Argon Investments or that any checks had been issued to Argon Investments. In order to conceal his scheme from the board, Huacuz caused these checks to be coded as payments to Sanofi Pasteur, Inc., a multinational pharmaceutical company. Huacuz falsely reported to the health department\u2019s board that some of the checks written to Argon Investments were for items purchased from Sanofi, and created false invoices from Sanofi purportedly for the purchase of pharmaceutical and medical items, including COVID-19 testing kits.\n\nIn November 2023, the director of the Taney County Health Department received information concerning Huacuz\u2019s job performance. The information stated that Huacuz was frequently absent from his job and that he had other businesses he was operating independent from his job at the health department. After reviewing the information, the director met with Huacuz on Nov. 13, 2023, and placed him on administrative leave. Huacuz went to the bank immediately afterward and withdrew more than $24,000 from the Argon bank account, leaving a balance of $100 in the account.\n\nUnder the terms of today\u2019s plea agreement, Huacuz agrees that he embezzled at least $258,976 and, at the very least, this amount is subject to forfeiture and restitution. The government will recommend a sentence of no more than four years and six months in federal prison without parole while Huacuz will seek a sentence of three years in federal prison without parole. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.\n\nThis case is being prosecuted by Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Randall D. Eggert. It was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI.",

Please check back soon for updates.\n\nThe supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid in adults has been accepted by the FDA for priority review, Sanofi announced in a press release.\n\nThe supplemental biologics license application for Dupixent for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid in adults has been accepted by the FDA for priority review.\n\n\n\nThe acceptance of the Dupixent (dupilumab; Sanofi, Regeneron) application in this indication may give hope to the approximately 27,000 adults in the U.S. living with bullous pemphigoid (BP) that is uncontrolled by systemic corticosteroids.\n\nCharacterized as a chronic debilitating and relapsing skin condition, BP is driven by type 2 inflammation which causes blisters and rashes to form on the skin. These lesions are prone to infection as they tend to itch and subsequently bleed, putting many patients, the majority of which are advanced in age, at extreme risk.\n\nHaving previously received an orphan drug designation by the FDA for BP, Dupixent was also granted priority review due to its high potential in treating this serious condition. If approved, Dupixent would be the first and only targeted medicine to treat BP in the U.S.\n\nThe submission of this application was supported by data from a pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 patients with BP. According to the press release, the study met its primary endpoint with five times more Dupixent- vs. placebo-treated patients reaching sustained disease remission.\n\nSustained disease remission was defined as complete clearance of disease after tapering off oral corticosteroids by week 16, receiving only Dupixent for 20 weeks without rescue therapy and experiencing no relapse by week 36.\n\nAccording to the press release, patients treated with Dupixent also reported reductions in itch, disease severity and use of oral corticosteroids.\n\nSafety data showed that adverse events were more common among the Dupixent vs. placebo group with the most common presentations being peripheral edema, arthralgia, back pain, blurred vision, hypertension, asthma, conjunctivitis, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, limb injury and insomnia.\n\nAccording to the release, the clinical assessment of the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP is currently underway.",

We did some analysis to find out why and believe that investors might be missing some encouraging factors contained in the earnings.\n\nHow Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?\n\nImportantly, our data indicates that Sanofi's profit was reduced by \u20ac1.7b, due to unusual items, over the last year. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Sanofi doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Sanofi's Profit Performance\n\nBecause unusual items detracted from Sanofi's earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Because of this, we think Sanofi's earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! And the EPS is up 8.6% over the last twelve months. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. Ultimately, this article has formed an opinion based on historical data. However, it can also be great to think about what analysts are forecasting for the future. Luckily, you can check out .\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Sanofi's profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying.

The Thousand Oaks, California\u2013based biotech disclosed in January it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts\u2014expected to be mostly complete by June\u2014are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 SEC filing. The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it\u2019s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics\n\nMarch 3\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, Endpoints News and Fierce Biotech reported. A company spokesperson would not tell Endpoints or Fierce how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January announced it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\nCytiva\n\nMarch 3\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva\u2019s recent news includes a January announcement that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva\u2019s manufacturing technologies with Cellular\u2019s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\nEisai\n\nMarch 3\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting 6.8% of its U.S. workforce, primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told BioSpace via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma\u2019s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai\u2019s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that \u201cEisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other neurological conditions.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 28\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It\u2019s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey\u2013based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to BioSpace as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told BioSpace via email that \u201cWe are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.\u201d\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would eliminate about 2,200 jobs by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville\u2019s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for $2 billion in savings through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\nLava Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech announced Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 SEC filing, meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, announcing in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\nRyvu Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Krak\u00f3w, Poland\u2013based biotech announced Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It\u2019s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 26\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately 75% of its staff, including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 SEC filing. The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April SEC filing, meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January announced planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 20\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to Endpoints News.\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called Targeted Active Gene Editor, or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was established in 2018 with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR\u2014including U.C. Berkeley\u2019s Patrick Hsu\u2014and with support from Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight\u2019s approach attracted $30 million in Series A funding in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in bioRxiv in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 20\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company told Fierce the layoffs came \u201cafter careful consideration of all options\u201d and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won\u2019t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, Endpoints News reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 SEC filing.\n\nKojin Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 17\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, Endpoints News reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told Endpoints the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 LinkedIn post. In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug\u2013enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin launched in 2021 with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin\u2019s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, \u201cWe are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.\u201d\n\nModerna\n\nFeb. 17\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles\u2014about 50 employees\u2014within two digital departments, Fierce Pharma reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed higher-than-expected losses for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna\u2019s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson\u2019s statement to Fierce.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 shareholder letter, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to \u201ccontinuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.\u201d\n\nEncoded Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 14\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go 29% of its workforce, primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco\u2013based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded\u2019s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThird Harmonic Bio\n\nFeb. 12\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a 50% reduction of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to \u201cmaximize shareholder value,\u201d including \u201cthrough a strategic transaction and/or business combination.\u201d\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335\u2019s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nQ32\n\nFeb. 12\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\nInventiva\n\nFeb. 12\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is laying off half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its LinkedIn People page, meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nViracta Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 7\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would shut down its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech\u2019s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California\u2013based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech announced a resource realignment initiative that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had laid off 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was forced to terminate the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort \u201cto maximize its cash runway\u201d as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was delisted from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent SEC filing that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company\u2019s closure.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals\n\nFeb. 7\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about 30% of its employees worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a \u201cresearch center of excellence\u201d in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement. The layoffs and scale-back of operations will save the company between $30 million and $35 million.\n\nThe news comes less than a year after X4 got FDA approval for mavorixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist now marketed as Xolremdi, for the treatment of an immunodeficiency syndrome known as WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) syndrome. At the time, the company stated that it was the first FDA approval specifically targeted for the disorder.\n\nLast month, X4 signed a licensing deal with Norgine, a European pharma company, to commercialize mavorixafor in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. That deal netted X4 \u20ac28.5 million ($29.55 million) up front and up to \u20ac226 million ($234.29 million) in regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 7\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\u2019s strategic reorganization rolls on with an additional $2 billion in savings planned through 2027 on top of an ongoing program that had targeted $1.5 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2025. The dramatic upheaval of the BMS business, spurred when CEO Chris Boerner took the helm in 2023, has been painful, with layoffs and program discontinuations.\n\nThe New Jersey pharma explained in its fourth quarter earnings release that the new savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency. The goal is to become a \u201cleaner, more efficient company while investing behind growth brands and promising areas of science,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nWorkforce cuts will include contract positions, open roles and attrition, Endpoints News reported.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nFrontier Medicines\n\nFeb. 6\n\nTo focus resources where they\u2019ll have the greatest impact, Frontier Medicines, a clinical-stage precision medicine company, will cut an unknown number of employees, Fierce Biotech reported Feb. 5.\n\nThe San Francisco-based biotech, which also has a location in Boston, is streamlining operations to ensure it can \u201cremain positioned and well-capitalized\u201d to deliver on the potential of its pipeline, a spokesperson told Fierce via email. The company has not formally announced the layoffs, which locations they\u2019ll affect or when they\u2019ll be effective.\n\nFrontier\u2019s lead program is FMC-376, a KRAS G12C dual inhibitor. The company in February 2024 announced it had closed an oversubscribed $80 million Series C funding round to advance FMC-376. Frontier noted at that time that it had dosed its first patient in the Phase I/II PROSPER trial, testing the inhibitor in patients with G12C-mutated KRAS cancers. The company expects interim clinical data for FMC-376 in the second half of this year, according to a Jan. 9 press release.\n\nKyowa Kirin\n\nFeb. 5\n\nJapanese pharma Kyowa Kirin will cut 52 employees at its Princeton, New Jersey, location effective May 1, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The site houses commercial and corporate functions, clinical development and operations, supply chain and quality teams.\n\nThe company, which has not announced the cuts or reasons behind them, restructured its workforce last year as well. In August, Kyowa offered voluntary early retirement to employees in connection with its transition to becoming a global research organization that will support its focus on advanced antibody technologies and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. That transition included significantly reducing the pharma\u2019s in-house small molecule drug discovery research activities and decreasing chemistry, manufacturing and controls research and quality-related activities.\n\nIn other recent organizational news, Kyowa in October announced it was setting up a new leadership structure that will be effective in March. The company is promoting Masashi Miyamoto from president to chairman and CEO, and Abdul Mullick from chief international business officer to president and chief operating officer. The CEO-COO team is meant to help support the company\u2019s continued growth, according to the announcement.\n\nOmega Therapeutics\n\nFeb. 5\n\nDespite a 2024 collaboration with obesity giant Novo Nordisk, Omega Therapeutics appears to have reached the end of its rope, with bankruptcy looming just ahead and staff cuts already happening. As its cash runway fizzles, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based epigenomic medicines company has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its founder, Flagship Pioneering.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing dated Jan. 29, Omega has until Feb. 10 to commence bankruptcy proceedings and go through a sale process with Pioneering Medicines, an affiliate of Flagship Pioneering, to potentially wind down operations. The company will provide a bridge loan of about $1.4 million upon the signing of the agreement.\n\nOmega had previously warned investors of its cash concerns in a November SEC filing, which stated the company had only enough capital to take it into the second quarter of 2025. Omega attempted to cut costs last March when it laid off 35% of its workforce, representing more than 30 staffers based on its headcount at the end of 2023. The most recent layoffs could leave the company with around 40 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb\n\nFeb. 4\n\nAs its sweeping cost-cutting initiative rolls on, Bristol Myers Squibb revealed that it will downsize its New Jersey headcount by 67, as per a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday.\n\nThe layoffs will take effect from April through December of the year.\n\nBMS first unveiled its \u201cstrategic productivity initiative\u201d alongside its first-quarter 2024 earnings report in April that year, targeting to save approximately $1.5 billion through 2025. Through the realignment program, the pharma plans to minimize management layers and prioritize key growth brands while lowering third-party expenditures. Around 2,200 jobs are on the chopping block.\n\nLast month, BMS turned its back on two development partners\u2014Immatics and Century Therapeutics. The pharma was supposed to work with Immatics on allogeneic T cell receptor and/or CAR T therapies, while its partnership with Century was focused on stem cell-derived natural killer cell or T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies. Both biotechs reported that BMS terminated the partnerships as part of a \u201cportfolio prioritization\u201d push.\n\nTurnstone Biologics\n\nFeb. 4\n\nTurnstone Biologics is making major moves, cutting an undisclosed number of staff as it explores strategic alternatives and halts further development of its TIDAL-01 program, the clinical-stage biotech announced Feb. 4. The strategic alternatives could include an acquisition, merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transactions. Turnstone indicated it intends to retain employees \u201cessential for supporting value-realization as part of its strategic review.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second recent shakeup at the La Jolla, California\u2013based company. In October, Turnstone announced it would cut about 60% of its employees, leaving the biotech with 30 people, according to a November SEC filing. It also disclosed it was adjusting its leadership team and shifting its pipeline to focus on clinical advancement of its selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy via TIDAL-01. The biotech was evaluating TIDAL-01 in multiple Phase I trials including in colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and uveal melanoma.\n\nTurnstone had indicated it would provide a clinical update in the first half of 2025. Now, the company has announced it\u2019s discontinuing all clinical studies evaluating TIDAL-01. It\u2019s also implementing further cost-containment and cash conservation measures, according to the Feb. 4 announcement.\n\nThe company had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million and $45.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, according to the November SEC filing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nFeb. 4\n\nCharles River Laboratories will be closing down its site in Durham County, North Carolina, leading to the termination of 31 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice published Tuesday. In a statement to Endpoints News, a company representative said that the facility was no longer \u201ca strategic fit\u201d for the organization.\n\nThe layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Charles River reported a revenue of $1.01 billion, down 1.6.% from the same period the year prior. The dip was driven by the lower performance of its Discovery and Safety Assessment unit, the company noted at the time.\n\nCharles River is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report on Feb. 19.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nFeb. 3\n\nJust months after disclosing it would cut employees at its Cambridge and Plainville, Massachusetts, locations, Thermo Fisher Scientific has announced a fresh round of layoffs at those viral vector sites. The Waltham-based tools and services company will let go 300 people across the two facilities, according to a Jan. 31 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. Those cuts will be effective March 30.\n\nIn November, Thermo Fisher disclosed via WARN notices it would lay off 160 people across its Cambridge, Lexington and Plainville sites, effective between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. At that time, the Boston Business Journal reported the company will close the Lexington facility, transferring programs from there to Plainville. The 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services, including commercial manufacturing.\n\nThe Cambridge and Plainville cuts were disclosed at about the same time Thermo Fisher announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2024 results. The company shared that while fourth-quarter revenue grew 5% year over year, full-year revenue was flat at $42.8 billion.\n\nFractyl Health\n\nFeb. 3\n\nMetabolic therapeutics company Fractyl Health announced Jan. 31 it will prioritize a pivotal clinical trial aimed at weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal while shuttering another trial and laying off 17% of its workforce.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, the layoffs amount to 22 people, indicating Fractyl had 129 employees prior to the layoffs. The savings, following $1.8 million paid out in severance and other related fees, will extend the company\u2019s runway into 2026, according to the news release.\n\nFractyl has two main products in development\u2014an endoscopy treatment called Revita designed to resurface the lining of the duodenum, and an AAV gene therapy called Rejuva, which aims to modify pancreatic cells to restore GLP-1 pathway function in islet cells. The company cites Revita as an \u201coff-ramp\u201d to injectable GLP-1 treatments for obesity and diabetes.\n\nFractyl\u2019s shift in priorities means it is pausing development of Revita and its associated REVITALIZE-1 trial in type 2 diabetes and focusing on Revita\u2019s pivotal REMAIN-1 trial in weight maintenance post-GLP-1 withdrawal, along with Rejuva, which is set to initiate first-in-human studies in this first half of this year.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nImmunityBio\n\nFeb. 3\n\nImmunityBio\u2019s layoffs are continuing into 2025, with the San Diego\u2013based biotech cutting 10 employees in California effective March 25, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices. The company has not announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nThe biotech had 672 employees as of Sept. 30, according to a Nov. 12 SEC filing. Given ImmunityBio let go 31 people over the course of October and November, this means the new cuts\u2014nine in El Segundo and one in Culver City\u2014 could leave the company with around 630 staffers.\n\nAt the same time that ImmunityBio is trimming its workforce, it\u2019s also moving forward with a new collaboration involving Anktiva, its FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, according to a Jan. 29 announcement. The company has entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, a global oncology company, to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase III clinical trial combining BeiGene\u2019s a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) tislelizumab and Anktiva in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nRentschler Biopharma\n\nJan. 31\n\nAs part of its exit from the cell and gene therapy space, contract development and manufacturing organization Rentschler Biopharma will cease operations at its Stevenage, U.K., site, affecting employees there, the company announced Jan. 30. A Rentschler spokesperson told Endpoints News via email that the move could affect up to 30 people, and the Laupheim, Germany\u2013based company will provide resources to help them find other opportunities.\n\nThe CDMO is withdrawing from cell and gene therapy as part of a long-term strategic shift so it can focus on biologics, according to the announcement.\n\nIn that press release, CEO Benedikt von Braunm\u00fchl stated, \u201cThe cell and gene therapy market has experienced slower-than-expected growth, with demand across the industry not meeting our expectations. Following a comprehensive strategic review, we are focusing our efforts on areas where we see the greatest demand and potential to create value sustainably.\u201d\n\nCargo Therapeutics\n\nJan. 31\n\nCargo Therapeutics is a little lighter\u2014on both the pipeline and workforce front\u2014as the CAR T\u2013focused biotech announced Jan. 29 that it is discontinuing a mid-stage study of its lead candidate and parting with approximately half of its employees. The company is letting go 81 people effective April 1, according to a Jan. 30 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice.\n\nJefferies analysts in an investor note Jan. 30 called the news a \u201csurprise disappointment\u201d as the Phase I study had showed a 50% complete response rate and long multi-year durability of firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel)\u2014an autologous CD22 CAR T cell therapy.\n\nCargo had 170 employees as of Sept. 30, 2024, according to a Nov. 13 SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave the company with about 85 employees.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCorrection (Feb. 4): This entry was updated to change the number of employees let go to 81 and add the effective date based on a WARN notice published today.\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 31\n\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals on Wednesday announced a steep workforce reduction initiative that will allow it to lower its spending and \u201cis intended to position the company for long-term growth.\u201d\n\nThe news of the layoffs comes as Boston-based Ironwood unveiled its 2025 revenue guidance, expecting to make between $260 million to $290 million\u2014a range that falls far below the $340 million consensus by analysts, according to SeekingAlpha. Ironwood dipped around 7% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nApproximately 50% of the company\u2019s employees will be affected by the layoffs, mostly those working in its field force, the biotech revealed in its news release. The workforce reduction should be mostly complete by the end of June, leaving Ironwood with about 120 employees, according to a Jan. 29 SEC filing.\n\nWhile the company has operations in Basel, Switzerland, it did not specify if the cuts will affect staff there.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 30\n\nZentalis Pharmaceuticals announced Jan. 28 it is cutting about 40% of its workforce in what it called a \u201cstrategic restructuring\u201d as the biotech goes all in on bringing its lead candidate to the market.\n\nAccording to Zentalis, the move aims to extend the company\u2019s cash runway until late 2027, with the hope of getting beyond a Phase II data readout for azenosertib in ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer.\n\nThe company had 168 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a Feb. 27, 2024, SEC filing, meaning the layoffs could leave it with about 100 employees.\n\nAlong with the restructuring, Zentalis reported mid-trial data from azenosertib from the MAMMOTH and DENALI studies on Jan. 29, showing a 5.5 month median duration of response and \u201cno new safety signals.\u201d\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nI-Mab\n\nJan. 30\n\nI-Mab will cut 27% of staff weeks after announcing a reprioritization of its pipeline to focus on a Phase I bispecific antibody.\n\nThe move will cost the Maryland-based immuno-oncology company about $300,000 but is estimated to save about $3 million overall. I-Mab expects the realignment to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2025, it noted in its Jan. 28 SEC filing. According to 2023 filings, I-Mab had 220 total employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, though most worked at a divested China operation.\n\nThe company had just under 135 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 29, meaning the cuts could leave it with fewer than 100 employees.\n\nThe layoffs follow an announcement in early January that I-Mab will re-prioritize resources to focus on advancing lead molecule givastomig, a CLDN18.2 and 4-1BB bispecific antibody for certain metastatic gastric cancers. The candidate is currently in Phase Ib trials in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo and chemotherapy, with data readouts expected in the second half of 2025. Other trials featuring givastomig are expected to readout in 2026.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nAffini-T Therapeutics let go an undisclosed number of employees last week, Endpoints News reported. Jak Knowles, the biotech\u2019s CEO, confirmed the cuts to Endpoints Jan. 28.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts\u2013based cell therapy company had just under 90 people listed on its LinkedIn profile\u2019s People page on Jan. 28. However, about a dozen had \u201copen to work\u201d designations on their profile photos.\n\nAffini-T is developing T cell receptor (TCR)\u2013based immunotherapies for solid tumors. It has two autologous TCR T cell therapy programs in the clinical stage and two in the preclinical stage, according to its website. Three bispecific T cell engagers are in the discovery stage.\n\nEndpoints noted that Knowles had previously told the publication that the biotech\u2019s launch-round funding would take it through December 2024. Started by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center researchers, Affini-T debuted in January 2022 at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. Two months later, it announced it had raised $175 million in initial financing.\n\nAtara Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 29\n\nFollowing the FDA\u2019s rejection of Atara Biotherapeutics\u2019 T cell therapy for a transplant-related blood cancer and a related clinical hold, the company divulged that it will cut about 50% of its workforce. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by June, according to a Jan. 27 SEC filing.\n\nAtara had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12, 2024, SEC filing, which means the layoffs could leave the company with around 80 employees. The biotech did not specify which locations the workforce reduction will affect. Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA rejected Atara\u2019s Ebvallo, which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a clinical hold on the biotech\u2019s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo\u2019s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company\u2019s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it\u2019s testing for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results. The move will leave the San Carlos, California\u2013based biotech with about 15 employees as it explores strategic alternatives and winds down the trial, according to the Jan. 27 announcement.\n\nAlthough AK006 was well tolerated, preclinical inhibitory effects observed did not translate to clinical benefit in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a skin condition that causes hives, according to a statement by Chin Lee, Allakos chief medical officer, in the press release. In the Phase 1 trial, patients taking AK006 did not show significant improvement in their symptoms as compared with the placebo group.\n\nThis is not the first time Allakos has ditched a CSU candidate. In January 2024, the company announced it would halt its humanized IgG1 antibody lirentelimab. It also noted it would cut about 50% of its employees and focus its efforts and resources on AK006 and additional preclinical programs.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nAllakos\n\nJan. 28\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos announced it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase I results.

The staff cuts, first reported by Endpoints News, come as Biogen\u2019s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to \u201creinvigorate\u201d its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. \u201cThe aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.\u201d\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in October 2023.\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting program announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs\u2014or approximately 11% of the company\u2019s headcount\u2014on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNotch Therapeutics\n\nJan. 17\n\nTo preserve cash and \u201cexplore alternate paths forward,\u201d Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia\u2013based company announced on LinkedIn Jan. 16. Fierce Biotech first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, \u201cThe biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.\u201d\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals\n\nJan. 14\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech\u2019s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.\u2014meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped \u201cestablish a world-class commercial organization,\u201d CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nBarinthus Biotherapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma announced Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees\u201495 of them in the U.K.\u2014as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing. However, it let go of 25% of its workforce in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won\u2019t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 SEC filing. If the cuts move forward, they include parting ways with Chief Operating Officer Graham Griffiths and Chief Financial Officer Gemma Brown, effective June 30 and April 30, respectively.\n\nRepare Therapeutics\n\nJan. 14\n\nAs it reprioritizes its pipeline, Repare Therapeutics will cut an unspecified number of staff, the clinical-stage precision oncology company announced Jan. 10. The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn\u2019t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an SEC filing. However, in August, it announced it was letting go of 25% of its workforce, which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Pol\u03b8 ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nPassage Bio\n\nJan. 14\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company announced Jan. 10. In an SEC filing, the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March SEC filing, meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company\u2019s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nY-mAbs Therapeutics\n\nJan. 13\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company announced Jan. 10. The New York\u2013based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a \u201csmall adjustment\u201d to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs\u2019 novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza\u2019s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\nGeneration Bio\n\nJan. 13\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell\u2013directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February SEC filing. However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including one in November. Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it\u2019s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity in vivo, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell\u2013driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas\u2019 last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\nIGM Biosciences\n\nJan. 13\n\nIGM Biosciences is cutting 73% of its workforce and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California\u2013based company\u2019s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating \u201cinternal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,\u201d according to the release.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nUpdate (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker\u2019s publication.\n\nIntellia\n\nJan. 10\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of a reorganization program announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an SEC filing.\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs \u201cover the course of 2025,\u201d as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday\u2019s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a \u201ccommercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,\u201d according to its Thursday announcement.\n\nShoreline\n\nJan. 10\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, Endpoints News reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with Endpoints, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still \u201cto be determined.\u201d\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech\u2019s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls \u201cintelligent engineering\u201d to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\nScribe\n\nJan. 9\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, Scribe Therapeutics on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, Endpoints News reported.\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told Endpoints. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that \u201cthe technologies we\u2019ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2020, Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms, including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the PCSK9 gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against APOC3 and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and with Sanofi to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\nResilience\n\nJan. 9\n\nSan Diego\u2013based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) is cutting staff based on demand in the gene therapy sector, which requires reducing headcount in some parts of its network, a company spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThe Durham layoffs aren\u2019t the only ones Resilience is making this year. The CDMO is also letting go 105 employees from its Alachua, Florida, site beginning in February and continuing through June, according to a December WARN notice.\n\nResilience bought the Durham facility from bluebird bio in 2021 and added the Alachua location after acquiring Ology Bioservices that same year.\n\nGalapagos\n\nJan. 9\n\nBy mid-2025, Galapagos will split into two entities and cut 40% of its workforce, which is expected to affect about 300 employees across its Europe operations, the Belgium-based biotech announced Jan. 8. As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a \u201ccritical step\u201d for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nCassava\n\nJan. 8\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will lay off 10 employees\u2014accounting for around 33% of its headcount\u2014in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ \u201ccontinuing strategic expense management efforts,\u201d including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement comes after Cassava\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug candidate simufilam failed the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava\u2019s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics\n\nJan. 8\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about 40% of its employees, the San Francisco\u2013based biotech announced Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice, likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX\u2019s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it\u2019s working on with Amgen. Plans for Phase Ia completion and potential advancement to Phase Ib are \u201cpending ongoing consideration of 2025 program resourcing given CytomX current capital constraints and discussions with our partner Amgen,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nVelia\n\nJan. 7\n\nVelia, a San Diego\u2013based biotech founded in 2021, is shutting down and eliminating its workforce, Endpoints News reported. The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn People page and PitchBook.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Endpoints Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, \u201cWe are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.\u201d\n\nEndpoints did not report when Velia\u2019s wind-down will be complete.\n\nOxular\n\nJan. 3\n\nFollowing Regeneron\u2019s acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, Fierce Biotech reported Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told Fierce that no Oxular employees will join the New York\u2013based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech\u2019s LinkedIn People page shows 13 \u201cassociated members\u201d as of Jan. 3, Fierce reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to Fierce.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on LinkedIn. In his post, he wrote, \u201cThe ophthalmology team at Regeneron is uniquely positioned to maximize the use of Oxular\u2019s proprietary technologies.\u201d\n\n2024 Layoffs Hit Multiple Companies and Thousands of Employees\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nDecember 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nDecember 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nDecember 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nDecember 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nDecember 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovember 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nNovember 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nNovember 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nNovember 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nNovember 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\nNovember 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nNovember 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nNovember 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nNovember 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nNovember 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nNovember 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nNovember 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not",

Image credit: Shutterstock / Leitenberger Photography.\n\nSanofi\u2019s sale of its $17bn consumer health business Opella just advanced a step closer, after the drugmaker signed a share purchase agreement with buyer Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).\n\nThe two companies agreed on the transaction that will see Sanofi hand over a 50% controlling stake of Opella to US private equity CD&R. French public investment bank Bpifrance is expected to participate as a minority shareholder with a 2% stake in the health business.\n\nSanofi, which will remain a significant shareholder, said the deal is expected to take place in Q2 2025 at the earliest, with customary regulatory approvals still required.\n\nThe share purchase agreement is the first public update on the deal since Sanofi entered exclusive talks with CD&R in October 2024. At the time, the French pharma company placed an enterprise value of \u20ac16bn ($17bn) on Opella, around 14 times the estimated core earnings (EBITDA) for 2024. The decision to divest Opella is part of Sanofi\u2019s ongoing strategy to become a pureplay biopharma company.\n\nOpella employs more than 11,000 people worldwide and is known for making Doliprane, one of France\u2019s most-sold paracetamol-based painkillers. The medicine is so popular that most paracetamol products are referred to as Doliprane, regardless of the manufacturer. In addition, Opella develops allergy treatment Allegra (fexofenadine) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) relief medicine Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide), among others. Sales in the business totalled \u20ac5.6bn ($5.8bn) in 2023, accounting for 11% of Sanofi\u2019s total business.\n\nSanofi also claims Opella is also the third-largest business in the world in the over-the-counter vitamins, minerals, and supplements market.\n\nGiven Opella\u2019s significant economic contribution to France, Sanofi\u2019s divestment prompted concerns in the country about the potential loss of a strategic asset to a US company. The Bpifrance stake is part of a guarantee from the French Government to keep jobs and production in the country.\n\nSanofi honing its focus on innovative medicines and vaccines while shedding its consumer health business is not unique. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and GSK both made the same play in 2022, creating independent consumer healthcare businesses Kenvue and Haleon, respectively.\n\nOpella is not the only big business decision recently made by Sanofi, as it has been busy increasing its ownership and reducing stakes held by investors. Earlier this month, Sanofi bought back a $3.1bn stake held by cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al, cutting the latter company\u2019s ownership. In addition, Sanofi agreed to purchase a further $2.08bn in shares held by other stakeholders.",

Bpifrance, the state-owned investment bank of France, will take a 2% minority stake. The deal, which was outlined last October, is expected to close in the second quarter, Sanofi said. Selling off a stake will give Sanofi funds to invest more in its prescription drug research. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nAn experimental drug from Supernus Pharmaceuticals has failed in a mid-stage study of adults with treatment-resistant depression. The oral drug, code-named SPN-820, is meant to enhance a protein complex that research suggests is involved with brain cell signaling and function. Supernus said that, while well-tolerated, SPN-820 was not significantly better than a placebo at improving depressive symptoms after four weeks of treatment. According to CEO Jack Khattar, the company plans to further analyze data from the trial and discuss the future of the program with its development partner, Navitor Pharmaceuticals. Supernus shares were down by double digits Wednesday morning. \u2014 Jacob Bell\n\nArcus Biosciences will keep control of its experimental cancer drug casdatifan after Gilead Sciences declined to license it via an option right granted under a 10-year collaboration the companies signed in 2020. Casdatifan is what\u2019s known as a HIF-2a inhibitor, similar in mechanism to Merck & Co.\u2019s recently approved medicine Welireg. Arcus is developing casdatifan for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and on Tuesday announced a $150 million stock offering that will fund independent development of the drug. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nGilead hopes to this year win U.S. clearance of its drug lenacapavir as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. The big biotechnology firm on Tuesday announced the Food and Drug Administration accepted its approval application and set a decision deadline of June 19, 2025. A new kind of HIV antiviral, lenacapavir is already marketed in several countries as a treatment, together with other medicines, for multi-drug resistant HIV. If approved for PrEP, lenacapavir would be the first twice-yearly option for HIV prevention, according to Gilead. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo\n\nBy mid-August, the FDA will decide whether to approve a gene therapy developed by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical for Sanfilippo syndrome type A, a rare and deadly lysosomal storage disease. The therapy, called UX111, uses an adeno-associated virus to deliver a functional gene capable of producing an enzyme people with Sanfilippo lack. Originally developed by Abeona Therapeutics, UX111 was transferred to Ultragenyx in a 2022 deal. The company does not expect the FDA to call an advisory committee meeting as part of the agency\u2019s review. \u2014 Ned Pagliarulo",

The condition is characterised by intense itch, blisters and painful lesions and, despite current treatment options, approximately 27,000 adults in the US are living with BP that is uncontrolled by systemic corticosteroids.\n\nAlready approved for a range of indications, Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signalling of the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways, shown in the Dupixent development programme to be central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related diseases, including BP.\n\nIf authorised for this latest indication, Dupixent would be the first and only targeted medicine to treat BP in the US.\n\nThe companies\u2019 supplemental biologics licence application for the drug was supported by the phase 2/3 ADEPT trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP.\n\nThe study met its primary endpoint, with five times more Dupixent-treated patients achieving sustained disease remission compared to those receiving placebo. Dupixent was also shown to significantly reduce disease severity, itch and oral corticosteroids use compared to placebo.\n\nThe FDA grants priority review to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.\n\nA priority review designation means the regulator will aim to take action on the application within six months, compared to ten months under its standard review pathway.\n\nThe latest decision on Dupixent comes less than five months after the FDA approved the drug as an add-on maintenance treatment of adults with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and an eosinophilic phenotype, making it the first biologic medicine approved in the US for this patient population.\n\nSanofi\u2019s chief executive officer, Paul Hudson, said at the time of the September announcement: \u201cDupixent has already shown it can revolutionise the treatment paradigm of many diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation with high unmet medical needs, with one million patients being treated globally across all currently approved indications.\u201d",

Credit: The Washington Post via Getty Images.\n\nSanofi and Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster biologic Dupixent (dupilumab) is poised for yet another label expansion, this time for the rare autoimmune skin disorder bullous pemphigoid (BP).\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a supplemental biologics licence application (sBLA) for priority review, with a decision expected by 20 June 2025. If approved, Dupixent would become the first and only targeted treatment for BP, which currently has no FDA-approved therapies.\n\nBP causes large, fluid-filled blisters \u2013 primarily in elderly adults \u2013 as the immune system mistakenly attacks proteins in the skin\u2019s basement membrane, leading to inflammation and skin separation. The current standard of care (SOC) is corticosteroids such as prednisone, which help manage symptoms but carry significant side effects, including weight gain, high blood sugar, and mood changes.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s review is based on data from the Phase II/III LIBERTY-BP ADEPT trial (NCT04206553), which evaluated Dupixent\u2019s efficacy in BP patients. In the 106-patient study, those receiving 300mg of Dupixent every two weeks achieved a fivefold higher rate of sustained disease remission (20%) compared to placebo at 4%. Remission was defined as a complete clinical response after tapering off SOC oral corticosteroids by week 16, with no relapses or rescue therapy required over the 36-week trial period. Dupixent also demonstrated superiority over placebo in reducing disease severity and clinically meaningful itch, among other secondary endpoints.\n\nDupixent, a fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits the signalling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways, two of the key drivers of type 2 inflammation. It is already approved across six indications in the US including atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nSanofi reported in its Q4 2024 results that Dupixent surpassed its \u20ac13bn ($13.6bn) sales target for the full year, reaching $14.15bn sales. According to GlobalData\u2019s Pharma Intelligence Center, the drug is expected to generate $25bn in global sales by 2030.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nDespite the commercial success, tensions between Regeneron and Sanofi have escalated. Late last year, Regeneron filed a lawsuit against its longtime partner, alleging that Sanofi withheld key commercialisation details in violation of their agreement. Specifically, Regeneron claims Sanofi refused to share pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) contracting information for Dupixent, allegedly to avoid disclosing bundling arrangements with other immunology drugs. The lawsuit, initially filed in November 2024 and amended in December, surfaced publicly earlier this month (February 2025) through Regeneron\u2019s annual SEC filing.\n\nRegeneron and Sanofi have collaborated on Dupixent since 2007, when they first partnered on the drug\u2019s development and commercialisation. Despite the ongoing lawsuit, Dupixent remains a critical asset for both companies. Regeneron is seeking declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages. In 2024, it became Regeneron\u2019s top-selling product, beating its blockbuster eye franchise Eylea (aflibercept).",

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\nDupilumab development program\n\nDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid, and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Regeneron\n\nRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The approval is for a 3 milliliter (mL) single-patient-use prefilled pen and a 10 milliliter (mL) multiple-dose vial.\n\nMerilog is the third insulin biosimilar product the FDA has approved, joining the two long-acting insulin biosimilar products the agency approved in 2021.\n\nA biosimilar is a \u201cbiological product that is highly similar to, and has no clinically meaningful differences from, a biological product already approved by the FDA (also called the reference product).\u201d The FDA has approved 65 biosimilar products to date.\n\nLike Novolog, Merilog should be administered within five to ten minutes before the start of a meal. Merilog is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection into the stomach, buttocks, thighs, or upper arms. Dosing of Merilog should be individualized and adjusted based on the patient\u2019s needs.\n\nMerilog may cause serious side effects, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), severe allergic reactions, and hypokalemia (low potassium in blood). Other common side effects may include injection site reactions, itching, rash, lipodystrophy (skin thickening or pitting at the injection site), weight gain, and swelling of hands and feet.\n\nIn 2023, Sanofi jumped the bandwagon with the other two insulin U.S. giants to lower the price of its best-selling insulin product, Lantus (insulin glargine), by 78%.\n\nSanofi said it would cap a Lantus patient\u2019s monthly out-of-pocket cost at $35 for all patients with commercial insurance.\n\nAlso, in 2023, Sanofi acquired Provention Bio for $25.00 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $2.9 billion.\n\nThe transaction adds a type 1 diabetes therapy to Sanofi\u2019s core asset portfolio in General Medicines and further drives its strategic shift toward products with a differentiated profile.\n\nIn November, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res highlighted that Eli Lilly And Co LLY, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, which dominate the global insulin market, have the power to set high prices that restrict access.\n\nAccording to MSF, data published in JAMA Network Open shows that insulin pens could be produced for as little as $0.94 per unit and remain profitable, yet current prices far exceed this figure.\n\nPrice Action: SNY stock is down 0.59% at $54.18 during the premarket session on last check Tuesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nImage by HJBC via Shutterstock",

            "content": "The FDA on Friday cleared Sanofi\u2019s Merilog (insulin-aspart-szjj), a biosimilar to Novo Nordisk\u2019s rapid-acting insulin NovoLog.\n\nLike its branded reference counterpart, Merilog is indicated to lower spikes in blood sugar concentrations during meals and help control glucose levels in patients with diabetes, according to the FDA\u2019s announcement of the approval. Friday\u2019s regulatory go-ahead covers both the 3-mL prefilled pen of Merilog and its 10-mL multiple-dose vial.\n\nMerilog is the first-ever rapid-acting biosimilar and the third insulin biosimilar approved by the FDA, the agency noted.\n\nSarah Yim, director of the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars at the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement that Merilog\u2019s approval \u201ccan truly make a difference\u201d for the \u201cmillions of people who rely on daily injections of insulin\u201d for their diabetes. A biosimilar, she said, can \u201cincrease access to these life-saving medications.\u201d\n\nMerilog\u2019s approval could serve to reinvigorate a battered insulin market, which over the past year has endured strong headwinds.\n\nIn March 2023, Sanofi and Novo came under fire from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), who asked the companies to follow in the footsteps of fellow diabetes leader Eli Lilly and lower the price of their insulin products. Lilly had announced steep price cuts at the time, planning a 70% reduction in cost for Humalog and Humulin\u2014both short-acting insulin products\u2014and capping patients\u2019 out-of-pocket at $35 per month.\n\nNovo and Sanofi agreed a few days later, announcing price reductions of up to 75% and 78% for many of their insulin products, respectively. Later that year, in November, Novo announced that it would discontinue Levemir, a long-acting insulin, in the U.S. The pharma at the time said it would \u201ccontinue to provide Levemir \u2026 while supplies last.\u201d The brand was fully discontinued at the end of 2024.\n\nThe meteoric rise of GLP-1 therapies may also pose a threat to the insulin market by indirectly addressing diabetes through obesity, though analysts continue to be mixed on the matter. In a May 2024 interview with BioSpace, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said that GLP-1s could lower rates of obesity and diabetes, in turn potentially affecting the demand for insulin.\n\nStill, Seigerman believes that the strength of the GLP-1 space remains, at least currently, a separate issue from the problems facing the insulin market. Price caps and reimbursements, along with other cost considerations for insulin developers, are more pressing matters, he said.",

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Dupixent (dupilumab) to treat adults with bullous pemphigoid (BP).\n\nThe sBLA is supported by data from a pivotal study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 106 adults with moderate-to-severe BP. The primary endpoint was met, with five times more Dupixent patients achieving sustained disease remission compared to those on placebo. Sustained disease remission was defined as complete clinical remission with completion of oral corticosteroids (OCS) taper by week 16 (off OCS treatment and only treated with Dupixent for at least 20 weeks) without relapse and no rescue therapy use during the 36-week treatment period. The study also showed that Dupixent significantly reduced disease severity, itch, and use of OCS compared to placebo.\n\nAdverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (in at least 3 patients) compared to placebo included peripheral edema, arthralgia, back pain, blurred vision, hypertension, asthma, conjunctivitis, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, limb injury, and insomnia.\n\nBP is a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing skin disease with underlying type-2 inflammation that typically occurs in an elderly population. It is characterized by intense itch and blisters, reddening of the skin, and painful lesions. The blisters and rash can form over much of the body and cause the skin to bleed and crust, resulting in patients being more prone to infection and affecting their daily functioning. Approximately 27,000 adults in the US live with BP that is uncontrolled by systemic corticosteroids.\n\nPriority review is granted to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Dupixent was previously granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for BP, which applies to investigational medicines intended for the treatment of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Dupixent in BP are currently under clinical assessment and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Dupixent\n\nDupixent (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type-2 inflammation in phase 3 studies, establishing that IL4 and IL13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type-2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.\n\nDupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in different age populations. More than one million patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.\n\nDupilumab development program\n\nDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type-2 inflammation.\n\nIn addition to the currently approved indications, Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type-2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies, including chronic pruritus of unknown origin, bullous pemphigoid, and lichen simplex chronicus. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Regeneron\n\nRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

No safety signals related to the vaccine candidate were identified and, throughout the study, investigators ensured that participants who developed IED received prompt treatment and care. As a result of the IDMC\u2019s determination, the E.mbrace study is being discontinued.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint, Global Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi, said: \u201cE. coli sepsis is a devastating disease and there are no preventative measures available to date. Driven by our ambition to transform the practice of medicine, we entered this ambitious although challenging field. We are disappointed to see that the vaccine was not associated with sufficient efficacy to support the trial continuation, and we will work tirelessly to understand the factors behind the IDMC\u2019s finding and to share further analysis once available. We are grateful to the participants, families and healthcare professionals involved in this development program. While disappointed by this outcome, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive innovation in R&D by developing first and best-in-class vaccines in areas of high unmet need.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, Sanofi entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company to develop and commercialize the vaccine candidate. Under the terms of the agreement, both parties agreed to co-fund current and future research and development costs. Sanofi paid $250 million in upfront and development milestones to be followed by commercial milestones.\n\nThe E.mbrace study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, interventional phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of the vaccine candidate compared to a placebo in the prevention of IED, which includes sepsis and bacteremia (blood infections)\n\nThe study was initiated in June 2021 enrolling adults aged 60 years or older in stable health with a history of urinary tract infection in the past two years. The study was conducted at over 250 sites across five continents.

            "content": "One of biopharma\u2019s hottest therapeutic areas, immunology and inflammation has seen an uptick in M&A activity in recent years, with big names like Sanofi and Gilead dropping billions of dollars to expand their I&I pipelines. At the same time, the space is seeing an influx of new companies, including Bambusa Therapeutics, which launched Friday with $90 million in series A funds.\n\nMomentum in this space was sparked at the turn of the century by the arrival of therapeutic antibodies. After winning FDA approval in 2002, Abbvie\u2019s Humira\u2014the first tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor\u2014became one of the best-selling drugs of all time, generating over $200 billion in lifetime sales to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease and more.\n\nOver 20 years later, with Humira and other key medicines having lost their exclusivity and research providing a better understanding of the biology underlying the field, it\u2019s time for the next wave of I&I. Indeed, novel targets and modalities are attracting an influx of investment into the I&I space, said Thomas Smith, a senior research analyst covering immunology at Leerink Partners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing antibodies that are going after targets that have not been targeted before, small molecules that were previously thought to be undruggable,\u201d he told BioSpace. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the emergence of cell therapies.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s room for them all. The second largest therapeutic area by value in 2023, the immunology market is projected to be worth more than $257 billion by 2032.\n\n\u201c[I&I] has large end markets of highly prevalent diseases that, despite having multiple treatment options, still have persistent, high medical need,\u201d Smith said.\n\nM&A Expected to Continue in 2025\n\nThe I&I space has made headlines recently for a spate of high-profile deals. In April 2024, Vertex struck the biggest deal in biopharma last year with its $4.9 billion buy of Alpine Immune Sciences. Then in June, Eli Lilly dropped $3.2 billion to acquire Morphic Holding. These deals followed Merck\u2019s eyepopping $10.8 billion pick-up of Prometheus Biosciences a year earlier.\n\nWhile many big pharma companies already have their own immunology platforms, \u201cinnovation does not happen in isolation,\u201d Shaju Backer, global head of immunology at Sanofi, told BioSpace in an email. This is why his company also complements its in-house R&D with a myriad of strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In 2021, Sanofi acquired Kymab for $1.4 billion to add an anti-OX40 ligand to its pipeline, hoping to address the underlying disease pathologies of inflammatory diseases like atopic dermatitis without depleting T cells.\n\nMore recently, Gilead struck a deal last month with LEO Pharma worth up to $1.7 billion for its preclinical STAT6 program. Smith expects more of the same in the near future. \u201cWe have a lot of reason for thinking this is going to continue to be the case in 2025,\u201d he said.\n\nPursuit of Novel Targets\n\nTNF blockers like Humira cast a wide net, pulling in some ten indications. Yet patients and practitioners have seen the effects of Humira and other anti-TNF therapies wear off relatively quickly because ancillary pathways take over, according to Backer, making it necessary to target other pathways for disease management and, hopefully, remission.\n\nOne of these, the TL1A pathway, plays a key role in driving inflammation and fibrosis in various autoimmune diseases, making its inhibition a promising strategy for multiple indications, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Merck\u2019s Prometheus buy brought in a potentially best-in-class TL1A inhibitor in late-stage studies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. And Sanofi is co-developing a TL1A-targeting antibody, duvakitug, with Teva Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAnother target generating a lot of interest is the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) transcription factor, which is a key regulator of Th2-driven immune response. Indication potential is wide-ranging for STAT6-targeted oral drugs, which could offer an alternative to existing injectable biologics.\n\nGilead\u2019s recent deal with LEO Pharma is one example. While the specific indication has not yet been announced, Flavius Martin, executive vice president of research at Gilead, told BioSpace in an email that the program is \u201cadvancing rapidly\u201d toward clinical testing. Elsewhere, Sanofi extended its collaboration with Nurix Therapeutics last year to include a targeted protein degrader of STAT6.\n\nThese are but a few of the many targets now being explored in the I&I space. Others run the gamut from Sanofi\u2019s T cell receptor\u2013targeting amlitelimab for atopic dermatitis, with a 52-week data readout expected in March, to the microRNA-targeting obefazimod from Paris-based biotech Abivax, which is awaiting a Q3 2025 Phase III readout in ulcerative colitis.\n\nFinally, the \u201cunbridled success\u201d of cell therapies in hematological malignancies is now driving efforts to bring cell therapy to the I&I space, particularly for autoimmune disease, Smith said. Companies like Kyverna are developing CAR T cell therapies to deliver complete B cell depletion that could help reset a patient\u2019s immune system to eliminate the need for chronic treatment. Kyverna is targeting a 2026 filing for its lead therapy KYV-101 in stiff person syndrome, with myasthenia gravis and lupus nephritis to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, Arcellx is taking its cell therapy pipeline from multiple myeloma into autoimmune disease. Last fall, the FDA cleared the company\u2019s Investigational New Drug (IND) application to begin a Phase I trial of its CAR T anito-cell in generalized myasthenia gravis.\n\nIf successful, Smith said the biggest challenges to cell therapies for autoimmune indications would be logistics, scalability, reimbursement and identifying the right patients for treatment.\n\nThe beauty of the I&I space is that one molecule can have many different applications, Jorge Santos da Silva, CEO of Moonlake Therapeutics, which is developing treatments for inflammatory indications including hidradenitis suppurativa, told BioSpace. \u201cIn I&I, you can have these molecules that just walk across a whole lot of therapeutic areas,\u201d a feature he said makes it ripe for investment by biopharma.\n\n5 I&I Diseases Poised for Disruption in 2025 Thomas Smith, a senior research analyst covering immunology at Leerink Partners, highlighted five indications within the I&I space that he believes could see substantive movement this year.

With strategic partnerships, global expansion, and a robust R&D pipeline, the company is positioned for a strong rebound in 2025.\n\nImage Source | Public Domain\n\nSK Bioscience reported strong revenue growth in Q4 2024, primarily driven by the consolidation of IDT Biologika, expansion of vaccine exports, and continued partnerships. However, operational losses were recorded due to increased costs and decreased COVID-19 vaccine sales.\n\nKey Financial Metrics (KRW 100 million)\n\nMetric Q4 2023 Q4 2024 YoY Change Revenue 906 1,568 +662 Gross Profit 294 56 -238 SG&A Expenses 378 564 +186 Operating Profit -84 -508 -424 Net Profit 42 -27 -69\n\nSK Bioscience reported a significant 73% year-over-year (YoY) increase in revenue for Q4 2024, reaching KRW 1,568 billion, compared to KRW 906 billion in Q4 2023. This remarkable growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of IDT Biologika, which contributed KRW 1,112 billion to total revenue. The integration of IDT Biologika strengthened the company\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and expanded its global market presence, solidifying its position in the vaccine and biotech industry.\n\nDespite the strong revenue growth, profitability was negatively impacted due to multiple factors. Gross profit declined sharply from KRW 294 billion in Q4 2023 to KRW 56 billion in Q4 2024, a reduction of KRW 238 billion, primarily due to increased cost of goods sold (COGS) and declining COVID-19 vaccine sales. The sharp decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue was attributed to reduced global demand and heightened competition in the flu vaccine market, which exerted downward pricing pressure.\n\nAdditionally, selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose significantly by KRW 186 billion, reaching KRW 564 billion, as the company ramped up marketing efforts and expanded operational costs following the IDT Biologika acquisition. Consequently, operating profit deteriorated further, posting a KRW 508 billion loss, compared to a KRW 84 billion loss in Q4 2023, reflecting a KRW 424 billion decline.\n\nAt the bottom line, net profit fell from KRW 42 billion in Q4 2023 to a net loss of KRW 27 billion in Q4 2024, a YoY decline of KRW 69 billion. While revenue showed strong upward momentum, rising operational costs and declining margins in key vaccine segments hindered overall profitability. Moving forward, SK Bioscience is expected to focus on operational efficiency and cost management, leveraging its expanded product portfolio and new business opportunities from the IDT Biologika acquisition to achieve long-term financial stability.\n\nSegment Performance\n\nSKYVaricella : Exports increased due to PAHO orders .\n\nSanofi vaccine distribution : Sales grew from KRW 7.5 billion in Q3 to KRW 8.4 billion in Q4 .\n\nFlu and Zoster vaccines : Revenue declined due to pricing competition and market saturation .\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nTotal Assets : Increased to KRW 2.84 trillion due to IDT acquisition .\n\nCash & Equivalents : Declined to KRW 1.16 trillion from KRW 1.27 trillion .\n\nNet Cash Position : KRW 774 billion , showing a reduction due to investment activities.\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio : Increased to 21% from 19% in Q3 .\n\nBusiness Developments\n\nPipeline & R&D\n\nSK Bioscience made significant advancements in its Pipeline & R&D efforts in Q4 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to innovation and global vaccine development. A major milestone was the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials for PCV21 in Australia, the U.S., and Korea, marking a crucial step toward regulatory approval for this next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Additionally, the company expanded its co-development partnership with Sanofi for the NextGen PCV, which is expected to enhance vaccine efficacy and broaden market reach.\n\nFurther strengthening its global presence, SKYTyphoid received WHO Prequalification (PQ) certification, facilitating its entry into international procurement programs and increasing its availability in typhoid-endemic regions. This certification positions SK Bioscience to supply the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries through organizations such as Gavi and UNICEF.\n\nIn the field of Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), the company secured approval for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Australia, marking an important step toward expanding its vaccine portfolio in the vector-borne disease segment. Additionally, SK Bioscience continued its CEPI-supported mRNA vaccine project, focusing on pandemic preparedness and next-generation vaccine technology. This initiative aligns with the company\u2019s broader strategy to develop rapid-response vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, ensuring readiness for future global health challenges. These advancements reflect SK Bioscience\u2019s strategic focus on strengthening its R&D pipeline and expanding its global footprint in the vaccine industry.\n\nVaccine Distribution & Partnerships\n\nSK Bioscience continued to strengthen its vaccine distribution and partnerships in Q4 2024, with notable expansions in collaboration with Sanofi. The partnership now includes RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and Hepatitis A vaccines, further broadening the company\u2019s vaccine portfolio and reinforcing its position in the global immunization market. This expansion allows SK Bioscience to leverage Sanofi\u2019s extensive distribution network, increasing accessibility to essential vaccines in various regions.\n\nThe company also reported significant growth in sales of five key Sanofi vaccines during Q4, reflecting increasing market demand and successful distribution strategies. Among these, Beyfortus, an RSV antibody designed for infant protection, gained strong market traction, expanding its use beyond high-risk groups to a broader infant population. This growth aligns with the rising global emphasis on RSV prevention, especially as countries prioritize immunization programs for newborns and young children.\n\nAdditionally, Hexaxim, Sanofi\u2019s six-in-one pediatric vaccine, was officially included in the National Immunization Program (NIP) in January 2025, ensuring wider public access through government-supported immunization efforts. This milestone is expected to drive long-term revenue growth and enhance SK Bioscience\u2019s presence in the pediatric vaccine sector. By deepening its collaboration with Sanofi and expanding its role in national vaccination programs, SK Bioscience is well-positioned to further strengthen its vaccine portfolio and global market influence.\n\nManufacturing & Global Expansion\n\nAndong site expansion to increase production and product diversity .\n\nThai joint venture established for Southern Hemisphere market expansion .\n\nSongdo R&D center pilot plant construction underway.\n\nOutlook for 2025 and Beyond\n\nSK Bioscience has set an ambitious growth trajectory for 2025 and beyond, with a target compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% or more by 2028. This goal is underpinned by strategic global expansion, leveraging key partnerships to strengthen its market presence and increase vaccine accessibility worldwide. By collaborating with industry leaders like Sanofi and global health organizations, the company aims to expand its footprint in both established and emerging markets, ensuring sustained revenue growth.\n\nA crucial component of this expansion strategy is the full integration of IDT Biologika, a German contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that SK Bioscience acquired in 2024. The integration is expected to drive the company\u2019s biotech business expansion, enhancing its capabilities in vaccine production and biologics manufacturing. This move positions SK Bioscience as a leading global player in contract manufacturing, allowing it to diversify beyond traditional vaccine development and capitalize on new business opportunities in the broader biopharmaceutical sector.\n\nAdditionally, the company is poised for multiple product launches in 2025, particularly in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) vaccines, and next-generation flu vaccines. These differentiated vaccines will cater to unmet medical needs and evolving global health challenges, reinforcing SK Bioscience\u2019s commitment to innovation. With a strong R&D pipeline, expanding global collaborations, and enhanced manufacturing capabilities, SK Bioscience is well-positioned to achieve long-term sustainable growth and further establish itself as a key player in the global vaccine industry.\n\nSK Bioscience showed strong revenue growth, but operational profitability was impacted by declining COVID-19 vaccine sales and higher SG&A expenses. The acquisition of IDT Biologika, expansion of key vaccine markets, and ongoing clinical developments position the company for future growth, with 2025 expected to be a turnaround year.",

            "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC's Merilog (insulin-aspart-szjj) becomes the first rapid-acting insulin biosimilar product to get its approval for the treatment of diabetes in adults and pediatric patients.\n\nMerilog has been approved as biosimilar to Novolog (insulin aspart) for the improvement of glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. The approval is for both a 3 milliliter or mL single-patient-use prefilled pen and a 10 mL multiple-dose vial.\n\nAs a rapid-acting human insulin, Merilog helps to lower mealtime blood sugar spikes to improve control of blood sugar in people with diabetes.\n\nLike Novolog, Merilog is required to be administered within five to ten minutes prior to the start of a meal. Merilog is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection into the stomach, buttocks, thighs or upper arms. Merilog's dosing needs to be individualized and adjusted based on the patient's needs.\n\nMeanwhile, Merilog may cause serious side effects, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), severe allergic reactions and hypokalemia (low potassium in blood). It may also cause other common side effects such as injection site reactions, itching, rash, lipodystrophy (skin thickening or pitting at the injection site), weight gain and swelling of hands and feet.\n\nSarah Yim, director of the Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said, \"For the millions of people who rely on daily injections of insulin for treatment of diabetes, having a biosimilar option for their rapid-acting insulin injection can truly make a difference, as biosimilar products have the potential to increase access to these life-saving medications.\"\n\nThe FDA noted that Merilog is the third insulin biosimilar product to get its approval. In 2021, the agency had approved two long-acting insulin biosimilar products.\n\nA biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to, and has no clinically meaningful differences from, a biological product already approved by the FDA. It gives the same safety and effectiveness from the biosimilar as from the reference product.\n\nAccording to the FDA, approval of biosimilar products can increase patient access to safe and effective treatment options. So far, the FDA has approved 65 biosimilar products for a variety of conditions.\n\nFor More Such Health News, visit rttnews.com\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\n\nBusiness News",

This entry is not much of a \u201cmix,\u201d per se, but here we go\u2026\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) in 2020, Operation Warp Speed was designed to \u201cdeliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021, as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (collectively known as countermeasures).\u201d\n\nHere are some of the companies initially chosen (funding amount in parentheses) to attempt doing what\u2019s never been done before (deliver \u201ca safe, effective vaccine\u201d in less than one year):\n\nJohnson & Johnson ($1 billion)\n\nAstraZeneca - University of Oxford ($1.2 billion)\n\nPfizer/BioNTech ($2 billion)\n\nModerna ($483 million)\n\nNovavax ($1.6 billion)\n\nSanofi and GlaxoSmithKline ($2.1 billion)\n\nFor the record, neither Novavax nor Moderna had previously brought a vaccine to market.\n\nRelated HHS funding includes:\n\nApiJect: $138 million contract for more than 100 million pre-filled syringes for distribution across the United States by year-end 2020, as well as the development of manufacturing capacity for the ultimate production goal of over 500 million pre-filled syringes in 2021.\n\nCorning: $204 million to expand the domestic manufacturing capacity to produce an additional 164 million Valor Glass vials each year if needed.\n\nSiO2 Materials Science: $143 million to ramp up capacity to produce the company\u2019s glass-coated plastic container, which can be used for drugs and vaccines.\n\nThe original chief advisor of the Operation Warp Speed project was Moncef Slaoui. A few things to consider about Dr. Slaoui:\n\nUp until his recent appointment, he was a board member of Moderna.\n\nSlaoui divested his shares in Moderna stock, at a potential personal gain of $10 million (the share value of Moderna stock increased by $3 million in one day when the company announced an advance in vaccine clinical research).\n\nIn May 2020, Slaoui promised to donate any excess Moderna stock earnings to \u201ccancer research.\u201d As of this writing, I can find no evidence that he has done this.\n\nSlaoui also owns stock in another of the funded companies, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). He said this stock represented his retirement after 29 years at the company and if asked to sell it, he would not take this federal position.\n\nSlaoui was subsequently not asked to sell the GSK stock and thereby accepted the powerful appointment.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Dr. Slaoui was not a federal employee and was instead \u201cworking under a $1 contract that exempted him from federal rules that would require him to list his outside positions, stock holdings, and other potential conflicts.\u201d\n\nTwo watchdog groups \u2014 Public Citizen and Lower Drug Prices Now \u2014 said Slaoui\u2019s $1 contract appeared \u201cdesigned primarily to allow Slaoui to maintain an extensive web of conflicting financial interests without the need to divest of, recuse from or disclose those conflicting interests\u201d and \u201cprovides Slaoui with the opportunity to enrich himself, his colleagues and his employers.\u201d\n\nReminder: DOGE is just another form of \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d \u2014 like when the police or the military investigate themselves and conveniently find the precise result that benefits them most.\n\nPLEASE trade your pride-driven gullibility for divine discernment and keep listening for that still, small voice.\n\nIn closing, a mix of sorts\u2026\n\nP.S. I know I said I wouldn\u2019t be posting on Saturdays for a while so please don\u2019t report me to DOGE for fraud\u2026\n\n********************************************************************\n\nI\u2019M NOW ACCEPTING DONATIONS VIA CASH, CHECK, AND SNAIL MAIL\u2026\n\nFriends, I could use your support for my ongoing mission of 8-plus years to help homeless women and other vulnerable souls on the streets of NYC.

No safety signals related to the vaccine candidate were identified, and throughout the study, investigators ensured that participants who developed IED received prompt treatment and care. As a result of the IDMC\u2019s determination, the E.mbrace study is being discontinued.\n\nIn October 2023, Sanofi entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company to develop and commercialize the vaccine candidate.\n\nAbout the Study\n\nThe E.mbrace study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, interventional phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of the vaccine candidate compared to a placebo in the prevention of IED, which includes sepsis and bacteremia (blood infections). The study was initiated in June 2021 enrolling adults aged 60 years or older in stable health with a history of urinary tract infection in the past two years.\n\n\u201cE. coli sepsis is a devastating disease and there are no preventative measures available to date. Driven by our ambition to transform the practice of medicine, we entered this ambitious although challenging field,\u201d remarked Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint, Global Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi. \u201cWe are disappointed to see that the vaccine was not associated with sufficient efficacy to support the trial continuation, and we will work tirelessly to understand the factors behind the IDMC\u2019s finding and to share further analysis once available.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile disappointed by this outcome, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive innovation in R&D by developing first and best-in-class vaccines in areas of high unmet need,\u201d he added.\n\nAs a result of the discontinuation, Sanofi has recorded an impairment charge before tax of $250 million in the Q4 2024 IFRS results.",

            "content": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 22.4x Sanofi India Limited ( ) may be sending bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in India have P/E ratios greater than 28x and even P/E's higher than 52x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Sanofi India's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. The P/E is probably low because investors think this poor earnings performance isn't going to get any better. If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs There Any Growth For Sanofi India?\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should underperform the market for P/E ratios like Sanofi India's to be considered reasonable.\n\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 11%. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 46% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.\n\nTurning to the outlook, the next year should bring diminished returns, with earnings decreasing 24% as estimated by the two analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the broader market is forecast to expand by 25%, which paints a poor picture.\n\nWith this information, we are not surprised that Sanofi India is trading at a P/E lower than the market. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Sanofi India's P/E\n\nTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nWe've established that Sanofi India maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.\n\nHaving said that, be aware in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is potentially serious.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

(more)\n\nSchool Vaccine Mandates Should States Be Allowed to Mandate Vaccines for School Attendance? Ask the Chatbot a Question Ask the Chatbot a Question\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTable of Contents Ask the Chatbot\n\nNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System In 1986 the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed in response to a large number of lawsuits filed claiming vaccines were causing adverse reactions including brain damage and death. The act shielded medical professionals and vaccine manufacturers from liability if an individual suffered injury from receiving vaccines. The act mandated that vaccine injury claims be filed with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims rather than filed directly against physicians or vaccine manufacturers in civil court. Unlike civil court, people filing injury claims are not required to prove negligence or failure to warn; they only need to prove that a vaccine caused injury. [14][15][16] On Oct. 1, 1988, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. The VICP was \u201cestablished to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines, stabilize vaccine costs, and establish and maintain an accessible and efficient forum for individuals found to be injured by certain vaccines.\u201d Between 1989 and July 1, 2014, 3,645 compensation awards have been made (amounting to over $2.7 billion in awards and $113.2 million to cover legal costs) and 9,786 claims have been dismissed (amounting to $62.8 million paid to 4,925 dismissed claimants to cover legal costs). [17] Subsequently, in 1990 the CDC and FDA created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS collects information about adverse events via reports filed by anyone, including medical professionals and family members. VAERS receives about 30,000 reports each year. 85-90% of VAERS reports are for \u201cmild adverse events such as fever, local reactions [such as redness at the injection site], and episodes or crying or mild irritability.\u201d The other 10-15% of VAERS reports is for \u201cserious adverse events involving life-threatening conditions, hospitalization, permanent disability, or death, which may or may not have been caused by a vaccine.\u201d [18] In 1993 the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Childhood Immunization Act of 1993 that created the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to provide vaccinations free of charge to children in need in order to increase the number of vaccinated children. [19]\n\nAndrew Wakefield and the Autism Controversy In Feb. 1998 Lancet published an article by Andrew Wakefield titled \u201cIleal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non-Specific Colitis, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children.\u201d The article claimed \u201cRubella virus is associated with autism and the combined measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccine \u2026 has also been implicated.\u201d Anti-vaccination groups and parents began using Wakefield\u2019s article as rationale to opt-out of vaccinating their children. [20] Between 2003 and 2012, Brian Deer, an investigative reporter, examined the story and published 36 articles that accused Wakefield of \u201cfalsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture, which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare.\u201d On March 3, 2004, ten of the twelve co-authors of Wakefield\u2019s article released a \u201cRetraction of an Interpretation\u201d in Lancet, stating \u201cWe wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.\u201d Lancet retracted Wakefield\u2019s article on Feb. 2, 2010, stating \u201cit has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al are incorrect.\u201d On Jan. 5, 2011, the British Journal of Medicine published an article stating that Wakefield received over $674,000 from lawyers and that, of 12 children examined, five had developmental problems before being vaccinated and three never had autism. [21][22][23][24] As a result, on May 24, 2011, Britain stripped Wakefield of his medical license, stating Wakefield had \u201cabused his position of trust\u201d and \u201cbrought the medical profession into disrepute.\u201d Wakefield contends that the investigation of his work is part of a conspiracy to \u201cdiscredit and silence his research\u201d in order to \u201cshield the government from exposure on the vaccine scandal.\u201d [21][25]\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine On Oct. 20, 2022, the CDC voted to add the coronavirus vaccine to the schedule of recommended vaccines for children and adults. However, only California (effective July 1, 2023) and D.C. (effective for the 2022-2023 school year) have announced the intent to require the COVID-19 vaccine and both will require only fully FDA approved coronavirus vaccines for the recommended age groups, which are the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (brand name Comirnaty) for children 12 and up, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (brand name Spikevax) for those 18 and up (which could include some high school students) as of Oct. 24, 2022. [134][135][136][137][138]\n\nPotential Consequences for Unvaccinated Children and Their Parents State laws in North Carolina, Ohio, and New York allow the public school system to suspend children who are not vaccinated. Approximately 2,000 seventh- to twelfth-grade children not vaccinated against pertussis (whooping cough) were barred from attending classes in San Francisco in 2011. On June 22, 2014, federal Judge William Kuntz upheld New York state law barring unvaccinated children from public school when other children have chickenpox. Many pediatricians will not treat children who have not been vaccinated. Some legal experts believe that parents who do not vaccinate their children should be subject to criminal prosecution (including criminally negligent homicide and monetary damages) if their unvaccinated children infect and harm other children who are too young or immunocompromised to receive vaccines. [36][37][38][39][40][41][42] Despite potential consequences, an Aug. 7, 2024, Gallup poll found that \u201cfewer Americans today consider childhood vaccines important, with 40% saying it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019 and 64% in 2001. There has been a similar decline in the combined \u2018extremely\u2019 and \u2018very important\u2019 percentage, which was 94% in 2001 but sits at 69% today.\u201d [147]\n\nEradication and Elimination of Disease Elimination means that the disease is not present in a region, while eradication means that the disease does not exist anywhere globally. Polio was declared eliminated in the United States in 1979 and in the Western Hemisphere in 1994. Rubella was declared eliminated in the Americas on Apr. 29, 2015, and measles on Sept. 27, 2016. Smallpox was declared globally eradicated in 1980, the first and only disease to be eradicated thus far. The World Health Organization states that eradication and elimination is the product of vaccination programs that promote high rates of inoculation, while those opposed to vaccination state that better sanitation and clean water led to the elimination of the diseases. [16][117][118][119][120] So, should states be allowed to mandate vaccines for school attendance?

Coli) after results were found to be underwhelming.\n\nThe multinational healthcare giant put a stop to the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04899336) after an independent interim analysis found that the vaccine, known as ExPEC, failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in preventing the invasive disease compared to placebo.\n\nIn October of 2023, Sanofi and J&J entered an agreement that saw Sanofi pay out $250m upfront. Originally initiated in 2021, the trial enrolled nearly 20,000 participants at 250 sites across five continents, with J&J subsidiary Janssen Research & Development heading up the process. The trial specifically sought to recruit patients aged 60 and above with a recent history of urinary tract infection.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint, global head of research and development in vaccines at Sanofi, said: \u201cWe are disappointed to see that the vaccine was not associated with sufficient efficacy to support the trial continuation, and we will work tirelessly to understand the factors behind the IDMC\u2019s finding and to share further analysis once available.\n\n\u201cWhile disappointed by this outcome, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive innovation in R&D by developing first and best-in-class vaccines in areas of high unmet need.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement, Sanofi recorded an impairment charge before tax of $250m, but stated there had been no resulting impact to its net income.\n\nResearch by GlobalData estimates that if the drug had been successful, it would have generated sales of around $464m by the end of 2030. Of that, more than half was forecast to come from the US market.\n\nE. Coli typically manifests as food poisoning that stemmed from undercooked or poorly stored food. While some strains of E. Coli can generally be tolerated, the infection can, in severe cases, result in death.\n\nThe US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the O157:H7 strain E. Coli causes 73,000 illnesses across the US annually.\n\nElsewhere in the E. Coli space, the US Army has awarded a contract to develop bacteriophages to treat uropathogenic E.

The vaccine was designed to fight extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, a leading cause of sepsis in older adults.\n\nBut the vaccine was \u201cnot sufficiently effective\u201d at preventing invasive E. coli disease based on the pre-planned interim analysis, Sanofi said Thursday. The research found no concerns with safety, and further analyses will be shared in the future, the company said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe study failure offers a disappointing end to Sanofi\u2019s collaboration of a little more than a year with J&J. The two companies were co-funding research and development and planned to share profits in major markets including the U.S. Sanofi had high hopes for the vaccine, at one point telling investors it could bring in between 2 billion and 5 billion euros, or as much as about $5.2 billion, in peak sales.\n\nAs part of the October 2023 deal, Sanofi paid J&J $175 million up front and agreed to future payments based on development and commercial milestones. On Thursday, Sanofi said the payments to J&J during the partnership totaled $250 million.\n\nAs a result, the French drugmaker recorded an impairment charge before tax of $250 million in the fourth quarter and will adjust earnings reported on Jan. 30.

            "content": "Update on extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli vaccine phase 3 clinical study\n\nIndependent interim analysis of the E.mbrace phase 3 study finds that the vaccine candidate didn\u2019t demonstrate sufficient efficacy in preventing invasive E. coli disease\n\nNo safety signals related to the vaccine candidate were identified\n\nParis, February 13, 2025. A scheduled review of the E.mbrace phase 3 study (clinical trial identifier: NCT04899336) conducted by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) determined that Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli was not sufficiently effective at preventing invasive E. coli disease (IED) compared to placebo. No safety signals related to the vaccine candidate were identified and, throughout the study, investigators ensured that participants who developed IED received prompt treatment and care. As a result of the IDMC\u2019s determination, the E.mbrace study is being discontinued.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Toussaint\n\nGlobal Head of Research and Development Vaccines, Sanofi\n\n\u201cE. coli sepsis is a devastating disease and there are no preventative measures available to date. Driven by our ambition to transform the practice of medicine, we entered this ambitious although challenging field. We are disappointed to see that the vaccine was not associated with sufficient efficacy to support the trial continuation, and we will work tirelessly to understand the factors behind the IDMC\u2019s finding and to share further analysis once available. We are grateful to the participants, families and healthcare professionals involved in this development program. While disappointed by this outcome, we remain steadfast in our commitment to drive innovation in R&D by developing first and best-in-class vaccines in areas of high unmet need.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, Sanofi entered into an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company to develop and commercialize the vaccine candidate. Under the terms of the agreement, both parties agreed to co-fund current and future research and development costs. Sanofi paid $250 million in upfront and development milestones to be followed by commercial milestones.\n\nThe E.mbrace study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, interventional phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single dose of the vaccine candidate compared to a placebo in the prevention of IED, which includes sepsis and bacteremia (blood infections).\n\nThe study was initiated in June 2021 enrolling adults aged 60 years or older in stable health with a history of urinary tract infection in the past two years. The study was conducted at over 250 sites across five continents. Janssen Research & Development, LLC, is the trial sponsor and responsible party and will continue appropriate safety follow up for the currently enrolled participants.\n\nFinancial considerations\n\nAs a result of the discontinuation, Sanofi has recorded an impairment charge before tax of $250 million in the Q4 2024 IFRS results. This adjustment impacts negatively the full-year IFRS EPS reported in the Q4 2024 results press release on January 30, 2025, by \u20ac0.15 from \u20ac4.59 previously to \u20ac4.44 now. This adjustment will be included in Sanofi\u2019s Form 20-F for 2024 to be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, there is no impact to the business net income / business EPS remaining unchanged respectively at \u20ac8,912 million / \u20ac7.12 (non-IFRS). There is no change to the financial guidance for 2025.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives. Our team, across the world, is dedicated to transforming the practice of medicine by working to turn the impossible into the possible.

Additionally, ongoing research efforts aimed at better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Otitis Media signaling in Otitis Media are likely to uncover new therapeutic targets and further expand treatment options for patients.Otitis Media Treatment Market LandscapeAntibiotics are the mainstay of treatment of uncomplicated otitis media in adults, and initial antibiotic choice is determined by knowledge of the most common causative pathogens. The preferred antibacterial drug for the patient with AOM must be active against S. pneumoniae, nontypeable H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. The treatment of otitis media is not always appropriate, and the long-term overuse of antibiotics reduces the effectiveness of treatment and places children at risk for drug-resistant infections. Further vaccination is recommended due to lack of effective therapies. There is a need for effective therapies. The Otitis Media treatment market landscape has witnessed significant advancements over the past years, with targeted therapies playing a crucial role in improving outcomes for patients. Among these targeted therapies, the emergence of Otitis Media has garnered attention in the medical community, presenting both challenges and opportunities in treatment strategies.To know more about Otitis Media treatment guidelines, visit @ Otitis Media Treatment Market Landscape-Otitis Media Market OutlookThe report's outlook on the Otitis Media market aids in developing a comprehensive understanding of historical, current, and projected trends. This is achieved by examining the influence of existing Otitis Media therapies, unmet needs, as well as drivers, barriers, and the demand for advanced technology. This section provides detailed insights into the trends of each marketed Otitis Media drug and late-stage pipeline therapy.Otitis Media Drugs Uptake\u2022 V114 being developed by Merck, consists of pneumococcal polysaccharides from 15 serotypes conjugated to a CRM197 carrier protein and includes serotypes 22F and 33F, which are commonly associated with invasive pneumococcal disease worldwide and are not contained in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently licensed for use in adults. Currently, the drug is in Phase III stage of clinical trial evaluation for the treatment of Acute Otitis Media, and has been approved in Europe.\u2022 VAX-24 being developed by Vaxcyte, is a clinical-stage 24-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) designed to improve upon existing vaccines by covering the serotypes responsible for most of the remaining pneumococcal disease currently in circulation. It is being developed for the treatment of otitis media. Vaxcyte aims to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity, broad-spectrumvaccines, such as VAX-24, by using modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and the XpressCF cell-free protein synthesis platform. Vaxcyte is deploying this approach with VAX-24 in order to add more pneumococcal strains without compromising the overall immune response. The company plans for VAX-24 (adults), end-of-Phase II meeting with FDA in 2H 2023, with Phase III pivotal immunogenicity data in 2025. While for infants Phase II study is enrolling subjects with topline data from the primary threedose immunization series by 2025.\u2022 CMTX-301 being developed by Clarametyx' is using anti-DNABII technology through a vaccination approach in at-risk populations. This approach prevents the development of bacterial biofilm, enabling the body's normal immune responses to more effectively destroy bacterial pathogens. The first targeted indication is otitis media. Preventing formation of biofilm and eliminating bacteria at potential infection sites will reduce the incidence of otitis media, and thus reduce antibiotic usage. The drug is under preclinical developmentMajor Otitis Media CompaniesSeveral Otitis Media Companies working in the market include Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck, Vaxcyte, Clarametyx Biosciences, Blue Water Biotech, Abbott, Otonomy, Inc., Alcon Research, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Currax Pharmaceuticals, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Replidyne, Salvat, Otic Therapy, and othersLearn more about the FDA-approved drugs for Otitis Media @ Drugs for Otitis Media Treatment-Scope of the Otitis Media Market Research Report\u2022 Coverage- 7MM\u2022 Study Period- 2019-2032\u2022 Otitis Media Companies- Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck, Vaxcyte, Clarametyx Biosciences, Blue Water Biotech, Abbott, Otonomy, Inc., Alcon Research, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Currax Pharmaceuticals, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Replidyne, Salvat, Otic Therapy, and others\u2022 Otitis Media Pipeline Therapies- V114, VAX-24, CMTX-301, S. pneumoniae vaccine, cefdinir, Augmentin (ES)-600, OTO-201 (ciprofloxacin), Moxidex otic, Telithromycin (HMR3647), AR01, Antipyrine and Benzocaine, ofloxacin otic solution, levofloxacin, Faropenem Medoxomil, Zmax, benzocaine, DF289, Benzocaine, and others.\u2022 Otitis Media Market Dynamics: Otitis Media Market Drivers and Barriers\u2022 Otitis Media Market Access and Reimbursement, Unmet Needs, KOL's Views, and Analyst's ViewsDiscover more about Otitis Media Drugs in development @ Otitis Media Clinical Trials Assessment-Table of Content1.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best International Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) stands against the other international dividend stocks.\n\nDividend stocks have been grabbing investors' attention for a while now. According to JP Morgan, over the last two decades, global dividends per share have increased at an annual rate of 5.6%, but analysts expect this to rise to 7.6% in the future, driven by historically low payout ratios. During the 2020 pandemic, many companies cut dividends, but as earnings have recovered, especially in Big Tech and AI, dividends have not kept up. With payout ratios at 25-year lows, simply returning to normal could add 2% annual growth over the next five years.\n\nAfter slowing down post-COVID, global dividend growth made a surprising comeback last year, increasing 8% and adding an extra $180 billion in payouts despite ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges. According to S&P Global, this was largely driven by record dividend initiations in US tech, European banks, Japan\u2019s auto industry, and solid growth from China. Even oil and gas companies held strong despite market volatility. Looking ahead, experts predict global dividends will hold steady at $2.3 trillion in 2025.\n\nRegionally, developed Asia, which includes Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, and Singapore, is looking at a 3% rise in dividends this year. Europe, on the other hand, is expected to see a 3.4% decline. In emerging markets, the trends are mixed. Asia, led by China, India, and Taiwan, is on track for a 5% increase, while dividends in the Middle East and Africa could drop by 20%, mainly because Saudi Aramco\u2019s special dividend program ended. Latin America is also expected to see a small dip of around 4%.\n\nWhen it comes to sectors, banks and energy companies remain the biggest dividend payers. Banks are expected to distribute around $380 billion globally, but after four years of rapid 20% growth, they are now down to just 2%. Banks are playing it safe, waiting to see how interest rates move. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best international dividend stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the BlackRock International Dividend ETF to filter out dividend stocks listed on US exchanges but headquartered internationally. We focused on picking stocks that were most popular among hedge funds. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of Q3 2024 hedge fund sentiment, and dividend yields are mentioned as of February 11.",

            "content": "\n\n\n\nAs Saudi Arabia moves toward healthcare self-sufficiency under Vision 2030, the localization of vital pharmaceutical manufacturing has become a critical priority. In a major step forward, Sanofi, which signed last year an offtake agreement with Sudair Pharma Company (SPC) and NUPCO, is transferring its global expertise in insulin production to the Kingdom, ensuring a more resilient supply of high-quality treatment for diabetes patients.\n\n\n\nLama Saleh, General Manager for General Medicines for Sanofi KSA & Gulf, said that, with a diabetes prevalence rate of 18.7%, (IDF Atlas 10th edition, IDF T1D index report) among the highest in the world, Saudi Arabia faces an urgent need to secure a stable and reliable supply of insulin. Historically reliant on imports, the Kingdom is now shifting toward localized production, a move that will significantly enhance national drug security and ensure greater access to life-saving treatment for hundreds of thousands of patients.\n\n\n\nLama Saleh underscores the importance of this strategic partnership in strengthening healthcare resilience. Through the collaboration with Sudair Pharma and NUPCO, Sanofi is bringing its century-long expertise in diabetes care to Saudi Arabia, establishing with SPC a state-of-the-art insulin production facility that will manufacture, assemble, and package advanced SoloStar insulin pens within the Kingdom.\n\n\n\nOnce fully operational, the facility will have the capacity to produce approximately 15 million insulin pens annually, meeting the treatment needs of 500,000 patients across Saudi Arabia. This production milestone is expected to cover 70% of diabetic patients receiving insulin in the Kingdom, significantly reducing dependency on external supply chains and bolstering pharmaceutical security.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis initiative is about more than manufacturing; it\u2019s about ensuring that patients have consistent access to high-quality insulin, produced locally to meet their needs,\u201d says Saleh. \u201cThrough technology transfer, we are helping strengthen Saudi Arabia\u2019s healthcare infrastructure and contributing to a future where essential medicines are always within reach.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Strategic Move Toward Vision 2030\n\n\n\nThe localization of insulin production aligns with the broader Health Sector Transformation Program, a key pillar of Vision 2030 that focuses on improving healthcare accessibility, advancing medical innovation, and strengthening national pharmaceutical capabilities. By developing high-tech manufacturing facilities and investing in specialized local talent, this initiative supports Saudi Arabia\u2019s goal of becoming a regional hub for biopharmaceutical production.\n\n\n\nFor Sanofi, this investment goes beyond meeting immediate patient needs. It is also about building local expertise, transferring knowledge, and fostering innovation within the Kingdom. \u201cWe are not just producing insulin. We are paving the way for the next generation of Saudi professionals, equipping them with the skills and expertise to lead in life sciences and biopharmaceuticals,\" Saleh explains.\n\n\n\nA Future of Healthcare Self-Sufficiency\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to localize pharmaceutical production are gaining momentum, and the insulin manufacturing is considered as a bold move and a key milestone in achieving national healthcare resilience. With greater production capacity, advanced technology transfer, and investment in local expertise, the Kingdom is implementing its strategy to long-term healthcare sustainability.\n\n\n\nFor patients with diabetes, healthcare professionals, and the broader community, this shift marks a new era in Saudi Arabia\u2019s healthcare landscape\u2014one where high-quality, locally produced medicines drive better health outcomes for all.",

More info\n\nOlympic medallist Lina Nielsen is dispelling the misconceptions behind multiple sclerosis with the new MS without Barriers campaign, in a bid to assist others on their own diagnosis journey.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who helped Team GB win bronze in the women's 4x400m at Paris 2024 last summer, was diagnosed with MS aged 17 and initially believed that her athletics dreams were over due to her lack of education around the chronic disease.\n\nFrom assuming that it only affected the elderly to now leading a brand-new campaign on how MS can affect anyone, Nielsen knows that she's come far in those 11 years.\n\n\"I got diagnosed and the only place I had ever seen MS was in a biology textbook for A-Level,\" she said.\n\n\"I remember so clearly that the image in the textbook was an older man in a wheelchair, and I thought 'that can't be me, this can't be the correct diagnosis' since I was a young woman who hadn't even turned 18 yet.\n\n\"So, I had those misconceptions myself and was therefore in denial.\n\n\"I was scared because I thought I would be in a wheelchair and my life would completely change and I could never continue my dreams of going to an Olympics.\"\n\nMS is an autoimmune neurological condition, affecting the brain and spinal cord, where the body own immune system attacks its nerves. MS affects 2.5 times more women than men.\n\nBut Nielsen and her identical twin sister Laviai, who was also diagnosed with MS in 2021, have proved first hand that MS doesn't have to define your abilities, both having represented Team GB on the athletics track and won bronze medals at Paris 2024. MS affects everybody differently, presenting different challenges to overcome.\n\nAnd with her dreams of becoming an Olympian finally coming true, the runner is now looking forward to pushing herself further to keep her spot in that pivotal relay.\n\n\"That relay completely changed my life,\" she said.\n\n\"Getting five out of five medals in Paris, people are now wanting to make these relay teams, it is really powerful.\n\n\"We've shown what it can look like and how it progresses.\"\n\nIt is estimated there are over 150,000 people with MS in the UK, around one in every 400 people, and Nielsen has joined forces with global pharmaceutical company Sanofi to form the campaign 'MS without Barriers' to promote awareness and education around the disease.\n\nAs well as public education via the media and social media, Nielsen will also be joining a delegation to the House of Commons later this year to discuss ways to support the MS community and admitted that she is thrilled to be at the forefront of a campaign she is so passionate about.\n\n\"Whenever I speak about MS, I think about someone who might be newly diagnosed and is figuring out how to navigate life and what this means for them,\" she said.\n\n\"I will speak to them because when I was diagnosed, I wish I had someone there to show how you could continue living life to the best that you can and to not let it limit you.\n\n\"My platform only goes so far so I'm really glad I have the partnership with Sanofi and to be working with the MS Society and MS Together.\n\n\"Hopefully we can remove some misconceptions about MS and provide education and awareness.\"\n\nMS without Barriers is a campaign led by Lina Nielsen in partnership with Sanofi, which aims to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis and address misunderstanding and stigma.

The treatment is indicated for patients aged 12 years and above with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) who have not responded to at least two prior lines of therapy, including cases with fibrosis.\n\nRezurock was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2021 and by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India in 2024. The approvals are based on safety and efficacy data from the ROCKstar trial, a randomised, open-label, multicentre pivotal study evaluating Rezurock in patients with cGVHD who had received two to five prior lines of systemic therapy.\n\nRezurock is administered orally once daily at a 200 mg dose. The trial reported an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 74 per cent, demonstrating responses across the spectrum of cGVHD. The treatment has been observed to be safe and well-tolerated, with adverse events aligning with those expected in patients receiving corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants.\n\nRodolfo Hrosz, Managing Director, Sanofi India, stated, \u201ccGVHD has a debilitating impact on the day-to-day functioning of those suffering from it. Treatment options for people suffering from it are very limited. This milestone reflects our dedication to addressing unmet medical needs in the transplant ecosystem and delivering breakthrough therapies for patients with this severe condition. The introduction of Rezurock reinforces Sanofi India\u2019s leadership in the field of immunology and transplant care.\u201d\n\nChronic graft-versus-host disease is a complication that can arise following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It results in inflammation and fibrosis across multiple tissues, including the skin, mouth, eyes, joints, liver, lungs, oesophagus, and gastrointestinal tract. The condition contributes to significant morbidity and mortality among affected patients.\n\nSanofi India has stated its commitment to working with healthcare professionals and stakeholders to ensure that Rezurock is accessible to patients across India.",

            "content": "A new drug has emerged that could create a turning point in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious complication that can occur after treatment for blood cancers.\n\nSanofi's Rezurock (belumosudil mesylate) has surfaced as a new hope for patients with chronic GVHD, and calls are growing for improving the treatment environment in Korea.\n\nGraft-versus-host disease is a complication that can occur in patients with blood cancer who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It is a severe disease that causes a host response that causes several life-threatening symptoms throughout the body.\n\nAs the transplanted cells adapt to the recipient body, i.e., the host, an immunologic response is triggered, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and other systemic damage. Graft-versus-host disease is the leading cause of non-relapsing mortality in patients with hematologic cancers, accounting for 37.8 percent of all non-relapsing deaths.\n\nTreatment of this disease has been limited to conventional steroids and JAK inhibitors, and many patients fail first- and second-line therapy and are faced with the reality that there is no longer appropriate treatment. Existing treatments have shown low response rates in major fibrotic organs, including the lungs and joints, and patients often have inadequate response rates.\n\n\u201cChronic graft-versus-host disease is a ticking time bomb that patients don't know when it will go off, as it manifests itself simultaneously throughout the entire body, starting with the oral mucosa and later on the skin, eyes, muscles, tendons, heart, and immune system,\u201d said Professor Park Yong of the Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology at the Korea University Anam Hospital.\n\nProfessor Park Yong\n\nProfessor Park explained that fibrosis irreversibly changes the tissue structure and stiffness increases. This can lead to permanent damage to organs, such as stiffened joints that make it difficult to move around or hardened lungs that make it harder to breathe, which can lead to problems with basic life functions.\n\nNotably, for organs that have been irreversibly damaged by fibrosis, currently, available treatments are ineffective, often providing only a symptomatic rather than curative treatment, creating a high unmet clinical need, Park added.\n\nRezurock is the first treatment to selectively inhibit the ROCK2 signaling pathway, which is responsible for inflammation and fibrosis in chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\nIn clinical trials in patients who have failed two or more systemic therapies, Rezurock demonstrated a high overall response rate (ORR) of 75 percent, demonstrating superior effectiveness compared to existing therapies. In particular, the response rate was 71 percent, 39 percent, and 26 percent in the joints, liver, and lung, respectively, which are difficult to improve with existing therapies, showing promising results.\n\n\u201cClinicians and patients are excited about Rezurock because it was developed to target chronic graft-versus-host disease to control both inflammation and fibrosis, and the clinical data shows that it is expected to improve host responses in areas such as the lungs, liver, joints, and eyes, where existing therapies have been inadequate,\u201d Professor Park said. \u201cThe clinical interest in Rezurock is growing as we see cases of fibrosis-induced sclerosis being alleviated with the treatment.\u201d\n\nPark emphasized that graft-versus-host disease is associated with an increased risk of death and irreversible tissue damage the longer the disease progresses, so early treatment is critical. Despite the current lack of an appropriate treatment after second-line therapy, many patients in Korea are not eligible for health insurance coverage, so government support through reimbursement is urgently needed to ensure that patients do not miss out on treatment opportunities.\n\nLast October, Sanofi announced its plans to apply for reimbursement at a news conference to celebrate Rezulock\u2019s approval in Korea. Industry insiders are interested in seeing if this year marks a turning point in the country's treatment landscape for chronic graft-versus-host disease patients.",

They informed me that they have run out of stock, but it will be restocked in early March,\u201d said Dr Dzulkefly.\n\n\u201cThey are, however, planning to switch to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) come September this year.\u201d\n\nTIV protects against three different Influenza viruses, while Sanofi flu shots protect against influenza A and B strains.\n\n\u201cThe influenza vaccine supply situation in Malaysia highlights some challenges in ensuring the stability of product availability, particularly for quadrivalent vaccines,\u201d said Dr Dzulkefly.\n\n\u201cThere are four registered influenza vaccine brands, but currently, only two are actively available on the market \u2013 namely Vaxigrip Tetra (Sanofi) and Influvac Tetra (Abbott) \u2013 which are supplied under the contract with the Health Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cFluarix Tetra (GSK) is no longer marketed, and SKYCellflu (Pharmaniaga Marketing, SK Bioscience Korea) has no stock in the country,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an unexpected surge in demand for influenza vaccines, affecting the supply of the two remaining products.\u201d\n\nSaid Dr Dzulkefly: \u201cSanofi is working to secure supplies from Thailand and France to meet demand in the private sector, while Abbott, although still having stock, has commitments tied to its contract with the Health Ministry. The Pharmacy Services Programme is closely monitoring the vaccine supply in Health Ministry facilities, and the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency is also in communication with the product registration holders to ensure a smooth supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese proactive measures are crucial to ensure that the influenza vaccines meet the current demand, especially in efforts to strengthen public health protection during the flu season,\u201d said Dr Dzulkefly.\n\nThe Star reported that Federation of Private Medical Practitioners Associations Malaysia president Shanmuganathan T.V. Ganeson had said some vaccines are out of stock.\n\nGeneral practitioners are reported to be seeing a spike in demand following the death of Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu, from a flu in Japan recently.\n\n\u201cThere is currently no stock. None in Sanofi, Zuellig or third-party drug reseller companies,\u201d said Dr Shanmuganathan.\n\n\u201cThe new batch of vaccines, both Fluarix and Vaxigrip, may be available by early March.\u201d THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

They informed me that they have run out of stock, but it will be restocked in early March,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThey are, however, planning to switch to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) come September this year,\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the name implies, TIV protect against three influenza strains, typically H1N1 and H3N2 from the influenza A family, and one strain of influenza B. Vaccines now in use locally are quadrivalent, offering protection against four strains.\n\nIncreased awareness following the Covid-19 pandemic has led to higher global demand for flu vaccines, which has been compounded by manufacturing delays and global supply chain disruptions as well as outbreaks of bird flu globally.\n\nDzulkefly explained that Malaysia currently relies on two main flu vaccine brands, Vaxigrip Tetra (Sanofi) and Influvac Tetra (Abbott), both supplied under government contracts.\n\nOf the two, there is a shortage of Vaxigrip Tetra, with Dzulkely saying Sanofi is attempting to source additional stock from Thailand and France.\n\n\u201cFluarix Tetra (GSK) is no longer marketed, and SKYCellflu (Pharmaniaga Marketing, SK Bioscience Korea) has no stock in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAuthorities are closely monitoring the situation, with the Pharmacy Services Programme and the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency working with manufacturers to ensure continued supply.\n\nRelated reading:",

            "content": "Regeneron revealed in its annual SEC report on Wednesday that it has sued Sanofi, claiming that its Dupixent partner \u201cbreached certain provisions\u201d of their agreement around the blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug.\n\nRegeneron claimed in its lawsuit that Sanofi had failed to provide it \u201cfull access to material information\u201d regarding Dupixent sales, especially contracts between Sanofi and pharmacy benefit managers and other payers, which include the discounts and rebates that establish the final pricing of Dupixent.\n\n\u201cBecause Regeneron and Defendants split Dupixent\u2019s profits in the United States, Regeneron effectively pays for half of these rebates and discounts,\u201d the suit read. \u201cIn violation of the Collaboration Agreement, Defendants have stonewalled Regeneron\u2019s repeated requests for full access to the PBM Agreements.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Regeneron claimed that Sanofi has blocked its attempts to \u201cfully audit their books and records related to Dupixent.\u201d Even without access to the PBM Agreements, Regeneron\u2019s independent audit \u201cidentified a significant monetary adjustment, many multiples of $75,000, that Defendants owed Regeneron in connection with commercializing Dupixent.\u201d The pharma suggests that it could unearth \u201ceven larger errors\u201d when given access to Sanofi\u2019s records.\n\nRegeneron filed its complaint in November last year with an amendment made a month later. The pharma is seeking declaratory judgement, injunctive relief and damages.\n\n\u201cWe are in full compliance with the terms of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron,\u201d a Sanofi spokesperson said in a statement emailed to BioSpace. \u201cWe remain focused on our shared priority with Regeneron - ensuring we continue to support the community of patients and caregivers who rely on Dupixent to treat their immunological conditions. We will not otherwise comment on the litigation.\u201d\n\nDupixent is a powerhouse pharma asset, indicated for atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and, most recently, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The biologic, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody, works by blocking IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, thus dampening the inflammatory response.\n\nDupixent is a critical asset for Regeneron. In 2024, the drug emerged as its top-selling product, with more than $14.1 billion in sales, a 22% increase from the year prior. Dupixent beat out other heavy hitters, including the cancer therapy Libtayo and the blockbuster eye franchise Eylea. In 2025, the company is awaiting further regulatory decisions for Dupixent, including for chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid.\n\nSanofi and Regeneron\u2019s Dupixent partnership started in 2007, when the French pharma paid $85 million upfront and promised up to $475 million in research funding disbursed in the five years following the contract. In exchange, Sanofi gained the right to co-develop several of Regeneron\u2019s assets, including the candidate that would become Dupixent.\n\nUpdate (February 7): This story has been updated to include a statement from Sanofi.",

Image credit: Shutterstock / LCV.\n\nJust days after taking back some of the stake held by L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Sanofi has agreed to repurchase its own shares worth \u20ac2bn ($2.08bn) from other stakeholders.\n\nThe French drugmaker said it had entered a mandate with an \u201cinvestment service provider\u201d, with the purchase occurring between 7 February and, at the latest, 31 December 2024. This second tranche of Sanofi\u2019s repurchase strategy for this year will be made through block trades and in the open market with the purpose of cancellation.\n\nGlobalData senior analyst Ophelia Chan said: \u201cThis large buyback is a reassuring signal on the company\u2019s stock price in the short term, but investors will be monitoring closely for Sanofi\u2019s long-term innovation and pipeline progress.\u201d\n\nSanofi declined to comment to Pharmaceutical Technology when asked for further details on the latest share buyback.\n\nShares in the Paris-listed company opened with a deficit of 2.8% on 7 February following the announcement but quickly rebounded by mid-morning.\n\nSanofi joins a growing list of big pharma companies gaining larger control in their businesses. This week, GSK launched a $2.5bn share buyback on the back of Q4 results that topped expectations. Eli Lilly also said it plans to buy back around $15bn in shares in a December 2024 announcement, amid the booming popularity of its diabetes and weight loss treatments.\n\nWith cash running high and room to boost its earnings per share, Sanofi announced its intention to execute a $5.1bn share buyback programme this year in its Q4 2024 earnings call. Earlier this week, the company trimmed the ownership of one of its largest shareholders, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, after buying back \u20ac3bn worth of shares. The two share purchase agreements this week mean the drugmaker has already ticked the buyback programme off its 2025 checklist.\n\nSanofi\u2019s shares have been performing well so far this year on the Paris Stock Exchange after raising its full-year profit outlook. This was propelled by blockbuster asthma drug Dupixent (dupilumab) and new launches such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) preventative antibody Beyfortus (nirsevimab), developed in partnership with AstraZeneca. Positive financial guidance comes despite uncertainty over vaccine profitability with changing political stances in the US under a new administration.\n\nOther 2025 targets for Sanofi include finalising the deal to sell a controlling stake in its consumer health business Opella. The company plans to close the deal for the business, valued at around $17bn, in Q2 this year. Pipeline milestones for 2025 include a regulatory submission in the first half of the year for a subcutaneous version of the multiple myeloma treatment Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc).",

            "content": "Sanofi was encouraged by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\u2019s (NICE) November 2024 announcement of the appeal results for the reimbursement of Sarclisa (isatuximab) plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Isa-Pd) as a fourth line treatment in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Following what were viewed as \u201cnegative recommendations\u201d made as a result of regulatory practices being unable to keep pace with innovations in the lab, NICE agreed to a third review of Isa-Pd, acknowledging challenges in evaluating innovative combination therapies and the need for flexibility in such assessments.\n\nThe ICARIA-MM study demonstrated significant benefits of Isa-Pd in improving progression-free survival and overall survival compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone. Yet there remains a lag in accessing cancer medicines in England (compared to European standards). Whilst acknowledging the challenges in current assessment and funding frameworks for combination therapies, as well as a need for greater flexibility in certain situations, Anju Bhalla, Head of Oncology and Haematology, Sanofi UK and Ireland, highlights the importance of treatment availability for managing multiple myeloma and remains committed to maintaining access to isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Isa-Pd) as an important fourth line option. Here she discusses the appeal process, its outcomes, and her hopes for lessons learned. Anju Bhalla (Sanofi) reactively provided these responses following Medicine Maker's request.\n\nWhat were the key points upheld in Sanofi's appeal against NICE's initial decision, and what does this success mean for the broader landscape of combination therapies in the UK?\n\n\n\nThe appeal committee recognized that NICE\u2019s methods for evaluating medicines have changed in recent years, moving away from its \u2018end-of-life\u2019 criteria to a \u2018severity modifier\u2019, meaning Isa-Pd is being re-appraised for routine NHS commissioning against different criteria to which it entered the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF).\n\nAdditionally, the key combination drug pomalidomide was assessed as cost effective by NICE under NICE's old methods (which applied a higher cost-effectiveness threshold), although it is unlikely to be under NICE's new methods. At the time NICE changed its methods, Isa-Pd was the only combination of three drugs in the CDF whose backbone treatment was already recommended under the previous higher threshold. As such, the appeal committee has requested that NICE consider applying flexibility outside its usual processes.\n\nSanofi appealed that there was no indication that the appraisal committee understood that applying NICE\u2019s standard methodology meant that isatuximab cannot be cost effective even at zero price. The committee acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t clear within the final draft guidance.\n\nCould you share more about the challenges posed by the NICE framework, and what reforms Sanofi hopes to see?\n\n\n\nWelcome progress has been made by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), NICE, NHS England, and the Competition and Markets Authority through the publication of guidance for companies \u2013 but unresolved issues remain.\n\nUltimately, the issues revolve around inflexibility in the way NICE assesses new medicines. For combination medicines, the challenges revolve around the value assessment, pricing, and funding that hinder patient access to (and development of) innovative medicines. These include cost-effectiveness barriers; for example, the thresholds for reimbursement are the same for combination medicines as they are for single medicines. The cost-effectiveness of the full combination is assessed regardless of whether the backbone medicine(s) have already been priced at the limit of cost-effectiveness. As such, reimbursement of combinations, for which the backbone is close to or at the threshold of cost-effectiveness, is extremely difficult.\n\nThere are also pricing barriers, or indication-based agreements that are currently the exception. These are difficult to secure under existing guidance, and this difficulty is a significant barrier for combinations as, in many situations, the price for the backbone medicine(s) has already been established, placing the onus on the manufacturer of the add-on therapy to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. Greater allowance for indication-based agreements would enable different prices to be negotiated per indication, enabling greater value for each separate indication/combination.\n\nUltimately, Sanofi would like to see NICE introduce greater flexibility within its processes to ensure medicines that provide demonstrable patient benefits can stand a fair chance of reimbursement. To fully resolve the combination therapies access challenge, all barriers must be resolved, not just one element.\n\nHow will stakeholder collaborations contribute to the case for Isa-Pd?\n\n\n\nWe are grateful for the strong support from the clinical and patient community. Alongside Sanofi, patient organizations such as Myeloma UK, along with clinical groups including the UK Myeloma Society, have also been challenging NICE\u2019s negative final draft guidance. These groups, who work with patients every day, have been significant voices in showcasing the need for continued access to Isa-Pd and building the case for its reimbursement. Multiple unresolved issues around the value assessment, pricing and funding of combinations threaten access to and development of innovative medicines in combination. NHS England, the UK government, and NICE must work with patient groups and the pharmaceutical industry to agree a framework that supports a flexible reimbursement and pricing framework for combination therapies. We are pleased to be working with NICE and NHS England to navigate a way forward.\n\nHow does Sanofi plan to address the potential impact on patients awaiting treatment during the appraisal process?\n\n\n\nThere is no impact on patients awaiting treatment while the appraisal process is still ongoing and until the Final Guidance is published. Isa-Pd will continue to be available to eligible new patients in England and Wales through the Cancer Drugs Fund. Isa-Pd is available to all eligible multiple myeloma patients in Scotland and is not impacted by any outcome from NICE.\n\nHow does Sanofi plan to address disparities between the UK and Europe?\n\n\n\nWe are concerned that the current NICE approach means Isa-Pd may not be available to patients in England should NICE issue negative final guidance, while patients in other countries (including Scotland) will continue to have access. It is important we understand and address the fundamental issue at the core of NICE\u2019s reimbursement processes that is preventing some innovations being reimbursed. Whilst there are certainly lessons and insights we can glean from our European neighbors, it is important we find a solution that is right for NICE and NHS England.\n\nHow does the Isa-Pd case fit into Sanofi's broader strategy in oncology, especially in making innovative treatments accessible in complex healthcare systems?\n\n\n\nCombination therapies are a cornerstone of cancer care and further progress against this devastating disease will likely be achieved through making these combination treatments available to patients. Isa-Pd is a valuable fourth line option for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who have limited alternatives at this later stage of their cancer. Overcoming access barriers for innovative combination therapies has the potential to offer improved outcomes for patients as early as possible, leading to a better chance of survival and improved quality of life.\n\nWhat do you hope will be the major lessons learned from this appraisal process?\n\n\n\nMedical advancements like isatuximab have the potential to transform cancer outcomes. However, NICE\u2019s health technology appraisal process must evolve if it is to keep pace with the speed of scientific advances.\n\nWe hope this appraisal makes the government, NICE, and NHSE recognize the need to review and update its existing pricing and reimbursement framework, or at the very least show greater flexibility. Otherwise, it is unlikely that Isa-Pd will be the last instance that patient access via routine NHS commissioning to a much-needed treatment option will be at threat of being denied or, worse still, not even submitted to NICE for consideration.",

Sanofi is recognized as a global leader in the generic drugs industry, benefiting from its robust active pharmaceutical ingredient production capabilities. The company maintains a healthy balance sheet with strong operating cash flow, which supports its ability to invest in research and development as well as manage risks associated with patent expiries and tariffs.\n\nSanofi\u2019s growth is further bolstered by the expansion of Dupixent, its blockbuster product, into new indications, including treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is expected to significantly drive revenue. Additionally, the prospective launches of Itepekimab and Tolebrutinib present new avenues for revenue growth, with these products targeting different patient populations. These factors, combined with a targeted price of USD64.0 based on a 14.3x forward PE, underscore the Buy rating recommendation for Sanofi\u2019s stock.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

(Credit: Sanofi Korea)\n\nBeyfortus received approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in April 2024 and has since been incorporated into the prescription system at major hospitals nationwide. As of Wednesday, the drug has officially entered the Korean market and is now available at major hospitals and clinics across the country.\n\nRSV is a highly contagious virus, affecting approximately 90 percent of children under the age of two. While RSV infections may present as mild cold-like symptoms, they can escalate into bronchiolitis or pneumonia, often requiring hospitalization.\n\nRSV is recognized as the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis and pediatric pneumonia, posing a greater risk to infants with narrower airways. As no specific treatments exist for RSV, prevention has been a growing priority in pediatric healthcare.\n\nIn their first RSV season, 78 percent of infants hospitalized due to RSV-related lower respiratory tract infections were full-term and previously healthy. Until now, there have been no RSV prevention options available for this group, leaving a significant unmet medical need. The introduction of Beyfortus is expected to bridge this gap.\n\nBeyfortus is indicated for administration to all newborns and infants entering their first RSV season. Given that approximately 50 percent of RSV-related hospitalizations occur in infants born just before the RSV season begins, early administration of Beyfortus is expected to reduce hospitalization rates.\n\nAlso, the drug can also be administered to children under 24 months at high risk of severe RSV disease during their second RSV season, expanding its preventive coverage.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to introduce Beyfortu in Korea, making RSV prevention available to all full-term newborns and infants,\u201d Sanofi Korea Vaccines Head Christine Park said. \u201cWith RSV spreading nationwide, we expect that Beyfortus will provide immediate benefits in protecting high-risk infants this season.\u201d\n\nInternational data has already demonstrated a significant reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations with Beyfortus use, and the company anticipates a similar impact in Korea, Park added.",

It is the most common viral cause of capillary bronchitis and childhood pneumonia. Globally, it is estimated to account for 50% to 80% of the causes of infant capillary bronchitis hospitalization that occur between November and April every year and about 30% to 60% of the causes of childhood pneumonia. As there is no specific treatment that can be applied to RSV, the importance of prevention has emerged.\n\nVapotus is available for administration to all newborns and infants in the first RSV season of life.\n\nPark Hee-kyung, head of Sanofi's vaccine division, said, \"We are happy to launch Vapotus in Korea, which can also inoculate healthy born full-term infants,\" adding, \"As RSV is currently prevalent nationwide, we hope that infants and toddlers at high risk of RSV infection will receive RSV prevention benefits from this season.\"",

Government and healthcare organizations worldwide recommend or mandate vaccinations for certain respiratory diseases, such as influenza. These recommendations drive vaccine adoption and coverage rates. The emergence of new respiratory viruses, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the importance of preparedness through vaccination.\n\n\n\nGovernments and organizations invest in vaccines as a key part of pandemic response plans. Public health campaigns and initiatives promote vaccination and raise awareness about the benefits of respiratory disease vaccines. These efforts aim to increase vaccine uptake. International organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF work to expand vaccination access in low- and middle-income countries. Global immunization programs aim to reduce the burden of respiratory diseases.\n\n\n\nKey Market Drivers\n\nIncreasing Prevalence of Respiratory Diseases\n\nRising Aging Population\n\nVaccine Mandates and Recommendations\n\nGlobal Immunization Programs\n\nKey Market Challenges\n\nVaccine Hesitancy and Misinformation\n\nSupply Chain Disruptions\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nPneumococcal Vaccines\n\nAsia Pacific held the largest market share in the Global Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market in 2024. The Asia Pacific region is home to a substantial portion of the world's population, including densely populated countries like China and India. The sheer number of people in the region creates a significant market for respiratory disease vaccines. Many countries in the Asia Pacific have been experiencing economic growth, leading to increased healthcare spending. This has allowed for greater investment in healthcare infrastructure, including vaccination programs.\n\n\n\nAwareness about the importance of vaccination has been on the rise in the Asia Pacific region. Governments and healthcare organizations have been actively promoting immunization, including respiratory disease vaccines, to combat the burden of preventable diseases. Like many other regions, the Asia Pacific is experiencing demographic changes with a growing aging population. Older adults are more susceptible to respiratory diseases, such as influenza and pneumonia, driving the demand for vaccines.\n\n\n\nKey Market Players\n\nGSK PLC\n\nJohnson & Johnson Services, Inc.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\nSanofi SA\n\nSerum Institute of India Pvt.

Excluding North Asia, where the Chinese ecosystem remained challenging, sales advanced in high single digits. I am particularly proud of the quality of the P&L management as the Group achieved record gross and operating margins. At 20%, the latter increased 20 basis points. On a comparable basis, excluding Aesop, our operating margin grew 40 basis points and that after a 10 basis points increase in our brand fuel.\n\n2024 was a defining year as we made L\u2019Or\u00e9al future fit and laid many foundations for our next conquests: we augmented our marketing and R&I capabilities with AI and tech, advanced with the harmonisation of our IT, simplified our organisational structures, and strengthened our industrial and supply chain resilience. We also continued to sharpen our portfolio: we acquired the Miu Miu license and Korean brand Dr.G, and took minority stakes in Galderma and Amouage.\n\nThis will allow us to go ever faster and further in our conquest of new beauty spaces: geographic, demographic and highly promising technologies that offer innovative science-based beauty solutions to the consumer of tomorrow.\n\nIn 2025, as we take the first steps in this conquest, we remain optimistic about the outlook for the global beauty market, and confident in our ability to keep outperforming it and to achieve another year of growth in sales and profit. We expect growth to accelerate progressively, supported by our beauty stimulus plan, which will be driven by an exciting pipeline of new launches and continued strong brand support.\u201d\n\nBoard appointments and renewals\n\nMeeting on 6 February 2025, the Board of Directors chose to propose to the Annual General Meeting of 29 April 2025 the renewal of the tenures as Directors of Mr. Nicolas Hieronimus, Mr. Paul Bulcke and Mr. Alexandre Ricard, for a four-year term.\n\nThe tenure of Ms. Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, a Director of L\u2019Or\u00e9al since 1997, Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors since 2020, and a member of the Strategy and Sustainability, Nominations and Governance, Human Resources and Remuneration Committees, expires at the end of this Annual General Meeting.\n\nMs. Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers has informed the Board of Directors that she would not request the renewal of her tenure as Director.

If the Annual General Meeting approves the appointment of T\u00e9thys as a Director, T\u00e9thys would designate Mr. Alexandre Benais, Deputy Chief Executive Officer at T\u00e9thys, as its representative. Mr. Alexandre Benais will bring to the Board of Directors his recognized financial expertise and long-term strategic vision.\n\nMr. Jean-Paul Agon, on behalf of the Board of Directors, warmly thanked Ms. Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers for her outstanding contribution to L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s success for nearly three decades, her unwavering commitment, and her constant support to the Group. A guardian of its founding values, she played an essential role in the Group's strategic transformations through her consistently insightful guidance. The Board praised the strong and lasting tie that unites the Bettencourt Meyers family with L'Or\u00e9al, which represents an invaluable asset for the Group, both through the presence of Mr. Jean-Victor and Mr. Nicolas Meyers, as well as the forthcoming presence of the company T\u00e9thys.\n\nTo replace Ms. Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers as Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors, the Bettencourt Meyers family proposed the appointment of Mr. Jean-Victor Meyers following the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2025, which the Board of Directors unanimously approved. Mr. Paul Bulcke is also Vice-Chair.\n\nThe tenure of Ms. Virginie Morgon, a Director of L\u2019Or\u00e9al since 2013, and Chairwoman of the Audit Committee since 2016, expires at the end of this Annual General Meeting. After 12 years on the Board, her term will not be submitted for renewal. The Board wished to highlight Ms. Virginie Morgon's contributions to the work of the Board and the Audit Committee, particularly her financial expertise and active contribution to the development of a sustainable business model.\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, will propose to the Annual General Meeting the appointments of Ms. Isabelle Seillier and Ms. Aur\u00e9lie Jean as independent Directors, for a period of four years.\n\nMs. Isabelle Seillier spent the majority of her career at JP Morgan, where she notably served as Chairwoman for France and North Africa, before continuing her distinguished career in London as Chairwoman of Investment Banking. Ms. Isabelle Seillier will bring to the Board her recognized financial expertise, her ability to develop a strategic vision in support of sustainable growth, as well as her deep knowledge of the economic environment across several geographical regions. She has been Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Fondation pour la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (FRM, French Foundation for Medical Research) since May 2024.\n\nMs. Aur\u00e9lie Jean is the founder of In Silico Veritas, a company specializing in data and algorithm consulting and development, and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer of INFRA, a start-up specializing in precision, personalized, and predictive medicine. Ms. Aur\u00e9lie Jean will bring to the Board her recognized expertise in innovation and new technologies, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, her experience of the North American market, and her commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nIf the Annual General Meeting approves the proposed appointments and renewals, the Board of Directors will comprise 17 Directors, i.e. 15 Directors appointed by the Annual General Meeting and 2 Directors representing the employees.\n\nThe balance in terms of independence and gender will be as follows:\n\n8 independent Directors out of 15 Directors appointed by the AGM, i.e. 53%\n\n9 men and 6 women out of 15 Directors appointed by the AGM, i.e. 40% of female directors.\n\nProjected composition of the Board and Committees following the General Meeting of April 29, 2025 [4]\n\nCOMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Age W/M Nationality Expiry of term of office BOARD COMMITTES S&S Audit Gov.

The Division\u2019s strategic focus on emerging markets was vindicated by the strength in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, India, and Thailand.\n\nAll four categories grew, powered by key innovations. Haircare was particularly dynamic, driven by L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, including its newly launched Elvive Glycolic Gloss. Skincare was the second-fastest growing category thanks to Garnier\u2019s Vitamin C Daily UV fluids, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 Bright Reveal, and the ongoing strength of mass medical brand Mixa, which continued its European roll-out. Makeup benefitted from the introduction of L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 blockbuster Panorama mascara and a strong second-half-weighted launch plan including Maybelline New York\u2019s Teddy Tint and NYX Professional Makeup\u2019s Butter Melt. In hair colour, the successful rollout of Garnier\u2019s premium offer Good was complemented by its most accessible launch, Garnier Color Sensation.\n\nLUXE\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Luxe grew +2.7% like-for-like, +4.5% reported.\n\nIn 2024, the Division reinforced its worldwide leadership in Luxury Beauty.\n\nIts solid progress reflected its increasingly balanced regional footprint. Outside North Asia, it grew at a remarkable, double-digit pace; the single largest growth contributor was North America, where it became the number one luxury beauty player for the first time, a position it already holds and further consolidated in China, Europe and emerging markets. This allowed the Division to more than offset the ongoing softness in North Asia, where operating conditions remain challenging and where it continued to grow ahead of the market both offline and online, driven by the successful expansion of its couture brands Prada and Valentino \u2013 recently launched in the region \u2013 and its latest acquisitions, Aesop and Takami.\n\nThe Division continued to strengthen the balance between its categories. In fragrances, outstanding momentum was driven by global successes in both, the feminine (Paradoxe by Prada, Born in Roma by Valentino, Libre by Yves Saint Laurent) and masculine segments (Stronger with You by Armani, Wanted by Azzaro, Polo 67 by Ralph Lauren, MYSLF by Yves Saint Laurent). Makeup growth accelerated thanks to the ongoing strength of Yves Saint Laurent in Western markets as well as China, driven by the YSL Loveshine and Touche Eclat pillars. In skincare, Aesop, Takami and Youth to the People pursued their globalisation strategy with very encouraging results.\n\nDERMATOLOGICAL BEAUTY\n\nThe Dermatological Beauty Division grew +9.8% like-for-like and +9.3% reported.\n\nFor the first time, the Division\u2019s sales crossed the 7-billion-euro mark. It continued to outpace the global dermocosmetics market, which has remained dynamic, despite a gradual slowdown.\n\nThe Division grew in all regions with particularly strong momentum in emerging markets, notably SAPMENA5, and Europe; it significantly outperformed the market in North Asia and grew ahead of it in North America.\n\nBy brand, growth was led by La Roche-Posay; thanks to the strong contributions from Europe and North America, where it has taken the baton from CeraVe, and boosted by the tremendous success of Mela B3, it has become the world\u2019s third largest skincare brand across all channels.\n\nDespite its stabilisation in the US, CeraVe crossed the 2-billion-euro sales mark, driven by its international expansion with exceptional performances in new markets - notably SAPMENA, China and Brazil - where it is the Division\u2019s trailblazer.\n\nBolstered by the dynamism of its Dercos haircare line, Vichy continued to advance strongly.\n\nThe aesthetics-related brands, SkinCeuticals and Skinbetter Science, grew in double digits; SkinCeuticals was boosted by the promising launch of its disruptive anti-aging innovation P-TIOX.\n\nSummary by Region\n\nEUROPE\n\nSales in Europe advanced strongly at +8.2 % like-for-like and +9.3% reported.\n\nEurope was the largest contributor to growth at Group level.\n\nSales grew ahead of a market that was dynamic. They advanced in both volume and value terms, even though the value component gradually normalised, as anticipated.\n\nSales grew in all countries and the Group outperformed the market in most markets, especially the Spain-Portugal, UK-Ireland, and Germany-Austria-Switzerland clusters, and many of the medium-sized countries.\n\nThe haircare, fragrance and makeup categories posted double-digit growth.\n\nIn Consumer Products, growth was driven by the continued strength of L'Or\u00e9al Paris, notably in haircare, the makeup brands Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Makeup, as well as the successful roll-out of mass medical brand Mixa.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Luxe advanced strongly, driven primarily by the couture brands, including Yves Saint Laurent in fragrances and makeup, as well as Valentino and Prada in fragrances; men\u2019s fragrances remained dynamic.\n\nDermatological Beauty outperformed its market. All three flagship brands recorded double-digit growth, with CeraVe in the lead. La Roche-Posay benefited from the successful launch of Mela B3 and Vichy continued to grow, strongly fuelled by the success of Dercos.\n\nProfessional Products also progressed ahead of its market, driven by the ongoing dynamism of K\u00e9rastase and successful launches from the Redken and Matrix brands.\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\nSales in North America grew +5.5% like-for-like and +5.9% reported.\n\nIn the USA, the Group\u2019s number one country, growth was driven by continued channel expansion and valorisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Luxe outperformed the market, and became No.1 in the USA, fuelled by the continued dynamism of the fragrance category; key contributors were MYSLF by Yves Saint Laurent, Born in Roma by Valentino, and Prada. Skincare growth was driven by Kiehl\u2019s and Youth to the People, which benefitted from a strong launch plan and entry into new online channels.\n\nConsumer Products delivered solid growth in haircare, where it outpaced the market, led by L'Or\u00e9al Paris. The Division was adversely impacted by the softness in the makeup category; thanks to the success of Fat Oil and Duck Plump, NYX Professional Makeup outperformed the market.\n\nDermatological Beauty grew ahead of the market, boosted by the acceleration in online channels. La Roche-Posay continued to advance in double digits, supported by the successful roll-out of Mela B3; the aesthetics-related brands also progressed strongly with SkinCeuticals boosted by the launch of P-Tiox.\n\nProfessional Products outperformed the market, driven by successful innovations like Premi\u00e8re by K\u00e9rastase and Acidic Color Gloss by Redken, and the strength of its omni-channel strategy. The recently launched AirLight Pro hair dryer innovation is off to a promising start.\n\nNORTH ASIA\n\nSales in North Asia contracted, -3.2% like-for-like and -3.4% reported.\n\nIn mainland China, beauty market growth was negative, strongly impacted by the softness in the selective segment. In this challenging context, L\u2019Or\u00e9al demonstrated its resilience, posting a low single digit decline in sales. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxe, Dermatological Beauty and Professional Products outpaced their respective markets; Consumer Products slightly underperformed the mass market.\n\nIn Japan, L\u2019Or\u00e9al outperformed a very dynamic market. In Travel Retail, given that sell-out continued to be under significant pressure, notably in Hainan, focus remained on securing healthy inventory levels.\n\nIn North Asia, Dermatological Beauty posted double-digit growth; all brands contributed with a particularly strong performance from CeraVe. Professional Products outpaced the market, boosted by the continued success of K\u00e9rastase. Given the continued challenges in the Chinese ecosystem, sales in L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxe declined and the Division performed in line with the market; in this context, the couture brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Maison Margiela, Prada and Valentino maintained strong momentum. In Consumer Products, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 sales declined in very low single-digits.\n\nIn December, L\u2019Or\u00e9al announced the acquisition of Dr.G, a leading Korean dermo mass skincare brand.\n\nSAPMENA\u2013SSA5\n\nSales in SAPMENA-SSA grew +12.3% like-for-like and +12.0% reported.\n\nIn SAPMENA, growth was broad-based with all categories and Divisions contributing; it was driven by mix and a positive contribution from both price and volume.\n\nBy country, key contributors were the Australia-New Zealand cluster, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and India.\n\nBy Division, Dermatological Beauty saw the strongest growth, fuelled by CeraVe\u2019s outstanding momentum and La Roche-Posay\u2019s successful Mela B3; Luxe maintained its double-digit rhythm, powered primarily by Yves Saint Laurent and Prada.\n\nThe most dynamic categories were fragrances and skincare, the latter driven by Dermatological Beauty and Consumer Products. Growth in haircare, both in mass and professional, was boosted by the continued premiumisation strategy.\n\nOnline remained a key growth driver, notably in Saudi Arabia, India and South-East Asia.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) delivered another record year with all countries and Divisions growing in double digits. By category, momentum was particularly dynamic in skincare, followed by haircare and fragrances. By Division, key growth contributors were Consumer Products and L\u2019Or\u00e9al Dermatological Beauty.\n\nLATIN AMERICA\n\nSales in Latin America advanced +11.0% like-for-like and +13.3% reported.\n\nGrowth was fuelled by well-balanced contributions from value and volume.\n\nMomentum was broad-based by country, led by Mexico and Brazil \u2013 the third and sixth largest contributors to growth at Group level respectively. Excluding Argentina, which was negatively impacted by the economic crisis, sales in the region grew +14.7%.\n\nBy Division, Consumer Products delivered exceptional growth, with each of the three international brands contributing; Els\u00e8ve further consolidated its position as the top haircare brand in Brazil by value. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxe achieved robust growth, driven by strong performances in Brazil and especially Mexico, where the market was very dynamic.\n\nHaircare remained the fastest-growing category across the three relevant Divisions, followed by makeup and fragrances.\n\nOnline remained a key growth driver for the region, boosted by the strong performance of pure players.\n\nIMPORTANT EVENTS SINCE THE LAST PUBLICATION\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nIn February, L\u2019Or\u00e9al agreed to sell approximately 29.6 million of Sanofi shares to Sanofi for \u20ac101.5 per share, for a total consideration of \u20ac3 billion. Upon completion of the transaction and cancellation of the repurchased shares, L\u2019Or\u00e9al will own 7.2% of Sanofi\u2019s share capital and 13.1% of its voting rights.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has acquired a minority stake in the High Perfumery House Amouage, becoming a long-term minority investor.

            "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Foreign Stocks With Dividends For Passive Income. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) stands against the other foreign stocks.\n\nIn August, S&P Global Market Intelligence reported that US dividends are set to grow around 5.1% by the close of 2024. In the United States, the energy sector dominated dividend contributions, with pharmaceuticals, financial services, and banks trailing behind. Looking beyond the US, we see similar growth trends in international markets. For example, S&P expects a 3.9% year-over-year recovery in dividends in Canada, resulting in $74.4 billion in dividend payouts for 2024. Interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada will aid this rebound in dividends. Two-thirds of the overall Canadian dividend distributions are attributed to the financial and energy sectors.\n\nBy year-end 2024, European dividends are projected to grow 4.2% year-over-year to $531.5 billion, with the banking and insurance sectors leading the charge and counteracting the weakness in the European transportation, materials, and energy industries. In the Asia-Pacific region, dividend growth is also projected to be strong. Developed markets in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 Australia, Japan, Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, South Korea, and Singapore \u2013 are expected to grow their dividends to $370.5 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting a 5.8% year-over-year increase. According to S&P Global, 2024 is the year that Japan will overtake Hong Kong SAR in terms of the highest dividend contributions in the developed Asia-Pacific market, with an expected growth rate of over 10% for the year.\n\nTurning back to Canada, Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management, joined BNN Bloomberg on February 4 and discussed the Canadian stock market outlook. He commented that the current hostility from the US should be a wake-up call for Canadian policymakers, noting that it is impractical to isolate the US but Canada should have alternative trading partners in case political tensions influence economic decisions. Bushell mentioned that having export options other than oil is crucial and that Canada should look into exporting natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases as well. In terms of investment strategies, the portfolio manager emphasized that sustainable and stable companies make for excellent long-term investments, regardless of who occupies the White House. This includes critical infrastructure companies, which cater to people\u2019s needs rather than wants. He went on to recommend his top stock picks, which were companies with steady dividend policies, high yields, and 40-60% of their revenues coming from the US, to navigate the messy tariffs. Bushnell prefers Canadian energy stocks since these companies are seeking to export to more countries, which will result in higher gains.",

Despite this progress, a number of childhood cancers, subtypes of certain cancers, or cancers that relapse, often lack curative treatments [1]. Furthermore, the majority of children who survive cancer, experience one or more significant long-term side effects later in life as a result of treatments that may include intensive chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery [2] [3].\n\nChildhood cancers, which comprise only 1% of all cancers, exhibit distinct biologic traits that usually present rapidly and follow an aggressive growth pattern. Under the microscope, many childhood cancers contain features seen in fetal tissues and are the result of dysregulated development [4]. Compared to adult cancers, childhood cancers harbor fewer genetic mutations but generally show more gene fusions and epigenetic changes [5].\n\nDeveloping new treatments for childhood cancers has been challenging as each cancer is rare or ultra-rare, lacking clear economic models that can support research & development in the private sector. Despite legislation in the US and Europe that incentivize or require the conduct of pediatric studies [6], clinical trials for children still encounter a 6.5-year delay compared to adults [7].",

This opportunistic germ develops in clinical situations of immunosuppression (e.g. AIDS or immunosuppression for organ transplantation). There is no equivalent therapeutic alternative in the world.\n\nSince FLISINT\u00ae ceased to be marketed in 2019, the FRIPHARM\u00ae (Fabrication Recherche Innovation Pharmaceutique; Hospices Civils de Lyon) university hospital platform has been manufacturing the product as a magistral preparation, helping patients with the last remaining stock of active ingredient available from SANOFI\n\nMITEM PHARMA has set itself the task of making available to patients and medical staff essential medicines that have been taken off the market.\n\nAt the request of the FRIPHARM\u00ae platform team, MITEM PHARMA is working to update and relaunch the active ingredient production and FLISINT\u00ae manufacturing processes.\n\nFLISINT\u00ae currently has marketing authorization in France but is the subject of numerous requests for exceptional supplies abroad (Europe; USA; Argentina; Australia; etc.).\n\nThis acquisition underpins MITEM PHARMA's growth strategy in the DMTI sector and its determination to serve all territories affected by diseases which, while rare, are often fatal.\n\nMITEM PHARMA, backed by the TECHLIFE CAPITAL investment fund specialising in healthcare, is bringing its expertise in DMTIs and its marketing network in over 60 countries to bear on these products.\n\nClaude-Alain CUDENNEC and \u00c9ric THIERRY, founders of MITEM PHARMA, said: \"The acquisition of FLISINT\u00ae (fumagillin) confirms MITEM PHARMA's determination to provide patients and medical teams with concrete solutions in the fight against serious diseases. MITEM PHARMA is taking over from the remarkable efforts made by FRIPHARM\u2019s\u00ae platform to avoid a disruption in the pharmaceutical availability of fumagillin.\n\nAbout MITEM PHARMA\n\nMITEM PHARMA is a French pharmaceutical laboratory specialising in Drugs of Major Therapeutic Interest (DMTI). MITEM PHARMA's mission is to improve patients' quality of life by ensuring the availability of important medicines, which are the only treatments for severe diseases, but whose supply shortages cause public health risks. Working with partner doctors and patient associations, the company identifies these situations, and buys back, upgrades, improves or develops these major medicines to guarantee access to appropriate care. MITEM PHARMA is constantly adapting to patients, the environment and market developments to make DMTIs accessible at every stage of life, particularly in the fields of haematology, endocrinology, emergency cardiology, medical dermatology and now infectious diseases. MITEM PHARMA currently has an international presence in over 60 countries.\n\nFor more information: www.mitempharma.com",

Explaining to them why they need the tools was a key motivator for the team to use them.\n\nNkeruka also spoke about their metric around doctor recommendations. She also spoke about how they help doctors communicate with their patients about those products using language patients understand.\n\nJordana Barish, VP Allegra Zone Head North America at Sanofi spoke about their app which enables consumers to know which two routes to take to a destination and avoid pollen or air pollution. They were able to get granular data and serve coupons to those experiencing high levels of allergies/pollution.\n\nJenny Dwork, VP of Marketing, at Wisp spoke about how they used various partners in the brand, non-profit, and DTC space to improve access to reproductive care. These partners helped them in areas they didn\u2019t have capabilities in.\n\nJenny also spoke about how they cleverly used a dummy YouTube account to address this controversial topic. This was so they wouldn\u2019t risk their own account getting taken down.\n\nShehzad Muhamed, Emergency Medicine Physician from the Northeast Georgia Health System mentioned that the biggest change he has seen around the past five years is data. Patients are now able to access their test results even before the physicians ordering those tests are able to see the results.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in submitting content for future editions, please reach out to our Managing Editor, Barbie Romero at Barbie@MediaPost.com.",

This transaction is part of Sanofi\u2019s share buyback program announced on January 30, 2025. It is fully aligned with Sanofi\u2019s capital allocation policy and focus on sustainable value creation for shareholders.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Roger\n\nChief Financial Officer, Sanofi\n\n\u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al has been a trusted shareholder and partner for decades, playing a key role in supporting Sanofi\u2019s growth and transformation. We are pleased to retain L\u2019Or\u00e9al as one of our largest shareholders. This transaction highlights Sanofi's dedication to sustainable value creation while upholding our strategic priorities and preserving the strength of our key partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition is structured as an off-market block trade and is not subject to any specific conditions. The acquisition is pursuant to an agreement approved by Sanofi\u2019s Board of Directors as a related-party agreement, in compliance with article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code, entered into on February 2, 2025. It is expected to be completed in the coming days. The transaction will involve the acquisition of 29,556,650 shares at a price of \u20ac101.50 per share, reflecting a discount of 2.8% to the closing price on January 31, 2025. The total consideration of the transaction amounts to \u20ac3 billion. Shares acquired from L\u2019Or\u00e9al will be cancelled at the latest on April 29, 2025.

In its expert opinion Finexsi confirmed that \u201cBased on our work and as of the date of this report, the price of the repurchased shares appears fair for Sanofi and its shareholders. This transaction will not affect Sanofi\u2019s financial balances and will be accretive for Sanofi and its shareholders. It is therefore carried out in the interest of the Company and will be treated as a related-party transaction.\u201d\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives.

This milestone funding round was co-led by SV Health Investors, Sanofi Ventures, Abingworth, and SymBiosis. Additional support came from existing investor Morningside, alongside new investors Tenmile, Brandon Capital, and others.\n\nSince its founding in June 2019, AdvanCell has grown from a belief in the potential of Targeted Alpha Therapy into a global organisation with 60 passionate team members, a 40,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, world-class pre-clinical infrastructure, a potentially best-in-class drug for prostate cancer that is in trials, and a deep and developing pipeline of assets.\n\nThis investment will fuel AdvanCell\u2019s ongoing efforts to expand its manufacturing capacity, accelerate the clinical development of its pipeline of radionuclide therapies, and advance its mission of delivering life-changing treatments to cancer patients worldwide.\n\nAdvanCell is currently enrolling patients for the highest dose cohort of its multi-center TheraPb Ph I/II dose escalation clinical trial of ADVC001 for metastatic prostate cancer, a potentially best-in-class Targeted Alpha Therapy. The trial aims to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Pb-212-based radionuclide treatment.\n\nAs part of the financing, Jamil M. Beg from SV Health Investors, Christopher Gagliardi from Sanofi Ventures, and Bali Muralidhar from Abingworth have joined the AdvanCell Board of Directors.

Radionuclide therapies for prostate cancer and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours have transformed patient care. Pb-212 Targeted Alpha Therapy has the potential to further advance this progress by leveraging the radiobiological and physical attributes of Pb-212 to make life-changing treatments for patients.\n\n\u201cThis successful Series C round demonstrates strong confidence in our vision and capabilities,\u201d said Andrew Adamovich, CEO of AdvanCell. \u201cWe are grateful for the continued support from our existing investors, particularly the long-term support from Morningside and are excited to welcome new partners who share our commitment to transforming cancer care.

Sanofi today announces the acquisition of 2.3% of its shares from long-standing shareholder L\u2019Or\u00e9al. This transaction is part of Sanofi\u2019s share buyback program announced on January 30, 2025. It is fully aligned with Sanofi\u2019s capital allocation policy and focus on sustainable value creation for shareholders.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Roger\n\nChief Financial Officer, Sanofi\n\n\u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al has been a trusted shareholder and partner for decades, playing a key role in supporting Sanofi\u2019s growth and transformation. We are pleased to retain L\u2019Or\u00e9al as one of our largest shareholders. This transaction highlights Sanofi's dedication to sustainable value creation while upholding our strategic priorities and preserving the strength of our key partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition is structured as an off-market block trade and is not subject to any specific conditions. The acquisition is pursuant to an agreement approved by Sanofi\u2019s Board of Directors as a related-party agreement, in compliance with article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code, entered into on February 2, 2025. It is expected to be completed in the coming days. The transaction will involve the acquisition of 29,556,650 shares at a price of \u20ac101.50 per share, reflecting a discount of 2.8% to the closing price on January 31, 2025. The total consideration of the transaction amounts to \u20ac3 billion. Shares acquired from L\u2019Or\u00e9al will be cancelled at the latest on April 29, 2025.

In its expert opinion Finexsi confirmed that \u201cBased on our work and as of the date of this report, the price of the repurchased shares appears fair for Sanofi and its shareholders. This transaction will not affect Sanofi\u2019s financial balances and will be accretive for Sanofi and its shareholders.

            "content": "Paris: Sanofi has announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa, in combination with a standard-of-care regimen, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nThis approval closely follows the decision from the NMPA earlier in January 2025, approving Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Beyond China, in the Asia-Pacific region, a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in NDMM patients not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently under review in Japan.\n\nOlivier Nataf, Global Head, Oncology said, \u201cWhen Sanofi entered China more than four decades ago, we did so with the intention of bringing potentially transformative therapies to Chinese patients. This approval, occurring just weeks after Sarclisa\u2019s first in the country, represents tremendous progress towards advancing this mission. Now, patients with multiple myeloma and their providers have access to two new Sarclisa-based regimens that have the potential to improve outcomes across lines of therapy.\u201d\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including in the US, EU, Japan, and China, across multiple indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in the US, EU and Japan in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u2265two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US, EU, and China, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous (SC) administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. In January 2024, Sanofi reported positive results from the IRAKLIA phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa SC formulation administered via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with Pd compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa in patients with R/R MM. In December 2024, additional positive results from the program, including the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy in transplant-eligible NDMM patients, were also presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.",

            "content": "00:00\n\nLet's talk, first of all, about the buyback. Some in the market had anticipated that the number would be higher than 5 billion. Why did you settle on that number? We believe that first of all, we have committed that we would do a sizeable share buyback because it was a way to mitigate the dilution that came from the separation of a pillar or consumer care business with this 5 billion share buyback. Let's review the total amount of shareholder remuneration that we will have in the year 2025, which is at 2,010,000,000,000 because we are increasing at the same time a dividend as well. We have increased our dividend for the last 30 years as well. So we are part of these dividend aristocrats as ones which grow to 10 billion. But go back to our shareholders in 2025. Did you did you talk about a bigger number? Was that on the table? Some had anticipated the number could be as high as 8 billion. I'm just wondering if a higher number was discussed. I would not comment anywhere on the discussion, but I think that when talking to our investors over the last couple of months, we understood that it was there was an expectation of about 4 to 5 billion. So we believe that the amount of 5 billion is the right amount. Okay. In 2023, you surprised many people by anticipating that you were going to pick up your R & D spending. You were going to spend more pushing forward into the science areas that you were focused on. Are we starting to see evidence of those that spend coming through in these numbers? You've talked as well in the statements about faster growth coming through. Is that a direct result of that pick up that we saw a year and a bit ago? We have raised our investment in R & D significantly last year because we increased our investment in R & D by more than 900 million. So we did exactly what we had said in at the end of 2023. The very strong development that we had in sales last year growing 11.3%, which is really a very high level in the pharmaceutical industry, is not the direct consequence of the investment in R & D that we did the last year in 2024, because obviously this is a long term investment. But clearly we were very happy as well with some readout that we have, positive readout that we had last year in 2024. Such a solid routine need, for example, or even in phase two without one. So we are super excited about the outlook. We have a very strong pipeline with 12 potential blockbusters and we had some very interesting readouts once again in 2020 for. In terms of where CapEx goes in 2025, There is considerable pressure coming from the new Trump administration that particularly health care companies should be manufacturing in the United States. There is the possibility as well the tariffs are going to be a factor in this equation. How much pressure do you feel to manufacture more of your products in the United States? You're quite light in terms of your footprints in the US. Because of our regional footprint in Europe. We do have a strong industrial base in Europe, but we do have a significant presence from an industrial point of view, and especially for vaccines in the US. So we are always looking at possibilities to invest further. We did decide, for example, on three new plants lately, none of them is in the US, but we are investing in Singapore, in Germany, in France as well. But we will always look at opportunities to invest, including in the US. I mean, we have no limitation. Do you feel greater pressure with the arrival of the Trump administration to focus fresh investment in the United States? We are in constant discussion with the regulator on policy makers as well. You know that we see well what we can do in order to support our industrial base as well, including in the US. But I cannot comment on recent discussion that we have had. RFK Junior had his his time on Capitol Hill yesterday. His confirmation hearing pushed back against the idea that he is anti-vaccine. Are you convinced now that the Trump administration is not anti-vaccine? You will see you have some huge products in this space. Your RSV vaccine for infants is a huge profit driver potentially for Sanofi. Yes. So obviously, we have a strong presence in vaccines. We were, by the way, extremely happy last year to see the result of our bid for two vaccines, for RSV for our young children, where we reach \u20ac1.7 billion of sales in the first year of marketing, which really show us well the interest that there is among parents, for example, in that case. I mean, to given that this vaccine has reduced hospitalization rate for infants in case of RSV in RSV by close to 90%. So it's really an extremely good product that succeeded extremely well last year. This is the evidence that vaccines are extremely relevant, I mean, for babies, but for adults, for and other people as well. And we will continue investing in vaccines.",

            "content": "Sarclisa is the first anti-CD38 treatment approved in China for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for transplant\n\nApproval based on positive results from the IMROZ phase 3 study that demonstrated Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) significantly improved progression-free survival, compared to VRd alone in transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma\n\nSecond approval in China in three weeks following the R/R MM indication announced on January 13, 2025\n\nParis, January 31, 2025. The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa, in combination with a standard-of-care regimen, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nOlivier Nataf\n\nGlobal Head, Oncology\n\n\u201cWhen Sanofi entered China more than four decades ago, we did so with the intention of bringing potentially transformative therapies to Chinese patients. This approval, occurring just weeks after Sarclisa\u2019s first in the country, represents tremendous progress towards advancing this mission. Now, patients with multiple myeloma and their providers have access to two new Sarclisa-based regimens that have the potential to improve outcomes across lines of therapy.\u201d\n\nThis approval closely follows the decision from the NMPA earlier in January 2025, approving Sarclisa in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Beyond China, in the Asia-Pacific region, a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in NDMM patients not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently under review in Japan.\n\nAbout Sarclisa\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including in the US, EU, Japan, and China, across multiple indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in the US, EU and Japan in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u2265two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor; this combination is also approved in China for patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in more than 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received one to three prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. In the US, EU, and China, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option in transplant-ineligible NDMM patients, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous (SC) administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. In January 2024, Sanofi reported positive results from the IRAKLIA phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa SC formulation administered via an on-body delivery system (OBDS) in combination with Pd compared to intravenous (IV) Sarclisa in patients with R/R MM. In December 2024, additional positive results from the program, including the GMMG-HD7 phase 3 study evaluating Sarclisa-RVd induction therapy in transplant-eligible NDMM patients, were also presented at the 66th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.\n\nIn striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally, Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline, leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat often rare cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, certain types of lymphomas, as well as gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and other gastrointestinal and lung cancers.\n\nFor more information on Sarclisa clinical studies, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives.

            "content": "Sanofi SA ((SNY)) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.\n\nSanofi SA\u2019s recent earnings call highlighted a generally positive sentiment, driven by impressive sales performance and strategic growth. The company showcased strong metrics in new product launches, particularly in the vaccines segment, despite facing challenges such as increased expenses, a slight decline in gross margin, and potential impacts from healthcare policy changes. Overall, Sanofi\u2019s growth outlook and advancements in its pipeline contributed to an optimistic tone throughout the call.\n\nDouble-Digit Sales Growth\n\nSanofi reported impressive double-digit sales growth for the third consecutive quarter. This achievement was significantly bolstered by the successful launches of new products and strong sales from existing ones like Dupixent, which has been a key driver of the company\u2019s robust financial performance.\n\nBeyfortus Achieves Blockbuster Status\n\nBeyfortus reached blockbuster status in its first full year of sales, marking a significant milestone for Sanofi. The product\u2019s remarkable sales growth and its expansion of RSV protection to over 6 million babies globally underscore its vital role in the company\u2019s portfolio.\n\nDupixent Sales Exceed \u20ac13 Billion\n\nDupixent, a focal point of Sanofi\u2019s product lineup, exceeded \u20ac13 billion in sales, fueled by robust demand from over 1 million patients worldwide. The drug experienced a notable 16% growth in Q4 alone, reinforcing its strong market position.\n\nRecord Vaccine Sales\n\nSanofi\u2019s vaccines segment achieved a new record, surpassing \u20ac8 billion in sales. This milestone was driven by the success of Beyfortus and the strong performance of the company\u2019s flu vaccine franchise, highlighting Sanofi\u2019s leadership in the vaccine market.\n\nImproved Access to Medicine Ranking\n\nSanofi improved its position in the 2024 access to medicine index, moving from eighth to third place. This advancement reflects the company\u2019s ongoing commitment to enhancing global health and increasing accessibility to essential medicines.\n\nR&D Pipeline Progress\n\nThe company\u2019s R&D efforts yielded positive Phase 3 results for several drugs, along with potential launches and regulatory progress. With 21 regulatory submissions accepted, Sanofi demonstrated significant momentum in its pipeline development.\n\nSlight Decline in Gross Margin\n\nSanofi experienced a slight decline in gross margin, attributed to the absence of COVID revenues in 2024. Despite this, the company saw an increase in operating expenses driven by its R&D initiatives, which are crucial for future growth.\n\nIncreased R&D and SG&A Expenses\n\nReflecting high levels of activity and preparation for upcoming product launches, Sanofi\u2019s R&D expenses rose by 14.6%, while SG&A expenses saw a 4.5% increase. These investments are aligned with the company\u2019s strategic growth plans.\n\nImpact of Medicare Part D Changes\n\nSanofi anticipates modest headwinds from changes to Medicare Part D under the IRA, which could affect sales and profit margins. The company is preparing to navigate these challenges as part of its broader strategic initiatives.\n\nFree Cash Flow Impacted by One-Offs\n\nSanofi\u2019s free cash flow was impacted by several factors, including price cuts of Lantus, elimination of factoring of receivables, and unfavorable exchange rates, leading to a closing free cash flow of \u20ac6 billion.\n\nForward-Looking Guidance\n\nLooking ahead, Sanofi provided extensive guidance for its performance in 2024 and beyond. The company anticipates mid-to-high single-digit sales growth and low double-digit EPS growth by 2025, alongside a projected positive foreign exchange impact. Sanofi also plans a \u20ac5 billion share buyback and expects sales reductions from portfolio simplifications, emphasizing its strategic focus on R&D advancements and key pipeline developments.\n\nIn conclusion, Sanofi\u2019s earnings call reflects a positive outlook, driven by strong sales growth and strategic initiatives. While facing challenges such as increased expenses and policy impacts, the company remains committed to its growth trajectory and pipeline advancements, offering optimism for its future performance.\n\nQuestions or Comments about the article?

We listened to analysts and shareholders, and EUR5 billion was a consensus amount. The buyback will start soon. We aim to invest in our business, particularly in R&D, AI, and manufacturing, and are also considering external growth opportunities without pressure, focusing on value creation for shareholders. - Francois-Xavier Roger, CFO\n\nQ: Regarding Dupixent, was the Q4 gross-to-net adjustment a one-off, and how will it affect 2025?\n\nA: The Q4 net sales reflect some one-off items in the US, including true-ups and fewer business days. This does not affect volume, and we are in a strong position for volume growth. We remain committed to our longer-term guidance. - Brian Foard, Head of Specialty Medicine\n\nQ: What are the catalysts you are most excited about in 2025?\n\nA: We are excited about the launch of Dupixent in COPD, the ongoing activity around our bispecific activity in Lunsekimig, and the potential of tolebrutinib in primary progressive MS. These developments are significant for our pipeline and growth. - Houman Ashrafian, EVP, Head of R&D\n\nQ: Can you discuss the potential for Lunsekimig and the implications of its timeline?\n\nA: We are confident in Lunsekimig, which combines the potency of TSLP and IL-13. The timeline adjustment aligns with clinicaltrials.org and does not reflect any data changes. We remain committed to its potential in moderate to severe asthma and high-risk asthma. - Houman Ashrafian, EVP, Head of R&D\n\nQ: What is your outlook for the operating margin and potential for margin leverage?\n\nA: We expect strong revenue growth and gross margin improvement in the coming years. While R&D expenses depend on future readouts, G&A is expected to be flat to declining. The end of the Regeneron co-development lines may pressure BOI in 2027, but we anticipate growth in absolute value each year. - Francois-Xavier Roger, CFO\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.",

            "content": "Sanofi\u2019s super autoimmune blockbuster Dupixent helped drive an 11.3% sales increase in 2024, a result touted by executives as a win but one analyst called a slight miss.\n\nIn full-year earnings results released Thursday morning, the French biopharma giant\u2019s total sales hit about \u20ac41 billion ($42.7 billion) for 2024.\n\nThat performance was driven by sales of autoimmune-fighting antibody Dupixent, with \u20ac13 billion in sales ($13.62 billion). BMO Capital Markets analysts noted that Dupixent\u2019s performance actually indicated a slight miss from analysts consensus of $13.75 billion (\u20ac13.18 billion).\n\nSanofi executives also pointed to the company\u2019s new RSV vaccine for newborns, Beyfortus, approved by the FDA in mid-2023. Last year, the vaccine brought in \u20ac1.7 billion ($1.77 billion) in 2024.\n\n\u201cBeyfortus achieved blockbuster status in its first full year of sales,\u201d CEO Paul Hudson said on the call.\n\nThomas Triomphe, head of vaccines at Sanofi, added, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy about the impact we have seen [from Beyfortus] on hospitalization in the newborn population. We\u2019ve seen many countries showing 80 or 90% reduction on hospitalization.\u201d\n\nHudson also boasted about the company\u2019s continuing work on the vaccine pipeline, noting a bevy of vaccine trials, including vaccines for pneumococcus , meningococcus and an RSV vaccine for adults aged 18 to 49 and 60 to 75 . The adult RSV vaccine would put Sanofi into direct competition with Pfizer , Moderna and GSK , who have focused their RSV vaccine efforts on adults.\n\nTriomphe also highlighted trials on RSV aimed at children, with the goal of keeping kids immunized with Sanofi\u2019s products as they grow. \u201cIt really complements very well what we\u2019re doing on Beyfortus. First season you get your newborn protected with Beyfortus. Second season, you want to make sure that you\u2019re able to provide what we call \u2018complete protection.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe earnings call comes on the heels of Sanofi\u2019s recently announced emphasis on research and development in medicines and vaccines. This strategy involved separating from essentially any other potential revenue streams for the time being, especially its consumer healthcare wing. Sanofi announced plans to sell a controlling share of its healthcare unit Opella in October, with the proceeds going towards possible acquisitions in the coming year.\n\nCFO Fran\u00e7ois Roger said in a media call early Thursday morning that it wants to use its strong balance sheet to shore up its pipeline through M&A. \u201cWe are looking at opportunities in M&A, but without any pressure,\u201d Roger said during the earnings readout call. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any pressure to go crazy on M&A.\u201d\n\nIncrease in business expenses was driven by a boost inspending on R&D, according to Roger. Over the full year 2024, Sanofi bumped its total R&D spend 14.6% to a total of \u20ac7.4 billion ($7.72 billion). That was on top of a \u20ac900 million ($938.60 million) R&D increase in 2023 as well.\n\nAs for deals, Sanofi has stayed busy even in the absence of acquisitions. In September the French biopharma signed a $110 million (\u20ac105.48 million) licensing deal with radiopharma-focused Orano Med and RadioMedix. A month later, the company paid $326 million (\u20ac312.59 million) for a 16% stake in the Orano Med to develop radiotherapies for rare cancers.\n\nAsked by analysts on Thursday what drug in the pipeline they were most excited about, Hudson answered: \u201cThe old \u2018what child is your favorite?\u2019 question. My answer is the one who called me most recently.\u201d",

We exceeded our business EPS guidance. In 2024, we announced an intention to sell a controlling stake in Opella consumer health, which will make Sanofi a focused, science-driven biopharma company.

As we enter 2025, we expect continued, solid growth in sales and a strong rebound in earnings. We are also confident in the mid to long-term growth prospects of Sanofi, supported by ongoing launches, Dupixent (currently expected to reach sales of around \u20ac22 billion in 20307, in line with the current ambition), and expected future launches from our pipeline.\u201d\n\nQ4 2024 Change Change\n\nat CER FY 2024 Change Change\n\nat CER IFRS net sales reported \u20ac10,564m +9.1% +10.3% \u20ac41,081m +8.6% +11.3% IFRS net income reported \u20ac683m \u2014 \u2014 \u20ac5,744m +6.4% \u2014 IFRS EPS reported \u20ac0.54 \u2014 \u2014 \u20ac4.59 +6.5% \u2014 Free cash flow8 \u20ac2,340m -25.5% \u2014 \u20ac5,955m -19.6% \u2014 Business operating income \u20ac2,078m -11.8% -7.7 % \u20ac11,343m +1.5% +7.6% Business net income \u20ac1,642m -15.1% -11.2 % \u20ac8,912m -1.8% +4.1% Business EPS \u20ac1.31 -14.9% -11.0% \u20ac7.12 -1.8% +4.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Changes in net sales are at constant exchange rates (CER) unless stated otherwise (definition in Appendix 9).\n\n2 To facilitate an understanding of operational performance, Sanofi comments on the business net income statement which is a non-IFRS financial\n\nmeasure (definition in Appendix 9).

As usual, you can find the slides on sanofi.com. Please turn to Slide 3. Here we have the usual forward-looking statements.\n\nWe would like to remind you that information presented in this call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to read the disclaimer in our slide presentation. In addition, we refer you to our Form 20-F on file with the U.S. SEC and our French registration document for a description of these risk factors.\n\nFinancials reported are under the new reporting scope that excludes Opella consumer health. As usual, we will be making comments on our performance using constant exchange rates and other non-IFRS measures. Numbers used are in millions of euros and for Q4 2024, unless stated otherwise. Please turn to Slide 4.\n\nFirst, we have a presentation, then we will take your questions. Because this is full-year results, we have a few more slides. We'll still have time for lots of questions as we added 15 minutes to the call time on top of the usual one hour. For Q&A, we have Brian, Olivier, Thomas to cover our global businesses, as well as Roy, our general counsel, and Brendan, head of manufacturing and supply.\n\n[Operator instructions] With this, I'll hand you over to Paul.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, thank you, Thomas. Hello everyone on the call. We made significant progress in 2024 toward becoming a focused science-driven biopharma company. Our strategic progress was emphasized by the decision to sell a controlling stake in Opella and further prioritize R&D.\n\nOn the business, we achieved double-digit sales growth with strong contribution from launches. This included Beyfortus that achieved blockbuster status in its first full year of sales. In R&D, we're pleased with the positive Phase 3 results of fitusiran, riluzabrutinib, and tolebrutinib. They provide the foundation for potential launches this year, underpinning our sustainable growth.\n\nWe are thrilled by the Phase 2 of duvacatode that is ready to move to Phase 3, pending regulatory feedback. Houman will share more pipeline details later. Looking at Q4 on Slide 6, we reported double-digit sales growth for a third consecutive quarter, supported by our key drivers, vaccines, Dupixent, and pharma launches. Taking a closer look at the launches on Slide 7.\n\nIn Q4, Beyfortus sales were as high as those in the first nine months of the year combined. We now have expanded RSV protection to more than 6 million babies around the world. In hemophilia, an increasing number of patients switched to Altuviiio from both factor and non-factor therapies. We're seeing strong patient benefits, and sales reached almost 0.25 billion euros in Q4.\n\nWe are confident in our expectations that Altuviiio will become a blockbuster this year. Moving to Slide 8. Dupixent exceeded the target of 13 billion euros in sales, driven by the demand for more than 1 million patients globally. In Q4, Dupixent grew by 16% from strong prescription trends in all geographies.\n\nIn the U.S., Dupixent continued its leadership in new-to-brand prescriptions across all indications, in line with the first nine months of the year. U.S. sales growth in the quarter reflected fewer business days compared to prior quarters and the normal year-end gross-to-net adjustments. In countries outside the U.S., Dupixent delivered more than 3.5 billion euros on a full-year basis.\n\nIn COPD, we are in the early stages of the launch, and we're seeing positive feedback from patients and prescribers. We expect the inflection point to be this year and COPD to become an important growth driver due to the large unmet medical needs. As we expand the benefits of Dupixent to more patients, we're pleased with the continued work on new indications, including EoE for children in the EU; CSU outside Japan; and BP, globally. New uses, increased penetration in approved indications, and further geographic expansion are all important future drivers for Dupixent.\n\nMoving to Slide 9. 2024 marked a sales record for our vaccines business, crossing the 8-million-euro milestone, up by 13.5%. This performance was driven by Beyfortus, offering a marked reduction in hospitalization across more than 20 countries with all infant programs. We have the only RSV mAb with real-world data showing greater than 80% effectiveness in more than 100,000 babies.\n\nOur flu franchise was resilient, keeping its status as the world leader. 2024 sales exceeded initial expectations, driven by our differentiated Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok. In Q4, we also made significant progress with our vaccines pipeline with the start of six new vaccine studies, including the Phase 3 study for a pneumo vaccine, PCV21, in children. Our R&D efforts in vaccines continue to be recognized by health authorities with the FDA granting Fast Track designation to our three new Phase 1/2 flu programs.\n\nI'm pleased to share with you Sanofi's remarkable achievement in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index. We have improved our ranking and moving from eighth to third place, underscoring our commitment to global health. Important factors for this result are governance of access, R&D, and product delivery. The Sanofi Global Health Unit plays an important role by delivering crucial medicines from the Impact brand portfolio to 30 low- and middle-income countries.\n\nEnding on such a positive note, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all Sanofians for their continued commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients. Thank you. I'll now hand over to Francois, our CFO, for more details on the financials.\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Paul, and hello to everyone. Before I begin, just a reminder that our Q4 and full-year results reflect our new reporting scope, excluding Opella. In the quarter, net sales increased by 10.3% at constant exchange rates to 10.6 billion euros, marking our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As mentioned earlier by Paul, growth was driven by new product launches, as well as Dupixent.\n\nGross margin was 74.3%, down slightly from the previous year, primarily due to the absence of COVID revenues in 2024. Excluding this COVID impact, our gross margin increased by 0.8%. The increase in operating expenses was driven by R&D, reflecting a high activity level in the quarter and brought us in line with our commitments for the full year. Business EPS was 1.31 euros, mainly reflecting a lower gross margin and the increase in R&D and a higher tax rate following the OECD Pillar 2 implementation.\n\nNow turning to our full-year results. Net sales increased by 11.3% at constant exchange rates to 41.1 billion euros, driven by our new product launches, including Beyfortus that became a blockbuster, as well as Dupixent that exceeded our ambition of 13 billion euros in sales. Gross profit grew by 10.3% at constant exchange rate to 31.1 billion with a gross margin of 75.7%. Our gross margin declined slightly due to the absence of any COVID revenue in 2024 and the remaining impact of the Aubagio LOE.\n\nR&D expenses increased by 14.6% at constant exchange rates to 7.4 billion euros, fully in line with our ambition to step up investments in our pipeline in 2024. SG&A expenses increased by 4.5%, providing an attractive gross leverage benefit. Business EPS increased by 4.1% at constant exchange rates to 7.12 euros, exceeding our full-year guidance. We ended our 2024 business EPS more than 6 percentage points above our initial guidance at the beginning of the year.\n\nThese results reflect our ability to drive strong growth while investing for the future and while carefully managing our cost base at the same time. Looking ahead to 2025, we would like to provide an overview of anticipated key business dynamics, which may be helpful for modeling purposes. As a reminder, at the beginning of the year, we expect to see the usual impact from the annual reset of insurance deductibles which leads to higher utilization of our copay assistance program for specialty medicines in the U.S. market.\n\nWe anticipate only modest headwinds from the introduction of changes to Medicare Part D under the IRA. We continue to simplify our portfolio of other medicines, and we expect around 250 million euros of sales reduction from disposals. We expect Beyfortus to grow further with additional penetration on geographic expansion. Our gross margin is expected to increase in 2025.\n\nR&D expenses will be slightly up, and there was a one-off Sobi item last year. SG&A will also slightly increase in preparation for upcoming launches, and we expect capital gains from portfolio simplifications to be again around 500 million euros. Our effective tax rate should remain broadly stable compared to 2024. For our 2025 guidance, we have decided to expand our disclosure by providing sales growth, in addition to EPS growth.\n\nFor 2025, we project sales to grow at the mid- to high single-digit percentage at constant exchange rates. This guidance now excludes any impact from hyperinflation, which accounted for about 1.8 percentage point of sales growth in 2024. We estimate a positive foreign exchange impact on sales of approximately plus 2% to 3% in 2025. Business EPS growth is expected to grow at a low double-digit percentage at constant exchange rates before foreign exchange and before share buyback impact.\n\nWe estimate a positive business EPS impact from currency of approximately plus 2% to 3% as well. Shifting to our free cash flow in 2024, which was mainly impacted by three one offs: first, the impact of price cuts of Lantus in the U.S. in H1 for 1.1 billion euros; second, the entire elimination of all factoring of receivables for 1.4 billion euros; and third, an unfavorable exchange rate impact of 0.8 billion euros, all of it resulting in a closing free cash flow of 6 billion euros. We expect our free cash flow ratio to be back to our historical levels steadily over 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe slight increase of our net debt at the end of 2024 reflects our strategic investments, including the acquisition of Inhibrx, as well as our value proposition to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is actually pretty close to our net debt-to-BOI ratio, was at 0.7 times at the end of 2024. This showcases a low gearing ratio and an optimal balance between strategic capital allocation and financial flexibility. In 2025, Sanofi will receive a cash consideration in the high single digit in billions of euros from the Opella transaction at the earliest in Q2 while retaining a significant stake in the company above 48%.\n\nLet me conclude by confirming our existing capital allocation policy. Our primary focus is to invest in our business to drive growth, demonstrated by our increased investment in R&D last year, as well as ongoing investments in manufacturing, in AI, in digitalization, as well as in sales and marketing. We will continue to explore external growth opportunities to strengthen our four existing therapeutic areas and potentially cover white spaces. In all our external investments, we maintain strict discipline and focus on value creation for our shareholders.\n\nOur preference remains for investments in the range of 2 billion euros to 5 billion euros each. We are committed to maintaining our AA credit rating in the short to medium term. In line with our commitments to shareholders, Sanofi intends to execute a share buyback program of 5 billion euros in 2025. These repurchases will be conducted preferably through block trades and in the open market.\n\nShares acquired will be canceled and will have an accretive effect to Sanofi's earning per share, mitigating part of the Opella dilution. This commitment underscores our confidence in Sanofi's future and our commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value. Our proposed dividend of 3.92 euros per share for 2024 marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend increase, further reflecting the emphasis we put on shareholder reward and the dependability of our dividend policy. With the proposed dividend and the share buyback combined, we will reward shareholders with almost 10 billion euros in 2025.\n\nThis would be a record year in terms of shareholder return for Sanofi. I now hand over to Houman to provide an update on the progress of our innovation pipeline.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nThank you, Francois. 2024 accelerated the transition into a company with increased focus on science with our pipeline starting to deliver meaningful benefits for patients and healthcare systems and growth opportunities for our company. We presented convincing clinical trial results in recent medical meetings, including for tolebrutinib in SPMS, rilzabrutinib in ITP, and fitusiran in hemophilia, the molecules from our pipeline that we are incidentally preparing for launch this year. As we look holistically at R&D productivity, scientific publications in high-impact journals underpin our commitment to developing science and bringing new medicines and treatments to patients.\n\nWe have an increasing trend of high-impact publications, and we now plan to closely track this leading indicator of improved productivity over time. Our pipeline has continued to deliver positive results, including eight positive Phase 3 readouts in 2024. We've initiated 18 mid- to late-stage studies with seven Phase 3s and six new molecular entities moving into the clinic. This increased level of activity is the main driver of R&D spend that Francois covered earlier.\n\nOn the regulatory side, we've made substantial progress with 21 acceptances of our regulatory submissions, including for the new -- for the three new molecules for the year. None of these are benefiting from priority review. We received 14 approvals supporting the ongoing new launches. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nWe are pleased with the significant process made for -- progress made for Sarclisa in 2024, including approvals of the MRO study in the U.S. and the EU last week. During the ASH meeting, data were presented in the frontline treatment option in multiple myeloma, both for patients eligible and ineligible for our autologous stem cell transplant. On the left, we have the PFS curve from the HD7 study, where Sarclisa, added to a standard frontline combination, demonstrated a 43% improvement in PFS based on a hazard ratio of 0.7.\n\nWe're very pleased that Sarclisa continues to shine in terms of patient benefits by offering a new standard of care. On the right, we referenced the IRAKLIA Phase 3 study of subcutaneous Sarclisa, meeting both co-primaries noninferiority end points, in addition to confirming a safety profile. Additional data from ongoing studies, in combination with different standards of care and across multiple lines of treatment, will support a broad application for a subcutaneous administration which we think will bring new benefits to patients and healthcare systems. The first regulatory submission is expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nOn Slide 21. Our commitment to rare diseases remains steadfast. Rilzabrutinib is one of the new additions to this portfolio with potential in ITP and far beyond. At ASH, we shared the Phase 3 data in ITP with rilzabrutinib meeting its primary end point of a durable platelet response in 23% of patients, compared to 0% on placebo at week 25.\n\nIn addition, a platelet response defined as a platelet count achieving at least 50 times 10 to the ninth per liter or a platelet count between 30 times 10 to the ninth per liter and 50 times 10 to the ninth per liter that are double from baseline, was achieved in 65% of our patients after only 15 days of treatment. As rilzabrutinib pleiotropically addresses the underlying immunological mechanisms of the disease instead of just boosting platelets per se as some existing medicines do, it confers an improvement in the quality of life of clinical symptoms and fatigue, even in nondurable response. We anticipate global approval this year and launch as the regulatory reviews are ongoing in EU, China, and in the U.S. for the PDUFA date of the 29th of August.\n\nIn addition, we now have meaningful benefit in wAIHA IgG4-related disease from our Phase 2 programs with IgG4 for being shared for the first time today. We're evaluating the move into Phase 3 with at least one of these two indications. As we remain committed to rare disease, we believe rilzabrutinib can bring significant patient benefit as we unleash the potential of pleiotropic immune modulation. On Slide 22, our partner Teva recently announced positive duvakitug Phase 2b results in IBD.\n\nIBD remains an important unmet medical need in immunology where we are underrepresented today. Duvakitug represents a meaningful opportunity for Sanofi to begin to bring new science and benefit to IBD patients continuing immunology and far beyond. We saw a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease with all end points met and faring pleasingly competitively within a TL1A class. It is the first and only TL1A to demonstrate a benefit in Crohn's disease, patients achieved strong placebo-adjusted responses across both indications as high as 27.4% clinical remission in UC and 34.8% endoscopic response in Crohn's disease, both at the high dose level tested.\n\nCombined with a favorable safety and tolerability profile, these positive results offer an opportunity to advance the program into Phase 3 development and potentially offer an improved outlook for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease relatively soon. Additionally, data will be presented at the ECCO meeting later this month. I'd like to conclude with my usual news flow slide now with 2026 news flow for the first time. We plan 12 Phase 3 readouts, 15 regulatory submissions, and 13 regulatory decisions in multiple jurisdictions increasingly capturing the improving value of our clients.\n\nImportantly, we also see the intensity of the news flow increase over the coming two years, building on our earlier comments about our focus on improving R&D productivity. The cadence and the volume of the R&D drumbeat continued to quicken. We look forward to updating you on our progress. As I regularly say, we remain humble in the patient disease and regrettably not everything will work.\n\nHowever, I'm optimistic that the impact of talented science-focused teams, coupled with our increasing exposure to breathtaking digital technologies, will drive this unique pipeline in our core-focused therapy areas in the service of patients. I would like to thank all of my brilliant R&D team members and colleagues across the company for the positive progress made this year. We are indeed chasing the miracles of science to improve people's lives. With this, I hand back to Paul for Q&A.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, thank you, Houman. Thank you, Francois. We'll now call to questions. [Operator instructions]\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nYes. The first question will be from Luisa Hector from Berenberg. Luisa?\n\nLuisa Hector -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHi there. Thanks for taking my question. On the buyback, perhaps you could just comment on the rationale for the size, the 5 billion euros and how soon you might start the buyback, and then any color on plans for the rest of your proceeds. So essentially, just latest thoughts on M&A targets by development stage, therapy area, size, etc.\n\nPerhaps then I could move to vaccines. I would like to ask Thomas some questions, maybe on the pneumococcal vaccine. So the Phase 3 entry, very exciting, perhaps a bit more color on what you're looking to show in Phase 3 and how you see the competitive landscape because there are others coming forward with vaccines perhaps with higher valence C2431, so how you see a 21 valent vaccine fitting in. Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Luisa. I counted eight questions. So OK, so buyback, sizing, timing, proceeds. Over to you, Francois.\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes. So good morning, Luisa. See, the rationale for the 5 billion euros, actually, we wanted to mitigate part of the dilution of Opella. So I think that we are addressing that with the 5 billion euros.\n\nWhat we did as well was to listen to you as analysts and to listen our shareholders as well, and we found that 5 billion euros was actually the amount that -- on which there was a consensus as well on your side. The starting point, we expect to start the share buyback in the middle of next week, actually, or relatively quickly. The rest of the proceeds, it's part of our capital allocation. You saw that, first and foremost, we want to invest in our business, which is what we did in R&D last year, which is what we do as well on a permanent basis in AI, in manufacturing.\n\nThere will be more coming in, in sales and marketing ahead of quite a few launches coming in. Obviously, we are looking as well very seriously at external growth opportunities, BD and M&A, without any pressure because we have a strong growth outlook ahead of us because we have a strong pipeline as well. I mean, Houman just covered it a few minutes ago. That being said, we have a strong balance sheet.\n\nAs you could see, we have a limited amount of debt as at the end of '24, so which gives us a certain number of opportunities, but we don't feel any pressure to go crazy on M&A and BD. So we will remain very disciplined while having the opportunity to complement whatever we have in our pipeline. So the main focus will be actually on our four therapeutic areas, which you know, plus potentially some white spaces, once again without feeling any pressure and always focused on creating value for our shareholders.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Thomas, PCV21, competitive landscape.\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nThank you, Luisa. Indeed, Sanofi was very pleased to announce the start of the Phase 3 program for PCV21 panel product. The study is progressing as per plan. And in total, we are expecting to include more than 7,000 infants into the overall Phase 3 program.\n\nMore broadly and in line you're your question, as you know very well, first of all, it's exactly at the heart of what we're doing today at Sanofi vaccines. It's reaching either the pediatric for this Phase 3 program or the elderly segments, both segments where we are very well-positioned, so it fits perfectly with our portfolio. It will be nicely complementary. It's a big space today, but pediatric is about 70% of the pneumo business altogether.\n\nAnd basically, as per the competitiveness of the program, I think I have a couple of things to highlight. First of all, PCV21 program is going to be the first pediatric vaccine against pneumococcal disease that will enter into a national immunization schedule, the first one with more than 20 valences. So I think that we position well as a starting point. As you've noticed also from our December announcement, we've announced a refocusing of the alliance with our partner SK, which means that it's a starting point.\n\nIt's not an ending point. We'll start with PCV21. And of course, our objective is to be competitive all over the marketplace. Therefore, we'll keep going forward with more and more valances.\n\nSo we appreciate, obviously, that other companies are working on other candidates in this space, but we do believe that we are very well-positioned to start a significant entry into that place, and we remain competitive in the future.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nGreat. Very effective. The first is you said 21 valences and a years ahead in the pediatric market, which is the biggest segment of all in that market. OK.\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Graham Parry from BofA. Graham?\n\nGraham Parry -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. So firstly, on Dupixent and just the gross-to-net adjustment in the fourth quarter, can you just clarify that with just a one-off adjustment catch-up for channel mix, rebate levels through the whole year of 2025 and just the extent to which that drove the 150 million euro miss. Is that just the majority of that compared to, say, invoicing days? And then just any comments you've got on how that could progress into 2025.\n\nAnd then secondly, on Beyfortus, just given clesrovimab potential for approval this year, possible inclusion in the season, do you -- are you -- what are you assuming in your guidance for the year on Beyfortus? Is it expected to grow? And then finally, on tolebrutinib, if you could just update us on the indication that you're expecting for tolebrutinib in non-relapsing SPMS. Is it classically defined non-relapsing SPMS you're discussing? Or is there any potential here to get a broader label for progression, independent of relapse activity? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Brian, Dupi, gross to net and outlook to '25.\n\nBrian Foard -- Global Business Unit Head, Specialty Care\n\nYes. Thanks so much, Graham, for the question. And I'll first start off by reiterating what Paul said in his opening remarks. We couldn't be more pleased with Dupixent's full-year performance, delivering greater than 13 billion euros.\n\nAs you guys know, we provided the target of 13 billion euros for the year, 23% growth this previous year. And again, it's underlying demand driven is what's happening here. So we have strong TRx growth across indications and across geographies, and that's the same actually for Q4. Q4 was really strong performance with double-digit growth in terms of sales and TRxs.\n\nAnd it's just exactly as you said. I think you said it in your question. It was really due to the Q4 net sales reflect some one-off items in the U.S., so there's some true-ups there. And of course, there is a little bit of the fewer business days.\n\nThere's a little bit of each of the two mixes. But overall, again, really, this doesn't affect volume. We're in a really strong position as far as volume goes. And now having 2024 behind us, it even further reinforces our commitment to our longer-term guidance that we provided, so feel like we're in a very good shape exiting '24 and entering '25.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd you see the script trends as we started the year, so very encouraging already. Beyfortus guidance, Thomas, and competitive set?\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Graham. First of all, maybe before we switch on to 2025, a couple of those on 2024, very happy about the first year of Beyfortus first full year of sales. We reached close to 1.7 billion euros, unprecedented pediatric immunization launch in the history of pediatric immunizations.\n\nSo I think that's a proof point of our capabilities. Now it's also a proof point of the capability of the product because you've seen that not only we are happy about the sales, but most importantly, we are very happy about the impact we have seen on hospitalization in the newborn population. Now moving forward from 2024 to 2025, we see further growth in 2025. That's very clear when you look at the penetration on the number of countries we can go to.\n\nThere's more penetration in some markets, and there's a couple of more markets notably in Europe or Asia where we could grow in the coming year in 2025 and after in 2026. So obviously, we also recognize that there are more competition coming down the road. You've pointed another molecule antibody that could come in 2025. We expect this other molecule antibody to come in 2025 in the U.S.\n\nAs we discussed before, I think first impact would be the fact that we will talk more about the importance of RSV prevention. So it will raise the importance of the awareness of RSV disease. That's the first thing. And then, of course, while there will be more competition down the road, we believe that we have a competitive profile with nirsevimab.\n\nWe have an extensive amount of reward dividends. You've seen many countries showing 80% or 90% reduction in hospitalization, and you've seen the very pristine safety on a large scale that is provided with the Beyfortus moving forward. So I think that from a real-world evidence, from the competitive profile, but we have also with a significant half life compared to the other molecular antibody, we are well-positioned to grow in 2025.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Thomas. Houman, tolebrutinib and potential label.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Graham. Tolebrutinib has been submitted in line with our previous guidance last year. We're excited about the data for tolebrutinib, as you suggested, secondary progressive MS, and we are equally excited about the readout later in this year for PPMS.\n\nThis is a demonstration of Sanofi's commitment -- unwavering commitment to patients with MS.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus?\n\nSeamus Fernandez -- Analyst\n\nHello. Thanks very much. I'll just go simple and try to abide by the one-question request. So actually, the question is for Paul and Houman sort of simultaneously.\n\nIf you each wouldn't mind offering up the catalysts that you're most excited about in 2025 in particular. I think most investors anticipate the results of itepekimab most eagerly but love to just kind of hear your thoughts on maybe your top three and if perhaps they might differ slightly. It would be fun to hear that as well.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAll right. So the old, which is your favorite child. For me, it's the one that called me most recently. But maybe Houman, you start, and I'll add.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. So I'll be very quick, top thre. I think we're excited about the launch of Dupi in COPD, which my beloved colleague, Brian, has already talked about. I think bringing itepekimab alongside that for patients with -- who are former smokers will be very exciting and reinforcing our position in pulmonary inflammation and immunology.\n\nI think it's an exciting time for amlitelimab as we continue the quickening drumbeat, particularly in disorders like asthma and in hidradenitis suppurativa. And finally, I'm very excited about the ongoing activity around our -- and completely internally generated bispecific activity in lucitanib. So those are my three, but it would be remiss of me not to comment on our three launches that are coming up.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'm excited about all of our Phase 2 programs, just to give it. I think the quality of what we're putting in means that we're more confident what comes out, of course, the normal risks around that. Probably a bit of overlapping with you, I mean, the itepekimab in COPD is game changer in former smokers, so I think that is going to be really interesting. And I could pick from three or four other things.\n\nBut on the later stage, I think it's primary progressive MS with tolebrutinib. I think they're all a big deal, and I think we can go a bit deeper into Phase 2s. But it's exciting year for us. No LOEs, mid-, high single-digit growth, strong rebrand in EPS, and pipeline catalysts.\n\nI mean, that's where we want to go, top-line pipeline. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Next question from Peter Welford from Jefferies. Peter?\n\nPeter Welford -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. I hope you hear me. So I'll ask these two.\n\nFirstly, just on Beyfortus. Can you just comment there on two things, both in terms of -- you said growth for 2025. Can we expect U.S. growth within your assumption for 2025? And what's with regarding the actual doses that you shipped at the moment in the U.S.\n\nor indeed other markets, have they been used? Or are there still doses at the moment that are outstanding that are presumably likely to be used during the first part of the year as the season continues? And then secondly, I just wonder if you can comment on the potential for Lunsekimig there. I think our catalyst has been pushed into 2026. Is that -- does that reflect any changes to the data you're awaiting or any change to the Phase 2? Or is that purely just a timing from the point of view of recruiting and getting sufficient data onboard for the decision in ASPA Phase 3? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAll right. Peter, thank you. Thomas, on Beyfortus U.S. growth and doses shipped.\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nYeah. We don't -- thanks for the question, Peter. We don't provide exact number of doses shipped by provider or to each country, but I can still give a bit more color on 2025 versus what happened in 2024. So I think what's at the heart of your question for 2024 is how did we deliver the growth on 2024 and what does that mean for -- how should you think about 2025.\n\nSo first of all, we had a significant increase in supply in 2024. All the teams have been remarkably working on both sides of the partners to deliver that. That has enabled us to deliver in Q4 2024 enough doses to cover for the 2024 needs and the Q1 2025 needs because, as you know very well, RSV is not flu. And therefore, you have babies being born in January and February and some more catch up.\n\nSo there will be RSV immunization in January, February, and March, and we've shipped doses in Q4 2024 for that to happen. So this is what accounted for. I still believe that when it comes to penetration, there is an opportunity to increase in the U.S. in the coming years.\n\nOf course, as always, when it comes to VCR, it's year by year progressively. There's a lot going on in the U.S., as you know very well, so we'll know more in the coming few weeks. But when you look at the profile of the product, we believe that there is a good space for the product moving forward.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Thomas. Houman, Lunsekimig?\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. So as I said, thanks for asking the question. We're very proud of Lunsekimig combining the potency of TSLP and IL-13, best in class, firstin class, unprecedented molecule with the best pheno data that's out there. Your specific question was about the implication of the move into '27 of that.\n\nI just want to -- I want to take a step back. I think the -- Sanofi has adopted a new discipline. This is part of our credo now. We're an organization that is robust in our use of data.\n\nAnd what all we've done, as you can see, by outlining and dimensionalizing our pipeline timing, what we've tried to do is align that beautifully with ClinicalTrials.org. That's all we're doing. There is no implication for Lunsekimig. In fact, our commitment, both to moderate to severe asthma, as well as high-risk asthma, underlines the importance of this potential molecule to both increase the efficacy ceiling and possibly drive durability.\n\nSo simple answer to your question, we remain super confident.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. It is really actually quite an exciting product given, in particular, on high-risk asthma. I mean, really -- I've been in asthma for 35 years, and I think this is a real incredible opportunity. OK.\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question from Jo Walton from UBS. Jo?\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJo?\n\nJo Walton -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Can you hear me?\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah.\n\nJo Walton -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nExcellent. I have two questions, please. Firstly, can I push you a little bit more on vaccines? Perhaps you can give us some idea of what you think the penetration today in relevant infants is in the U.S. and what that would be compared to some other sort of early pediatric vaccines, just to give us a sense of what the upside for the market there is.\n\nAnd also within vaccines, can you tell us a bit more about the proportion of your sales that go to, let's say, adolescents with mandates? Because I think people are fearful that while everyone is going to be allowed the choice to have a vaccine going forwards, perhaps some of the mandates that really pushed people to vaccination may weaken, anything to do with individual choice, and you do tend to see lower vaccination rates. So I'd like you to discuss that a little bit in more detail, if you could. And could you also just please tell us a little bit more about healthcare reform in the U.S., your assumption of how much more you're going to have to pay for the Part D for those patients who are in catastrophic cover? And whether you see any offsets in terms of increased volume from lower patient copays, more adherence, for example, for things like Dupixent in the elderly.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Thank you. And, Francois, maybe I'll meet you on the last part on the assumptions. Some very specific questions, Thomas.\n\nI'm not sure that you can answer them specifically, but you can certainly share what you think.\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nYeah. And if I cannot answer them specifically, please call. That's why we're having quarterly calls. It might be some other quarters on the road.\n\nWhat I mean by that, sorry. Hi, Jo. And back to your first question on the penetration in the U.S. It will be today in January a bit premature because I said before, you have the full data a few weeks after injection, and we know very well that RSV immunization are going to go see in January, February, and March.\n\nSo it's a bit early to say. I would expect the significant percentage of the U.S. birth cohort has been protected against RSV this year, but -- which means more than the majority, more than half, if you wish. But it's way too early to be a bit more precise.\n\nWait for a couple of one or two earning calls, and we'll do a bit more. It will give you more idea of further room to play. But there is -- as for any immunization coming into the market, it takes two or three years to pick in terms of VCR. So I think that's what we should expect for the product, especially the whole category.\n\nNow on your second question, which is very different on percentage of adolescents with a corresponding to mandated or potentially mandated immunizations in the U.S., I understand where the question is coming from. A bit early there. I would say that if you want to have an idea, the immunizations you're talking about are some boosters in adolescents and some meningococcal shots in adolescents, so mening and boosters. However, if you're looking at the heart of your question, I personally do not believe that mandatory or not mandatory situations will make a big difference into the taxation coverage rates.\n\nSo we are not specifically worried for that. Of course, it's something we are monitoring as a field. But when you look at the clear benefits risk of our products moving forward between disease and not disease, those one-time immunizations are very clear in terms of safety and benefits. So again, there are some decisions that will happen in the coming few months or quarters maybe.\n\nLet's see. Let's not have too many hypotheses. But whether or not mandatory situation are removed, I do not foresee today a major impact on ourselves.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Maybe Francois will let you --\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nFrancois speaking. On the Medicare Part D, as I said, we expect a modest impact. It has been fully built in our 2025 guidance and budget, obviously. You talked about the volume elasticity.\n\nThere isn't \u2013 it's very difficult to assess, but we don't expect a significant positive volume elasticity out of it. But maybe I'll let Brian complement what I said.\n\nBrian Foard -- Global Business Unit Head, Specialty Care\n\nYeah. I think as Francois said, we're a little bit less exposed versus some of the other organizations as well based upon the nature of our portfolio. Again, more innovative medicines and vaccines, so you tend to have a little bit less exposure there. As well, you see a lot of our business, even for Dupixent that we've said, 70% of our business really primarily comes from commercial versus again in the government channels.\n\nBut nevertheless, I think, Jo, you hit the nail on the head a little bit. What we haven't seen yet is will we actually have a little bit of volume improvement based upon the 2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap for patients which could lead to improved compliance for patients as well? So that's really to be determined, but that could be a potential slight offset, if you will. But we feel like we're in a very good position as we enter into 2025.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Thank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Richard Vosser from J.P. Morgan. Richard?\n\nRichard Vosser -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, please. One on amlitelimab.\n\nJust as we think about the asthma data that's coming up and the 12-week dosing, could you just talk through your level of confidence that you'll see no detrimental reduction in efficacy there through the data? And then secondly, question on itepekimab. Obviously, Dupixent in COPD has a broader label. The launch is going exceptionally well from the script trends. But what implications does that have for the residual opportunity for itepekimab in COPD? Thanks very much.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Houman?\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. Thanks, Richard. Two quick answers, and thank you for both questions. So just categorically, I obviously haven't seen the data, just to be clear, but I don't expect based on the pharmacodynamics of amlitelimab in atopic dermatitis, a condition which is both clinically overlapping and pathophysiology overlapping, I don't expect any drop off at week 12.\n\nIn fact, what we saw with amli is progressive increase throughout the duration of atopic dermatitis over 52 weeks, so I'm actually comfortable that the pharmacodynamic half life of amli will continue to grow throughout the course of asthma. We remain studiously awaiting the outcome of the amlitelimab asthma result, which should be this half of the year. And then specifically talk about itepekimab, just to challenge a little bit of the underlying premise of the question, while we were appropriately rewarded with a broad label for dupilumab with type 2 inflammation and chronic bronchitis, I think that it's the population of former smokers is a very substantial one and one that we led to science with both genetically and in terms of characterization of the patients while IL-33 secretion is substantially increased in bronchoalveolar lavage. So actually, if anything, the opportunity is very substantial in the form of smokers that have significant morbidity and mortality, so you said, with COPD, and we remain steadfast in our view that in a success scenario, which we'll know fairly soon, the combination of products will reach a peak sales of more than $5 billion a year.\n\nBrian, any further thoughts?\n\nBrian Foard -- Global Business Unit Head, Specialty Care\n\nYeah. I'd like to complement that with, again, like other therapeutic areas or disease states that we've gone in with our immunology portfolio, again, we are the first mover into the marketplace. So the biopetentration rate today is, again, just what we're doing with Dupixent in COPD, number one. And so as we go in there with both of these agents, we're going to be able to continue to grow patients, I think, on those therapies.\n\nBut just nicely, as you said, this is going to open up the population. And across the two, we've shown you that two by two before in the past. Itepekimab plus Dupixent will open up the opportunity to reach more than 80% of the COPD population. Again, around 2 million patients if you think about it across the G7, if you will.\n\nSo they both uniquely sit in unique places. They overlap ever so slightly, I think, in the above 300 EOS level in the type 2 COPD patient population. But I think the complement of the two really shows that we're going after this disease state from all angles because there will be different patient populations that will benefit from both drugs.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nBrian, just a quick addition before we go back to Paul, which is I just want to remind everybody that itepekimab works in the highest interval and the lowest interval population equally in terms of relative risk reduction, and we do have a life cycle management strategy for itepekimab with CRS with MP. Our Dupixent story is now being rolled out in conjunction with our extremely valued partners at Regeneron.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Richard, for allowing Houman an opportunity to hijack the call. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Florent Cespedes from Bernstein/Societe Generale. Florent?\n\nFlorent Cespedes -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. Florent Cespedes from Bernstein. Two questions, please, on the pipeline. First on R&D budget.\n\nWith a long list of Phase 2 products, how will you manage the R&D budget going forwards? Good problem to have, but any color would be great. And my second question is for Thomas. We see more and more vaccines projects on the pipeline and on the new slot tables. I like the Phase 3 and the RSV for toddlers.\n\nCould you maybe elaborate a bit, even though for 2026, but how you see these projects nicely, good addition to your existing RSV franchise? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Florent. Managing the R&D budget, Francois?\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. So Florent, Good afternoon. So for 2025, we expect a moderate increase in terms of R&D spend and investment, but don't forget that this comes over 900 billion euros plus increase in 2024 over 2023. And don't forget either that, obviously, as it is the case every year, we have projects being completed and new projects coming in, new clinical trial coming in and out.\n\nSo we are comfortable with the amount that we have for 2025 with a slight increase over 2024. Once again, it is 900 million euros plus increase. For 2026, we have not provided any indication for the time being. We are working on it.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. All right. Good. Thomas?\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nThanks for the question, Florent. Indeed, I like the way you frame the question, Florent. We're really looking forward to beat an aggressive franchise. So the first proof was the Beyfortus that we just talked about at the beginning of the call.\n\nAnd as highlighted before, we want to make sure that we complement that with an RSV toddler approach for second season and thereafter, as well as with an elderly approach moving forward with respiratory combinations. For the RSV toddler candidate you're talking about, indeed Phase 3 2026 readout will be an important one. Why am I particularly excited about this one? Because it really complements very well what we're doing on Beyfortus. First season, you get your newborn protected with Beyfortus.\n\nSecond season, you want to make sure that you're able to provide what we call complete protection, i.e., we're targeting by being an intranasal product. We go to the mucosal immunity and to prevent not only lower respiratory disease but also upper respiratory disease, which is why we're going for the intranasal approach. We think it makes a lot of sense. There's a significant burden of disease still in kids one year, two years, and three years of age, and we believe that we have a step forward that of any competitor in this area.\n\nThat's why we're so excited about it.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Thomas. OK. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Risinger from Leerink. David?\n\nDavid Risinger -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks very much, and congrats on all the strong business momentum. So my two questions are, first, what amount of Nuvaxovid sales are factored into 2025 sales guidance? And second, should we expect top-line press releases on Phase 2 trial results? Or will we need to wait for you to provide updates on them in conjunction with quarterly results calls? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Thank you. Nuvaxovid, Thomas?\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nSo maybe -- thanks for the question, David. As you know very well, we've announced last year the collaboration with Novavax to make sure that we are really looking forward at building what we believe could be a competitive -- not only competitive but a winning ticket for flu and COVID-19 combination. We always highlighted a couple of things that I'd like to stress again year to date. First of all, the big objective of this alliance is really to get to the right combination vaccines, flu and COVID, and we believe this market to be well served needs to ensure that there is the right level of safety, efficacy, and making sure that we have thermostability.\n\nAnd of course, when you have two winning leaders in Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok, that's why we're happy that we have received the Fast Track designation for both Phase 1, 2 trials with Nuvaxovid. Of course, in 2025 and 2026 months forward, we're going to start commercializing Nuvaxovid first and foremost in the U.S. This, in 2025, the first reason is to learn about the COVID-19 market. It will be our first time in the U.S., so we need to understand, first of all, how is the market behaving there on COVID-19 and if our hypothesis or the fact that there is room for actually a better-tolerable COVID-nineteen vaccine is indeed confirmed into the marketplace.\n\nYou know very well that there is a PDUFA date in the U. S. for this product in April. So let's make sure that we first move forward to the PDUFA date, the level we have.\n\nAnd of course, we have not disclosed any sales targets specifically for COVID-19 in 2025 and 2026. But as you know very well, this has been already included with the guidance that has been shared with Francois. Again, it's going to be progressive learning, building on the market, and then really launching at scale our combination.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Thomas. And I think you said it about safety. I mean, it'd be interesting to have a non-mRNA COVID opportunity.\n\nAnd if that has a lower burden, we don't know. But from a safety perspective, and that leads to being a stronger choice, we'll find out.\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nIt could be what changes the COVID-19 PCR rate, which has been collapsing recently.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think we all remember what it was like to get the safety challenges on route. But anyway, OK. Houman, over to you. Are you going to do press releases for Phase 2?\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nWell, let me start with a very simple comment that we are very conscious of our materiality requirements. We will remain great stewards of that. That's the very first point beyond anything else. Now speaking specifically about clinical trials, we're also conscious of the embargo requirements of major meetings, and we need to be very thoughtful about that.\n\nSo we will absolutely not commit to publishing top-line Phase 2 data as they come, except where they're material or as part of a broader story. Please watch the broad story development around R&D and pipeline at Sanofi as we go. We are now becoming a science company.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Well said. OK, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Peter Verdult from BNP Exane. Peter?\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nPeter.\n\nPete Verdult -- BNP Paribas Exane -- Analyst\n\nHello there. How are you?\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK.\n\nPete Verdult -- BNP Paribas Exane -- Analyst\n\nOK. It's Pete Verdult here from BNP Paribas Exane. Two questions. Houman, just on TL1A, really interesting asset in light of your data in UC and in particular Crohn's.\n\nAnd also given the market seems to describe all the value of this class to competing assets. So recent KOL checkpoint of biomarker-led strategies being keenly sought. So I'm just seeking confirmation from you and your partner, Teva, that a biomarker will be deployed in your Phase 3 program, timings on the Phase 3 start, and whether you're considering going beyond IBD in your clinical development program. And then a very quick one for Francois on Dupixent, just simply on profitability dynamics in light of the COPD launch accelerating volumes and the manufacturing changes that you're putting through.\n\nThe simple question, Francois, I'm not asking for numbers, but just -- will 2025 be a significant sort of gross margin driver as it relates to Dupixent? Or do we need to be a little bit more conservative and wait until 2026? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Thank you. The biomarkers question.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. Hi, Peter. Congratulations. I should start by saying, the TL1A story, yeah.\n\nWe did a great deal around the TL1A, and we were quiet until the science began to speak for itself. Based on preliminary data, we're very excited about how competitive our molecule is. I don't share necessarily your KOL calls feedback that standard of care will require biomarker-based stratification as an obligatory option. But of course, we are active in thinking about how we design our Phase 3 trials to deliver the maximum value for patients.\n\nAnd in terms of life cycle management options, we are working diligently with our partner Teva to establish the best path forward with life cycle management options. More on this space in February ECCO meeting, And with that, I'll hand over to Francois and Brian for the next level of question.\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes, Peter. On the question of gross margin, let me give you a little bit of insight. First of all, if you look at it four, five years ago, we were 4 to 5 percentage points lower than our peers in terms of gross margin. We have gone a long way because if you look at it in '24, we were basically at par with our peers, which gives a good illustration of the way we manage our portfolio and we manage some efficiency program as well.\n\nIn 2025, we expect to see some further progress in our gross margin, which is partly coming from Dupixent, but not only. By the way, our growth even in 2024, and this is the case in 2025 and in the coming years, I would say we are not Dupixent dependent just to increase our gross margin. So it's a combination of factors, but there is a fair contribution from Dupixent, but it's not only Dupixent. And I must say, the other new product launches have a fair contribution to it as well.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Anything to add? No? OK. Good. And Peter, we'll allow a little bit more time in the next call given the length of your new title.\n\nRight. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve?\n\nSteve Scala -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. Also on TL1A, has the best-in-class profile held up when the data is cut by biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients? So that's the first question. And secondly, are you highly confident FDA will not ask for additional data, such as the PPMS data, for approval of tolebrutinib? And is the every-week monitoring for three months likely to be what's in the label? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. I think we're straight to you, Houman.\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYeah. Well, I don't want to undermine the discussion at ECCO later this month in terms of biologically naive and biological experience. Suffice it to say that we warmly invite you to the ECCO meeting to come and see the breadth of our data. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAnd then very specifically with PPMS and SPMS, as you know, we're working closely with the FDA who encouraged us to submit for SPMS. Now as you know, the results of the PPMS result comes out later in the year. You can infer exactly what the dataset requirement will be for SPMS in that regard. Of course, any decision is subject to regulatory final active review.\n\nAnd then with respect to the label and monitoring, I think you'll see that the FDA will adhere pretty closely to the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol that's been the standard in this kind of space in terms of intensiveness and regularity of the monitoring, and we anticipate that that will play out in the label. We should be upfront and straightforward in saying that Sanofi will support any decision by the regulator to provide the most thoughtful and safe path for patients to take this disease-modifying drug.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Houman. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Next question is from Emmanuel Papadakis from Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel?\n\nEmmanuel Papadakis -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking the question. Yes, Emmanuel Papadakis, Deutsche Bank. So maybe a question for Francois on the outlook for the operating margin. Just talk a little bit about potential for margin leverage.\n\nI know it's \u2013 presumably, we should see revenue growth beyond well beyond 2025. We obviously have some financial considerations to take into account, the Regeneron co-development lines, royalty lines perhaps. Just your thoughts on whether steady, modest margin improvement in the midterm is a reasonable assumption. And then maybe a question for Houman on one of the handful of Phase 2 -- interesting Phase 2 data points are due this year, Belinotanfib, the oral TNF.\n\nThe Phase 1 data last year showed moderate efficacy. You've emphasized the potential as a combination opportunity with biologics. In that setting, we do this right to say it relatively soon. What are you hoping to see in that? And is the plan to take it forward now as a biologic combination Phase 3? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK, Francois.\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes, Emmanuel. From the medium term, I don't want to give a guidance. But directionally, I can help you a bit. Obviously, we expect a strong level of growth in the coming years solid level of growth, let's say.\n\nGross margin should continue to increase as well over the next coming years, as I said earlier. R&D, still early to say because -- I mean, it depends on what readout will be in the coming months. Directionally, G&A, you can expect that there will be flat-to-declining growth for the G&A part, but the sales and marketing part could increase a little bit because we have a fairly heavy program coming in. You were mentioning one important item, which is the profit sharing with Regeneron and the end of the reimbursement for R&D there, which is coming at the end of '26, beginning of '27.\n\nSo this will put a little bit of pressure probably in '27 on BOI. That being said, not in absolute value, I can tell you anyway. Our BOI will increase in absolute value each and every single year, but there is a possibility that it could be a little bit under pressure as a percentage of sales in '27 from what we can see today. It's still early.\n\nLet's not forget that we have other items that are coming in like the Ambrutra royalties, which is going to grow significantly in the future as well. So, I think that's directionally that's what I can tell you without once again, I'm not providing you guidance for the medium term in terms of UI.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. And I think you mentioned what you mentioned, -- That's what I just mentioned. So I think that is an important point to consider. Houman, all TNFR-1?\n\nHouman Ashrafian -- Global Head of Research and Development\n\nYes. Thanks for the question. Firstly, we had pleasing results last year. The data are on track as we always committed to releasing that in the first half of this year and that's exciting.\n\nJust to dimensionalize that for you. Yes, of course, there's a logic for it to be used in combination treatment strategy, particularly in the modern era where we have seen the combination, cytokine blockade can both increase the efficacy ceiling or surpass the efficacy ceiling and also provide durability. But I just want to be clear that, as well as combination therapies, remember Sanofi is now becoming a premier immunology powerhouse, and we have network effects internally where we can combine our molecules to generate greater value for patients. Just to be clear, in Clark's psoriasis, not only is there optionality for combination therapy, but depending on the results, we'll certainly consider using it as monotherapy, as a pre-biologic small molecule TNFR-1 signaling inhibitor.\n\nI should remind everybody, however, that rheumatoid arthritis will read out later in the year, and that's an even more classically TNF-mediated disorder. We're excited to see that in monotherapy and combination therapy, and there are further indications supporting our broad life cycle management strategy in immunology.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Let me just add on. The RA data will be important in -- given the TNF driver. When I think the question was also what are you hoping to see? If safety is right, the combination opportunity is significant, and then we'll see our mono as well.\n\nbut we look forward to that. OK. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Shirley Chen from Barclays.\n\nUnknown speaker -- -- Analyst\n\nShirley Chen here on behalf of Emily Field. Just moving back to Beyfortus by chance. So when we're ordering and contracting for Beyfortus for the next ISV season happen, we're just trying to understand a bit more about how much of first-mover advantage we still have here for the next season. And how do you consider the pricing of Beyfortus year over year? So in 2024, we saw a slight price increase by 5% according to American pediatrics.\n\nSo would you keep this trend? Or would you consider the price slightly differently for next season due to the potential competition? Another question on broader vaccine business. So obviously, there's a lot of attention on nominee to action. So are you concerned about like vaccine hesitancy as impacting your broader vaccine business given how widely publicized this is, even if there are no changes in policy? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nGreat. Thomas?\n\nThomas Triomphe -- Executive Vice President, Sanofi Pasteur\n\nTwo great questions. Thank you very much, Shirley. First of all, on Beyfortus, maybe a couple of points on your questions on the ordering patterns and RSV. First of all, from an ordering pattern perspective, I think it's very important to be clear that RSV is not flu, so the product is not changing every year.\n\nIt's not a seasonal product because of that. Even though immunizations are much more focused on some part of the year, it's the same product all year long. You don't have the same fee book effect that you have, for example, in influenza. I think that's an important differentiator to have in mind.\n\nHaving said that, most specifically for 2025, I think the last thing your question was about the fact that is there a first-mover advantage? I would say yes, just because of the product profile. Again, if you look at our product profile, we have an unprecedented body of reward evidence, showing massive reduction of hospitalization for newborns in countries that have used Beyfortus. By the way, not the same drop in hospitalization in countries that have decided to go other ways than with Beyfortus. I think that's an important factor to look at.\n\nNow there will be, maybe specifically for 2025, a little bit of a first-mover advantage, just because if you look at the U.S. market, physicians, practitioners have used Beyfortus this year are comfortable with it, have really appreciated not only the efficacy, but the safety profile. And now that we have full supply, we are able to deliver whenever they want it in 2025. So we're really moving forward with this.\n\nOn the price point of Beyfortus in 2025, we are seeing the situation as no erosion of price point in 2025. We will hold there. On the second part -- second question, sorry, that you had on vaccine hesitancy, I don't think we are in the position to make a lot of conjecture about the future. But a couple of points, I think, that are important and valid to your questions.\n\nFirst of all, is vaccine hesitancy a concern? Yes. Vaccine hesitancy is a concern for any vaccines head on this planet. But also on the fact that actually when there is vaccine hesitancy, there is less protection, and there is more disease. Interestingly, and that's what I want to close this point on, it's interesting to see that after three or four years of soft flu vaccine coverage rate, you see a comeback of influenza in the U.K., in France, a little bit in Japan and many other markets, where actually there is an increase in the severity of the number of hospitalization due to influenza this winter.\n\nI think it's a good wakeup call. And if vaccine intensity goes too much the wrong way, we will see more and more disease, so we need more vaccines. We are welcoming two delegates about those, about the safety and the dignity they provide, and products.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Next question?\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Next question from Eric Le Berrigaud from Stifel. Eric?\n\nEric Le Berrigaud -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nYes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Two questions.\n\nFirst on Sarclisa. Any chance to get a better understanding of what your ambition is with the drug? It's a two-player market where the other guy is having 95% market share. If you're successful in closing the gap, it could be an exceptional opportunity for you. But it was first about data, and now you have the data.\n\nIt was then about formulation. You will soon have formulation. So probably the remaining question is the willingness to invest and support on a commercial side, a relaunch, or a stronger launch based on those data. So where are you? What's the market intelligence telling you? Is it too late? Is it becoming too much your market? Are you not having too much time, given patented Blackstone royalties? Anything to help us understand whether it can be a blockbuster for sure but a multi-blockbuster maybe.\n\nAnd the second question, a very short one, given the current dynamics with Altuviiio, is that one your next blockbuster and no later than this year? Thank you.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'll take the second part. It'll be a blockbuster this year, Altuviiio. Brian, Sarclisa, ambition.\n\nBrian Foard -- Global Business Unit Head, Specialty Care\n\nYes. Thank you so much for the question. I think you framed it really nicely. If you look at that CD-38 marketplace, again, this is a marketplace where they've the physicians like the CD-38 target for multiple myeloma.\n\nWe estimate that that marketplace could be somewhere in the range of 16 billion ueros by the 2030 timeframe. Now, as Houman said, we've had a real strong drumbeat of new information coming out. Of course, really favorable data. I think putting us in the first-line therapy but also the recent data that we've had for the on-body device.\n\nAnd I think that's not to be underestimated. The subcu formulation offers a significant advantage in terms of patient and nurse experience. Utilizing an on-body delivery device, we believe this could ease the use and reduce some of the treatment burden, along with the strong efficacy and safety that we provided. So we absolutely do not think it's too late.\n\nWe absolutely believe we have all of the elements we need now to compete in the marketplace. We are investing behind this asset as we said before, and we believe it's going to be a multi blockbuster.\n\nPaul Hudson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Maybe I'll just add to just, Altuviiio, blockbuster this year. Sarclisa is a potential blockbuster next year in -- with the on-body device opportunity for nurse to manage multiple patients simultaneously is still -- from an oncology office perspective, still a major advantage because we do have great data. We do have great data.\n\nWe do have incredible medicine. These things matter in a head-to-head race. Last question, I think.\n\nOperator\n\nLast question from Ricardo Benevides from Santander.\n\nUnknown speaker -- -- Analyst\n\nRicardo, Francois speaking. Just a couple of questions. First of all, it's difficult for us to comment on something that is not real today. Very, very difficult to comment.\n\nJust be aware of the fact that, we have a significant industrial base in the U.S., which about 25% of what we market from what is coming from the U.S. So, we are a little bit under index versus our commercial presence there. But once again, very difficult to comment on something that is still at the plan for discussion. That's it.\n\nFrancois Roger -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nRicardo, Francois speaking.

Thank you to everybody for the comments. We've got a busy year, I think, ahead of us.\n\nWe made significant progress in 2024. We upgraded our EPS guidance twice and exceeded it. We continue to advance to becoming a focused science-driven biopharma company. And as we enter 2025, we provided you guidance today, including mid-to-high single-digits sales growth expectation and a strong rebound in earnings, as well as a solid outlook for our pipeline.\n\nSo thank you for your interest in Sanofi.

Dupixent sales missed our model estimate of \u20ac3.58 billion.\n\nSales of the drug in the United States rose 10.4%, driven by strong demand in its approved indications \u2014 atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. However, fewer business days in the fourth quarter and a year-end gross-to-net adjustment hurt sales slightly.\n\nDupixent sales rose 30.4% in Europe and 38.1% in the Rest of the World, driven mainly by sales in Japan. Dupixent was approved for its sixth indication \u2014 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u2014 in Europe in July and in the United States in September 2024.

The analysis found that financing is not sufficiently reaching countries most impacted by climate change, as less than 35 per cent of finance from bilateral donors is channelled directly to countries, and less than 50 per cent of overall funding analysed flowed to low-income countries.\n\nThe analysis defines climate and health finance as international concessional financing for projects in and out of the health sector that address the direct health impacts of climate change, support the health sector to adapt to and mitigate climate change, and/or generate health co-benefits from climate action.\n\nWith increased political support for climate and health through the Group of 20, Conference of the Parties, and World Health Assembly, donors have increased contributions towards projects at the intersection of climate and health. In 2022, this financing included: US$4.8 billion in commitments from bilateral donors; US$1.5 billion in commitments from two health multilateral funds; US$0.6 billion in commitments from four multilateral development banks; US$130 million in commitments from philanthropies; and US$23 million in commitments from multiple climate multilateral funds.\n\nThe report also found that bilateral donors are increasingly making health investments that include climate considerations. The share of climate finance directed to the health sector increased from one per cent in 2018 to nine per cent in 2022. However, 24 per cent of the available funding in 2022 was provided as loans rather than grants. Additionally, more than 90 per cent of Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s total funding for climate and health financing was provided as loans.\n\nNassar Al Mubarak, CEO, Reaching the Last Mile, said: \u201cWell-financed climate action is an opportunity to transform countries and economies and achieve health and wellbeing for all. As the report demonstrates, now is the time to invest in more ambitious, coordinated and accessible funding, delivered where it is needed most.\u201d\n\nDr Naveen Rao, Senior Vice President, Health, The Rockefeller Foundation, said: \u201cWhile the increase in financing for climate and health projects is a promising step in the right direction, the overall amount of funding still falls far short of what is needed to protect lives and livelihoods from the devastating impacts of climate change. Donors from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors must increase their commitments to climate and health, while also making sure that funding reaches the communities that need it most.\u201d\n\nVanina Laurent-Ledru, Director General, Foundation S, said: \u201cCountries on the frontlines of climate change urgently need more accessible financing to protect their population\u2019s health. Business as usual is no longer an option; public, private, and philanthropic collaborations can help to fast-track flexible finance directly to local communities so they can urgently build climate-resilient health systems.\u201d\n\nThere are several limitations to the analysis that reflect the challenges in transparency and clarity countries face in accessing financing. Donor data on climate and health commitments are self-reported and use different definitions of climate and health. The lack of standardised data on finance flows from disparate funders and sectors also limit the comparison across finance categories. While recognising these limitations, the report presents its data as an initial overview of the funding landscape, providing a baseline understanding to strengthen financing for climate and health.\n\nThe report calls on donors, civil society, academia, and policymakers to support countries in accessing needed financing through the following actions: increase funding available for climate and health; align investment priorities and frameworks to maximise impact; accelerate delivery and improve access to funding; channel funding to country priorities; and standardise definitions and increase transparency.",

            "content": "Sanofi's Strategic Share Buyback Amid Robust Q4 Performance\n\nFrench pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has announced its fourth-quarter profit, which aligned with analysts' expectations, with further details available here. The company also revealed plans to repurchase shares worth 5 billion euros (approximately $5.21 billion) this year, bolstering investor confidence in its robust drug pipeline.\n\nSanofi, renowned as one of the world's leading vaccine producers and a key player in anti-inflammatory medications, anticipates a mid-to-high single-digit sales growth by 2025 as it transitions to a pure-play drugmaker. According to IndexBox data, Sanofi's strategic moves, including the sale of a 50% stake in its consumer health segment 'Opella' to Clayton Dubilier & Rice, aim to cement its pharmaceutical focus, with the deal expected to complete in the second quarter.\n\nDespite a 7.7% decrease in quarterly business operating income to 2.08 billion euros, these results were in line with the company-provided analyst consensus. The flagship asthma medication Dupixent showed robust results with sales surging by 16% to 3.46 billion euros, though slightly under the analyst forecast of 3.61 billion euros, a discrepancy attributed to fewer business days during the quarter.\n\nInvestor anticipation around Dupixent remains high after the drug gained regulatory approval for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease last September. Sanofi's Beyfortus, a pioneering drug aimed at shielding newborns from common respiratory viruses, exceeded expectations with its sales more than doubling to 841 million euros, significantly surpassing the projected 648 million euros.\n\nContinuing its strong performance, Sanofi's vaccines division posted an impressive 10.8% currency-adjusted sales increase, reaching 2.18 billion euros, compared to the 1.91 billion euro consensus, further underscoring the company's healthy growth trajectory.\n\nSource: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform",

            "content": "After returning from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference last week, I was pleased to hear that some of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s most respected leaders were tackling the topic of vaccines head-on.\n\nGSK CEO Emma Walmsley publicly urged the industry to \u201crun towards\u201d conversations about vaccine efficacy, emphasizing transparency, trust, and open dialogue. Her call to action aligns with other industry leaders\u2019 perspectives on building public vaccine confidence.\n\nModerna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel advocated for data-driven decisions and collaboration with the new administration. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla highlighted the risks and opportunities of radical change, emphasizing vaccines as vital healthcare interventions. Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson noted things may be temporarily chaotic with a new administration, and that there may be a call for even more transparency. I concur with all of the above.\n\nErosion of trust\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn\u2019t new, but the scale of resistance we\u2019re witnessing today is unprecedented. A 2021 study published in The Lancet found that vaccine confidence varies widely across countries, with trust particularly fragile in regions where misinformation and distrust of institutions are pervasive. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed this to us. Despite the remarkable speed and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the general public was leery about safety, concerns over government mandates, and a relentless tide of disinformation on social media.\n\nThe reasons for vaccine hesitancy are complex, encompassing fear of side effects, philosophical beliefs, and historical abuses of medical trust, particularly in marginalized communities. For instance, the legacy of unethical experiments like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study has understandably left some communities wary of public health initiatives. Addressing these concerns requires more than repeating the mantra \u201cvaccines are safe and effective.\u201d It demands a concerted effort to listen, engage, and build trust through transparency.\n\nTransparency is a necessity. People are more likely to trust vaccine recommendations when they feel fully informed about the science, the risks, and the benefits. This means sharing success stories and openly acknowledging uncertainties and potential side effects.\n\nPillar of trust\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, concerns about rare but serious side effects, such as blood clots linked to certain vaccines, were sometimes met with confusing or delayed communication. While these risks were statistically small, the lack of clear and immediate messaging allowed fear to flourish.\n\nTransparency must also extend to how vaccines are developed and approved. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines led some to question whether corners had been cut. While the speed was a testament to decades of prior research and unprecedented global collaboration, this nuance was lost instead of applauded.\n\nExplaining the rigorous testing, oversight, and monitoring processes in plain language can go a long way toward dispelling fears and fostering trust.\n\nTransparency alone isn\u2019t enough; we must proactively combat misinformation. Social media platforms play an outsized role in spreading vaccine myths, from false claims about infertility to baseless conspiracy theories about microchips. These narratives thrive in the absence of accessible, accurate information.\n\nSocial media campaigns, engaging visuals, and collaborations with trusted community leaders can help counter falsehoods with facts. Importantly, these efforts focus on empathy and understanding, acknowledging the emotions and fears that drive vaccine hesitancy while providing clear, evidence-based answers.\n\nEngaging communities\n\nOne of the most effective ways to build vaccine trust is through grassroots engagement. Community leaders, religious figures, and local healthcare providers often have a level of confidence that national or global institutions cannot match. By partnering with these trusted voices, public health campaigns can deliver messages that resonate on a personal level.\n\nPrograms that address specific community concerns have shown remarkable success. For example, in historically low vaccination rates, outreach initiatives that included community discussions, mobile clinics, and bilingual materials significantly increased vaccine uptake. These efforts demonstrate that trust is built not through top-down mandates but through relationships and respect.\n\nBuilding vaccine trust is not solely the responsibility of governments or health agencies. Biotech and pharma companies must also play their part by being open about pricing, manufacturing, and safety data. Too often, perceptions of corporate greed undermine confidence in vaccines. Demonstrating a commitment to public health over profit can help counteract this narrative.\n\nSimilarly, individuals have a role to play. Sharing accurate information, engaging in respectful dialogue, and correcting misconceptions within our circles can create ripple effects that strengthen community trust.\n\nThe path forward\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Vaccine hesitancy not only endangers individual lives but also undermines herd immunity, putting entire communities at risk. As we face ongoing and future health crises, from seasonal influenza to emerging pandemics, rebuilding trust in vaccines is a moral and practical imperative.\n\nThis effort starts with transparency. As we begin this year with a new president and administration, I call on all our elected officials to help close the trust gap by openly addressing concerns, acknowledging uncertainties, and committing to honest communication.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a new era of public health\u2014one where vaccines are not just seen as a scientific triumph but as a shared commitment to the well-being of all.\n\nDavid Dodd is president, CEO, and chairman of GeoVax, a clinical-stage biotech company developing vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious diseases and cancers using proprietary platforms.",

The financing was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and Sanofi Ventures, with participation from other new investors RiverVest Venture Partners, funds managed by abrdn Inc, Novartis Venture Fund, Pictet Alternative Advisors, Mirae Asset Financial Group, and GHR Foundation alongside existing investor F-Prime Capital.\n\n\u201cThis financing validates the truly transformative potential of Atalanta\u2019s best-in-class di-siRNA platform for delivering oligonucleotide therapies to the central nervous system and the exciting promise of our expansive wholly-owned pipeline,\u201d said Alicia Secor, Atalanta\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \u201cImportantly, this Series B will support a path to the clinic for two programs for serious neurological diseases that today lack disease-modifying therapies \u2014 KCNT1-related epilepsy and Huntington\u2019s disease \u2014 and will anchor our growing franchise of investigational medicines for Huntington\u2019s disease. We are diligently progressing these programs toward IND submissions this year so that we can start our Phase 1 trials and reach patients who are waiting.\u201d\n\nIn conjunction with this financing, the company announced the appointments of Arno de Wilde, M.D., Ph.D., MBA, managing director at EQT Life Sciences; Jason Hafler, Ph.D., managing director of Sanofi Ventures; and Niall O\u2019Donnell, Ph.D., managing director of RiverVest Venture Partners to its Board of Directors.\n\n\u201cAtalanta\u2019s di-siRNA technology has shown promising ability to durably silence disease-promoting genes throughout previously inaccessible regions of the brain and spinal cord \u2014 opening a wide range of treatment possibilities for devastating neurological diseases,\u201d said Dr. de Wilde. \u201cEQT Life Sciences is proud to co-lead this investment in Atalanta\u2019s future as part of such a high-quality investor syndicate, and we look forward to partnering with Atalanta\u2019s leadership to support their continued success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Atalanta as they enter their next chapter as a clinical-stage company,\u201d said Dr. Hafler. \u201cTheir success to-date is a strong validation of their ability to create meaningful new RNAi therapies, and Sanofi Ventures is glad to support Atalanta as they advance their pipeline.\u201d\n\nATL-201 is Atalanta\u2019s investigational therapy for KCNT1-related epilepsy, an early-onset seizure disorder and encephalopathy driven by gain-of-function variants in the KCNT1 gene. Infants and children with KCNT1-related epilepsy have severe, frequent seizures that are unable to be controlled with anti-seizure medications, and they often experience developmental delays and intellectual disability. ATL-201 is designed to reduce KCNT1 levels and to normalize neuronal excitability. Preclinical studies have shown that ATL-201 produces a significant reduction of seizures and improvement in behavior with impressive durability and tolerability.\n\nThe company\u2019s second development candidate, ATL-101, is a di-siRNA designed to silence the HTT gene for the treatment of Huntington\u2019s disease. Huntington\u2019s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of the HTT gene, which leads to deterioration in a person\u2019s physical, cognitive, and psychiatric abilities. Preclinical studies have shown that a single dose of ATL-101 produces a potent and strong reduction in HTT expression, including in deep brain regions, with six months of durability and excellent tolerability.\n\nA full overview of the company\u2019s pipeline, disclosed today, is available here.\n\nAbout Atalanta Therapeutics\n\nAtalanta Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing treatments for intractable diseases of the central nervous system using RNA interference. Atalanta\u2019s unique platform of divalent small interfering RNA (di-siRNA) enables durable, selective gene silencing throughout the brain and spinal cord. Atalanta is advancing a wholly owned pipeline of disease-modifying programs for Huntington\u2019s disease, genetic epilepsy, severe chronic pain, and other neurological diseases in addition to partnered programs as part of a strategic collaboration with Genentech.

            "content": "In February 2023, Novavax warned investors that it might not be able to continue operations for another year. It\u2019s now two years later and the company is still rolling on\u2014although CEO John Jacobs admits it\u2019s been a bit like pushing a boulder up a hill.\n\n\u201cIt took the last two years to reset the company, to reset us for a better future,\u201d Jacobs told BioSpace on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. \u201cWe had to unwind a lot of what was good intention put in place to try to hit the pandemic just so. And the silver lining that came out of that was proving out the technology [and] actually having a marketed product now.\u201d\n\nJacobs took the helm just the month before the company\u2019s dire prediction in early 2023. Checking off the news items that have occurred since his tenure began shows a painful evolution of the vaccine company: layoffs, pipeline reorganizations, FDA delays and clinical holds.\n\nBut through all of that, Novavax has built up a 4 million\u2013strong patient safety database and launched its COVID-19 vaccine around the world. A massive partnership with Sanofi last year paved the way for that product\u2019s future in the face of a \u201cDavid vs. Goliath\u201d battle against Pfizer and a fluctuating vaccine market.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re at this new pivot point,\u201d Jacobs said. The market has shifted from government contracts with huge orders to a private market. Demand dropped way off and even the front runners, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have struggled to adapt.\n\n\u201cOur strategy was to let someone else do that and to get paid for that,\u201d Jacobs said of the Sanofi deal.\n\nThe market in the U.S. now sits at about 40 million shots annually across all the available options, with Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty taking the largest share, according to Jacobs. Sanofi is the perfect company to try and break through with Novavax\u2019s shot, which offers an alternative to mRNA technology, because the French pharma has marketed a flu shot for years and is more familiar with the seasonal demands of the vaccine market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the experts with the scale and scope take that on as a challenge this coming fall,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to see what Sanofi can do.\u201d\n\nExperts have been skeptical of the Sanofi deal, with one Seeking Alpha analyst recently warning that it was negotiated \u201cfrom a position of relative weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe partnership with Sanofi offers significant benefits but does not assure [Novavax] of ongoing success,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nAnother warned in November 2024 that \u201cit still seems early to bet on a turnaround for Novavax.\u201d\n\n\u2018Low Cost Bets\u2019\n\nThe Sanofi deal does more than just provide the powerful backing of a big pharmaceutical company to oversee the commercialization of its COVID-19 vaccine, however. It also gives Novavax the breathing room to focus on its pipeline, Jacobs said. Novavax brought in a new R&D chief, Ruxandra Draghia-Akli , in November 2024.\n\nNovavax is not about to drop a bunch of cash on R&D, Jacobs said, as the company has carefully scaled back its operating expenses over the past two years by about $1 billion, with plans to go even further by 2026. So the pipeline will be based on what he calls \u201clow cost bets,\u201d with a lean organization that can create more vaccines through partnering.\n\nOne area of development will be combination vaccines. Specifically, Novavax is using the COVID-19 shot to provide additional value in combination with others, such as Sanofi\u2019s Fluzone. An earlier RSV program will also now take the combination approach after Pfizer, GSK and Moderna entered the market. In addition, Novavax announced four new preclinical programs in infectious disease at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference earlier this month. These include vaccines for shingles, C. diff and vesicular stomatitis virus.\n\nDraghia-Akli has been getting up to speed as fast as possible. The company has collected a ton of data on many pathogens over the past couple years. She said the most important thing as Novavax defines this next period is ensuring there is a business case for the programs they move forward with.\n\n\u201cObviously, we can have good data in diseases [where] nobody can pronounce the name, but we need to be really, really focused and not go on a fishing expedition, but really go very targeted to diseases or combinations where we think that we can make a difference,\u201d the R&D chief told BioSpace.\n\nThe backbone of all these programs is the Matrix-M technology, an adjuvant that Jacobs says could make existing vaccines less expensive and more effective. Novavax is seeking additional partnerships for this technology, and has already signed deals with the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India to develop a malaria vaccine. That vaccine is now being administered to people in Africa and parts of Asia that need it at a very low cost.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bring us a lot of profitability or revenue,\u201d Jacobs admitted, but he estimates the vaccine could be saving the lives of 600 million children annually. \u201cThat\u2019s worthy of doing, and it\u2019s a proof point for our technology.\u201d\n\nBuilding Trust\n\nNovavax\u2019s share price has declined from a pandemic high of around $20 to around $9.50 today. The company\u2019s shares are also heavily shorted, meaning some investors are betting on the continued decline. When the Sanofi deal was announced and the share skyrocketed, Bloomberg reported that one short investor, S3 Partners, lost $255 million.\n\nThe share price declined sharply in October 2024 when the FDA placed a clinical hold on the investigational combo COVID-19/influenza and standalone influenza vaccines after a report of a serious adverse event in a trial participant. The stoppage was brief, as an investigation showed in November that the participant had unfortunately been diagnosed with amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nDraghia-Akli said that the clinical program was completely stopped when the adverse event was discovered. \u201cWe intend to always do the right thing regardless of share price impact,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThat was the right thing to do until we knew what that was\u2014we acted immediately and sooner than was required, actually.\u201d\n\nNovavax has learned from its experience in the COVID-19 pandemic that transparency is everything.\n\n\u201cWe have empathy for anyone who has fear over vaccines, who may have had mixed messages unintentionally during a pandemic. This was a first in a lifetime for all of us, including our government and governments around the world,\u201d Jacobs said. As the science evolved, so did the messaging and communications around vaccines. It was 100% correct to update, but Jacobs admits that there were some things that could have been done better by all stakeholders involved.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, one of the casualties of the pandemic was trust, and that takes time to earn back, and we\u2019re going to be patient with that. We\u2019re going to be empathetic with consumers who rightfully are asking questions about their health.\u201d\n\nJacobs said that Novavax hopes to continue to contribute to the conversation around vaccines going forward in a new paradigm that may include Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services: \u201cI\u2019m glad people are asking questions and paying attention, and I think the silver lining to this is, because people have awoken to vaccines more as an option, more recently, there\u2019s an opportunity then . . . for education.\u201d\n\n",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Anticoagulants Market Global Forecast Report by Drug Class, Route of Administration, Distribution Channel, Application, Countries and Company Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe size of the anticoagulants market is projected to expand from US$ 41.31 billion in 2024 to U$ 89.50 billion by 2033, while growing at a CAGR of 8.97% from 2025-2033. A few of the key factors that are driving the growth of this market are sedentary lifestyles increasing, improvements in healthcare system, and a growing prevalence of thrombotic diseases.\n\n\n\nThere are anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin, and new oral medications like rivaroxaban and apixaban. These have been widely applied in patients with atrial fibrillation, a clinical condition that predisposes a patient to stroke. Other commonly applied areas include hip or knee replacements. They are very useful also in the management of patients with pulmonary embolism, DVT, and other thrombotic disorders. Even though effective, anticoagulants tend to bleed if the management is inadequate. Regular blood tests along with the dosages may need to be adjusted to ensure their safe usage.\n\n\n\nGrowth Drivers of the Anticoagulants Market\n\nIncreasing Prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases\n\n\n\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death across the globe. Every year, approximately 17.9 million people die from this disease. The key driver for the anticoagulant market is the growing trend of cardiovascular diseases, which include heart attacks, strokes, and atrial fibrillation. These diseases are usually characterized by inappropriate blood clotting; therefore, anticoagulants are crucial in maintaining and preventing further complications.\n\nThe rising population age and unhealthful lifestyle habits, such as a poor diet and lack of physical activity, also contribute to these issues. The number of patients under anticoagulation therapy is on the rise, and thereby, the demand for anticoagulants also increases. In 2022, 702,880 people died from heart disease, and such deaths accounted for 1 in every 5 deaths.\n\n\n\nInnovation in Anticoagulant Drugs\n\n\n\nNewer drugs have been developed due to technology, which proved more potent than the drugs previously discovered. Unlike traditional anticoagulants like warfarin, newer oral formulations like rivaroxaban and apixaban have the benefits of fewer dietary restrictions, lower monitoring, and fewer complications caused by bleeding. These innovations facilitate improved patient compliance and outcomes, increasing the adoption of anticoagulants in hospital and outpatient settings.\n\nThe ongoing development of newer, more targeted, and user-friendly forms of anticoagulant treatments supports the overall growth of the market by offering more variety in the management of thrombotic disorders. Three new coagulation tests for Factor Xa inhibitors launched by Roche in February 2024 are part of its contribution to enhancing clinical decisions in prescribing direct oral anticoagulants to avert stroke.\n\n\n\nBetter Health Care Facilities and Enlightenment\n\n\n\nImproved health facilities worldwide open up treatment for those suffering from chronic conditions, such as people requiring anticoagulation. Increasing awareness regarding thrombotic diseases, and better diagnostics and treatment options, are encouraging more patients to undergo preventive and therapeutic anticoagulant care.\n\nFurther, efforts by the healthcare department to educate patients pertaining to the risk of blood clots and the early intervention for the same also contribute towards rising demand for the anticoagulants. Improved access to healthcare in developing markets is also expanding the anticoagulants market worldwide.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Attribute Details No. of Pages 120 Forecast Period 2024 - 2033 Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024 $41.31 Billion Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 $89.5 Billion Compound Annual Growth Rate 8.9% Regions Covered Global\n\nCompany Analysis: Overviews, Key Personnel, Recent Developments & Strategies, Product Portfolio, Financial Insights\n\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals Inc\n\nAspen Holdings\n\nBayer AG\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nDaiichi Sankyo Company Limited\n\nDr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd\n\nGlaxoSmithKline plc\n\nJohnson & Johnson Private Limited\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\nSanofi\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1.

The lawsuit was first filed in 2018 by former Attorney General Lori Swanson, and Ellison took it over when he took office in 2019. Ellison settled with Eli Lilly nearly a year ago and Sanofi in July.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the State Capitol on Monday morning, Ellison said the final settlement is \u201ca big win that was a long time coming\u201d because price increases are unjustified. He added his office\u2019s goal is to make sure insulin prices do not increase after these five years.\n\nDuring the press conference, Ellison said diabetic patients were paying about $6,000 a year on average for insulin prior to the settlements. The cost is now dropping to about $600 annually.\n\nAll three companies have agreed to offer low-cost alternatives for patients and alert them of these options at pharmacies around the state, according to a news release issued by Ellison\u2019s office on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cWith this final insulin settlement, we have guaranteed that Minnesotans can not only obtain and afford their insulin, but they can choose between manufacturers and insulin products to ensure they get what they need,\u201d Ellison said in the release. \u201cWhile our insulin lawsuits have been resolved, the work my office to make life more affordable for folks across our state remains ongoing.\u201d\n\nAdvocates stood next to Ellison as he made the announcement on Monday. One of those advocates was Nicole Smith-Holt, the mother of 26-year-old Alec Smith who died rationing his insulin because he could not afford his monthly dose. The Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act, passed by Gov. Tim Walz in 2020, is named after him. The law allows diabetics who are struggling to afford their insulin to get a month supply once a year with a $35 co-pay.\n\nSmith-Holt praised Ellison and his office\u2019s fight against big-name pharmaceutical companies, saying too many people have died from not having insulin, and that Minnesota is leading the way to change.\n\nAccording to Quinn Nystrom, a local advocate within the diabetes community, said Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk make up 95% of insulin manufacturers. She added having all three of these companies settle means Minnesotans are no longer going to be turned away from the lifesaving medication.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies have dictated the cost of my life,\u201d Nystrom said. \u201cInsulin isn\u2019t an optional medication; it\u2019s our life support.\u201d",

The pharmaceutical companies argued that consolidation for pretrial matters signaled an intent for a joint trial, which would invoke federal jurisdiction under CAFA\u2019s mass action provisions.\n\nHowever, the Second Circuit majority concluded that the cases were consolidated only for pretrial proceedings, not for trial, which justified keeping them in state court.\n\nArguments for Federal Jurisdiction\n\nIn their petition, the pharmaceutical companies criticized the Second Circuit for creating what they described as a subjective, unpredictable test requiring courts to analyze plaintiffs\u2019 intent rather than applying a clear rule.",

Treatment options vary depending on the size, location, and symptoms of the fibroids. One emerging drug for fibroid management is Ulipristal acetate, which works by modifying hormonal balance, specifically by blocking progesterone receptors, thus shrinking the fibroids and alleviating symptoms. However, its use is limited due to concerns about liver toxicity, and it's only prescribed in certain cases. Other drugs like GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide) temporarily shrink fibroids by reducing estrogen levels, while tranexamic acid and NSAIDs help manage bleeding and pain. Surgical options, like hysterectomy or myomectomy, are also available for more severe cases.Here, we've just put out a new study report on the Uterine Fibroids Drug Market Demand 2024-2032 that gives a thorough and organised look at the size of the market.

            "content": "Paris: Following the adoption of a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the EU has approved Sarclisa in combination with a standard-of-care regimen, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), based on data from the IMROZ phase 3 study. With the expanded marketing authorization, Sarclisa is an anti-CD38 therapy in combination with VRd in this patient population in the EU.\n\nOlivier Nataf, Global Head of Oncology at Sanofi said, \"While there have been many important advancements in multiple myeloma treatment over the past decade, there remains a significant unmet need in the front-line setting, particularly for transplant-ineligible patients. With today\u2019s decision the 27 countries in the EU will have access to a potentially transformative new combination regimen, marking a significant step forward in our mission to make a meaningful difference in multiple myeloma treatment.\u201d\n\nIn September 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sarclisa in combination with VRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM who are not eligible for ASCT, representing the first global approval for Sarclisa in the front-line setting. In addition, the FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity for Sarclisa in the approved indication. Beyond the US and the EU, regulatory submissions for Sarclisa in NDMM not eligible for ASCT are under review in Japan and in China.\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including the US and in the EU, across three indications. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MM (R/R MM) who have received \u22652 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1\u20133 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US and EU, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM, who are not eligible for ASCT, based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\n\"Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery,\" the Company stated.\n\nRead also: Sanofi Sarclisa gains Chinese nod for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma",

Arlene Foster, Michelle O\u2019Neill, Jeremy Farrar, Robin Swann, Humza Yousef, Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson, Mark Drakeford, Social Media companies YouTube, Google, TikTok, META & Twitter.\n\nBy deliberately narrowing the scope of an inquiry they\u2019ve removed the publics understanding of why they were so heavily censored, yes it was partly about removing vaccine hesitancy but blocking the sharing of very real harms seen and felt by so many proved horrendous for so many more to come over the following year from AstraZeneca and not only it\u2019s changed name to Vaxzevria but from the harms posed by all the vaccines.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the very real harms suffered by the public which so many have refused on many occasions to even engage let alone acknowledge existing from Hancock to Whitty, they all played down risks in Covid so they\u2019d be seen as rare to remove vaccine hesitancy.\n\nMany of those appearing even openly admitted their part in calling for or backing censorship campaigns to \u201cprotect the public\u201d from misinformation and disinformation that was \u201crisking lives\u201d, the goal being to \u201cprotect granny\u201d afterall.\n\nAnd what of us now, it\u2019s such a cruel hellscape we\u2019ve found ourselves thrust into with once strong fit bodies and perfectly functioning minds now so horribly broken and no one in \u201chealthcare\u201d offering us the help we desperately need even 4 years on from the toxic vaccine campaign waged by AstraZeneca and indemnified from prosecution by the government, \u201cthey won\u2019t make any money from providing it\u201d stated Hancock \u201cso it\u2019s only right we do this.\u201d\n\nThis Inquiry hasn\u2019t been designed with fairness in mind to those cruelly affected whether vaccine injured & bereaved, those loved ones murdered by lethal protocols or other harms inflicted by lockdown kerbs.\n\nBlame is clear from far away but indemnity clauses are in place with guided questions designed to restrict the needed answers further, but in the question will our solicitors get us justice finally after it\u2019s concluded is another matter and you have to have hope that they\u2019ve still beyond every obstacle thrown at this that they will. \u202a\n\nThe deceitful actions of a trusted government put the safety of millions in the U.K. in the completely immoral and un-impartial hands of a medicines regulator. \u202c\n\n\u202aSwearing allegiance to a company paying funding of around 80% should\u2019ve been the biggest safety signal ever yet it proved how blind they all were to signs of major harms being committed by their assured products. \u202c\n\nLies seem to be part of their remit in the Inquiry, we know that indemnification from prosecution has been offered to all who require it it now appears after Matt Hancock openly referred to it at the end of module 3, with guided questions also they\u2019re protecting everyone concerned from seeming to act without impartiality.\n\nImagine the depths of evil to firstly construct the plan Howard but then to build such an army of minions willing or otherwise to push such an Orwellian agenda, it\u2019s from the stuff of nightmares but the powers that have brought us to this point but still without a clear way of getting justice were certainly in it for the long haul with many paths to protect them\n\nBearing in mind the first record death from the covid vaccines was Jan 26th 2021 it\u2019s a timely reminder that this is exactly the sort of horror that the Covid inquiry was meant to finally look into but why narrow the margins of investigation to further protect those already with indemnity from prosecution instead of highlighting the British publics already valid causes for concern?\n\nIt\u2019s been a complete failure by \u201chealthcare\u201d to ensure the safety of its public and act on concerns to offer the help they need afterwards, we need a government prepared to take the tough steps needed to restore trust if we are ever to believe them again.",

            "content": "ABL Bio, a Korean biotech firm, is reportedly close to finalizing a landmark technology licensing agreement with a global pharmaceutical company. The deal, said to be worth over 1 trillion won ($696 million), centers on the company\u2019s Grabody-B platform\u2014a technology that promises to break barriers in neurological disease treatment.\n\nAt a corporate briefing on Thursday, CEO Lee Sang-hoon hinted that the agreement \u201cmight even eclipse the company\u2019s 2022 deal with Sanofi,\u201d valued at 1.47 trillion won. That earlier agreement, which involved ABL301, a Parkinson\u2019s disease treatment, included 100 billion won in upfront payments.\n\nThis time, the stakes are higher, with Lee noting that the upcoming deal is expected to include \u201csuperior upfront and milestone payments.\u201d\n\nABL Bio CEO Lee Sang-hoon addresses investors and media during a corporate briefing and press conference at the Conrad Seoul on Thursday.\n\nThe potential deal under negotiation involves Grabody-B, a platform designed to improve drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB has long posed challenges in treating neurological diseases by limiting the ability of many therapeutic molecules to reach the brain. Grabody-B employs receptor-mediated transcytosis, targeting the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) to deliver antibodies more effectively to the brain.\n\n\u201cThe global interest in BBB-shuttle technologies has surged,\u201d Lee said, pointing to successes like Roche and Genetech\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s drug trontinemab, which employs a similar approach. \u201cAt the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, pharmaceutical companies expressed confidence in Grabody-B\u2019s readiness. They said no further validation is necessary.\u201d\n\nInvestor frustration meets strategic ambition\n\nWhile the technology shows promise, investor sentiment remains cautious after years of delays and unmet expectations.\n\n\u201cWe hear the same thing every year,\u201d one shareholder said during the briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s always \u2018soon\u2019 and \u2018next year.\u2019 Last year, even after getting a term sheet, it fell apart. Another delay, another excuse. How do we know this time is different?\u201d\n\nIn mid-2024, Lee announced that ABL Bio had received a term sheet from one pharmaceutical company, a move initially viewed as a breakthrough. However, negotiations stalled, and Lee revealed during the briefing that the company had walked away from the agreement, instead pursuing a larger deal with one of the global firms it met at J.P. Morgan.\n\n\u201cEntering an exclusive deal with a smaller partner would have limited our ability to negotiate bigger deals with Big Pharma,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cWe\u2019re now in advanced discussions with multiple companies, focusing on finalizing contract terms. There\u2019s even potential for multiple deals if there\u2019s no overlap in interest.\u201d\n\nFor some shareholders, such explanations felt familiar\u2014and unconvincing. \u201cYou hype up term sheets and then abandon them after raising funds. It feels like a betrayal,\u201d one shareholder remarked.\n\nBuilding momentum around key programs\n\nLee defended the company\u2019s strategy, framing past setbacks as necessary steps in a high-stakes game. \u201cStrategic delays are frustrating, but they\u2019re necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just chasing any deal; we\u2019re chasing the right deal.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that the company is negotiating from a position of strength, with Grabody-B and its broader pipeline providing reasons for optimism. ABL301, the Parkinson\u2019s treatment licensed to Sanofi, has completed dose-escalation trials, and phase 1 topline data is expected by mid-2025. Meanwhile, phase 2/3 results for ABL001, a bispecific antibody treatment for bile duct cancer, are expected in March.\n\nIf successful, Lee said ABL001 could gain FDA approval as a second-line treatment for bile duct cancer by 2026, potentially generating royalties in the \u201chundreds of billions of won\u201d after 2027. Trials at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas are also underway to evaluate ABL001 as a first-line treatment, further broadening its market potential.\n\n\u201cIf the bile duct cancer trial succeeds, royalties could finally start flowing in,\u201d one investor acknowledged. \u201cBut until then, it\u2019s just more waiting.\u201d\n\nInvestors\u2019 frustrations were palpable during the Thursday morning shareholder meeting, where stock prices dipped as skepticism about Lee\u2019s ability to deliver resurfaced. One shareholder pointed out the cyclical nature of these meetings: \u201cStock prices drop after every IR session because trust has eroded.\u201d\n\nBut by Thursday afternoon, following additional updates at a press conference, ABL Bio\u2019s stock rebounded, closing 4.97 percent higher at 33,800 won on the Kosdaq market.\n\nBeyond Grabody-B, ABL Bio is advancing its U.S. expansion plans through its California-based subsidiary, ABL Bio USA, established in 2022. The unit is focused on developing bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and preparing for clinical trial applications later this year. By 2028 or 2029, the company aims to either take the subsidiary public on Nasdaq or position it for acquisition.\n\n\u201cWe envision ABL Bio USA as either a publicly traded entity or a highly attractive acquisition target,\u201d Lee said. To support these goals, the company plans to hire a new CEO, reportedly a former Genentech executive, by March, along with a chief medical officer by this summer.",

The study had previously been placed on a clinical hold by the agency.\n\nFor context, prescription Cialis was first approved in 2003 and is marketed by Eli Lilly\u2014in 2014, Lilly signed a licensing agreement with Sanofi that permits the latter to pursue regulatory approval of an OTC version in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the about-face? At the time the study was put on hold, the FDA cited problems with protocol design related to the company\u2019s planned actual use trial (AUT). AUTs are a key component of the FDA\u2019s process for converting drugs from prescription to OTC products and are meant to confirm that consumers can self-diagnose and treat themselves appropriately without the help of a healthcare provider.\n\nAfter a subsequent review of the study, the agency gave the green light to Opella, which can now initiate its AUT.\n\nWhy it matters: Cialis is the first PDE-5 inhibitor\u2014a class of drugs that includes the likes of Pfizer\u2019s Viagra\u2014to reach this study milestone.\n\nA shift to OTC status could have serious implications given the number of people impacted by the condition. ED affects about 30 million men in the US, according to the NIH.\n\nOur take: Consumers and direct-to-consumer (D2C) health and wellness retailers stand to benefit should Cialis make the shift from a prescription drug to an OTC product.\n\nConsumers will benefit in the form of increased access to the treatment. OTC status will bypass the need for consumers to see a physician for a Cialis prescription, which some men may have avoided due to feelings of embarrassment. This would likely be welcome news to consumers as they look to increasingly take self-ownership of their health.",

The contract period runs until the end of next year and may be extended upon mutual agreement. This agreement expands upon the distribution deal signed last year for five pediatric vaccines, including DTaP combination vaccines.\n\nApproved in April last year in Korea, Beyfortus is expected to bring significant changes to the RSV preventive medicine market by allowing all infants, not just high-risk groups, to receive protection during their first RSV infection season.\n\nBeyfortus is the only RSV preventive medicine available for all infants during their first RSV season. It offers a single-dose regimen with a minimum five-month protection period, covering the entire season. In 2023, it achieved \u20ac547 million (approximately KRW 821 billion) in global sales.\n\nAvaxim, a hepatitis A vaccine manufactured in accordance with WHO recommendations, is widely used worldwide due to its high safety and efficacy. It has demonstrated excellent effectiveness in preventing hepatitis A.\n\nEarlier in March last year, SK bioscience and Sanofi signed a distribution agreement for pediatric DTaP combination vaccines (Tetraxim, Pentaxim, and Hexaxim), the adolescent and adult Tdap combination vaccine Adacel Prefilled Syringe, and the meningococcal vaccine Menactra. Notably, the six-in-one combination vaccine Hexaxim was officially included in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) this year, further expanding its market presence.\n\nWith this expanded agreement, SK bioscience aims to solidify its position as a leading vaccine provider in the Korean market while strengthening its partnership with Sanofi. Leveraging the R&D, production, and sales collaboration framework established with Sanofi, SK bioscience is also accelerating its entry into the global market. The two companies have been conducting Phase 3 clinical trials for a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine since 2014.

Inadequately investigating product leakage was also noted during the audit.\n\nOther deviations mentioned in the letter include Sanofi\u2019s failure to demonstrate that the manufacturing process can reproduce an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with its predetermined quality attributes, and a failure in using appropriate equipment for the manufacture of specific drug substance:\n\n\u201cMobile carts used in the setup of [undisclosed] units required operators to get down to the floor and manually lock and unlock the cart brakes despite previously determining equipment proximity to the floor as a contributing root cause in microbiological contamination events.\u201d\n\nIn another example, the Agency wrote: \u201c[Undisclosed equipment] used to establish temporary sterile boundaries for tubing continue to be used despite being identified in a June 2023 microbial contamination event investigation as possessing a \u2018design flaw\u2019 that may allow microbial ingress.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also cited failures within the facility\u2019s quality unit. Sanofi responded last year by identifying four contributing root causes \u2013 \u201cexcessive personnel attrition of trained investigators, process knowledge gaps amongst newer investigators, prioritization of investigations associated with lots pending release, and inconsistent communication of \u2018deviation performance metrics\u2019\u201d \u2013 but was pulled up further by the Agency due to insufficient detail as to how these causes are to be corrected.\n\nThe FDA has requested Sanofi to respond to it with corrective action plans within 15 days.\n\nWhen contacted, a Sanofi spokesperson told us: \"Patient safety and the quality of our products are our highest priorities. We take all inspections extremely seriously and we are fully committed to working with the FDA to resolve all findings holistically, robustly and promptly to meet the agency\u2019s requirements and expectations.\"\n\nThey added there has been \"no interruption to manufacturing or to the continued supply of medicines from the Framingham site as a result of these findings.\"\n\nFramingham\n\nThe Framingham site, commissioned by Sanofi acquisition Genzyme, won approval from both the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2012 for the production of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta).\n\nAt the time, there had been a shortage of the enzyme replacement therapy \u2013 first approved in 2003 to treat the inherited disorder Fabry Disease, a deficiency of the enzyme alpha galactosidase A \u2013 due to a series of contamination issues at another Genzyme\u2019 facility: Allston Landing, located close to the Framingham site.\n\nThe transfer to Framingham allowed Sanofi to rectify shortages of both Fabrazyme and Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) \u2013 the latter by freeing space up at Allston Landing.\n\nIn 2013, Sanofi invested $80 million to build a downstream facility at Framingham dedicated to Fabrazyme. Since then, Sanofi describes Framingham as \"among the world\u2019s first digitally enabled facilities to use continuous-biologics-production technology,\" in its literature. \"Its end-to-end platform uses millions of points of data captured by sensors to continuously optimize for excellence.\"\n\nAs for the Allston Landing facility, Sanofi sold the plant to contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Resilience in 2021.",

A source close to the case confirmed that the appeals court \u201cdeclared inadmissible\u201d a set of complaints brought in 2023 by Belgian former lobbyist Frederic Baldan, as he could not prove suffering \u201cpersonal harm.\u201d The court \u201cfound the complainants wrong across the board,\u201d von der Leyen\u2019s lawyer Adrien Masset told AFP. The EU moved swiftly after the Covid pandemic emerged in 2020 to secure vaccines for member countries to buy for their citizens and residents, but many aspects of the procurement from Pfizer have been kept confidential, leading to claims of a lack of transparency and several legal proceedings. Last year Baldan, who argued that von der Leyen both overstepped her role and violated the European Commission code of conduct, lost a similar lawsuit in Brussels. Another complaint filed by The New York Times against the commission for failing to release the texts despite a freedom of information request is being heard by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA new class of drugs may be emerging to challenge the dominance of the first generation checkpoint inhibitors, such as Merck\u2019s Keytruda, which has been used to combat dozens of different cancers in millions of patients, making it the top-selling drug in the world, STAT explains. Experts say a certain type of bispecific antibody seems to have hit upon a crucial combination of two cancer targets: the proteins VEGF and either PD-1 or PD-L1. There has been a surge of interest in these compounds from biotech and pharma in the last few months, spurred on most by the presentation of promising clinical data from Summit Therapeutics. In September, the company presented data showing its PD-1 and VEGF bispecific outperformed Keytruda in a Phase 3 clinical trial in advanced lung cancer patients.

VAS00017 version 1.0 dated 30 July 2024.\n\nHowever, this approval is subject to the condition that the firm increase the sample size to a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects and clinical trial sites should be geographically distributed, including government sites.\n\nNirsevimab is a long-acting monoclonal antibody indicated for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants.\n\nNirsevimab (MEDI8897) is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1\u0138) monoclonal antibody used to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants. It binds to the prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein, a glycoprotein involved in the membrane fusion step of the viral entry process, and neutralizes several RSV A and B strains.\n\nRSV is coated with two types of glycoproteins, the attachment glycoprotein (G protein) and the fusion glycoprotein (F protein). Of these two, only the F protein is essential for the entry of the virus into cells lining the respiratory tract, making it a desirable drug target. The RSV F protein is initially in a metastable prefusion conformation and undergoes conformational changes after being triggered by an unknown event. These conformational changes lead to a postfusion conformation, where both viral and host-cell membranes are together.\n\nNirsevimab binds to a highly conserved epitope of the RSV prefusion F protein, inhibiting the membrane fusion step in the viral entry process. This allows nirsevimab to neutralize various RSV A and B strains and block cell-to-cell fusion.\n\nAt the recent SEC meeting for Pulmonary held on 9th January 2025, the expert panel reviewed the proposal to conduct a Phase IV clinical trial titled \u201cA Phase 4, open-label, single-arm clinical study to describe safety and efficacy outcomes associated with the use of Nirsevimab in neonates and infants born during or entering their first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season and in children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.\u201d\n\nAfter detailed deliberation, the committee recommended the approval to conduct the study with the following conditions:\n\n1. The sample size should be increased to a minimum of 100 evaluable subjects.\n\n2. Clinical trial sites should be geographically distributed, including government sites.\n\nAccordingly, the expert panel suggested that the firm should submit the revised protocol to CDSCO for further evaluation.\n\nAlso Read: Government Bans Import of Refurbished Medical Devices",

Opella, Sanofi\u2019s Consumer Healthcare business, announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted a clinical hold on its planned actual use trial (AUT) to support the switch of Cialis (tadalafil) from a prescription to an over-the-counter medicine. This decision allows for the initiation of the AUT and makes Cialis the first PDE-5 inhibitor to achieve this milestone.\n\nAUTs evaluate the use of the medicine under real-world conditions to identify any issues that have not previously been identified and to confirm that consumers can self-diagnose and treat themselves appropriately without the help of a healthcare provider.\n\nJulie Van Ongevalle\n\nPresident and CEO, Opella\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the FDA has completed their review and is allowing us to initiate this important study. The actual use trial is not only a significant opportunity to gain insights into how Cialis is used by consumers without a prescription, but it also underscores our commitment to advancing self-care solutions. It represents a crucial step towards our commitment to make self-care as simple as it should be.\u201d\n\nDr. Josephine Fubara\n\nChief Science Officer, Opella\n\n\u201cFDA\u2019s decision marks a significant step forward in Opella\u2019s data-driven efforts to switch a PDE-5 inhibitor like Cialis. Now that the FDA has completed their thorough review of our data, we can move into the next phase of this program; the actual use trial, which is pivotal in ensuring the safety and proper self-selection of Cialis for over-the-counter use. We look forward to continuing our work to bring safe and expanded access to the many consumers who will benefit from nonprescription Cialis.\u201d\n\nOpella remains committed to advancing its development program and bringing a new self-care solution with proven effectiveness for people living with erectile dysfunction. The company is completing the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to initiate the pivotal AUT. Information about the study will become available on clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nOn October 21, 2024 Sanofi and CD&R announced the intention to transfer a 50% controlling stake in Opella to CD&R with Sanofi to remain a significant shareholder.\n\nAbout Cialis\n\nCialis (tadalafil) in the US is currently only available with a prescription. Cialis is a tablet taken to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and both ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only PDE-5 inhibitor treatment that offers men a choice when it comes to treatment for ED - Cialis for use as needed and Cialis for once daily use. To learn more about Cialis, visit www.cialis.com.\n\nCialis is not for women or children. It is important to note that Cialis is not to be taken with medicines called nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate or isosorbide mononitrate which are often prescribed for chest pain; or with recreational drugs called poppers like amyl or butyl nitrite, as the combination may cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure; or if allergic to Cialis or Adcirca (tadalafil), or any of its ingredients. Anyone who experiences any symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as rash, hives, swelling of the lips, tongue or throat, or difficulty breathing or swallowing, should call a healthcare provider or get help right away.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives. Our team, across the world, is dedicated to transforming the practice of medicine by working to turn the impossible into the possible.

            "content": "Paul Hudson\n\n[People] delegate AI to CDOs, and it's the biggest mistake you can make.\n\nAt last year\u2019s World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Paul Hudson, CEO of French pharma giant Sanofi, made the case for AI being a technology that would augment, not destroy, jobs and the nature of work, arguing:\n\nI think there is this journey to more meaningful work\u2026We don't spend enough time talking about what this will enable that is not possible by human beings.\n\nMaking sure that this message sinks home, Hudson was back to pick up the theme this year, expanding on how AI has changed the nature of roles, including that bit of \u2018tough love\u2019 for Chief Digital Officers (CDO) everywhere:\n\nI have a great CDO, but the nature of the change and the courage needed to change business process at scale, to better optimize resources and to go chase miracles for us, means that if you delegate to a CDO, you have automatically lost. You have great AI that nobody uses.\n\nToo many cooks spoil the proverbial broth, he added:\n\nWhen you're trying to change the business process, that's where the real win is, and that's why I have to lead it myself. It's not just about me, it's just I'm the arbitrator to make sure we get the adoption that we need. If I have a call to action, don't over delegate.\n\nPace of change\n\nThere\u2019s also wider home truths to be levelled about the pace of AI adoption particularly among some of Sanofi\u2019s peers:\n\nI talk to a lot of my peers about the adoption of AI...and people are still moving too slow course. Part of it is that it needs to be sponsored from the top, because it's still unknown to so many people, and the scale of it, so many business processes have to be changed. If you're not going to do that, it's a sort of nice addition to the tools that you have.\n\nHe added:\n\nWhile most big companies are piloting and dabbling, most CEOs are a little bit apprehensive and are running lots of proof of concepts because it's safer just to do that for a few years before retirement, We've decided that everybody will be in the same place in the end in healthcare, so being first and the broadest, which is where we believe we are right now, gives us a huge opportunity to beat others.\n\nProof points\n\nAnd that\u2019s happening, he boasted:\n\nIn big corporations, there's a lot of managers and senior managers who've made careers out of 'polish and slide decks' to make sure that they can communicate upwards what we should think about a situation. With radical transparency, we've sort of blown that away a little bit. People can turn bad news into good news with the right PowerPoint presentation. We're trying to really avoid that\u2026I think in healthcare in general, people are a bit slow. I think in the race with the turtles, we're the lead turtle.\n\nAnd he can prove it, he reckons, citing examples of how Sanofi\u2019s adoption of AI tech has changed operations:\n\nWe used to, when I joined the company, spend a week doing a budget process. Now we can spend about three hours because AI lets us know where we're heading, use it as a base case and adjust resources from there. We're deploying up to a billion dollars in real time, enabled by an agent to allow us to do that.\n\nAi is also changing the nature of Sanofi\u2019s core business, Hudson said:\n\nIt takes about 12 to 15 years to discover and develop and bring forward a new drug and Large Language Models are what two three years, at least, in practical application,. We spend about two to three billion to develop and discover and develop that medicine. At the same time, roughly a third of the discovery effort for the drugs that will launch in 10 years are being validated by AI,. People forget there are so many diseases that are considered undruggable and so many diseases that are unmet in terms of needed treatment that we're using AI to genetically validate targets, to make sure we're likely to bring forward a medicine a decade later.\n\nValidation is a crucial component of the organization\u2019s work, he added:\n\nWe generally validate everything, and target selection is more than 90% accurate now, but we spent an awful lot of time putting together our data, making sure that we have it end-to-end. We've completed that. We're running validated agents now at scale, with more than 20,000 people using them on a daily basis. They'll be from as simple as inventory management, but the agent is correlating all the data real-time, almost like Instagram notifications. We're doing very much the same in terms of forecasting accuracy, more than 99% accurate in terms of use cases.\n\nAgent tech is playing a big part in all this, explained Hudson:\n\nWe spend around \u20ac8 billion a year on development, and the key decision-making body, our drug development committee, begins its sessions with a validated agent recommending whether a drug should pass through a toll gate, whether it goes to phase three or goes to phase two. We do that because it's very sobering. The agent doesn't have a career at stake, the agent isn't wedded to the project for the last 10 years. The agent is dispassionately saying, \u201cDon't go forward or go forward faster or go forward and remember these things\u2019. We're not used to having somebody without a career at stake in the room at a senior level.\n\nMy take\n\nWhat about the \u2018AI is going to take my job!\u2019 Paranoia? Hudson has one more blunt message born of experience:\n\nThat\u2019s really not the question.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a message that those \u2018slow CEOs\u2019 he talks about are ready to take on board remains to be seen.",

That process is when manufacturers figure out what compounds should qualify as candidates for new medicines.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company, which makes drugs like Lantus insulin jabs and Plavix blood thinners, spends about three billion euros, or $3.1 billion, on discovery within that timeframe, Hudson said.\n\nHe and four other senior-level speakers, including Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman and Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, spoke positively about AI at the panel, saying people shouldn't be so worried that they might lose their jobs.\n\n\"The jobs that are at risk are the jobs where the human isn't interested in AI.

Opella, Sanofi\u2019s Consumer Healthcare business, announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted a clinical hold on its planned actual use trial (AUT) to support the switch of Cialis (tadalafil) from a prescription to an over-the-counter medicine. This decision allows for the initiation of the AUT and makes Cialis the first PDE-5 inhibitor to achieve this milestone.\n\nAUTs evaluate the use of the medicine under real-world conditions to identify any issues that have not previously been identified and to confirm that consumers can self-diagnose and treat themselves appropriately without the help of a healthcare provider.\n\nJulie Van Ongevalle\n\nPresident and CEO, Opella\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the FDA has completed their review and is allowing us to initiate this important study. The actual use trial is not only a significant opportunity to gain insights into how Cialis is used by consumers without a prescription, but it also underscores our commitment to advancing self-care solutions. It represents a crucial step towards our commitment to make self-care as simple as it should be.\u201d\n\nDr. Josephine Fubara\n\nChief Science Officer, Opella\n\n\u201cFDA\u2019s decision marks a significant step forward in Opella\u2019s data-driven efforts to switch a PDE-5 inhibitor like Cialis. Now that the FDA has completed their thorough review of our data, we can move into the next phase of this program; the actual use trial, which is pivotal in ensuring the safety and proper self-selection of Cialis for over-the-counter use. We look forward to continuing our work to bring safe and expanded access to the many consumers who will benefit from nonprescription Cialis.\u201d\n\nOpella remains committed to advancing its development program and bringing a new self-care solution with proven effectiveness for people living with erectile dysfunction. The company is completing the clinical and regulatory activities necessary to initiate the pivotal AUT. Information about the study will become available on clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nOn October 21, 2024 Sanofi and CD&R announced the intention to transfer a 50% controlling stake in Opella to CD&R with Sanofi to remain a significant shareholder.\n\nAbout Cialis\n\nCialis (tadalafil) in the US is currently only available with a prescription. Cialis is a tablet taken to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and both ED and the signs and symptoms of BPH. Cialis is the only PDE-5 inhibitor treatment that offers men a choice when it comes to treatment for ED - Cialis for use as needed and Cialis for once daily use.

Further insights were presented at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, with Sanofi revealing that the Phase II data readout is expected to take place in the first half of 2025.\n\n\u201cThe collaboration between Sanofi and Kymera Therapeutics on SAR444656 may represent a significant opportunity for competition in atopic dermatitis treatment and may introduce a novel therapeutic option to the market,\u201d Maniatis said.\n\nAlso Read Weight loss pills Ozempic, Wegovy and Trizepatide enter Indian market\n\nSanofi continues to be at the forefront of the competition within the AD space, thanks to its anti-OX40L mAb amlitelimab, which is currently in four Phase III clinical trials (COAST 1, COAST 2, SHORE, and AQUA), and with key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData sharing their excitement about the progress of anti-OX40L mechanism of action. Overall, the positive outcomes from the clinical trials for both SAR444656 and amlitelimab may assist in shaping a more competitive treatment landscape for AD and bolster Sanofi\u2019s position in this market.\n\n\u201cSanofi\u2019s focus on growth through innovation and pipeline development is important to maintain its establishment in a competitive landscape. The AD market is expected to continue expanding as multiple pharmaceutical companies are investigating agents with different mechanisms of action in an effort to provide alternatives to the current standard of care,\u201d Maniatis added.",

The University of Queensland-CEPI COVID vaccine program also received financial support from the Australian and the Queensland governments, and more than 2,600 university alumni, community members, foundations and corporations.\n\nOne of the challenges in manufacturing a vaccine from these surface proteins is that they go through many structural changes upon binding to receptors, meaning that their final form may be significantly different to how they appear on the viral surface to the immune system.\n\nBy using molecular clamp technology to \u2018lock\u2019 these proteins in their original form, researchers can use them as the basis of a subunit vaccine that induces the body to raise an immune response.\n\nThe molecular clamp technology was exclusively licensed to University of Queensland start-up company Vicebio Limited prior to the pandemic. In 2024, Vicebio received investment of US$100 million to begin Phase 1 clinical trials for vaccines for major respiratory pathogens \u2013 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n\n\u201cMy team is now focused on other viruses and other vaccine platforms, and understanding how viruses interact with the immune system in order to make better vaccines and therapies,\u201d says Watterson.\n\nWatterson says the new facilities at QEVC will enable his team to expand their work into arboviruses, such as dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis, which could help inform vaccine work in the event of future pandemic threats.\n\nRafi Ahmed (second from right), director of the Emory Vaccine Center in the United States and Ravi Thadhani (second from left), executive vice president for health affairs at Emory University, visiting colleagues at The University of Queensland.Credit: The University of Queensland\n\nWorking together\n\nThe centre is a culmination of a decade of collaborative research between The University of Queensland and Emory University, and will also involve work with industry partners such as global pharmaceutical company, Sanofi, and Brisbane-based biotech, Vaxxas.\n\n\u201cIt takes advantage of Queensland\u2019s capabilities in design and production of vaccine candidates, as well as Emory\u2019s capabilities in rapid clinical testing of vaccines,\u201d explains Trent Munro, director of biotechnology innovation at The University of Queensland.\n\nAn important role for the new centre will be analysing immune responses after vaccination or infection. Ahmed says this will help researchers develop a better understanding of how humans respond to vaccines from the immune perspective.\n\n\u201cSanofi, for example, is developing a vaccine for chlamydia, which is nearing the clinical trial stage. We will help them with testing after vaccination, analysing the immune response to the vaccine,\u201d says Ahmed.\n\nAnother area of collaboration will be therapeutic vaccines for viral mediated cancers, such as human papilloma virus (HPV). Researchers at the Emory Vaccine Center are working on HPV head and neck cancer and extending those studies to HPV cervical cancer.\n\nAs well as the vaccines themselves, QEVC researchers will collaborate with industry partners on alternative methods of delivering vaccines into the body, which do not involve needles and syringes.\n\n\u201cVaxxas is developing a needle-free skin patch which delivers the vaccine to the immune cells just below the skin\u2019s surface,\u201d say Munro. \u201cIt is potentially a more targeted and efficient way of delivering vaccines,\u201d says Munro.\n\nVaxxas\u2019 high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) technology also has thermostability benefits that could reduce refrigeration requirements, making vaccines more accessible globally.\n\nThe QEVC, which is based at the university\u2019s St Lucia campus in Brisbane, will house more than 80 researchers and is expected to officially open in 2026.",

            "content": "Sanofi (EPA:SAN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 7.0% over the last month. However, in this article, we decided to focus on its weak fundamentals, as long-term financial performance of a business is what ultimately dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sanofi is:\n\n6.2% = \u20ac4.5b \u00f7 \u20ac73b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every \u20ac1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20ac0.06 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Sanofi's Earnings Growth And 6.2% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Sanofi's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 8.7%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. For this reason, Sanofi's five year net income decline of 3.3% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared Sanofi's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 14% over the last few years.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Sanofi's's valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Sanofi Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nWith a high three-year median payout ratio of 65% (implying that 35% of the profits are retained), most of Sanofi's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. The business is only left with a small pool of capital to reinvest - A vicious cycle that doesn't benefit the company in the long-run. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Sanofi visit our\n\nMoreover, Sanofi has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 49% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Sanofi's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, Sanofi's performance is quite a big let-down. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. \u2022 Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n\u2022 Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n\u2022 Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

At D28, the geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) of MVB.1.351 booster relative to BNT162b2 was 2.53 (1.80;3.57) and 2.50 (1.70;3.67) against BA.1 and BA.4/5 strains, respectively, which met the noninferiority criterion of the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of GMTR > 0.5 (Table 2). At M3, the GMTR of MVB.1.351 relative to BNT162b2 was 2.06 (1.22;3.48) and 2.48 (1.44;4.27) against BA.1 and BA.4/5, respectively, meeting the noninferiority criterion. Antibody titers elicited by MVD614 and BNT162b2 vaccines were comparable to each other (Fig. 2A, D).\n\nFig. 2: Kinetics of post-booster neutralization antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 and BA.4/5 variant strains assessed prior to, at 28 days and 3 months after receipt of a third vaccine dose (Revised Per-Protocol analysis set Monogram). Shown are geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron BA.1 (A\u2013C) and BA.4/5 (D\u2013F) variant strains of SARS- CoV-2. The blue line, red even dashes, and green uneven dashes indicate BNT162b2, Sanofi B.1.351, and Sanofi D614 vaccines, respectively. Circles represent the GMT values at 0, 28 days and 3 months after receipt of a third vaccine dose. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals for the GMTs. A and D depict all participants, B and E show GMTs for subgroup of participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 3 months post-booster, and C and F show GMTs for subgroup of participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection identified between D28 and M3. Please refer to Table 4 for the number of participants at each time point. Infected participants were defined with either a positive anti-nucleocapsid serology at M3 or who developed clinical symptoms with confirmatory testing for SARS CoV-2 between D28 and M3. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were measured using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assay expressing the full-length S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G or Omicron (BA.1 or BA.4/5) variants. Laboratory testing was performed by staff who were blinded to group allocation and time points. The figure was created using SAS\u00ae 9.4. Full size image\n\nTable 2 Comparison of post-booster geometric mean titer (GMT) and geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) and associated 95% CI between MVB.1.351 and BNT162b2 by variant at Day 28, Month 3 for all participants Full size table\n\nTo further understand the persistence of NAbs at M3 and potential impact of differentiated post-D28 infections between vaccine groups, a subgroup analysis was performed in individuals infected or not infected between D28 and M3. This analysis should be interpreted as supplemental to the main analysis acknowledging the post-randomization nature of the strata definition with potential unknown confounders impacting the interpretation. Infected participants were defined with either a positive anti-nucleocapsid serology at M3 or who developed clinical symptoms with confirmatory testing for SARS CoV-2 between D28 and M3. Nine of 54 participants (17%) from MVB.1.351 group, 18 of 60 participants (30%) from BNT162b2 group and 0 of 48 (0%) participants in the MVD614 were identified as infected between D28 and M3 in the revised PPAS monogram at D28. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 17 of 78 participants (22%) from MVB.1.351 group, 30 of 80 participants (38%) from BNT162b2 group, and 18 of 84 participants (21%) in the MVD614 were identified as infected between D28 and M3 (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Participant disposition Full size table\n\nAmong uninfected participants (Fig. 2B, E), the ratio of M3 to D28 GMTs (Table 4) was higher for the MVB.1.351 group than the BNT162b2 group against Omicron BA.1 (0.64 [0.53;0.77] versus 0.43 [0.35;0.53]), against Omicron BA.4/5 (0.61 [0.50; 0.75] versus 0.44 [0.34; 0.56]), and against D614 (0.68 [0.58,0.81] versus 0.46 [0.39,0.55]) indicating better persistence of NAbs over three months for the MVB.1.351 group. The beta containing variant booster MVB.1.351 elicited higher NAb titers against the original D614 virus strain compared to the two D614-containing booster groups BNT162b2 and MVD614 groups at both D28 and M3 (Table 2).\n\nTable 4 Summary of post-booster Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) and Geometric Mean Titer ratio (GMTR) and associated 95% CI in Sanofi MVB.1.351, BNT162b2 and Sanofi MVD614 vaccine booster groups by SARS-CoV-2 infection status subgroup and by variant strain Full size table\n\nIn participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection between D28 and M3 (Fig. 2C, F), both the MVB.1.351 (n = 9) and BNT162b2 (n = 18) vaccine groups showed an increase in GMTs against Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5 following infection (Table 4). Among the limited number of participants, the MVB.1.351 group maintained a higher magnitude of NAb titers than the BNT162b2 group, both at D28 and M3.\n\nThe limitations of this study included a lack of data on currently circulating and emerging variants with a consequence of no direct comparative data with the newer Omicron sublineages. Although such data are not available, this ongoing study will generate additional information about later time points and immunogenicity against subvariants like BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. Our findings for the MVB.1.351 vaccine offer an alternative to the conventional variant chasing approach, providing a valuable option for heterologous boosting.\n\nIn conclusion, these data show that the MVB.1.351 vaccine induced higher and durable cross-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants, up to 3 months after boosting compared to an MV ancestral BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine or to the MVD614 vaccine. Bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster doses containing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineage were recommended due to the Omicron variant spreading and more recently recommendations moved to MV booster dose containing an Omicron XBB.1 sublineage. New sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron continue to emerge. The effectiveness of the updated vaccines against the new variants continues to be studied, acknowledging the degree to which this higher NAb response against Omicron subvariants, as compared to a licensed mRNA vaccine, translates into greater clinical protection is not yet quantified. Overall, bivalent vaccines have demonstrated higher relative effectiveness relative to MV ancestral booster vaccines5. Data with currently deployed bivalent BA.4/5-containing mRNA booster vaccines suggest that antibody responses against BA.4/5 may be similar following MV ancestral and bivalent mRNA boosters6,7. A new comparative study demonstrated that the bivalent BA.4/5 vaccine was more immunogenic than the original MV BNT162b2 vaccine against circulating Omicron sublineages after a 4th dose in individuals >55 years of age8. Another study evaluating the effectiveness of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine elicited modest protection (30%) against COVID-199. Recent preliminary data comparing immune responses following administration of a 5th dose of a Monovalent XBB.1.5 booster to Bivalent BA.4/5 and XBB.1.5 booster vaccines did not show a strong advantage of the bivalent formulation10. In general, variant-chasing vaccines may only add value when the window between variant introduction and vaccine deployment is very short (<3 weeks). Hence, it is crucial to develop next-generation cross-neutralizing and durable vaccines11,12.",

            "content": "The potential takeout value supposedly is baked into the current price of young medical technology companies. However, the eventual price paid by a buyer frequently is influenced by the stage of the company\u2019s growth and market forces. Recently, the anti-merger stance of the Biden administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) appeared to place most biotechnology and medical device takeouts on hold because of the intransience of FTC chair Lina Khan, appointed by President Biden.\n\nStryker Medical (NYSE:SYK), with a long history of small, tuck-in medical device acquisitions, earlier this week agreed to buy Inari Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) for $4.9 billion. Stryker owns a market cap of nearly $140 billion. The size of the deal was not a stretch for Stryker but announcing the deal on January 6 was revealing, given the new administration will shift the FTC majority 3-2 in favor of Republicans once Donald Trump is sworn in as US president.\n\nLong dominant in orthopedic devices, Stryker said Inari\u2019s catheter-based mechanical thrombectomy systems to treat vascular disease will complement Stryker\u2019s current neovascular business. Revenue estimates for 2024 call for Inari to record $603 million for the past year, up from $494 million in 2023 and $383 million in 2022. In 2019, Inari posted $51 million in revenue. On the surface, Inari\u2019s fast growth could have attracted a Stryker bid over the past three years, probably at a lower price. Potential difficulties with the FTC, however, likely contributed to a delay by Stryker.\n\nIn 2023, the FTC forced the termination of a licensing deal between Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and the biotechnology company Maze Therapeutics. The FTC filed a lawsuit claiming the Sanofi-Maze collaboration was designed to extend Sanofi\u2019s monopoly in treating the rare disorder known as Pompe disease. According to filings, Sanofi designated Maze\u2019s drug MZE001 as a significant threat to its lucrative Pompe monopoly shortly after Maze publicly announced its development plans in 2021. Sanofi\u2019s drugs are administered via lengthy, biweekly intravenous infusions, whereas the oral tablet MZE001, taken two times a day, would reduce patients\u2019 treatment burden significantly.\n\nAs the Pompe drug regimen from Sanofi costs hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, the FTC complaint about monopoly power was not without credence. Had Sanofi licensed the Maze drug, the company would claim it was investing in the next generation of Pompe therapy. And then invest and develop very, very slowly, while its monopoly franchise continued to rack up high sales. Large companies have deployed the tactic for decades.\n\nThe FTC said the alliance would extend Sanofi\u2019s monopoly power over Pompe disease treatments and reduce innovation to develop new Pompe drugs. Curiously, Maze filed for an IPO in early January 2025 as its drug continues to progress through the clinic, signaling MZE001 holds promise in treating Pompe disease. If MZE001 succeeds, Maze could attract a more lucrative takeout bid than the original Sanofi partnership.\n\nThe develop-a-competitive-drug strategy and then seek a big company investment or takeout is a staple for medical technology companies. The strategy not only applies to Inari and Maze, but also to the partnership last November between Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) and Japan-based Kirin Kyowa (OTCPK:KNBWY).\n\nThe Kura-Kirin partnership involved Kura\u2019s lead drug ziftomenib, initially aimed at treating relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with NPM1 mutations. In the deal, Kura will lead development and commercialization in the U.S.; Kirin will take over those roles outside the U.S.\n\nWhile the deal was not formally a \u201ctakeout\u201d by a large drug company, Kura stands to receive the $330 million as an upfront payment and likely another $420 million in near-term milestones. That\u2019s a probable $750 million to Kura within perhaps three years.\n\nKura\u2019s stock plunged ~40% on the news because investors believed the deal ruled out a future, more rewarding takeout bid. Kura\u2019s market cap prior to the deal was ~$1.2 billion. The company\u2019s market cap now stands at $569.2 million, forcing Kura to develop more compelling drugs in the future. Kura could have had that intention when it inked the deal with Kirin.\n\nStryker\u2019s takeout of Inari may not have faced stiff FTC scrutiny. Stryker\u2019s action, however, may signal more large companies are ready to proceed with M&A in 2025 because of the favorable FTC environment. At this week\u2019s annual JPMorgan Healthcare conference, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced it would buy the neurology company Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI) for $14.6 billion.\n\nThe JP Morgan event historically has been a bellwether for M&A for the next 12 months as both large and small companies use the yearly kickoff conference to convince investors takeouts remain active in the industry.\n\nAmong the names covered by Biotech Currents in the past 12 months, Janux Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JANX) and Verona Pharma plc (NASDAQ:VRNA) stand out as takeover targets. Bidders reportedly were circling Janux in early 2024 before the company reported strong results with its prostate cancer drug JANX007. The company\u2019s stock jumped 55% on December 3, 2024, after it announced positive, updated interim phase 1b data for JANX007. Janux is mostly a one-product company and would tuck in well in a large company\u2019s cancer portfolio.\n\nThe key management behind Verona previously has sold two companies after advancing the respective companies to commercialization. Ensifentrine, Verona\u2019s drug to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was approved by the FDA in June 2024. Earlier this week, Verona reported ensifentrine, now branded as Ohtuvayre, recorded ~$36 million in fourth quarter sales and a total of ~$42 million for all of 2024.\n\nVerona likely wants to establish a few more quarters of rising sales in 2025 to cement the demand for Ohtuvayre before considering a serious takeout bid. But with the new FTC environment, bidders may choose to act more aggressively.\n\nDisclosure: The author owns positions in Inari, Intra-Cellular, Verona and Janux.\n\nShare",

Sanofi\u2019s CEO Paul Hudson thoroughly assessed Sanofi\u2019s performance over the past year and provided further insights on the company\u2019s plans for the future. Among other topics, Hudson discussed the success of Dupixent (dupilumab), highlighting that it has reached over $13bn in global sales, which affirms its commercial advantage and sets a milestone for Sanofi. This achievement further emphasises the drug\u2019s efficacy across multiple indications, including atopic dermatitis (AD), in which it is considered the gold standard. The use of Dupixent in AD has set a high benchmark for competitors within the space. However, despite its market leadership, Hudson has noted the need for increased competition, which is essential for a dynamic market, especially for AD.\n\nWithin the AD field, Sanofi has been developing the IRAK4 degrader SAR444656 (KT-474) in collaboration with Kymera Therapeutics. The drug is currently in Phase II clinical trials and may play an interesting role in increasing the competition in this disease area. Further insights were presented at the JP Morgan conference, with Sanofi revealing that the Phase II data readout is expected to take place in H1 2025. The collaboration between Sanofi and Kymera Therapeutics on SAR444656 may represent a significant opportunity for competition in AD treatment and may introduce a novel therapeutic option to the market. Nevertheless, Sanofi continues to increase competition with the anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) amlitelimab, which is currently in four Phase III clinical trials (COAST 1, NCT06130566; COAST 2, NCT06181435; SHORE, NCT06224348; AQUA, NCT06241118). Key opinion leaders are currently excited about the progress of anti-OX40L therapies. Overall, the positive outcomes from the clinical trials for both SAR444656 and amlitelimab may assist in shaping a more competitive treatment landscape for AD.\n\nSanofi\u2019s focus on growth through innovation and pipeline development is vital to maintaining the company\u2019s establishment in a competitive landscape. The AD market is expected to continue expanding as multiple pharmaceutical companies are investigating agents with different mechanisms of action to provide alternatives to the current standard of care.",

As of 2024, the market is estimated to be valued at approximately US$ 4.78 billion, reflecting a positive trajectory in terms of demand and accessibility. This growth is expected to continue, with projections indicating that the market could reach around US$ 9.66 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8% from 2025-2033.\n\nA key contributor to this upward trend is the increasing incidence of influenza outbreaks and the resulting need for immunization among diverse demographics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes the importance of vaccination, which, combined with government initiatives promoting vaccine accessibility, is vital for maintaining public health standards.

            "content": "Supporting data for the approval came from the phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial (NCT02990338) as well as the real-world IsaFiRsT study.\n\nChina\u2019s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved isatuximab-irfc (Sarclisa) plus pomalidomide (Pomalyst) and dexamethasone for adults with multiple myeloma who were previously treated with at least 1 therapy including lenalidomide (Revlimid) and a proteasome inhibitor, according to a press release from the developer, Sanofi.1\n\nBeyond this approval, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology and Chinese Anti-Cancer Association guidelines list the isatuximab combination as a \u201cCategory I Recommendation\u201d and a \u201cPreferred Option\u201d for treating those with multiple myeloma following a first relapse. Health authorities in China are also reviewing a regulatory submission for isatuximab plus bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant; a final decision for this indication is anticipated in the coming months.\n\nSupporting data for the approval came from the phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial (NCT02990338) as well as the real-world IsaFiRsT study. In ICARIA-MM, combining isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone produced a 40% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death vs pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone (HR, 0.596; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81; P = .001). Additionally, isatuximab-based treatment prolonged overall survival (OS) by 6.9 months (HR, 0.78; P = .0319).\n\nReal-world data from the IsaFiRsT study showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 82.6% with isatuximab plus pomalidomide/dexamethasone among patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in China.\n\n\u201cThis approval marks an important milestone for [isatuximab] in China. The results of the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, coupled with the real-world IsaFiRsT study, highlight the benefit of [isatuximab] for patients living with multiple myeloma and the importance of innovative regulatory pathways for timely access to different treatments,\u201d Olivier Nataf, global head of Oncology at Sanofi, stated in the press release.1 We look forward to continuing to build strong partnerships with the medical community, local companies, and authorities in China as we work to bring more innovative treatments to patients.\n\nICARIA-MM\n\nInvestigators of the open-label, multi-center phase 3 ICARIA-MM trial assessed treatment with isatuximab plus pomalidomide/dexamethasone vs pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone among 307 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma across 96 centers in 24 countries. Patients received isatuximab at 10 mg/kg intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every other week in 28-day cycles plus standard pomalidomide/dexamethasone.\n\nThe trial\u2019s primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included ORR, clinical benefit rate, OS, time to progression, time to first response, pharmacokinetics, and safety.2\n\nPatients 18 years and older with documented multiple myeloma with evidence of measurable disease, at least 2 prior lines of therapy including lenalidomide plus a proteasome inhibitor, and disease progression on or within 60 days of finishing the last prior line of therapy were eligible for enrollment on the trial. Those enrolled on the ICARIA-MM study had a median of 3 prior lines of treatment for multiple myeloma.\n\nIsaFiRsT\n\nThe single-arm, observational, prospective, real-world IsaFiRsT study assessed 24 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who received treatment with isatuximab plus pomalidomide/dexamethasone at a single site in China. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of treatment, which included lenalidomide plus a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nInvestigators administered isatuximab at 10 mg/kg intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every other week in 28-day cycles in combination with standard pomalidomide/dexamethasone.\n\nThe study\u2019s primary end point was ORR. Key secondary end points were PFS, OS, duration of response, and safety.\n\nThe FDA previously approved isatuximab plus bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM in September 2024 based on data from the phase 3 IMROZ trial (NCT03319667).3\n\nReferences",

For example, we have in the clinical stage bispecifics that target pathways in both asthma and allergy.\n\nOur revolutionary NANOBODY\u00ae technology platform, which lets us target three or more targets at once, is empowering our teams to develop the medicines of tomorrow. By connecting antibody fragments our teams can create new compounds (called \"multivalent\" NANOBODY molecules) that bind to many different targets simultaneously nanobodies play an essential role in drug discovery\u2014specifically, helping to develop medicines that may replace complex treatment regimens with single, multi-action medicines.\n\nIn addition, expanding the role of AI and machine learning in R&D will boost efficiency and generate earlier insights, AI will play a large role in \u201cbuilding quantitative systems where we look at how a drug works, how the pharmacodynamics work, and how to safely dose to the highest efficacy in specific patients,\u201d said Ashrafian. \u201cWe are expanding the application of AI to large patient databases to get a better idea of where potential clinical trial participants are, and to model the outcomes of clinical trials based on the characteristics of different patient populations. Since we started doing this, recruitment in clinical trials has doubled.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we begin applying AI more broadly across development, we will become even more efficient and generate earlier insights to bring transformative medicines to patients, faster,\u201d continued Ashrafian.\n\nAnother key area of expansion will be to better understand the patient journey, with patients and advocacy groups informing every aspect of the drug discovery and development process. In the case of asthma, Ashrafian explained that the typical patient begins with an inhaler or steroid, and once those no longer control symptoms, they move on to an oral drug, then to an injectable biologic.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding that journey helps us develop drugs that target the various disease stages,\u201d said Ashrafian. \u201cWe\u2019re further integrating patient feedback into R&D insights to better understand key benefits and determine unmet needs.\u201d\n\nOf course, R&D excellence requires us to focus externally as well as internally, which is why we remain open to strategic collaborations.",

PHOTO: ISTOCKPHOTOS\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Procter and Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive are among the defendants in six new lawsuits targeting the sale of toothpaste and mouth rinse for young children because the products contain fluoride, which can be harmful if swallowed in large quantities.\n\nParents filed complaints on Jan 13 in federal courts in Illinois and California over products such as Procter and Gamble\u2019s Kid\u2019s Crest toothpaste and several products sold under Colgate\u2019s namesake, and the Tom\u2019s of Maine and Hello brands.\n\nOther challenged products include Perrigo\u2019s Firefly anti-cavity rinse and Sanofi\u2019s ACT Kids rinse.\n\nThe proposed class actions cite warnings from US health regulators that fluoride-based toothpastes and rinses not be used by children under the ages of two and six, respectively, and that the toothpastes be kept out of reach of children under six.\n\nThey also say the products are marketed as \u201ccandy-like\u201d with bright colours, cartoon images and flavours such as Groovy Grape and Silly Strawberry. The colour of one Kid\u2019s Crest product is shown changing to pink from blue as children brush.\n\nFluoride helps prevent cavities when applied topically to the teeth, but when ingested can pose significant risks to and even kill young children, according to the lawsuits.\n\nProcter and Gamble, Colgate, Perrigo and Sanofi did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuits seek restitution, compensatory damages and triple or punitive damages for violations of various consumer protection laws.\n\n\u201cThese lawsuits are not about whether fluoride toothpaste should be available to those who want it,\u201d Mr Michael Connett, a partner at the law firm Siri and Glimstad \u2013 representing the parents \u2013 said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThey are about companies that mislead consumers into believing these products are harmless to young children.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between fluoride and human health has long been debated. Mr Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who is US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to become secretary of health and human services, has questioned fluoride\u2019s safety and use in public water systems.\n\nLast week, a study published in the journal Jama Paediatrics linked higher fluoride exposures in children to lower IQ scores.\n\nIn September 2024, a San Francisco federal judge ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water because of the possible link to lower IQ. Mr Connett represented advocacy groups seeking additional regulation. REUTERS\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.",

And the findings may provide further impetus for legislative action to curb practices that critics say contribute to the rising cost of prescription drugs, STAT says. The latest report accuses the PBMs \u2014 CVS Caremark, Optum Rx, and Express Scripts, all of which are owned by large health insurers \u2014 of boosting prices of specialty generic drugs that are sold through their own pharmacies. By doing so, the companies significantly padded their bottom lines at the expense of the American health care system, according to the FTC. Specifically, the companies were able to generate more than $7.3 billion in revenue by dispensing medicines to treat cancer, HIV, heart disease, and other serious illnesses at prices that exceeded their estimated acquisition costs between 2017 and 2022.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA federal watchdog weighed in on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s controversial accelerated approval pathway, identifying three instances where the agency deviated from protocol during a drug approval, STAT writes. The report, released by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, intended to determine whether the FDA\u2019s contentious approval of Biogen\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s drug, Aduhelm, was the outlier or the norm. The agency approved the drug against the recommendations of an independent advisory panel. STAT later revealed that Biogen executives recruited an FDA official to help secure the approval. The report suggested that Aduhelm was more of an outlier, as investigators found only three troubling instances out of a sample of 24 accelerated approval drugs. But Ivan Troy, social science analyst at HHS OIG, noted even one misstep can negatively impact scores of patients.",

            "content": "Paris: Sanofi has announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa, an anti-CD38 medicine, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nThis approval is based on results from the pivotal ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, using the China-based IsaFiRsT real-world study as bridging data. The ICARIA-MM study demonstrated Sarclisa in combination with Pd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR 0.596, 95% CI 0.44-0.81, p=0.001), and resulted in a clinically meaningful, 6.9-month improvement in overall survival (OS) (HR=0.78; log-rank 1-sided P=0.0319), compared to Pd alone. Additionally, the IsaFiRsT study, which is the first real-world study for the registration of an anti-CD38 therapy in combination with Pd in China, showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 82.6% among relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) adult patients.\n\nOlivier Nataf, Global Head, Oncology said, \u201cThis approval marks an important milestone for Sanofi in China. The results of the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, coupled with the real-world IsaFiRsT study, highlight the benefit of Sarclisa for patients living with multiple myeloma and the importance of innovative regulatory pathways for timely access to different treatments. We look forward to continuing to build strong partnerships with the medical community, local companies, and authorities in China as we work to bring more innovative treatments to patients.\u201d\n\nThrough the Lecheng Pilot for real-world data application, the NMPA has increasingly used real-world evidence (RWE) to help accelerate the review and approval of innovative therapies and medical devices in China. Sarclisa was one of the first three treatments authorized for real-world studies as part of the pilot program and is the first blood cancer treatment approved based on RWE, in addition to clinical data.\n\nIn addition to the NMPA approval, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) and Chinese Anti-Cancer Association (CACA) guidelines include Sarclisa-Pd as a \"Category I Recommendation\" and the \"Preferred Option\" for the treatment of patients with first-relapsed MM. Beyond R/R MM, a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) in adult patients not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, is also under review in China with a final decision expected in the coming months.\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including the US and EU, across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u22652 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1\u20133 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy.\n\nIn the US, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM not eligible for transplant based on the IMROZ phase 3 study.\n\nOn November 14, 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd in this patient population. A final decision is expected in the coming months.\n\n\"Sanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery,\" the release stated.",

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China has approved Sarclisa, an anti-CD38 medicine, in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least one prior line of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.\n\nThis approval is based on results from the pivotal ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, using the China-based IsaFiRsT real-world study as bridging data. The ICARIA-MM study demonstrated Sarclisa in combination with Pd significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% (HR 0.596, 95% CI 0.44-0.81, p=0.001), and resulted in a clinically meaningful, 6.9-month improvement in overall survival (OS) (HR=0.78; log-rank 1-sided P=0.0319), compared to Pd alone. Additionally, the IsaFiRsT study, which is the first real-world study for the registration of an anti-CD38 therapy in combination with Pd in China, showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 82.6% among relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) adult patients.\n\nOlivier Nataf\n\nGlobal Head, Oncology\n\n\u201cThis approval marks an important milestone for Sanofi in China. The results of the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, coupled with the real-world IsaFiRsT study, highlight the benefit of Sarclisa for patients living with multiple myeloma and the importance of innovative regulatory pathways for timely access to different treatments. We look forward to continuing to build strong partnerships with the medical community, local companies, and authorities in China as we work to bring more innovative treatments to patients.\u201d\n\nThrough the Lecheng Pilot for real-world data application, the NMPA has increasingly used real-world evidence (RWE) to help accelerate the review and approval of innovative therapies and medical devices in China. Sarclisa was one of the first three treatments authorized for real-world studies as part of the pilot program and is the first blood cancer treatment approved based on RWE, in addition to clinical data.\n\nIn addition to the NMPA approval, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) and Chinese Anti-Cancer Association (CACA) guidelines include Sarclisa-Pd as a \"Category I Recommendation\" and the \"Preferred Option\" for the treatment of patients with first-relapsed MM. Beyond R/R MM, a regulatory submission for Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) in adult patients not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant, is also under review in China with a final decision expected in the coming months.\n\nAs one of the first multinational companies to enter China in 1982, Sanofi is committed to accelerating the introduction of innovative medicines and vaccines into China, aiming to transform the practice of medicine for the benefit of more Chinese people.\n\nAbout the ICARIA-MM study\n\nICARIA-MM was a pivotal phase 3 randomized, open-label, multi-center trial evaluating Sarclisa in combination with Pd versus Pd alone in patients with R/R MM. The study enrolled 307 patients with R/R MM across 96 centers spanning 24 countries. Overall, patients had received a median of three prior lines of anti-myeloma therapies, including at least two consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor given alone or in combination.\n\nDuring the trial, Sarclisa was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with standard doses of Pd for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of ICARIA-MM was progression-free survival (PFS). Key secondary endpoints included ORR and OS.\n\nAbout the IsaFiRsT study\n\nThe IsaFiRsT study was a single-arm, observational, prospective, real-world study evaluating Sarclisa in combination with Pd in patients with R/R MM. The study enrolled 24 patients with R/R MM at one site in China. Overall, patients received a median of three prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and had measurable serum or urine M-protein.\n\nDuring the trial, Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks, then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with standard doses of Pd for the duration of treatment. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of IsaFiRsT was ORR. Key secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, duration of response (DOR) and safety.\n\nAbout Sarclisa\n\nSarclisa (isatuximab) is a CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on MM cells, inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells, making it a target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa. In the US, the non-proprietary name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc, with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with nonproprietary naming of biological products guidance for industry issued by the US FDA.\n\nCurrently, Sarclisa is approved in more than 50 countries, including the US and EU, across two indications; Sarclisa is approved under an additional indication in the US. Based on the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, Sarclisa is approved in combination with Pd for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received \u22652 prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the IKEMA phase 3 study, Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone, including in the US for the treatment of patients with R/R MM who have received 1\u20133 prior lines of therapy and in the EU for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the US, Sarclisa is approved in combination with VRd as a front-line treatment option for adult patients with NDMM not eligible for transplant based on the IMROZ phase 3 study. On November 14, 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Sarclisa-VRd in this patient population. A final decision is expected in the coming months.\n\nSanofi continues to advance Sarclisa as part of a patient-centric clinical development program, which includes several phase 2 and phase 3 studies across the MM treatment continuum spanning six potential indications. In addition, the company is evaluating a subcutaneous administration method for Sarclisa in clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of Sarclisa has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indications and methods of delivery.\n\nIn striving to become the number one immunoscience company globally, Sanofi remains committed to advancing oncology innovation. Through focused strategic decisions the company has reshaped and prioritized its pipeline, leveraging its expertise in immunoscience to drive progress. Efforts are centered on difficult-to-treat often rare cancers such as select hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with critical unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, certain types of lymphomas, as well as gastrointestinal and lung cancers.\n\nFor more information on Sarclisa clinical studies, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nAbout Sanofi\n\nWe are an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people\u2019s lives.

            "content": "Multiple Myeloma | Image Credit: \u00a9 Maris\u2013 stock.adobe.com\n\nThe Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved isatuximab-irfc (Sarclisa) plus pomalidomide (Pomalyst) and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior line of treatment, including lenalidomide (Revlimid) and a proteasome inhibitor.1\n\nThe regulatory decision is supported by findings from the pivotal phase 3 ICARIA-MMtrial (NCT02990338) using the China-based IsaFiRsT real-world study as bridging data. At a median follow-up of 52.4 months, patients who received isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (n = 154) achieved a median investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) of 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.8-13.8) compared with 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.5-7.9) among those who received only pomalidomide and dexamethasone (n = 153; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; 1-sided P < .0001).2 The median overall survival (OS) was 24.6 months (95% CI, 20.3-31.3) vs 17.7 months (95% CI, 14.4-26.2), respectively (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-1.02; 1-sided P = .0319).\n\n\u201cThis approval marks an important milestone for Sanofi in China,\u201dOlivier Nataf, MS, global head of oncology, Sanofi, stated in a news release.1 \u201cThe results of the ICARIA-MM phase 3 study, coupled with the real-world IsaFiRsT study, highlight the benefit of [isatuximab] for patients living with multiple myeloma and the importance of innovative regulatory pathways for timely access to different treatments. We look forward to continuing to build strong partnerships with the medical community, local companies, and authorities in China as we work to bring more innovative treatments to patients.\u201d\n\nIsatuximab is a CD38-directed monoclonal antibody that is designed to bind to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor of multiple myeloma cells. The agent induces antitumor activity via multiple mechanisms of action, including apoptosis and immunomodulatory activity.\n\nICARIA-MM was a multicenter, open-label study that enrolled adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least 2 prior therapies and failed treatment with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, alone or as a combination component.2 Patients who were refractory to prior anti-CD38 therapy, had previous pomalidomide exposure, an ECOG performance status above 2, an ongoing toxic effect above grade 2 from previous treatment, had active primary amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, or had concomitant plasma cell leukemia were excluded from the study.\n\nEligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the investigational or control arm. In the investigational arm, patients received intravenous (IV) isatuximab at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 for subsequent cycles in combination with IV or oral dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg (20 mg if age \u2265 75 years) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and oral pomalidomide at a dose of 4 mg on days 1 to 21. Patients in the control arm received dexamethasone and pomalidomide only via the same dosing schedule as the investigational arm.\n\nThe primary end point was PFS per independent review committee. Key secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and OS. Median PFS on subsequent therapy or death (PFS2), ORR on further therapy, PFS on the first line of further therapy, and time to next treatment (TNNT) served as exploratory end points.\n\nAdditional data from ICARIA-MM showed that the ORR was 63% (95% CI, 55%-71%) in the investigational arm compared with 33% (95% CI, 26%-41%) in the control arm. The median PFS2 was 17.5 months (95% CI, 14.9-19.2) compared with 12.9 months (95% CI, 10.1-16.6), respectively (HR, 0.735; 95% CI, 0.569-0.950; log-rank P = .0091). The median TNNT was 15.5 months (95% CI, 12.1-19.8) vs 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.3-11.5), respectively (HR, 0.548; 95% CI, 0.417-0.718; P < .0001).\n\nThe median treatment duration in the investigational arm was 11.0 months (range, 2.6-12.4) and 5.5 months (range, 4.4-21.8) in the control arm. Safety findings demonstrated that treatment-emergent serious adverse effects were reported in 74% vs 61% of patients, respectively. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse effects (TEAEs) occurred in 15% vs 13% of patients, respectively. The most common any-grade TEAEs in both arms included neutropenia (52% vs 36%), infusion-related reactions (37.5% vs 1%), and upper respiratory infection (36% vs 21%).\n\nBeyond the approval by the NMPA, the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology and Chinese Anti-Cancer Association guidelines include isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone as a category 1 recommendation and the preferred option for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma at first relapse.1 A regulatory submission for isatuximab plus bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant is also under review in China with a final decision expected in the coming months.\n\nReferences",

            "content": "Moderna (MRNA) shares plummeted $9.29, or 22%, to $22.96 in early trading after the company slashed its 2025 sales forecast, sparking investor concerns. The revised guidance cut the expected revenue by approximately $1 billion, setting a new range of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. This adjustment reflects the company\u2019s anticipation of various challenges that could impact sales in the coming year.\n\nThe majority of Moderna\u2019s projected revenue for 2025 is expected from its Covid-19 vaccine and a newly launched vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, the lowered expectations stem from multiple factors. CFO Jamey Mock highlighted increased competition within the Covid vaccine market as a primary concern. Moderna\u2019s share in the U.S. retail market for Covid shots has decreased from 48% in 2023 to 40% by the end of 2024, with further declines anticipated. This competitive pressure is compounded by a new partnership between Sanofi and Novavax, where Sanofi (SNY) will co-commercialize Novavax\u2019s Covid vaccine globally, potentially increasing competition for Moderna.\n\nAnother significant factor contributing to the sales forecast reduction is the decline in vaccination rates. In the U.S. retail market, there was a noticeable 7% drop in vaccination rates in the fall of 2024 compared to the previous year. This trend suggests a waning public interest or perceived need for Covid boosters, which could further depress sales figures.\n\nAdditionally, uncertainties around manufacturing contracts for vaccines in various countries and the unclear recommendations from CDC advisors on RSV revaccination add to the complexities Moderna faces. These elements introduce variability into the company\u2019s sales projections, making it harder to predict demand accurately.\n\nDespite these challenges, Moderna is not standing still. The company is actively managing its expenses, with plans to cut cash costs by $1 billion in 2025 and another $500 million in 2026. This cost management strategy is crucial as it aims at preserving cash reserves while the company diversifies its portfolio beyond its current offerings.\n\nModerna\u2019s approach to these issues reflects broader industry trends where biotechs pivot from peak pandemic profits to a more sustainable business model focusing on multiple revenue streams and cost efficiency. The company\u2019s earlier projection to break even on an operating cash basis by 2026 has been pushed back to 2028, aligning with these strategic shifts towards long-term financial stability rather than short-term gains from Covid vaccine sales.\n\nThe ripple effect of Moderna\u2019s revised forecast swept through the sector, dragging down other vaccine makers. Novavax (NVAX) fell 9% to an intraday low of\n\n$8.38, while BioNTech (BNTX) dropped over 6% to $114.51 in early trading. The declines reflect growing investor uncertainty about the vaccine market as the world transitions beyond the acute phase of the global health crisis.\n\nIn summary, Moderna\u2019s lowered sales forecast for 2025 signals a cautious approach to a market still adjusting to post-pandemic realities. The company\u2019s focus on cost reduction and portfolio diversification indicates a strategic recalibration aimed at navigating through current uncertainties while setting a foundation for future growth beyond its Covid-19 success. As the biotech landscape evolves, how Moderna adapts to these changes will be critical in determining its trajectory in the competitive pharmaceutical market.\n\nWallStreetPit does not provide investment advice.

            "content": "Gilead Sciences\u2019 inflammation drug prospects have come via deals, and the latest one brings drug candidates for an elusive target that\u2019s in pursuit by a growing number of companies.\n\nThe drugmaker is paying $250 million up front to acquire preclinical small molecules from LEO Pharma. Gilead will continue development of oral formulations of these potential drugs, while privately held LEO will develop topical versions, according to deal terms announced Saturday. Denmark-based LEO could receive up to $1.7 billion in additional payments, depending on the progress of the partnered research.\n\nLEO aims to inhibit the activity of IL-4 and IL-13, two signaling proteins that are validated targets associated with inflammation. Both proteins are already addressed by currently available injectable drugs, including Adbry, an FDA-approved IL-13-blocking antibody marketed by LEO for treating atopic dermatitis. But immunology drug research has been pursuing ways to block these targets with oral small molecules. Some of that research has focused on alternative ways of inhibiting inflammation driven by IL-4 and IL-13.\n\nSponsored Post A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Success A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.\n\nSignal transducer and activator of transcription factor 6, or STAT6, is a protein that\u2019s required for IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. LEO says preclinical research indicates that targeting STAT6 offers the potential to treat a broad population of patients with an oral alternative to injectable biologic drugs. The LEO drugs are small molecule inhibitors and targeted protein degraders.\n\nGilead\u2019s deal with LEO brings it into a burgeoning field of companies developing STAT6-targeting drugs. While Sanofi\u2019s blockbuster Dupixent, an antibody inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-13, is a cornerstone of the pharma giant\u2019s immunology strategy, the company also has designs on developing that product\u2019s successor. In 2023, Sanofi paid $125 million up front to begin a partnership with privately held Recludix Pharma, a preclinical developer of small molecule inhibitors of STAT6. Recludix is scheduled to present on Wednesday during the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.\n\nSanofi has spread its STAT6 bets via a partnership with Nurix Therapeutics, developer of targeted protein degraders. Nurix is also partnered with Gilead in an alliance that spans oncology and immunology. Yet another protein degrader biotech, Kymera Therapeutics, in October began a Phase 1 test of its STAT6 degrader, KT-621. Just before the end of 2024, Johnson & Johnson announced it had licensed global rights, excluding Japan, to Kaken Pharmaceutical\u2019s preclinical STAT6 inhibitor for autoimmune and allergic diseases.\n\nTo industry observers, the flurry of STAT6 dealmaking is encouraging for the field. Leerink Partners analyst Faisal Khurshid wrote in a note sent to investors on Sunday that as the fourth major licensing deal for STAT6, Gilead\u2019s collaboration with LEO underscores the growing strategic importance of this mechanism. An oral STAT6 degrader has the potential to be a category-defining medicine for T helper type 2 (Th2) inflammatory disorders, and could become an \u201coral Dupixent,\u201d Khurshid said.\n\nSponsored Post How to Improve Employee Benefits While Reducing Insurance Costs Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.\n\n\u201cWe see STAT6 as strategically important for companies aiming to develop small molecules for I&I (immunology & inflammation) indications and/or hold a position in Th2 inflammatory disorders (i.e., atopic dermatitis, asthma),\u201d Khurshid said.\n\nPhoto: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images",

            "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Sanofi India's (NSE:SANOFI) recent performance, when its stock has declined 15% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sanofi India is:\n\n77% = \u20b95.3b \u00f7 \u20b96.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every \u20b91 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20b90.77 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Sanofi India's Earnings Growth And 77% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Sanofi India has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. Despite this, Sanofi India's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 4.7%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or or poor allocation of capital.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Sanofi India's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 13% in the same period.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Sanofi India fairly valued compared to other companies? These might help you decide.\n\nIs Sanofi India Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nThe high three-year median payout ratio of 70% (that is, the company retains only 30% of its income) over the past three years for Sanofi India suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.\n\nIn addition, Sanofi India has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like Sanofi India has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

As more people venture into regions where endemic diseases are prevalent, the demand for vaccines to prevent illness intensifies, ensuring travellers remain protected during their journeys. This trend is particularly evident in regions with a high incidence of infectious diseases, where vaccination is often a prerequisite for entry or recommended by health authorities.\n\n\n\nGovernmental Health Initiatives: Governments around the world are increasingly implementing health policies that encourage or mandate vaccinations for travellers, particularly for diseases that pose substantial public health risks. These initiatives, often in the form of travel advisories or entry requirements, are significantly boosting the uptake of travel vaccines, contributing to public health safety and reducing the spread of infectious diseases across borders.\n\n\n\nAdvancements in Vaccine Technology: Technological advancements in vaccine development, particularly the creation of combination vaccines that protect against multiple diseases, are making vaccines more effective, safer, and convenient for travellers. These innovations are driving increased adoption, as they reduce the number of injections required and offer broader protection, thereby enhancing compliance among travellers who may otherwise avoid multiple vaccinations.\n\n\n\nMarket Challenges\n\n\n\nVaccine Hesitancy: Despite the availability and proven efficacy of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant challenge. Misinformation and fear of side effects can deter travellers from getting vaccinated, impacting market growth.\n\n\n\nRegulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex regulatory landscape for vaccines in different countries can delay market entry and increase costs for vaccine manufacturers. Regulatory requirements vary widely, making compliance a significant challenge.\n\n\n\nLogistical Challenges in Distribution: The distribution of vaccines, particularly to remote or underserved areas, can be challenging due to the need for cold chain storage and transportation. Ensuring that vaccines remain effective during transit is a critical concern.\n\n\n\nFuture Opportunities\n\n\n\nDevelopment of Universal Vaccines: Research into universal vaccines that offer protection against multiple strains or types of a virus presents a significant growth opportunity. Such vaccines could simplify travel health protocols and reduce the number of vaccinations required for international travel.\n\n\n\nTechnological Innovations in Vaccine Delivery: Innovations in vaccine delivery, such as needle-free options or oral vaccines, could increase vaccine uptake by making the vaccination process less invasive and more convenient for travellers.\n\n\n\nIncreasing Demand for Personalised Vaccination Plans: The growing demand for personalised healthcare extends to travel vaccines, with travellers seeking tailored vaccination plans based on their specific travel itinerary and health needs. This trend could drive the development of customised vaccine solutions.\n\n\n\nMarket Trends\n\n\n\nShift Towards Combination Vaccines: There is a growing trend towards the use of combination vaccines in the travel vaccines market. Combination vaccines offer protection against multiple diseases in a single dose, making them more convenient for travellers and increasing vaccination rates. This trend is particularly strong in regions where multiple vaccinations are required for safe travel, as it simplifies the vaccination process and reduces the number of injections needed.\n\n\n\nAdoption of Digital Health Passports: With the ongoing digitalisation of healthcare, digital health passports that track vaccination status are becoming more common. These digital tools allow travellers to easily prove their vaccination status, facilitating smoother international travel and enhancing compliance with travel health regulations.\n\n\n\nIncreased Investment in Vaccine Research and Development: Governments and private organisations are increasing their investments in vaccine research and development, particularly in response to emerging global health threats. This trend is expected to drive the introduction of new and more effective travel vaccines over the coming years.\n\n\n\nExpansion of Travel Health Clinics: The expansion of travel health clinics, particularly in urban centres and near major transportation hubs, is making it easier for travellers to access vaccines. These clinics often offer a one-stop solution for travel health needs, including vaccinations, travel advice, and health checks, contributing to the overall growth of the travel vaccines market.\n\n\n\nTravel Vaccines Market Segmentation\n\nMarket Breakup by Composition\n\nThe market is segmented by composition into mono vaccines and combination vaccines. Mono vaccines are designed to protect against a single disease and remain widely used for their specific targeting capabilities. However, combination vaccines are increasingly popular due to their convenience, offering protection against multiple diseases in one shot. This segment is expected to see significant growth as it caters to the needs of travellers requiring multiple vaccinations, streamlining the immunisation process.\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by Disease\n\nThe market segmentation of travel vaccines by disease includes hepatitis A, DPT, yellow fever, typhoid, hepatitis B, measles and mumps, rabies, meningococcal, and others. Hepatitis A and B vaccines are in high demand due to their effectiveness and the prevalence of these diseases in many travel destinations. Yellow fever and typhoid vaccines are also critical, especially for travellers to regions where these diseases are endemic. The 'others' category includes a range of vaccines for less common but equally important diseases, reflecting the diversity and complexity of travel health requirements.\n\n\n\nMarket Breakup by Region\n\nThe market segmentation by region includes North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. North America leads the market, driven by high travel rates and strong healthcare infrastructure. Europe follows closely, with a well-established system for travel vaccination. The Asia Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing outbound travel and rising awareness of travel-related health risks. Latin America the Middle East and Africa are emerging markets, with significant potential as international travel increases and healthcare infrastructure improves.\n\n\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\n\n\nThe competitive landscape of the global travel vaccines market includes leading companies such as GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Sanofi SA, and Pfizer Inc., which dominate the market with extensive vaccine portfolios and strong global distribution networks. CSL Limited, Bavarian Nordic AS, and F.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.\n\nHow Does Sanofi P/E Compare to Other Companies?\n\nThe P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued.\n\nSanofi has a better P/E ratio of 26.52 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 24.59 of the Pharmaceuticals industry. Ideally, one might believe that Sanofi Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued.\n\nIn summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes.",

Namandj\u00e9 Bumpus, who was effectively the FDA\u2019s second-in-command as principal deputy commissioner, left at the end of last year. Two other agency veterans, Douglas Throckmorton and Robert Temple, have also retired.\n\nCavazzoni joined the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research seven years ago and in 2021 was picked to serve at its head, replacing longtime leader Janet Woodcock. A physician by training, Cavazzoni treated and studied mood disorders at the University of Ottawa before going into the pharmaceutical industry, where she worked at Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Pfizer.\n\n\u201cLeaving CDER was an extremely difficult decision, but the time has come for me to be more present for my family, who have taken the backseat over the past few years due to the demands of my role and our critically important public health work,\u201d Cavazzoni wrote in her email to staff.\n\nWhile staff turnover between administrations is common, President-elect Donald Trump has signaled significant disruption could be in store for the agencies that regulate healthcare in the U.S. He has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, and pledged to let him \u201cgo wild\u201d on healthcare.\n\nIn comments on X and in interviews, Kennedy has made clear he views the FDA as in need of significant change, criticizing it as corrupt and claiming it has waged a \u201cwar on public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags,\u201d Kennedy wrote on X in October.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee for FDA commissioner, the Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary, is viewed as a more traditional choice, but he has also criticized the FDA, particularly for its handling of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cFDA has lost the trust of Americans, and has lost sight of its primary goal as a regulator,\u201d Trump wrote in a statement announcing his selection of Makary.\n\nBoth Kennedy and Makary need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate to take office.",

This addition allows infants to receive the vaccine free of charge at NIP-designated medical institutions nationwide.\n\nKorea\u2019s National Immunization Program has included Sanofi\u2019s 6-in-1 pediatric combination vaccine, Hexaxim. (Credit: Sanofi Korea)\n\nHexaxim is the first and only 6-in-1 combination vaccine in Korea, protecting against six diseases- -- diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), and hepatitis B. Unlike existing 5-in-1 vaccines, Hexaxim includes protection against hepatitis B, streamlining immunization schedules for infants.\n\nThe vaccine is recommended for infants who received a standalone hepatitis B vaccine at birth. It is administered in three doses at two, four, and six months of age.\n\nHowever, infants born to hepatitis B-positive mothers require separate doses of the 5-in-1 vaccine and a standalone hepatitis B vaccine to prevent vertical transmission.\n\nParents can confirm NIP-designated medical institutions and the vaccines offered at each location through the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency\u2019s (KDCA) website. Since vaccine availability may vary, confirming the institution's vaccine inventory before visiting is recommended.\n\nHexaxim is already part of essential immunization schedules in over 40 countries, including Europe, Canada, and Australia. The vaccine reduces the total number of injections from six (5-in-1 vaccine and standalone hepatitis B vaccine) to four, easing the burden on parents and infants.\n\nThis streamlined schedule also reduces delays and missed vaccinations, improving timely immunization rates.\n\nAlso, Hexaxim\u2019s ready-to-use liquid formulation eliminates the need for reconstitution, reducing preparation time and the risk of errors during administration. This enhances efficiency for healthcare providers while ensuring safer and quicker vaccination services for infants and their families.\n\n\u201cThe addition of Hexaxim to the NIP reflects its value in public health,\u201d Sanofi Korea Vaccines Head Christine Park said. \u201cThis will reduce the financial burden on parents and improve healthcare system efficiency.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sanofi has collaborated with SK bioscience to ensure the stable supply of Hexaxim to NIP-designated medical institutions across Korea. The two companies will also partner in distributing Hexaxim and promoting awareness of pediatric combination vaccines.",

            "content": "A team of health-care workers screen people for sleeping sickness in the village of Boffa in Guinea.Credit: Brent Stirton/Getty Images for DNDI\n\nLire en fran\u00e7ais\n\nWilfried Mutombo Kalonji wanted to devote his life to doing the most good possible. So, after graduating from medical school in 2004, he moved to Kasansa, a remote village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nPart of Nature Outlook: Neglected tropical diseases\n\nMutombo was the only physician serving Kasansa\u2019s 11,000 residents. Of all the maladies his patients presented with, late-stage human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, was among the diseases he dreaded the most. Caused by protozoan parasites, the disease is almost always fatal if left untreated. But the only medication available to Mutombo was melarsoprol \u2014 an arsenic-based drug, which was nearly as terrifying to his patients as the disease itself.\n\nTreatment with melarsoprol consists of a ten-day course of injections that people have described as feeling like \u201cfire in their veins\u201d. The drug\u2019s high toxicity also risks lives: 5\u201310% of those treated die during the process. Two of Mutombo\u2019s young male patients were among those that have succumbed. \u201cI could imagine what their parents were telling themselves,\u201d he says: \u201c\u2018This doctor has killed our son.\u2019\u201d\n\nMutombo never wanted to repeat that experience. So, in 2006, he began collaborating with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), an organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, that was working on eliminating the disease. Such efforts \u2014 spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by various public-health authorities in Africa \u2014 have resulted in a 97.5% reduction in sleeping-sickness cases over the past two decades.\n\nMutombo, who is now head of the DNDi\u2019s clinical operations team in the DRC, has co-led several clinical trials searching for safer, more effective treatments for sleeping sickness. One promising single-dose drug in development, acoziborole, could give physicians the ability not just to treat people with a confirmed infection, but also to interrupt transmission by treating people who might have been exposed to the parasites. In parallel to medical interventions, entomologists have developed better methods for reducing the population of tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), the insects that transmit the parasite to humans.\n\nThese efforts are showing signs of success. Fewer than 1,000 cases of sleeping sickness have been reported annually in Africa over the past seven years, down from a peak of almost 40,000 cases in 1998. In 2012, the WHO set a goal of stopping transmission of the form of the disease that occurs in western and central Africa by 2030. Seven countries have already reduced cases of sleeping sickness to less than one case per 10,000 residents, and several others are on the cusp of doing so. If these efforts succeed, \u201cit would be the first time we\u2019ve eliminated a fatal human disease from the planet without a vaccine\u201d, says Philippe Neau, head of the neglected tropical diseases programme at Foundation S in Paris \u2014 an organization funded by pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which produces most of the treatments for sleeping sickness.\n\nStill, a declaration of victory would be premature. Without constant vigilance, the disease has a track record of re-emerging \u2014 even in places where it was thought to have been wiped out. One reason is that the parasites have evolved to play a game of hide-and-seek with the immune system by constantly changing their \u2018surface coat\u2019 to evade antibodies. \u201cThere has been a lot of progress toward elimination, but if we stopped now, sleeping sickness would come back, and it could affect millions of people,\u201d says Gerardo Priotto, a medical officer at the WHO. \u201cThe tsetse fly is still there.\u201d\n\nA cryptic infection\n\nSleeping sickness is caused by two types of unicellular parasite: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Key differences exist between the sub-species. T. b. rhodesiense occurs in eastern and southern Africa, mainly in savannah ecosystems, and it can live in a range of wild and domestic animals. In humans, it causes a fast-acting disease that develops in weeks to months. T. b. gambiense, however, occurs mainly near water bodies in rural parts of western and central Africa. It causes around 90% of sleeping-sickness cases, and humans are its main known reservoir \u2014 a fact that means elimination could be possible.\n\nA health worker tests for sleeping-sickness parasites in a blood sample.Credit: Brent Stirton/Getty Images for DNDI\n\nMost of the efforts against sleeping sickness have focused on T. b. gambiense, which takes months or even years to cause acute symptoms, and diagnosis during the initial stages of infection can be challenging. Symptoms usually include a non-specific fever and headache, which can be misdiagnosed as malaria. While the person is given malaria treatments, T. b. gambiense grows in their system.\n\nWithout diagnostic tests, T. b. gambiense\u2019s identity becomes clear only once it makes its way to its final destination \u2014 the brain. It then begins to cause the unusual patterns of sleep for which the accompanying disease is named. \u201cThe person\u2019s rhythm of sleep gets broken into pieces,\u201d says Olaf Valverde, a physician at DNDi. \u201cThey can fall asleep during the day, just talking to someone, and have bouts of insomnia by night.\u201d\n\nOnce the density of parasites in the brain is high enough, the disease enters its second stage. Individuals show telltale neurological symptoms, including disinhibition, extreme talkativeness, exaggerated laughter and confusion. At this stage, without treatment \u201cthere\u2019s almost no escape\u201d, Priotto says. \u201cYou will die.\u201d\n\nBecause there is little commercial interest in developing treatments for neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness, the WHO approached two pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Sanofi in Paris and Bayer in Leverkusen, Germany \u2014 to find a charity-based path forward. From the start of the initiative, everyone knew that the arsenic-based treatment melarsoprol needed to be replaced with something safer. As Priotto says, \u201ca worse treatment is difficult to imagine.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, the DNDi was established to find new, better treatments for sleeping sickness and other neglected tropical diseases. After evaluating more than 700 candidate molecules from various sources, DNDi researchers identified fexinidazole, which had been discovered by a German chemical company in the 1970s but shelved because of a lack of commercial viability. DNDi and Sanofi collaborated to develop the treatment.\n\nClinical trials, which began in 2012, took longer than expected. War broke out in the Central African Republic, forcing the team to abandon a site there. Remote areas in the DRC \u2014 the country where more than half of all sleeping sickness cases now occur \u2014 were also a challenge to reach and to work in, Mutombo says. \u201cThe health facilities there are in bad states, without water, electricity, Internet or laboratories.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a decade of effort, in December 2018, fexinidazole for the T. b. gambiense strain of the disease received a \u2018positive opinion\u2019 from the European Medicines Agency \u2014 a form of approval for drugs that will be used outside the European Union \u2014 and started to be administered in March 2020. It now accounts for about 70% of sleeping-sickness treatments, Neau says. In December 2023, fexinidazole also gained approval for treating the acute strain of the disease found in east and southern Africa.\n\nAlthough a great improvement over melarsoprol, fexinidazole is still not ideal. For one, the drug is not as effective in the late stages of the disease as it is in the early stage. Moreover, individuals must take the drug for ten days. Side effects can include nausea and vomiting that is so severe that some people stop the medication. Ensuring that people take the full dose requires medical supervision. This means people must go to the nearest hospital, which can be hours away. Some countries also require someone to accompany the patient to the hospital, increasing the burden on the family. \u201cIn these rural areas, going to the hospital has a big impact,\u201d Mutombo says. \u201cThis disease makes poor people poorer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t obligate someone to go for treatment,\u201d says Jean-Mathieu Bart, an investigator based in Conakry, Guinea, with the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development in Marseille. \u201cSometimes it takes one year before we succeed in convincing the person to go for treatment, and during this year, they can contaminate other people in the village.\u201d\n\nWhile fexinidazole was being developed, DNDi researchers continued to look for something better. They found one promising molecule under patent by Anacor Pharmaceuticals (acquired by multinational pharmaceutical firm Pfizer in 2016), but it did not enter the brain in sufficient quantities. So they teamed up with scientists from Anacor, as well as Pace University in New York City and Scynexis, a biotechnology company in Jersey City, New Jersey, to increase the compound\u2019s ability to accumulate in the brain.\n\nThe resulting drug, acoziborole, is an oral medication. Valverde lauds it for its \u201cbeautiful feature\u201d of being a one-and-done treatment \u2014three tablets are taken in a single dose. Unlike fexinidazole, it also seems effective for people at all stages of the disease. Clinical trials in the DRC and Guinea have produced promising results1. At 18 months after treatment with the drug, around 96% of 167 people with late-stage sleeping sickness were still parasite-free, as were all 41 people with early- or intermediate-stage disease. The only notable side effects so far have been mild to moderate headaches. Based on the evidence, Priotto says, \u201cit\u2019s like a dream drug\u201d.\n\nWorking with Sanofi, Valverde and his colleagues hope to gain a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency by 2026, and to start treating people the following year. Once acoziborole is available, Bart adds, it \u201cwill be a game changer\u201d.\n\nKill the messenger\n\nPharmaceuticals are essential for eliminating sleeping sickness, but vector control is also a crucial tool. The good news here is that killing the tsetse flies that carry the parasite is straightforward because of their unusual reproductive strategy. Females mate just once and produce a single live-birthed larva every ten days. As a result, \u201cyou only have to kill something like 4% of the population per day to drive the population to extinction,\u201d says entomologist Stephen Torr at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK.\n\nThe Trypanosoma brucei parasite (blue) causes sleeping sickness.Credit: IKELOS GmbH/Dr. Christopher B. Jackson/SPL\n\nIt took entomologists a while, however, to work out how to lure the flies into a trap to kill them. The insects that transmit the less common T. b. rhodesiense parasite \u2014 the savannah tsetse fly \u2014 were not a major problem to bait because they are attracted to odours. But the riverine tsetse flies that are the vector for the more widespread T. b. gambiense have no such affinity to aromas, and proved much more elusive. Then in 2008, Torr and his colleagues ran a series of experiments2 and found that the flies are drawn to small blue objects.\n\nTorr and his colleagues first created a small target made of a blue cloth, about the size of a handkerchief, that they covered in insecticide. The flies circled the target \u2014 but only about 40% landed on it and were exposed to the insecticide. So the researchers added a parallel panel of very fine black net, also covered in pesticide. This design worked: flies drawn to blue targets collided with the netting, which they could not see, and then flew away having received a lethal dose of poison.\n\nEven after developing the \u201ctiny targets\u201d, as the researchers call them, it took several years for the importance of vector control to gain widespread acceptance. The WHO and other international medical teams saw vector control \u201cas very time-consuming and not cost-effective,\u201d Bart says.\n\nHe and his colleagues in Guinea persisted, however, and in 2012 they set up tiny targets in a coastal community affected by sleeping sickness. The method\u2019s effectiveness was unexpectedly confirmed when Ebola broke out in 2013. Violence against medical teams swept the country, driven by misconceptions that the virus was being brought to villages by health workers. Safety concerns caused sleeping-sickness testing and treatment efforts across Guinea to be put on hold.\n\nVector-control activities, however, continued unabated. When Bart and his colleagues were able to resume medical activities, they found that sleeping sickness had begun to increase in the country \u2014 from around 78 cases per year in 2013 to 139 cases in 2017. The exception, however, was the small area where vector control had been maintained. Cases there had remained low.\n\nResearch shows that tiny targets can \u201cmassively\u201d accelerate elimination of the disease, adds Inaki Tirados, a medical entomologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. In Chad, for example, where vector control was also initiated early, scientists estimated that it accounted for 70% of the decline in new sleeping-sickness cases between 2013 and 2015 (ref. 3). Although vector control is not helpful for people who have already been infected with T. b. gambiense, \u201cit is the only method that can provide protection from getting sleeping sickness\u201d, Torr says.\n\nForecasting the future\n\nJudging solely by case count, efforts to eliminate sleeping sickness caused by T. b. gambiense seem to have stalled (see \u2018Elimination of sleeping sickness is in sight\u2019). But the numbers reported are deceptive, Priotto says, because rather than reflecting the true level of disease transmission, they show the level of case-finding activities that result in diagnoses.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, many case-finding efforts ground to a halt, so sleeping-sickness case numbers, in turn, seem to have plummeted in 2020. And the increase in case numbers after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted represent greater efforts to find and treat instances of the disease, Priotto says. Many villages that used to have high levels of sleeping sickness are now transmission-free, and health-care authorities have been able to move on to other villages that they previously did not have the resources to access. \u201cEven if the numbers are in a plateau, elimination is advancing,\u201d Priotto says.\n\nSuccess should not be taken for granted, however. Civil unrest can disrupt progress. In the Central African Republic, for example, health-care workers have been unable to access a northern region for years because government-associated medical staff are at risk of attack from rebel groups. Separatist groups are also active in southwestern Cameroon, preventing essentially all sleeping-sickness control activities in the region.\n\nAnd the closer countries come to elimination, the more time, money and effort are needed to find and treat each remaining case \u2014 a phenomenon that risks \u2018donor fatigue\u2019, Bart says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to convince people that we need as much money to detect one case as we used to need to detect 10\u201320 cases.\u201d\n\nOne way to stretch elimination efforts is to spend money as wisely as possible. To that end, Kat Rock, a mathematical epidemiologist at the University of Warwick, UK, is leading a team of modellers to create tailored elimination strategies for five African countries. In the DRC, for example, where vector control is limited, Rock and her colleagues identified areas where tiny targets would probably be most effective for enhancing medical interventions4,5. As well as providing actionable insights for elimination efforts, modelling can also help to forecast how well elimination efforts are likely to fare. \u201cWe want to understand how long this very concerted effort for sleeping sickness will have to go on,\u201d Rock says.\n\nA blue \u2018tiny target\u2019 coated in insecticide is used to control populations of tsetse flies.Credit: Sophie Dunkley\n\nDespite this progress, however, the ultimate goal of vanquishing sleeping sickness permanently \u2014 known as eradication \u2014 remains elusive. Unknowns are numerous, but include whether the parasite might have an as-yet-undiscovered animal reservoir, or be able to persist in some healthy human carriers who never develop symptoms but remain infectious. Screening and diagnostic tools are imperfect, and the many obstacles of working in rural Africa make it unlikely that every case will ever be found and treated. \u201cIn this context,\u201d Priotto says, \u201cwe don\u2019t dare talk about eradication.\u201d",

Alloy is also eligible for tiered royalties on sales of any resulting products.\n\nThe partnership centres on Alloy\u2019s AntiClastic Antisense platform, which is designed to overcome limitations in existing antisense technologies by targeting RNA-level intracellular disease mechanisms. Alloy claims the platform improves a drug\u2019s therapeutic index and enables delivery of treatments to previously inaccessible targets.

(Nasdaq: VIGL), a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to harnessing the power of microglia for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, today highlighted 2024 corporate achievements and upcoming 2025 milestones.\n\n\u201c2024 was a year of strong operational execution, driven by the progress of our two TREM2 agonist programs, VG-3927 and iluzanebart, and a $40 million strategic investment from Sanofi,\u201d said Ivana Magov\u010devi\u0107-Liebisch, Ph.D., J.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Vigil. \u201cAdvancing these clinical programs requires both strong science and commitment, and we remain focused on delivering Phase 1 data on VG-3927 in the first quarter of 2025, and Phase 2 data on iluzanebart in the second quarter of 2025, both of which represent meaningful milestones for expanding our scientific insights and developing these programs into potential therapeutics.\u201d\n\n2024 Key Achievements\n\nIluzanebart, Monoclonal Antibody TREM2 Agonist:\n\nAnnounced clinical development strategy update following Type C Meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) where the Agency stated it was open to considering the accelerated approval pathway for iluzanebart in ALSP.\n\nCompleted enrollment of 20 patients for IGNITE Phase 2 clinical trial, exceeding the initially planned 15 patients.\n\nSurpassed enrollment of 50 participants in ILLUMINATE natural history study of ALSP. Findings from ILLUMINATE have provided critical insights on MRI and NfL biomarkers and continue to improve the overall understanding of ALSP disease pathophysiology and progression.\n\n\n\nVG-3927, Small Molecule TREM2 Agonist:\n\nReported interim data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG-3927 in healthy volunteers. These data demonstrated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile supported continued clinical development. Initiated dosing of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) cohort in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, including some participants who carry TREM2 or other disease-related variants, to explore the biomarker response of VG-3927 after a single dose.\n\nFDA removed the partial clinical hold on the Phase 1 clinical trial of VG-3927 based on a complete response submitted by the Company.\n\nPresented new preclinical data on the small molecule TREM2 agonist program at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference (AAIC) that highlighted its differentiated mechanism of action compared with antibody TREM2 agonists. These data demonstrated that Vigil\u2019s small molecules, including VG-3927, are fully brain penetrant, do not bind to sTREM2 resulting in more drug reaching the target, and also act as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) which amplifies the functional response within sites of pathology leading to greater horsepower for superior neuroprotection.\n\n\n\nCorporate:\n\nSecured a $40 million strategic investment from Sanofi to fund research and development activities. In connection with the equity investment, Vigil granted Sanofi the right of first negotiation (ROFN) for an exclusive license, grant or transfer of rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the Company\u2019s small molecule TREM2 agonist program, including its clinical candidate, VG-3927.\n\nstrategic investment from Sanofi to fund research and development activities. In connection with the equity investment, Vigil granted Sanofi the right of first negotiation (ROFN) for an exclusive license, grant or transfer of rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the Company\u2019s small molecule TREM2 agonist program, including its clinical candidate, VG-3927. Appointed Petra Kaufmann, M.D., M.S., F.A.A.N, as Chief Medical Officer to lead the Company\u2019s clinical, regulatory, and patient advocacy efforts.\n\n2025 Milestones\n\nOn track to report data in the first quarter of 2025 from the Phase 1 clinical trial of VG-3927, including single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose data from healthy volunteers, data from a single cohort of AD patients and data from an elderly patient cohort. Vigil expects to use these data to inform the development strategy for subsequent and larger trials evaluating VG-3927 in AD.\n\nFinal analysis from the IGNITE Phase 2 clinical trial, including all patients at 12 months dosed with either 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg of iluzanebart, is planned for the second quarter of 2025. The Company will pursue an accelerated approval pathway for iluzanebart in ALSP and expects to share an update on its progress when the final analysis is reported.\n\n\u201cBuilding on the momentum from 2024, we plan to report key data for both VG-3927 and iluzanebart in the first half of 2025. We expect these development milestones will further support our efforts to bring potentially transformative therapies to patients with ALSP and AD,\u201d concluded Dr. Magov\u010devi\u0107-Liebisch. \u201cLooking ahead, we aim to leverage our deep expertise in microglial biology to explore additional targets to treat other rare and common neurodegenerative diseases.\u201d\n\nAbout Vigil Neuroscience\n\nVigil Neuroscience is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for both rare and common neurodegenerative diseases by restoring the vigilance of microglia, the sentinel immune cells of the brain.

            "content": "This transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat we do as primary care clinicians is challenging: seeing people all day long and keeping up with the ever-changing evidence. It is also rewarding. We live in an amazing age where each year, we are privileged to witness incredible advances in medicine.\n\nI\u2019m Dr Neil Skolnik, and these are the highlights of important guidelines for primary care that came out during the past year.\n\nAsthma\n\nLet\u2019s start with asthma. The big change in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommendations for asthma care have to do with the recognition that even patients with mild asthma can have severe exacerbations. Thus, GINA no longer recommends that patients with mild asthma be treated with albuterol alone, but rather that an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) should be used whenever a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) is used. Patients with mild (step 1) asthma now have three choices. They can be treated with low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed (which is not a US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]\u2013approved approach), or as-needed low-dose ICS-albuterol, using budesonide-albuterol in one canister (now FDA approved). They can also choose to take ICS daily, using either albuterol or ICS-SABA as needed for symptoms.\n\nThe point to remember is that patients have fewer exacerbations when using an ICS-containing reliever medication. Per GINA, budesonide-albuterol is preferred over albuterol alone as reliever or rescue therapy to reduce the risk for exacerbations across all severities of asthma.\n\nChronic Kidney Disease\n\nNext, I\u2019ll touch on the high points of the KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. The explosion of knowledge about chronic kidney disease (CKD) over the past decade has been nothing short of phenomenal. We now have medicines that can slow the rate of decline in kidney function, help patients avoid dialysis, and decrease the elevated risk for heart disease in people with CKD.\n\nWe should screen people at high risk for CKD \u2014 patients with diabetes, certainly \u2014 and consider screening those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Screening should include a serum creatinine level and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( UACR).\n\nTo substantially slow the rate of decline in kidney function and lower the elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, good blood pressure control with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker is recommended, titrated to the highest or near-highest approved dose. Also recommended are the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The details about who should be prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor are important:\n\nOnce started, the SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued until dialysis is initiated, even if the eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\nFor patients with diabetes, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, is suggested for adults with type 2 diabetes, an eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and persistent albuminuria (> 30 mg/g) despite other standard-of-care therapies. Note that the FLOW trial of semaglutide in patients with diabetes and CKD was published after the guidelines were released, so it is not clear where semaglutide would fit in. The FLOW trial showed benefit on slowing progression of kidney disease and decreasing major cardiovascular events and the risk for death from any cause, all of which are important results.\n\nProstate Cancer Screening\n\nNext up, prostate cancer screening. It\u2019s important to recognize that many organizations \u2014 the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American College of Physicians, and others \u2014 have recommendations that do not all align. What they all agree on is the importance of shared decision-making because the risks and benefits of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening are not entirely clear. On one end of the spectrum are the AAFP recommendations, which do not recommend routinely discussing PSA-based screening if the patient does not request it.\n\nHere are particularly helpful recommendations in the American Urological Association guidelines:\n\nFor people with newly elevated PSA levels, clinicians should repeat PSA measurement in a few months before any further screening or diagnostic testing is done, because 25%-40% of elevated PSA levels are normal on retesting.\n\nStarting PSA screening for prostate cancer may begin for average-risk men at 45-50 years of age. For those at increased risk, screening should begin earlier, at 40-45 years of age. Note that the US Preventive Services Task Force does not make a separate recommendation for high-risk individuals.\n\nThen after that first screen, the interval for testing PSA is every 2-4 years from age 50-69, and stop screening around age 70.\n\nVitamin D Testing and Treatment\n\nOne of the most popular guidelines of the year was the Endocrine Society\u2019s guideline on vitamin D testing and treatment. All adults should get the Institute of Medicine\u2019s recommended amount of vitamin D (600 IU daily for those 50-70 years of age and 800 IU daily for those older than 80 years). For adults aged 18-74 years who do not have prediabetes, the guidelines suggest against routinely testing for vitamin D deficiency and against routine supplementation. For adults with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to reduce the risk for progression from prediabetes to diabetes by approximately 10%-15%.\n\nFor adults over age 75, it is a different story. Because about 20% of older adults have low vitamin D levels, and supplementation is safe, the guidelines suggest against testing vitamin D levels and recommend empirical vitamin D supplementation. The guidelines do not specify a specific dose of vitamin D, but based on the doses used in trials of adults aged 75 or older, I\u2019m going to suggest that a dose of 1000-2000 IU daily is a reasonable choice for older adults. In the prediabetes trials, a higher average dose was used, so a dose of 3000-4000 IU might make sense for this group.\n\nMigraine Management\n\nThe recommendation for first-line treatment of migraine headaches saw a big change this year. To put it simply, the American Headache Society now recommends calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) agents as a first-line option for preventive therapy in people with migraine headaches. Many clinical studies have shown CGRP-targeting therapies to be as or even more effective than traditional first-line agents such as tricyclics, beta-blockers, and topiramate at decreasing the number of migraine days per month and the decreasing the severity of migraine headaches.\n\nCGRPs are well tolerated and safe. They are also effective in individuals who have failed multiple other first-line therapies, so they can be used as first-line therapy in patients with difficult-to-treat migraine. Monoclonal antibody CGRPs are easy to use as a monthly subcutaneous injection. For a quick reference, see the table I put together on generic and brand names, as well as dosing and monthly cost. Pick one CGRP and get to know it. It\u2019s a useful therapy that patients appreciate.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s Diagnosis\n\nNext are the revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from the Alzheimer\u2019s Association Workgroup. Talk about a big change in the way we think about a disease. Until recently, AD was the diagnosis that remained after we ruled out other causes of dementia with blood tests and imaging. Moving forward, AD will be ruled in using blood-based biomarkers. The key principle that this guideline lays out is that AD is defined by its biology \u2014 neuropathologic changes in the brain characterized by deposition of amyloid and tau protein. A recent paper in JAMA showed that blood-based biomarkers, using the ratio of two tau proteins and two amyloid proteins, were accurate in identifying AD more than 90% of the time.\n\nOnce there is regulatory approval of the blood biomarkers, which is coming soon, our whole approach to the diagnosis of the cause of dementia will change. What will that look like? In addition to ordering an MRI to look for structural lesions and evidence of multi-infarct dementia, we will also be ordering blood tests to see if a person with mild cognitive impairment or dementia has AD.\n\nApoB and Cardiovascular Risk\n\nNext I want to talk about apolipoprotein B (apoB) and the Expert Clinical Consensus from the National Lipid Association that gives us guidance. ApoB is the main protein that is found on all atherogenic lipoproteins and predicts cardiovascular risk more accurately than LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C). Although it is often correlated with LDL-C, it can be discordant, and this is when it is most useful. This brings us to the two circumstances where apoB testing is helpful:\n\nRemember, this guideline does not suggest that the standard of care should be measurement of apoB in all patients, but rather that apoB can provide helpful information for decision making for specific patients and is most likely to be helpful in those with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance/ metabolic syndrome, or low HDL-C.\n\nUrinary Tract Infection\n\nA guideline on urinary tract infections (UTIs) from the WikiGuidelines group was published in JAMA Open Network. First, always put the results of a urinalysis into clinical perspective because it is an imperfect test. The sensitivity of leukocyte esterase is only about 80%, with even lower specificity. The sensitivity of nitrite on urinalysis is below 50%, meaning the test is negative more than half the time when someone actually has a UTI, so don\u2019t withhold treatment solely because the nitrite test is negative. The specificity of urine nitrite is greater than 90%, so if it is positive, the person has bacteria in the urine.\n\nFor healthy people with simple bladder infections, urine cultures are not necessary \u2014 just treat empirically. For uncomplicated cystitis, first-line treatment is nitrofurantoin for 5 days. Other first-line agents include trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 3 days; fosfomycin (oral) single dose; or a beta-lactam (most commonly a first-generation cephalosporin).\n\nIt is important to distinguish uncomplicated UTI from pyelonephritis, which requires a decision about inpatient vs outpatient treatment depending upon how sick the patient is. For pyelonephritis, always get a urine culture. For outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis, the guideline suggests that both TMP-SMX and first-generation cephalosporins are reasonable first-line agents, with fluoroquinolones being a reasonable choice as well. Ceftriaxone is a good choice for inpatient treatment.\n\nFor women with recurrent UTIs, consider doing something to decrease the rate of recurrence. That can be increasing water intake if the patient doesn\u2019t drink a lot, or encouraging cranberry juice intake. Methenamine hippurate is FDA-approved for prevention of UTIs. It works by releasing formaldehyde in the urine, which is bacteriostatic. You can also use antibiotic prophylaxis \u2014 postcoital or daily administration of TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin, which can decrease UTI recurrence by approximately 85%. For postmenopausal women, don\u2019t forget topical vaginal estrogen, which can lead to a 50%-90% reduction in the incidence of recurrent UTIs.\n\nThere have been many important changes and updates over the past year that further allow us to do amazing things for our patients. Medicine is truly one of mankind\u2019s greatest achievements, harnessing science to fight disease, improve health, and promote well-being.\n\nIn patients already treated with statins, in whom we are deciding whether treatment intensification is warranted. If the LDL-C is at goal and apoB is above threshold, treatment intensification may be considered.",

            "content": "Big pharma without trimming the fat\n\nOne of the largest holdings in the $37.9m (\u00a329.8m) Antipodes Global fund, which contains 75 stocks \u2013 is a large-cap pharma name which isn\u2019t dependent on popular weight-loss drugs.\n\nAlison Savas, investment director at Antipodes Partners, has high conviction in Sanofi, a leading immunology healthcare firm headquartered in France.\n\n\u201cIts strengths lie in that it does not face any patent risk this decade, it has a much lower exposure to US drug pricing risk than peers, a deep pipeline, a dominant vaccines business and a leading consumer healthcare business that it\u2019s in the process of monetising,\u201d Savas told Portfolio Adviser.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t all been smooth-sailing for the multinational company, however; Sanofi\u2019s share price fell by more than 20% last year after it pledged to increase its research and development (R&D) investing by 10% to \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.4bn) annually during 2024 and \u201925.\n\nSavas said prioritising pipeline development over short-term earnings growth \u201cspooked the market\u201d, although her team used this as an opportunity to increase the fund\u2019s exposure.\n\n\u201cCentral to Sanofi\u2019s investment thesis is a pharma portfolio that isn\u2019t facing patent cliffs. It has an emerging powerhouse on its hands with Dupixent, used to treat allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma, currently generating around \u20ac13bn in annual revenue and outperforming market expectations,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cDespite its size, Dupixent can see low double-digit growth per annum into the next decade due to greater penetration of existing indications, younger age groups, new geographies and a recent approval to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD (chronic bronchitis) \u2013 a large additional patient population.\n\n\u201cThis is not properly reflected in analyst forecasts,\u201d Savas said.\n\nWhat is even more appealing, according to the investment director, is that the company isn\u2019t solely dependent on the success of Dupixent. It also holds business of so-called \u201corphan drugs\u201d, used to treat rare diseases, which are typically high-cost but high-profit.\n\n\u201cCombined with exciting new launches, these account for an extra \u20ac7bn in revenue, growing at a high single-digit pace.\n\n\u201cOn top of this Sanofi has a full pipeline focused around its key areas of strength. Any positive readouts in 2025 will increase the market\u2019s confidence in the pipeline and vindicate the decision to pivot strategy. A solid balance sheet also leaves room for acquisitions to further bolster its pipeline.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Savas said Sanofi\u2019s \u20ac7.5bn vaccines business is growing faster than market expectations.\n\n\u201cVaccines are a sticky, long-duration business with high barriers to entry due to stringent approval requirements and scale manufacturing. Sanofi is one of three scale providers of the flu vaccine, with polio and meningitis vaccines also in its stable.\n\n\u201cParticularly promising is the new RSV vaccine, which targets a virus that can cause severe respiratory infections, particularly in children. Expanded production capacity positions Sanofi to meet rising demand, adding another growth driver.\u201d\n\nFinally, she referred to Opella \u2013 Sanofi\u2019s consumer health business \u2013 which recently attracted a \u20ac16bn private equity deal, with Sanofi retaining a 48% stake. The division predominantly offers household-name, over-the-counter treatments and supplements.\n\n\u201cOnce finalised, the transaction could unlock capital for share buybacks or strategic investments \u2013 moves likely to be rewarded by the market,\u201d Savas said.\n\n\u201cAt 12x earnings, with earnings forecast to grow around 10% per annum, there\u2019s a lot to like about Sanofi. While the share price has regained almost all it lost on last year\u2019s R&D announcement, there are multiple catalysts coming over the next 12 to 24 months that can drive the shares higher.\u201d\n\nHandbags and gladrags\n\nLuxury goods companies such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al in cosmetics and LVMH in fashion have proven resilient despite a global deceleration in consumer spending globally, according to Ben Peters, fund manager of the Evenlode Global Income fund.\n\nBut while revenue for the likes of these names has continued to rise, growth has still slowed on a relative basis, which the manager said has led markets to mark down the share prices of some firms \u201cquite significantly\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have responded by growing these positions over time. We have increased L\u2019Or\u00e9al from 2.7% of the portfolio at the start of the year to 3.8%, and LVMH from 2.8% to 3.3%,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs their stock prices are down by 20% and 13%, respectively, in sterling terms over the year so far, valuations look good in an absolute and a relative sense.\u201d\n\nPeters said famous fashion houses stand the test of time and avoid the cyclicality of lower-budget brands.\n\nBecause luxury brands are perceived to be higher quality, more durable and therefore more valuable than their non-luxury counterparts, the manager believes they offer \u201cresilience in the event of an economic downturn\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have held LVMH for some time, and Richemont has also recently been under our microscope although has not yet made it into our investable universe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth companies are \u2018houses of brands\u2019, in other words a collection of well-diversified luxury businesses serving multiple end markets. For example, half of LVMH\u2019s income derives from fashion and leather, with the other half coming from perfumes, watches and alcoholic beverages, among others.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Richemont focuses predominantly on luxury jewellery and watches, with Cartier one of its leading brands, although it also has a smaller segment offering luxury clothing and apparel.\n\n\u201cRichemont operates somewhere between LVMH and Herm\u00e8s in terms of the tier of luxury goods it sells,\u201d Peters explained. \u201cIts jewellery brands and watch portfolio is undoubtedly in the very top tier of luxury goods, by both price and reputation. Its soft luxury brands, on the other hand, may not be quite as high tier when compared with their rivals in the space, and they are getting out of the online market business by selling Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP), an acquisition that never really got going.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the jewellery segment of luxury remains quite fragmented, providing opportunities for further consolidation where, YNAP aside, they have historically proven to be shrewd operators in M&A.\u201d\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, the manager is positive on the prospects for the luxury segment.\n\n\u201cOn balance it seems unlikely that high-net-worth and aspirational wealthy consumers will eschew handbags and gladrags any time soon. Exactly where around the world the growth is driven from may change though, making a multinational approach appealing.\n\n\u201cWhile consumer spending could remain soft in the short term, the valuations at which some luxury companies are trading relative to history offsets these challenges.\u201d\n\nLearning curve\n\nEducation has long been preached as an investment in the next generation by parents and teachers alike, and for Steven Tredget, partner at Oakley Capital, it\u2019s a valuable part of the portfolio.\n\n\u201cEducation is a subscription,\u201d said Tredget. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last things you will change, if you can avoid changing.\u201d\n\nFrom an investment perspective, this means a steady stream of income that is able to withstand economic wobbles. Tredget saw the opportunity to combine the longstanding success of education with technology, by investing in the mainly online university IU Group.\n\nThe German private university was founded in 2000 and targets a different group of students than a traditional university. \u201cThe average age of an IU group student is 27, and 70% of them do not come from a family background of higher education,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in work or have families, and so they are looking to study on terms that suit them. These are highly modular degrees, so you can create one to suit you. Often people choose professional-type bachelors based on the fact they\u2019re already working and want something quite specific.\u201d\n\nThe university is now the largest and fastest-growing in Germany, with more than 140,000 students enrolled. Tredget believes some of this success is due to the business model, which is not focused on research or attracting international students, but on offering a service to its consumer.\n\n\u201cThis is like any customer service. It\u2019s asking what customers value and focusing on that output. What they typically value is the outcomes of degrees,\u201d Tredget said.\n\n\u201cThe average salary increases by 20%, and now their degree time is shortening as well.\u201d\n\nRecently, this has been aided by the launch of an AI teaching assistant, called Syntea, which has cut the time it takes to complete a degree by almost a quarter.\n\n\u201cStudents will ask 10 times more questions of Syntea than they would a physical professor, because she\u2019s always available. Second, they\u2019re not embarrassed to ask the stupid questions, and so Syntea learns much more about the student,\u201d Tredget said.\n\nOakley first invested in IU Group in 2018, when the university was operating at a much smaller scale. When the investment came to fruition, it was too large for Oakley to remain the sole control investor. Oakley now has the holding in a continuation vehicle alongside a group of other investors.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that\u2019s not uncommon for Oakley, which invests primarily in companies that are not yet large enough to be considered by large-scale private equity firms. Tredget said the firm often works with companies that are diving into the world of private equity for the first time, with some deals taking years to build trust with the owners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much hassle for the larger firms to come down that far,\u201d Tredget said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to find much competition. Three quarters of our deals are outside the auction process, so they\u2019re a bilateral conversation between us and the founder.\u201d\n\nThis article first appeared in the December issue of Portfolio Adviser magazine",

Kite Pharma, Inc. from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \u2013 have called into question the validity of broad antibody patent claims, leading some commentators to declare the death of the antibody genus claim.1\n\nIn the aftermath of those cases, some practitioners have suggested means-plus-function claiming as one strategy to obtain antibody claims that are broader in scope than the specific antibodies provided in the application as filed. This previously untested strategy cleared a first hurdle in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) decision in Ex parte Chamberlain, where the USPTO held that a patent specification need not describe the \u201cequivalents\u201d to an antibody claimed in means-plus-function format.\n\nPatent at issue and its initial rejection\n\nEx parte Chamberlain involved Xencor Inc.\u2019s Patent Application No. 16/803,690, which included the following claim to an antibody in means-plus-function2 format:\n\n\u201c9. A method of treating a patient by administering an anti-C5 antibody comprising:\n\na) means for binding human C5 protein; and\n\nb) an Fc domain comprising amino acid substitutions M428L/N434S as compared to a human Fc polypeptide, wherein numbering is according to the EU index of Kabat, wherein said anti-C5 antibody with said amino acid substitutions has increased in vivo half-life as compared to said antibody without said substitutions.\u201d\n\nThe specification described a \u201c5G1.1\u201d antibody as capable of binding to the C5 protein. Murine and humanized versions of the \u201c5G1.1\u201d antibody were known in the art, but the specification did not indicate which it was referring to and did not provide an amino acid sequence for either. The specification did not identify any other antibodies that were capable of binding to the C5 protein or were otherwise \u201cequivalent\u201d to 5G1.1.\n\nThe USPTO examiner rejected this claim under 35 US Code \u00a7 112 as lacking adequate written description because the specification\u2019s disclosure of the 5G1.1 anti-C5 antibody was insufficient to identify a particular structure that correlates to \u201cmeans for binding human C5.\u201d Xencor subsequently appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the USPTO.\n\nThe PTAB found:\n\nThat \u201cmeans for binding human C5 protein\u201d lacked sufficient written description because the specification did not disclose \u201csufficient structure\u201d corresponding to the claimed function of \u201cbinding human C5 protein.\u201d\n\nThe specification\u2019s disclosure of the 5G1.1 antibody insufficient because \u201cthe claimed \u2018means for\u2019 is not restricted by the [s]pecification to this specific antibody species.\u201d\n\nThat the term was indefinite because a skilled artisan would not know whether 5G1.1 referred to the mouse or humanized antibody and, thus, could not identify sufficient structure for the claimed means.\n\nThe PTAB subsequently denied a request for rehearing, and Xencor filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit.\n\nLate in 2023, the USPTO filed a motion requesting an administrative remand of the proceeding to the USPTO so an Appeals Review Panel (ARP) could clarify the USPTO\u2019s position on the proper analysis of \u201cmeans-plus function claims in the field of biotechnology, and particularly in the antibody art\u201d and \u201cissue a revised decision.\u201d The Federal Circuit granted that motion on January 23, 2024, and the ARP issued its decision on May 21, 2024.\n\nARP\u2019s decision\n\nIn its decision, the ARP considered the PTAB\u2019s written description and indefiniteness rejections of the means-plus-function claim 9.3 The ARP first found \u201cthat the phrase \u2018means for binding human C5 protein\u2019 is a means-plus-function limitation subject to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 \u00b6 6.\u201d The ARP further found that claimed function was \u201cbinding human C5 protein\u201d and that the 5G1.1 antibody was the sole structure disclosed in the specification that performs the claimed function.\n\nOn the indefiniteness rejection, the ARP found that a person of ordinary skill would have understood \u201c5G1.1\u201d to refer to two related antibodies: the original mouse 5G1.1 antibody and a humanized version of the mouse antibody, known as ecluzimab, which were described in the specification. Thus, the ARP found the term to be definite and withdrew the PTAB\u2019s rejection on indefiniteness grounds.\n\nWith respect to the written description rejection, the ARP noted that a means-plus-function claim literally covers structures described in the specification and equivalents thereof, but it rejected the PTAB\u2019s reasoning that equivalents of the structure need to be described in the specification. The ARP reasoned that \u00a7 112 \u00b66 explicitly distinguished between the \u201ccorresponding structure \u2026 described in the specification\u201d and \u201cequivalents.\u201d emphasis added). The ARP noted that while \u00a7 112 \u00b66 specifically states that the corresponding structure must be described in the specification, it \u201cdoes not state that the [s]pecification must also describe the equivalents of that structure.\u201d The ARP further cited Supreme Court and Federal Circuit case law that \u201csupports reading \u2018equivalents\u2019 to cover structures, materials or acts beyond what is explicitly described in the [s]pecification.\u201d Accordingly, the ARP concluded that it was not necessary for the specification to describe equivalents of 5G1.1 to meet the written description requirement.\n\nAs a result, the ARP disagreed with the PTAB and concluded that the claim limitation \u201cmeans for binding human C5 protein\u201d met both the written description requirement of 35 USC \u00a7 112 \u00b6 1 and the definiteness requirement of 35 USC \u00a7 112 \u00b6 2.4\n\nImplications of ARP\u2019s decision\n\nAlthough Xencor\u2019s means-plus-function claims remain rejected for lack of written description on other grounds, the ARP decision suggests that the use of this format might provide applicants with a chance to obtain broader antibody claims that could potentially cover those antibodies specifically recited in a specification as well as \u201cequivalent\u201d antibodies. However, it is unclear how the USPTO will view the use of means-plus-function language in composition of matter antibody claims, as opposed to the method of treatment claims presented in Xencor. In addition, it remains to be seen whether the federal courts will abide by this decision and, if they do, how they will determine what antibodies are deemed to be \u201cequivalent\u201d to antibodies explicitly described in a specification. Moreover, it is important to note that the ARP\u2019s decision only addressed the written description of means-plus-function claims and did not consider enablement.\n\nWhile we wait to see what comes next, patent applicants should consider including means-plus-function claims when drafting new antibody applications.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "Dublin, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Semaglutides Market Report 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThis Semaglutides market report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market. It traces the market's historic and forecast market growth by geography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size has grown rapidly in recent years. It will grow from $20.54 billion in 2023 to $23.07 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3%. The growth during the historic period can be attributed to lifestyle changes leading to higher diabetes prevalence, increased investment in research and development, rising healthcare expenditure, the expansion of pharmaceutical companies into developing regions, and growing acceptance of injectable therapies.\n\n\n\nThe semaglutides market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years. It will grow to $36.87 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to the increasing global prevalence of diabetes, rising awareness about diabetes management and treatment, growing demand for effective therapies with fewer side effects, supportive government initiatives and policies for diabetes treatment, and an aging population contributing to higher diabetes incidence.\n\nMajor trends expected during this period include the integration of digital health technologies, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, increased demand for telemedicine and remote monitoring, development of wearable technology, the use of 3D printing, and the application of blockchain for supply chain management.\n\n\n\nThe rising prevalence of diabetes is anticipated to drive the expansion of the semaglutide market in the coming years. Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. The increasing incidence of diabetes is largely attributed to factors such as rising obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and poor dietary habits. Semaglutide plays a key role in diabetes management by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which stimulates insulin secretion, reduces glucagon release, and slows gastric emptying, thereby helping to lower blood glucose levels and support weight loss.\n\nFor example, in November 2021, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), a Belgium-based non-profit organization, reported that approximately 537 million people globally are living with diabetes. This number has been steadily increasing, with the IDF projecting that by 2.04 trillion people will have diabetes, representing a 46% rise. As a result, the growing prevalence of diabetes is driving the expansion of the semaglutide market.\n\n\n\nKey players in the semaglutide market are focusing on developing products such as GLP-1 receptor analogues to enhance the effectiveness of treatments for diabetes and obesity, improve patient adherence, and reduce side effects through advanced delivery systems and personalized medicine approaches. A GLP-1 receptor analogue is a synthetic peptide that mimics the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases insulin secretion and regulates blood sugar levels in diabetes management.\n\nFor instance, in January 2022, Novo Nordisk India, an India-based pharmaceutical company, launched oral semaglutide, marking a significant advancement in diabetes treatment. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor analogue (GLP-1 RA) traditionally available only as an injection, was developed in an oral form for the first time. This oral version combines semaglutide with an absorption enhancer known as SNAC, which protects the medication from degradation in the stomach and enhances its absorption.\n\n\n\nIn May 2024, Novo Holdings, a Denmark-based life sciences company, acquired Catalent for $16.5 billion. This strategic acquisition aims to strengthen Novo Holdings' portfolio by incorporating Catalent's expertise in drug delivery technologies, biologics, and gene therapies, thereby bolstering its position in the global healthcare market. Catalent, Inc. is a US-based company involved in the production of semaglutide.\n\n\n\nNorth America was the largest region in the semaglutides market in 2023. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the semaglutides market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa. The countries covered in the semaglutides market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA, Canada, Italy, Spain.\n\nSome of the major companies profiled in this Semaglutides market report include:\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\nRoche Holding AG\n\nMerck & Co.

            "content": "The FDA ended 2024 with a flurry of year-end decisions, capping off a productive year that saw 55 novel approvals. This list includes several potentially practice-changing drugs, including Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s Cobenfy, the first new mechanism of action for schizophrenia in over three decades, and Sanofi and Regeneron\u2019s blockbuster therapy Dupixent, which in September 2024 became the first biologic approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nLast year, the FDA also greenlit the industry\u2019s first-ever treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in Madrigal Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Rezdiffra, and introduced a much-needed alternative anti-amyloid treatment option for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Eli Lilly\u2019s Kisunla.\n\nThe gene therapy space also saw several key approvals in 2024, including Pfizer\u2019s Beqvez, indicated for hemophilia B, and PTC Therapeutics\u2019 Kebilidi, which is used for the treatment of L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiencyand is the first direct-to-brain gene therapy cleared by the FDA.\n\nLooking ahead, the FDA is expected to deliver several key verdicts that could shape the industry\u2014and clinical practice\u2014in profound ways. Here are BioSpace\u2019s five most anticipated regulatory decisions in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nBiogen and Eisai\u2019s Leqembi\n\nIndication: Intravenous maintenance for early Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nPDUFA: January 25\n\nAmid a disappointing launch\u2014and equally underwhelming sales\u2014Biogen and Eisai are awaiting an FDA approval for the monthly intravenous maintenance regimen of their Alzheimer\u2019s disease therapy Leqembi (lecanemab). The regulator\u2019s final word is due on January 25.\n\nLeqembi, the first anti-amyloid antibody Alzheimer\u2019s drug to win the FDA\u2019s traditional approval, is currently indicated as an intravenous medication administered once every two weeks in approximately hour-long infusion sessions. Under the proposed monthly regimen, the interval between Leqembi doses can be stretched to one month in patients who complete an initial bi-weekly initiation phase\u2014though the exact duration of Leqembi initiation has yet to be determined, according to Biogen and Eisai.\n\nAs per the partners, monthly maintenance is designed to help maintain therapeutic levels of Leqembi in the body in order to suppress toxic protofibrils, which otherwise could result in nerve damage and brain injury even after the clearance of amyloid-beta clumps.\n\nThe companies are backing their application with modeling results using data from the Phase IIb Study 201 and its related open-label extension study. The models also include data from the Phase III Clarity AD and its open-label extension phase.\n\nBiogen and Eisai are also advancing a subcutaneous injection formulation of Leqembi. In August 2024, Eisai noted that the partners had initiated a rolling Biologics License Application for injectable Leqembi and expect approval by March 2026.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report in November 2024, Eisai lowered its full fiscal year sales forecast for Leqembi to $280 million from its previous guidance of approximately $370 million. Analysts from various firms said at the time that Leqembi\u2019s U.S. launch so far has been disappointing and fraught with various infrastructure challenges.\n\nStill, demand for Leqembi appears to be strong and growing, with Biogen and Eisai touting around 6,000 patients waiting to be initiated on the anti-amyloid therapy, which could translate to future growth once the companies address infrastructure and administrative challenges.\n\nAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Dato-DXd\n\nIndication: Metastatic, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer\n\nPDUFA: January 29\n\nBy January 29, the FDA is expected to have released its decision regarding AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Biologics License Application (BLA) for their antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), which the partners are proposing for the treatment of a type of breast cancer.\n\nResults are mixed for Dato-DXd. In the Phase III TROPION-Breast01 study\u2014which the companies are using to back the BLA\u2014the investigational ADC lowered the risk of death or disease progression by 37% versus the investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy, according to an October 2023 readout. At the time, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo called this effect \u201cstatistically significant and clinically meaningful.\u201d\n\nHowever, a follow-up data drop in September 2024 showed Dato-DXd was unable to significantly boost overall survival in the study. TROPION-Breast01 enrolled patients with inoperable or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors were HR-positive and either HER2-negative or HER2-low.\n\nAs for safety, TROPION-Breast01 found Dato-DXd to be well-tolerated overall, with a better adverse event profile than chemotherapy. The most common grade 3 or higher side effects included neutropenia, fatigue and anemia.\n\nDato-DXd is an ADC designed to target the TROP2 protein, which is highly expressed in several cancers. This binding affinity allows Dato-DXd to deliver its exatecan derivative payload directly to the target cells, triggering their death.\n\nAside from breast cancer, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are also testing Dato-DXd in non-small cell lung cancer, for which the ADC likewise failed to yield significant overall survival improvements in September 2024.\n\nVertex\u2019s Suzetrigine\n\nIndication: Moderate-to-severe acute pain\n\nPDUFA: January 30\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is advancing a non-opioid analgesic, dubbed suzetrigine, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. The FDA\u2019s verdict is due on January 30.\n\nSuzetrigine is an orally available pain signal inhibitor that selectively targets the NaV1.8 voltage-gated sodium channel, a genetically validated pain target that is typically found on peripheral neurons. NaV1.8 is believed to play a role in sensing pain and transmitting signals back to the central nervous system.\n\nVertex is backing suzetrigine with two Phase II and three Phase III studies, including the NAVIGATE 1 and NAVIGATE 2 trials, which looked at the analgesic efficacy of the drug candidate in patients who had undergone bunionectomy and abdominoplasty, respectively.\n\nFull data from these two late-stage studies, presented in October 2024 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, showed that suzetrigine monotherapy improved pain scores by 48.4 points after a tummy tuck. In patients undergoing the toe procedure, suzetrigine lowered pain scores by 29.3 points. Both treatment effects were statistically significant versus placebo.\n\nAt the time of the readout, analysts appeared to be torn over suzetrigine. BMO Capital Markets said that the presentation \u201creaffirms our confidence in the strength of suzetrigine\u2019s profile in acute pain,\u201d while William Blair noted that while suzetrigine \u201chas a strong argument for inclusion in the market,\u201d its \u201cpricing remains a point of investor contention.\u201d\n\nIf approved, suzetrigine will represent the first new drug class for acute pain in more than two decades, according to Vertex.\n\nAlnylam\u2019s Amvuttra\n\nIndication: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy\n\nPDUFA: March 23\n\nOn the heels of BridgeBio\u2019s recently approved Attruby is Alnylam\u2019s Amvuttra, which the Massachusetts-basedbiotech is hoping to expand into transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\n\nAmvuttra, which is currently indicated for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, is an RNA interference treatment that works by knocking down mutant and wildtype TTR mRNA, leading to an overall decrease in protein levels in the serum. Through this mechanism, Amvuttra also lowers TTR deposits in various organs, including the heart, that would otherwise give rise to the various symptoms of cardiomyopathy, including the stiffening of cardiac walls.\n\nTo support its ATTR-CM bid, Alnylam is using data from the Phase III HELIOS-B study, which found that Amvuttra had \u201cfavorable effects\u201d on survival, cardiovascular events, functional capacity and quality of life in ATTR-CM patients, according to the biotech\u2019s press announcement of the FDA\u2019s acceptance of its supplemental New Drug Application. A presentation at the 2024 American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions showed that Amvuttra treatment led to a 28% drop in the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events.\n\nThe FDA is expected to release its verdict on March 23.\n\nIf approved, Amvuttra will be the first RNA interference therapeutic for ATTR-CM, in contrast to BridgeBio\u2019s Attruby and Pfizer\u2019s Vyndaqel and Vyndamax, which are TTR stabilizers.\n\nSanofi\u2019s Fitusiran\n\nIndication: Hemophilia A or B\n\nPDUFA: March 28\n\nTo challenge the increasingly popular gene therapy approach to hemophilia, Sanofi is advancing fitusiran, an investigational small interference RNA therapy. The pharma is seeking approval for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A and B patients, regardless of their inhibitor status. The FDA\u2019s decision is due on March 28.\n\nIn support of fitusiran\u2019s FDA bid are data from the ATLAS clinical development program. In April 2023, Sanofi announced publications in The Lancet and The Lancet Hematology touting encouraging late-stage results for the siRNA candidate.\n\nOne of these studies, dubbed ATLAS-INH, focused on patients with inhibitors and found that 66% of fitusiran-treated participants hit zero monthly bleeding episodes, as compared with 5% of control counterparts who were given an on-demand bypassing agent. The other trial, named ATLAS A/B, enrolled patients without inhibitors, of whom 51% had zero monthly bleeds after fitusiran treatment, versus 5% of comparators treated with on-demand clotting factors.\n\nTaken together, both studies showed that prophylactic fitusiran could reduce the annualized bleeding rate by 90% versus their respective control arms, according to Sanofi.\n\nIf approved, fitusiran will introduce a new modality of treatment to a therapeutic space that is increasingly being addressed with gene therapies. Leading the charge is BioMarin\u2019s Roctavian, which became the first FDA-approved gene therapy for hemophilia A in June 2023. It works by restoring the body\u2019s ability to produce the blood-clotting protein factor VIII.\n\nPfizer is taking a similar approach to hemophilia A with its investigational gene therapy giroctocogene fitelparvovec. In July, the candidate aced its Phase III trial, maintaining over 5% factor VIII activity in 84% of treated patients at 15 months. In February, the pharma won the FDA\u2019s approval for its hemophilia B gene therapy Beqvez.",

            "content": "Investors often hold blue-chip stocks at the core of their portfolios. That makes sense. After all, blue-chip companies are leaders in their industries. Their names are familiar to investors.\n\nWhat are blue-chip stocks?\n\nBlue-chip stocks are from companies that are large, well-established, and financially sound. These companies have strong brand names and reputations, and they generate dependable earnings. Blue-chip companies usually boast consistent dividends and are often considered to be less risky, given their financial stability.\n\nHowever, investors may differ in how they define blue-chip companies. Some investors demand that a blue-chip stock be included in a particular index, such as the ASX 20 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Others may only include dividend-paying companies on their lists of blue-chip stocks. Still others may have specific market-capitalisation thresholds for blue-chip companies.\n\nThe companies on Morningstar\u2019s list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term share a few qualities:\n\nThe stocks are from companies included on Morningstar\u2019s list of the Best Companies to Own for 2024. Companies on this list have wide Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings (see end of article for definitions) and predictable cash flows, and they are run by management teams that make smart capital allocation decisions.\n\nThese stocks look undervalued, which means they\u2019re trading below Morningstar\u2019s fair value estimates.\n\nTheir market caps top $100 billion.\n\n10 best US blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term\n\nThese are the largest firms by market cap on Morningstar\u2019s Best Companies to Own list whose stocks were at least 14% undervalued as of 6 January 2025.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev BUD Pfizer PFE Roche RHHBY Nike NKE Nestle NSRGY Sanofi SNY Danaher DHR Merck MRK Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY\n\nHere\u2019s a little bit about each of these blue-chip stocks for the long term.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev BUD\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $105 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.55\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 1.66%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Beverages\u2014Brewers\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev is the most undervalued company on our list of best blue-chip stocks to buy. It has built a vast global scale and regional density through past acquisitions like Grupo Modelo and SABMiller. The brewer\u2019s strategy is to buy brands with a promising growth platform, expand distribution, and ruthlessly squeeze costs from the business, observes Morningstar analyst Verushka Shetty. \u201cAB InBev has one of the strongest cost advantages in our consumer defensive coverage and is among the most efficient operators,\u201d she adds. The brewer\u2019s free cash flow conversion has been consistently higher than peers\u2019 in recent years, but it needs to continue to deleverage its balance sheet to reduce its earnings volatility. AB InBev stock trades 45% below our fair value estimate of $90 per share.\n\nPfizer PFE\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $143 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.60\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 6.65%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nPfizer is the first of seven healthcare companies that made our list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy, and it offers the highest trailing yield of the group. A household name among drug manufacturers, Pfizer\u2019s stock is currently trading at a 40% discount to its fair value estimate. The firm has strong cash flows generated from a basket of diverse drugs, says Morningstar strategist Karen Andersen. Further, the company\u2019s large size confers significant competitive advantages in developing new drugs. We expect steady growth until 2028 when patent losses will likely increase, but pipeline advancements hold the potential to mitigate pressures. We think Pfizer stock is worth $42 per share.\n\nRoche RHHBY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $231 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.64\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.80%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nRoche stock trades 36% below our fair value estimate of $55 per share. The company\u2018s drug portfolio and industry-leading diagnostics provide significant competitive advantages and underpin our wide economic moat rating, says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. \u201cThis Swiss healthcare giant is in a unique position to guide healthcare into a safer, more personalised, and more cost-effective endeavour,\u201d she notes. With its biologics focus and innovative pipeline, we expect Roche to continue to achieve growth as its blockbuster drugs face competition.\n\nNike NKE\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $115 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.66\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 1.96%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Footwear and Accessories\n\nNike is one of only three nonhealthcare companies on our list of best blue-chip stocks. The largest athletic footwear brand in all major categories and all major markets, Nike dominates categories like running and basketball with popular shoe styles. We view Nike as the leader of the athletic apparel market and believe it will overcome current challenges, such as uneven demand for sportswear in key markets, argues Morningstar senior analyst David Swartz. Nike\u2019s consumer plan is led by its Triple Double strategy to double innovation, speed, and direct connections to consumers. Although its recovery in China has been slow due to economic conditions, native competition, and a political controversy, we still believe Nike has a great opportunity for revenue growth there and in other emerging markets. Nike stock trades at a 34% discount to our fair value estimate of $117 per share.\n\nNestle NSRGY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $215 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.71\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.96%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Packaged Foods\n\nNestle is the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the world by sales. Its diverse product portfolio includes brands such as Nestle, Nescafe, Perrier, Pure Life, and Purina. Nestle faces competition from local operators, and past missteps have caused the firm to miss out on or be late to the latest consumer trends. However, current management has reversed past trends, says Morningstar analyst Diana Radu. Aside from structural cost-cutting efforts, the management team has successfully put a lot of weight on reinvigorating growth through active portfolio management, resetting legacy businesses, and further investment in high-growth categories (coffee, pet care, water, and nutrition). Nestle stock trades 29% below our fair value estimate of $116 per share.\n\nSanofi SNY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $117 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.77\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 4.44%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nSanofi\u2019s wide lineup of branded drugs and vaccines and robust pipeline create strong cash flows and a wide economic moat. Growth of existing products and new product launches should help offset upcoming patent losses, says Morningstar senior analyst Jay Lee. Sanofi\u2019s existing product line boasts several top-tier drugs, including immunology drug Dupixent. A history of acquisitions and robust cash flow from operations mean Sanofi could take advantage of further growth opportunities through external collaborations. We expect the firm\u2019s acquisition focus on immunology drugs and rare disease drugs will continue following several deals in this area. Sanofi stock trades 23% below our fair value estimate of $63 per share.\n\nDanaher DHR\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $169 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.83\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Core\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 0.45%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Diagnostics and Research\n\nMedical technology company Danaher joins our list of best blue-chip stocks to buy after Morningstar analysts upgraded the firm\u2019s moat rating to wide from narrow. The firm offers differentiated technology that is protected by various intangible assets, including patents, brands, copyrights, and trademarks, observes Morningstar senior analyst Julie Utterback. Danaher seeks out attractive markets and makes acquisitions to enter or expand within those fields, and it also divests assets that are no longer core to the business. The company\u2019s acquisition-focused strategy has contributed to it becoming a top-five player in the highly fragmented and relatively sticky life science and diagnostic tool markets. Danaher stock trades at an 17% discount to our fair value estimate of $285 per share.\n\nMerck MRK\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $253 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.83\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 3.12%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Standard\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nMerck\u2019s combination of a wide lineup of high-margin drugs and a pipeline of new drugs should ensure strong returns on invested capital over the long term, says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. After several years of mixed results, Merck\u2019s R&D productivity is improving as the company shifts more toward areas of unmet medical need. Merck\u2019s new products have mitigated the generic competition, offsetting recent major patent losses. In particular, Keytruda for cancer represents a key blockbuster with multi-billion-dollar potential. We expect Keytruda\u2019s leadership in non-small cell lung cancer and several other cancers will be a key driver of growth for the firm over the next several years, but the 2028 US patent loss on the drug will create eventual pressure. Merck stock is trading 17% below our fair value estimate of $120 per share.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific TMO\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $203 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.85\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 0.29%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Diagnostics and Research\n\nThermo Fisher is weathering the pullback in global biopharmaceutical spending better than most of its peers. Being the premier life science supplier and having an unmatched portfolio of products, resources, and manufacturing capabilities have allowed the firm to retain and grow its wallet share among its customers across all channels, observes Morningstar regional director Alex Morozov. We expect the current budget-constrained environment to slowly ease in the upcoming year. The firm remains in a great position to leverage its share gains in the biopharma channel and capitalize on strong long-term demand. Thermo Fisher stock is trading at a 15% discount to its fair value estimate of $630.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb BMY\n\nMarket Capitalisation: $113 billion\n\nMorningstar Price/Fair Value: 0.86\n\nMorningstar Style Box: Large Value\n\nTrailing 12-Month Yield: 4.30%\n\nMorningstar Capital Allocation Rating: Exemplary\n\nIndustry: Drug Manufacturers\u2014General\n\nRounding out our list of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock is trading 14% below our fair value estimate of $66 per share. Adept at partnerships and acquisitions, Bristol-Myers Squibb has built a strong portfolio of drugs and a robust pipeline. The firm has brought in partners to share the development costs and diversify the risks of clinical and regulatory failure. \u201cWe believe the cardiovascular partnership with Pfizer represents one of the most important partnerships,\u201d says Morningstar\u2019s Andersen. Bristol is aggressively repositioning itself to expand through challenging patent losses. The recent approval of Karuna\u2019s schizophrenia drug Cobenfy stands to generate multi-billion-dollar peak sales in neurology, which is now reestablished as a key focus for Bristol.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years. To learn about finding different sources of moat, read this article by Mark LaMonica.",

            "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMLX) (\u201cAmylyx\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the appointment of Dan Monahan as Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Monahan will also join the Company\u2019s Leadership Team. Mr. Monahan joined Amylyx in January 2024, bringing more than 20 years of commercial leadership experience in the biopharmaceutical industry overseeing sales, marketing, and market access for multiple product lines.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to announce the appointment of Dan Monahan to Chief Commercial Officer as Amylyx prepares for the first participant dosed in the Phase 3 LUCIDITY clinical trial of avexitide for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia planned in the first quarter of 2025. Dan has a strong track record of launching medicines and excels in building and leading high-performing teams that have brought new medicines to communities with high unmet needs,\u201d said Joshua Cohen and Justin Klee, Co-CEOs of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx earlier this year, Mr. Monahan has demonstrated invaluable leadership as we work towards ensuring launch readiness for the avexitide program ahead of Phase 3 data expected in 2026 and potential future launches. We are confident that the addition of Mr. Monahan to our leadership team will play a crucial role in delivering a meaningful impact to the PBH community as we continue to move forward in our goal for avexitide to be the first therapy approved for people living with PBH.\u201d\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Monahan has remained deeply committed to launching therapies that address high unmet medical needs, bringing critical treatments to those who need them most. Prior to joining Amylyx, Mr. Monahan served as Vice President, Head of CNS Marketing and Portfolio Strategy at Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, where he led the U.S. commercialization efforts for the company\u2019s CNS franchise, including REXULTI\u00ae and ABILIFY MAINTENA\u00ae, which played a critical role in treating serious mental health conditions. Before joining Otsuka, Mr. Monahan held senior leadership roles at Novartis. He led the commercial execution of the company\u2019s flagship blockbuster dermatology brand, COSENTYX\u00ae, for patients with autoimmune conditions. Prior to Novartis, Mr. Monahan spent 14 years at Sanofi in positions of increasing leadership responsibility across sales, marketing and market access. He received an MBA from Seton Hall University, and is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Dan served as a Field Artillery Officer in the U.S. Army.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to collaborate with the team on advancing novel therapies from development through commercialization, with our first focus on avexitide for the potential treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia,\u201d said Dan Monahan, Chief Commercial Officer of Amylyx. \u201cSince joining Amylyx, I have seen first-hand both the resilience of those with post-bariatric hypoglycemia and the significant quality of life impacts that this debilitating condition can have. I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to support people living with PBH and potentially addressing the critical unmet need for a treatment option.\u201d\n\nIn this role, Mr. Monahan will lead the Company\u2019s commercialization efforts, particularly as Amylyx prepares for the potential approval of avexitide, an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). Amylyx plans to initiate LUCIDITY, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAbout Avexitide\n\nAvexitide is an investigational, first-in-class glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist that has been evaluated in five clinical trials for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) and has also been studied in congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted avexitide Breakthrough Therapy Designation for both indications, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in congenital HI, and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (which includes PBH and congenital HI). Avexitide is designed to bind to the GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic islet beta cells and inhibit the effect of GLP-1 to mitigate hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin secretion and stabilizing blood glucose levels. In PBH, excessive GLP-1 can lead to the hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent debilitating hypoglycemic events. In two Phase 2 PBH trials, avexitide demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions in hypoglycemic events. These events can lead to autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that can have a devastating impact on daily living.\n\nAbout the LUCIDITY Trial\n\nLUCIDITY (NCT06747468) is a 75-participant, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of avexitide in participants with PBH. The Phase 3 trial will be conducted at approximately 20 sites in the U.S. Participants will be randomized 3:2 to receive either 90 mg of avexitide subcutaneously once daily or placebo. The trial will include a three-week run-in period and a 16-week double-blind treatment period. Participants who complete the double-blind period of the planned study will be eligible to enter an open-label extension (OLE) period with a duration of 32 weeks. The primary efficacy objective of LUCIDITY will evaluate the FDA-agreed upon primary outcome of reduction in the composite of Level 2 and Level 3 hypoglycemic events through Week 16. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.\n\nAbout Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)\n\nSymptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a condition that affects approximately 8% of people who have undergone bariatric surgery, or approximately 160,000 people, in the U.S. PBH is thought to be caused by an excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response leading to hypoglycemia and impaired quality of life. PBH can cause debilitating hypoglycemic events associated with inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, known as neuroglycopenia. Clinical manifestations can include impaired cognition, loss of consciousness, and seizures. PBH is also associated with a high degree of disability that can result in major disruptions to independent living. There are no approved therapies for PBH.\n\nAbout Amylyx Pharmaceuticals\n\nAmylyx is committed to the discovery and development of new treatment options for communities with high unmet needs, including people living with serious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions. Since its founding, Amylyx has been guided by science to address unanswered questions, keeping communities at the heart and center of all decisions. Amylyx is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, visit amylyx.com and follow us on LinkedIn and X.

As per a study done by ICMR, cancer incidence in India is estimated to increase by about 13 percent in 2025 as compared to 2020.\"\n\nThe President emphasised that it is the duty of healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care, which addresses the physical and psychological needs of the cancer patients.\n\nShe said that every word of sympathy and compassion that a doctor utters has the power to change the life of his patient for better.\n\nThe President said that there is a need to spread more and more awareness regarding the causes, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We come across many such cases where either due to ignorance of the patient and family or due to financial constraints, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases are delayed. In case of cancer, this can prove fatal.\n\nShe said that the fight against diseases such as cancer is a collective effort. She urged all to work together to create a healthcare system that is patient-centric and equitable, along with being world-class.\n\nThe President said that we have seen that in some families, the health of boys is given more importance than that of girls. This different treatment is also seen later with respect to men and women. Many times, the women of a family do not get timely diagnosis and treatment for their health issues.\n\nShe stated that any such delay, especially in case of cancer could be critical. She urged every household to encourage women to share their problems.\n\nShe said that every member of the family and society as a whole needs to take the health of women more seriously and contribute pro-actively in taking care of them and facilitating appropriate timely treatment for them.",

            "content": "Lawsuits concerning medicinal products are still a rarity at the Unified Patent Court. Alexion is in dispute with Amgen and Samsung Bioepis over Soliris, a drug for treating rare blood diseases. Amgen and Sanofi extended their epic battles over the cholesterol-lowering drugs Repatha and Praluent respectively. Sanofi has also challenged various generics manufacturers such as Accord over cancer drug cabazitaxel, while GSK sued Pfizer over a patent regarding an RSV vaccine.\n\nBut compared to the number of mobile communications and medical devices cases, pharmaceutical cases at the UPC are still few and far between. Now, however, the next major dispute is on the horizon. Accord filed a declaration of non-infringement with the Milan central division at the end of November. Andrea Postiglione will lead the case as presiding judge, assisted by Dutch judge Marije Knijff.\n\nThe secret sauce\n\nThe exact motions are not known to JUVE Patent. What is certain, however, is that Accord wants to establish that its product for the active ingredient nilotinib does not infringe Novartis patent EP 2 501 384. The patent protects a method of treating proliferative disorders and other pathological conditions mediated by BCR-ABL, C-KIT, DDR1, DDR2 or PDGF-R kinase activity. In simpler terms, it protects the administration of the active ingredient nilotonib together with apple sauce.\n\nNilotonib is an anti-cancer medication used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but Novartis is also currently researching its use in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The company sells nilotonib under the brand name Tasigna. Nilotonib is mainly administered in the form of capsules. Novartis recommends taking the capsules on an empty stomach because taking it with food can lead to side effects. However, this poses problems for patients with difficulties swallowing. Administration with apple sauce therefore ought to alleviate this.\n\nThe basic patent for nilotonib has already expired, which makes the market entry of generic products likely. In August 2024, for example, Accord received approval for a generic hard-capsule preparation called Nilotinib Accord. However, Accord is not yet selling this.\n\nAccord has already carved out the new form of administration together with apple sauce from is labels. By means of its declaration of non-infringement lawsuit in Milan, Accord now apparently wants to establish that its generic product is not at risk from an infringement suit at the UPC or national courts in Europe. Originators usually file PI applications against new generic products.\n\nOpt-out, opt-in\n\nIn 2023, Novartis initially opted EP 384 out of the UPC\u2019s jurisdiction. In June 2024 the Swiss company then withdrew the opt-out. Generic drug manufacturers are likely to have understood this as a preparatory measure for attacks on generic nilotinib products. So far, however, JUVE Patent is not aware of any lawsuits filed by Novartis.\n\nPreviously, the patent\u2019s path to grant was eventful. In 2018, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office initially withdrew the grant of EP 384 due to a lack of inventive step. Various pharmaceutical companies and law firms had filed oppositions against the grant as straw men. However, Novartis, with the support of Hoffmann Eitle, appealed against the decision to the EPO Boards of Appeal. They then granted EP 384 in amended form in 2023.\n\nAccord and Novartis no newcomers\n\nBoth companies already have experience with UPC lawsuits. Novartis, for example, sued Celltrion at the local division D\u00fcsseldorf for infringing a patent for the asthma drug Xolair but failed to get a PI in September 2024. Accord is one of the generics companies sued by Sanofi regarding cancer drug cabazitaxel.\n\nNovartis is relying on Bristows partners Gregory Bacon and Brian Cordery for the dispute with Accord. Novartis is one of the UK law firm\u2019s most important clients. Bacon is a UK solicitor, but also has a licence in Belgium and therefore with the UPC.\n\nBristows backed the UPC early on, even after the UK pulled out of the UPC project. So far, however, the patent team has only represented Winnow Solutions in a suit concerning a technology for food waste monitoring at the local division The Hague. The Novartis case is therefore a success for the UK law firm \u2014 especially if active infringement claims extend the dispute.\n\nIn the dispute with Celltrion, Novartis is relying on lawyers from Freshfields and Carpmaels & Ransford. Both law firms are also regular advisors to the Swiss pharmaceutical giant.\n\nTaylor Wessing for Accord\n\nTaylor Wessing is currently one of the busiest law firms at the UPC. It is highly active for Abbott, for example, in medical devices proceedings against Dexcom. In the pharmaceuticals segment, the firm has so far only represented Zentiva in the dispute with Sanofi. Here, Accord relies on a team from Pinsent Masons.\n\nFor the lawsuit against Novartis at the Milan central division, however, Accord chose the Dutch Taylor Wessing partner Wim Maas. Alexander Rubusch from D\u00fcsseldorf, David Mulder and Iris van der Heijdt from the Amsterdam office and Charlotte Garnitsch from Eindhoven complete the team. According to JUVE Patent information, Accord has also retained Fabrizio Jacobacci from the law firm of the same name as local advisor in Milan.",

            "content": "Several Big Pharma companies unveiled price increases for some 250 drugs during the first month of the year, according to data from 3 Axis Advisors.\n\nMost notably, Pfizer is raising the price of its COVID-19 medication Paxlovid, while Bristol Myers Squibb is hiking the price of several cancer cell therapies.\n\nMost of the drug price increases are lower than 10%, with the median price increase reaching 4.5%. That\u2019s about the same as the median increase last year.\n\nAnnual price drug hikes have become less frequent in recent years due to increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the public, but drugmakers have turned to higher launch prices to get around that, 3 Axis president Antonio Ciaccia told Reuters.\n\nLaunch prices in 2023 were 35% higher than in 2022, according to an analysis by the outlet.\n\n\u201cDrugmakers don\u2019t have much real estate any longer to increase prices over time, which means taking greater liberties on launch prices is really the only option they have in the face of expanded penalties for year-over-year price increases,\u201d Ciaccia said.\n\nPfizer came out on top in raising the prices of most drugs for the third year in a row, accounting for about 60 on the list.\n\nThe pharma giant, which has experienced a tumultuous few years following a sharp decline in its COVID business, raised the prices of its migraine drug Nurtec and some cancer drugs including Adcentris, Ibrance and Xeljanz.\n\nLeadiant Biosciences was responsible for the biggest price hikes this month, including a 15% increase on its Hodgkin\u2019s disease therapy Matalune \u2014 as well as a 20% increase on cystinosis treatment Cystaran.\n\nBMS increased the prices of its oncology drugs, Abecma and Breyanzi, by 6% and 9%, respectively.\n\nDan Ollendorf, chief scientific officer and director of health technology assessment methods and engagement at healthcare nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), told MM+M that the context around the list prices is important to understand their impact.\n\nList prices are different from net prices, or the money drugmakers take home after paying rebates, discounts or other concessions to middlemen and insurers.\n\n\u201cBefore we make too much out of the yearly list price increases, we have to think about what that actually will mean in terms of net pricing,\u201d he said.\n\nNotably, some list prices also went down this month.\n\nMerck decided it will reduce the list price of its diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, noting it wants to align the list price more closely to the net price. Januvia is one of the first 10 drugs chosen to be part of the Medicare negotiation process, though it\u2019s unclear if the January price drop is related to that.\n\nLast month, ICER published a report that examined the top 10 drugs with the most substantial net price increases in 2023.\n\nThe report found that five of those drugs \u2014 Biktarvy, Darzalex, Entresto, Cabometyx and Xeljanz \u2014 saw \u201cunsupported\u201d price increases that did not add value to patients and resulted in $815 million in added costs to payers.\n\n\u201cThe higher prices we pay for drugs, and if those prices are not aligned with value to the patient, the more pressure that puts on the system,\u201d Ollendorf explained.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a BMS spokesperson said \u201cit is important to note that most patients will not pay the list price for their medication,\u201d and that it does not reflect the discounts provided to insurers, PBMs and other purchasers.\n\n\u201cAt BMS, we are committed to achieving unfettered patient access to our potentially life-saving medicines and our approach to pricing prioritizes the value our medicines deliver for patients, healthcare systems and society,\u201d the spokesperson continued.\n\nDrug pricing advocacy organization the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP), however, wasn\u2019t as pleased with the news.\n\n\u201cBig Pharma makes a tradition of ringing in each new year with egregious price hikes on hundreds of brand name prescription drugs,\u201d CSRxP executive director Lauren Aronson said in a statement. \u201cBig Pharma\u2019s price hikes this January will continue to grow but already outpace the rate of inflation and include significant increases on drugs for serious conditions, like cancer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear how the January price hikes might impact net prices or ultimately impact patients, Ollendorf said. Higher list prices don\u2019t always translate to higher net prices and even reductions in price \u2014 as seen with Januvia \u2014 might not always provide savings to patients.\n\n\u201cIt depends both on whether the net price trend is following the same pattern [as the list price trend],\u201d Ollendorf explained. \u201cIf the net price trend is flatter, then it may not have as much of an impact on patients unless that patient has insurance that is still basing the co-insurance level on the list price rather than the net price.\u201d\n\nAnother area that might have an impact on increasing drug costs is the newly implemented provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that requires drugmakers to pay rebates to the federal government for raising the prices of drugs faster than the rate of inflation.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to track not just whether the net price trend is different from the list price trend, but also how the effects of inflation rebates in the Medicare program play out,\u201d Ollendorf said.",

Here's how to file for unemployment 4-minute read\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Filing for New Jersey unemployment guide Step-by-step guide to navigating New Jersey's unemployment filing process online. Megan Fernandes and Katie Sobko, NorthJersey.com\n\nNearly 100 New Jersey companies announced more than 13,300 layoffs combined in 2024, public records show, as white-collar sectors such as pharmaceuticals, banking and finance tightened job counts.\n\nThe numbers are made public through New Jersey\u2019s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filings, or WARN notices, which mandate that employers provide a 90-day notice when they are letting employees in the state go.\n\nNot all 13,332 people were necessarily out of a job. For example, a layoff notice was filed for 157 people from the Metropolitan YMCA in Wayne, but many of those workers were rehired.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Lots said late in December that it was handing 385 workers the pink slip, but then announced a last-minute deal to keep 400 of its stores open.\n\nAll told, New Jersey has the 10th-highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 4.6%, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n'This is really a correction'\n\nMany of the layoffs were likely among hires that came on board in 2022 and 2023, during what\u2019s been called the Great Resignation, said James Hughes, an economist at Rutgers University.\n\nThat primarily included information jobs, as well as banking, finance and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cThe Great Resignation has yielded to the Great Stay,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt could definitely be shrinking \u2026 which suggests this is really a correction.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey of business owners released in December, 55% of employers had trouble finding staff in 2024, down from 73% in 2021 during the Great Resignation, when many people quit work amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShrinking office space could mean fewer workers\n\nNew Jersey has typically been known for its suburban office market, which shrank in the past decade, a phenomenon sped up thanks to the pandemic.\n\nCompanies that are staying in New Jersey are shrinking their footprints. Unilever is moving from its 325,000-square-foot headquarters in Englewood Cliffs to one that\u2019s a third of the size in Hoboken.\n\nSanofi is also shrinking its office footprint as it transfers from Bridgewater to a smaller location at M Station in Morristown.\n\nWhich companies had layoffs\n\nUnilever said in November that it was cutting 149 employees at its Englewood Cliffs headquarters. Spirit Airlines said last month that it was laying off 68 employees at Newark Liberty International Airport after declaring bankruptcy.\n\nFinance giant Prudential announced in May that it was terminating 56 employees at its Newark headquarters.\n\nTroubled New Jersey hospital chain CarePoint Health announced layoff notices last year for 2,600 workers.\n\nSamsung Electronic in Ridgefield Park \u2014 soon to be based out of what will be the former Unilever headquarters in Englewood Cliffs \u2014 notified 125 employees in September of layoffs.\n\nFamily Dollar said last year that it would lay off 94 employees as it embarked on plans to close nearly 1,000 stores across the United States. Drugmaker Bayer laid off 70 employees at its Whippany headquarters, while Barclays let go of 70 employees in the same town.\n\nWhy do businesses cut jobs?\n\nAccording to Indeed.com, one of the most common reasons for a layoff is to cut costs.\n\n\u201cA way that the company could save money is by eliminating some positions and allocating those funds elsewhere,\u201d said a February 2024 post by the job-searching website.\n\nIn the same vein, a business might opt to outsource some of its operations, Indeed said, meaning those roles within the company are terminated.\n\nIn other cases, a company may be relocating, so employees unable to move will be laid off. Or two companies may be merging.\n\nWhat to do if you're laid off in NJ\n\nAs soon as you\u2019re notified you\u2019ll be laid off, there are questions you should make a priority to ask your employer, according to the Harvard Business Review.\n\nThey include:\n\nWhen you\u2019ll receive your last paycheck and whether you\u2019ll get paid for unused vacation time.\n\nWhether you\u2019ll receive severance pay.\n\nHow long you have to exercise your company stock options.\n\nHow long company health coverage will last.\n\nWhether the employer will still provide you a reference.\n\nHow and when you can get copies of your performance reviews.\n\nWhat happens to your 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nThe financial publication NerdWallet states that once laid off, you should file for unemployment \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAnd you should contact any banks or lenders, including your credit card or mortgage company, and see if they could waive or reduce your fees, or extend the payment due dates, NerdWallet said.\n\nIf need be, NerdWallet suggests you should tap into local community resources, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's emergency food assistance programs, or 211.org, which connects to other local social services.\n\nHow to get health care when unemployed\n\nHealth care options need to be researched. Job loss counts as a \u201cqualifying life event,\u201d meaning you can change health insurers outside of the open enrollment period.\n\nYou can stay on your parents' plan if you\u2019re under 26, stay on your spouse\u2019s employer health plan, or acquire insurance through the federal insurance marketplace.\n\nOr you could continue on your former employer\u2019s health plan through COBRA.\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100 and Facebook",

LIU YING/XINHUA\n\nChina's economy demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability in 2024 amid complex domestic and global landscapes.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory was marked by steady progress and supported by a robust package of measures.\n\nNotable growth was seen in key economic indicators such as industrial output, alongside progress in the stabilization of the real estate market. Targeted reforms, fiscal support and innovation-driven measures bolstered domestic confidence.\n\nAnd the global significance of China's economic performance is clear.\n\nChina's economy is expected to have contributed close to 30 percent of global growth in 2024, highlighting its pivotal role in the international economic landscape.\n\nThe country has made significant strides in areas of heightened domestic and international interest \u2014 consumption, foreign investment, real estate and green development.\n\nConsumption growth\n\nDespite persistent skepticism about China's consumption prospects, the past year has proven successful, with consumer spending on the rise with fresh highlights.\n\nThough challenges such as subdued consumer sentiment and the ongoing adjustment of the real estate sector have been cited frequently, such narratives do not fully capture the complexity of the situation.\n\nBut highlights such as steady development in services and tourism, as well as growth in the large-scale trade-in of goods, paint a more promising picture \u2014 one that merits further discussion.\n\nIn 2024, the country introduced a series of immediate and long-term initiatives to tap into its immense consumption potential.\n\nThese efforts encompassed the enhancement of fiscal investment, an increase in household incomes, dismantling of market barriers, exploration of new avenues for consumption through technological advancements and broader opening of the market.\n\nSome policies have already proved effective, including a consumer goods trade-in initiative, which is supported by 150 billion yuan ($20.55 billion) in funding raised through ultra-long special treasury bonds allocated to local governments.\n\nThe effects of this policy are evident in rising spending on home appliances, automobiles and other goods, with sales of white goods and autos up 22.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, in November, said the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nBroader economic indicators suggest an optimistic outlook. In October, e-commerce logistics hit a five-year high in business volume, while spending on services gained fresh momentum, particularly in the hospitality and dining sectors.\n\nForeign investment\n\nIn a year marked by growing protectionism and attempts toward economic \"decoupling\" on the global stage, China has nevertheless remained a popular investment destination.\n\nFrench pharmaceutical giant Sanofi reaffirmed global investor confidence in the Chinese market by announcing in December that it was investing nearly 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) to build a new insulin production base in Beijing, marking the company's largest single investment in China since 1982.\n\nThe investment followed China's announcement of further opening-up in its healthcare sector, including a plan to allow the establishment of wholly foreign-owned hospitals in some major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the island province of Hainan, to modernize healthcare services and address rising demand.\n\nAn increasing number of companies are joining Sanofi in expanding their presence in China to seize growth opportunities and share in the dividends of the country's continued high-standard opening-up.\n\nIn the first 11 months, a record 52,379 foreign-invested companies were established in China, up 8.9 percent from the previous year.\n\nIn November, foreign direct investment in the Chinese mainland in actual use climbed 6 percent from the same period a year prior.\n\nForeign investors are drawn to China for a variety of reasons \u2014 its supply chain advantages, innovation-driven growth model and comprehensive offerings that provide everything a company might need.\n\nTo help foreign investors capitalize on its supply chain, market and innovation advantages, China has taken significant steps to open up more broadly in 2024. Key measures included expanding industry access and launching pilot programs to attract global investment.\n\nNotably, the 2024 national negative list for foreign investment, effective Nov 1, eliminated all market access restrictions for foreign investors in the manufacturing sector, in a groundbreaking move for global manufacturers entering the Chinese economy.\n\nProperty market\n\nClear signs of recovery have emerged in 2024, bolstered by well-targeted policies that have strengthened confidence and rekindled demand.\n\nIn late September, a key meeting convened by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee underscored the urgency of stabilizing the property market and reversing its downturn.\n\nThe meeting called for adjustments to housing purchase restrictions, reductions in mortgage interest rates and improvements to land, fiscal, tax and financial policies.\n\nResponding to these directives, authorities have lowered home-purchase costs, eased mortgage burdens, and extended critical support for first-time buyers and those seeking to upgrade their living arrangements.\n\nOn Sept 29, the central bank instructed commercial banks to cut interest rates on existing mortgages, including first and second-home loans, to no less than 30 basis points below the loan prime rate by Oct 31, aiming to alleviate financial pressure on homeowners.\n\nSubsequently, major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province's Guangzhou and Shenzhen have introduced tailored measures to boost their local property markets via another round of policy adjustments.\n\nThese efforts have built on measures announced in May, which included cutting minimum down-payment ratios, establishing a re-lending facility for affordable housing and pledging to complete unfinished residential projects.\n\nThe impact of these policy measures is becoming increasingly evident. In November, the year-on-year decline in commercial residential property prices across 70 large and medium-sized cities narrowed, pointing to early signs of recovery and stabilization in the housing market.\n\nXinhua",

            "content": "Biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN -2.02%) started 2024 on a strong note and performed well through the first half of the year. However, the drugmaker has since seen its shares decline substantially due to several factors, most notably headwinds related to one of its key growth drivers (more on that later).\n\nStill, many analysts on Wall Street think the correction is way overdone. Regeneron's stock could soar by 50% in the next year from its current levels if we go by its average price target of $1,053 (according to Yahoo! Finance). Should investors rush to buy Regeneron's shares?\n\nThe Eylea problem\n\nRegeneron has largely relied on two main products to drive top-line growth in recent years. One is Dupixent, an eczema treatment whose rights it shares with Sanofi, based in France. The other is Eylea, a medicine for wet age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease) that it comarkets with Bayer.\n\nHowever, Eylea has been facing serious issues in the past two years. It first dealt with stiff competition from Roche's Vabysmo. Regeneron did find a solution, at least somewhat, for Vabysmo's challenge. It developed a high-dose formulation of Eylea that helped decrease the number of annual injections, one of Vabysmo's key selling points.\n\nBut Regeneron is now dealing with biosimilar competition for the original Eylea. Amgen recently won a ruling allowing it to launch its biosimilar version of Eylea, Pavblu, while the two entities continue their patent battle in courts. Regeneron still generated strong financial results in the third quarter. Its revenue increased by 11% year over year to $3.72 billion. Combined U.S. sales of Eylea and Eylea HD came in at $1.54 billion, 3% higher than the year-ago period. But Eylea HD accounted for just $392 million of that total.\n\nHaving to deal with fewer injections per year is great, but a much lower price -- which is what Pavblu will offer as a biosimilar -- is also an excellent selling point. So, Regeneron's Eylea-related sales and total revenue could start moving in the wrong direction because of this problem.\n\nPotential growth avenues\n\nThankfully, Regeneron's other growth driver, Dupixent, is doing fine. In the third quarter, the medicine's total worldwide revenue, recorded by Sanofi, increased by 23% year over year to $3.82 billion. In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the green light to Dupixent in treating COPD, an indication that could add several billion dollars in annual sales to the therapy. So, Dupixent should continue its upward path next year. It might even grow its sales faster since the COPD indication in the U.S. is still so fresh.\n\nRegeneron's lineup also features Libtayo, a cancer medicine whose rights it shares with its Dupixent partner, Sanofi. Libtayo's third-quarter sales came in at $289 million, up 24% compared to the year-ago period. It should also maintain strong growth next year. Further, Regeneron has a deep pipeline and expects several key data readouts in 2025. One of them will be for itepekimab, a potential medicine for COPD in former smokers that is undergoing phase 3 studies. Libtayo and Dupixent could deliver data readouts supporting new indications, too. These developments could put some life back into Regeneron's stock.\n\nIs Regeneron's stock a buy?\n\nThe most important potential catalyst for Regeneron would be a win in its patent infringement case against Amgen. If that happens in 2025, Regeneron could meet the Street's average price target. However, no one knows whether that will be the case's outcome, so it's hard to bet on Regeneron rising by 50% in the next 12 months. And if Regeneron loses its case, its revenue could decrease for at least several quarters. The market does not like uncertainty.\n\nSo, what's the verdict? In my view, it depends on each person's horizon. Even with the Eylea-related issue, the rest of Regeneron's lineup -- Dupixent and Libtayo -- are winners. Further, the drugmaker should develop several more blockbusters, particularly in oncology, where it has been looking to increase its presence. Regeneron is also doing important work in gene therapy and gene editing.\n\nInvestors expecting the company to bounce back next year might be disappointed. But those willing to hold onto Regeneron's shares for more than five years could earn strong returns.",

According to primary research conducted by GlobalData, high volumes of prescribing physicians and patients have demonstrated positive attitudes towards the use of ultra-rapid insulin analogs, which is expected to drive T1D market growth,\u201d Sulayman Patel, Pharma Analyst at GlobalData, said.\n\nAlso Read Akums opens new facility for lyophilised and sterile dosage manufacturing\n\nThe late-stage T1D pipeline consists of several agents, including Eli Lilly\u2019s insulin efsitora alfa, which is anticipated to launch in 2027. As a once-weekly insulin analog, insulin efsitora alfa is expected to compete alongside Novo Nordisk\u2019s Awiqli (insulin icodec), which offers basal insulin therapy options that reduce lifestyle disruption and improve patient compliance, a critical unmet need, particularly in pediatric populations.\n\nAdditionally, Diamyd Medical\u2019s vaccine for T1D is one of several prominent immunomodulatory agents that is expected to present a disease-modifying therapy option for T1D patients, offering the potential to eliminate the need for lifelong insulin therapy.\n\nPatel notes: \u201cShould the Diamyd vaccine, or other immunomodulatory agents such as Johnson & Johnson\u2019s ustekinumab or Dompe Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ladarixin receive regulatory approval for the treatment of T1D, the underlying mechanisms of T1D may be addressed and beta cell function could be significantly improved. These pipeline agents could leverage the use and growing evidence produced by Sanofi\u2019s Tzield (teplizumab), the only approved disease-modifying therapy for T1D, which could support adoption and prescribing behaviors following anticipated approval.\u201d\n\nAlso Read Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound holds potential to dominate obesity market\n\nTzield received FDA approval in November 2022 and is the first treatment for T1D that targets the underlying disease mechanisms by delaying the onset of stage 3 T1D in patients 8 years and older. GlobalData expects Tzield to gain European approval and become the top-selling drug in the T1D market with sales of $4.8 billion across the 7MM in 2033.\n\nWhile the T1D market is projected to grow during the forecast period across the 7MM, it may face some challenges that will slow its growth. Potential barriers to growth include the high financial burden of immunomodulatory agents, which means insurance and reimbursement restrictions will impact drug sales, as well as the high failure rate of clinical trials developing disease-modifying therapeutics in the T1D space.\n\nPatel concludes: \u201cNotably, the patient share of Tzield is particularly low due to the substantial financial burden and limited long-term data, with its sales accounting for 1.2% of total T1D drug sales in 2023. However, GlobalData forecasts that the increasing adoption and launch of further immunomodulatory agents, combined with the anticipated European approval of Tzield, will result in significant market growth, resulting in immunomodulatory agents expected to account for 63.5% of T1D sales in 2033, driving total market growth in the T1D drug landscape.\u201d",

            "content": "Just as 2023 was a tough year for the biopharma industry, so was 2024. Scores of pharmas and biotechs downsized and restructured their workforces to stay afloat, including large companies such as Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson. Some of those businesses cut thousands of employees.\n\nBioSpace tracked the layoffs below. Keep reading for details on these cuts.\n\nDecember Layoffs: Javara, Ring, Outlook and More\n\nJavara\n\nDec. 23\n\nJavara, a North Carolina\u2013based clinical research organization, is laying off staff as the company restructures, according to Fierce Biotech. Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,\u201d a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. \u201cTo reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.\u201d\n\nRing Therapeutics\n\nDec. 18\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with \u201cjust under 50%\u201d of its employees, a spokesperson told Endpoints News on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.\u2013based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n\u201cWe recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring\u2019s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,\u201d the spokesperson wrote to Endpoints. \u201cAs a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.\u201d\n\nOutlook Therapeutics\n\nDec. 17\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics announced it\u2019s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey\u2013based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC filing. The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company announced its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA\u2019s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 nixed approval for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization. Outlook plans to launch bevacizumab in the European Union and the U.K. in the first half of 2025.\n\nEditas\n\nDec. 16\n\nUnable to find a development sponsor for its sickle cell disease therapy renizgamglogene autogedtemcel, Editas announced Dec. 12 it will terminate work on the ex vivo therapy and cut about 65% of its employees over the next six months. The move will affect several members of the company\u2019s management team, including Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei.\n\nThe biotech expects these adjustments will extend its runway into the second quarter of 2027.\n\nMoving forward, Editas will focus its resources and expertise on developing in vivo CRISPR-editing assets. This pivot will capitalize on recent preclinical findings in various tissues.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBavarian Nordic\n\nDec. 12\n\nDenmark-based vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic will close its San Diego research and development (R&D) site and lay off 48 employees there, according to a Dec. 9 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. There\u2019ll be two rounds of layoffs\u2014with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31\u2014and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a deal that gave the vaccine maker Emergent\u2019s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that\u2019s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also announced this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of \u201cimproved visibility\u201d around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a \u201cfinal restructuring\u201d of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian\u2019s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBenevolentAI\n\nDec. 12\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company announced Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI\u2019s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company announced it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI announced it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners\u2019 drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI\u2019s new strategic direction \u201cbuilds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.\u201d\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\nChroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\n\nDec. 12\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics\u2019 merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop announced their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma\u2019s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\nCellectar Biosciences\n\nDec. 11\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday kicked off a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an \u201cimmediate reduction in headcount\u201d of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech\u2019s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company\u2019s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. \u201cWe have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,\u201d CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCarisma Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma announced Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 SEC filing.\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma announced it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 SEC filing, the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma\u2019s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nBelharra Therapeutics\n\nDec. 10\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego\u2013based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, Endpoints News reported on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve \u201ckey inflection points\u201d while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson\u2019s emailed statement to Endpoints. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra announced its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra\u2019s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. BioSpace named the move one of the top immunology and inflammation deals of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra launched in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, BioSpace named Belharra to its NextGen Bio Class of 2024 list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\nNational Resilience\n\nDec. 9\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is laying off 105 employees from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence \u201cto focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers\u2019 demands and patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021. The site primarily produces drugs and biologics for commercial clients as well as the U.S. government. At the time of the acquisition deal, it had won more than $1.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nAlso on Friday, Resilience named William Marth as its new CEO.\n\nAmplifyBio\n\nDec. 9\n\nAmplifyBio is closing up shop in South San Francisco as it lays off an unspecified number of employees in the region and terminates its R&D and characterization services, according to a report from Fierce Biotech on Friday.\n\nSome of the work in the shuttered site will move to the manufacturer\u2019s new facility in Ohio, a company spokesperson told Fierce, adding that these changes will allow AmplifyBio to \u201cintegrate early drug discovery and characterization more seamlessly\u201d with its manufacturing activities. The reorganization will also help the CDMO lower overhead costs and provide its services \u201cat more market-competitive prices,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmplifyBio is a preclinical contract research organization and manufacturing service provider that provides discovery, characterization and optimization services, as well as in vitro and in vivo safety studies. Its work includes several treatment modalities, such as small molecule drugs, mRNA therapies and cell and gene treatments.\n\nAgenus\n\nDec. 5\n\nA week after announcing a strategic operational alignment that includes shifting two California manufacturing facilities\u2019 focus to contract biologics manufacturing, Agenus has announced employee cuts are on the way. The Lexington, Massachusetts\u2013based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they\u2019ll affect or which locations they\u2019ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March SEC filing, Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has \u201cdemonstrated robust clinical activity\u201d in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA advised against the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it\u2019s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\nAlligator Bioscience\n\nDec. 3\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will lay off 70% of its employees in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its press release, the biotech cited its \u201ccurrent capital constraints\u201d as the reason for the strategic restructuring. Alligator also noted that all but one of its assets are now \u201cunder strategic evaluation.\u201d The company will focus all of its resources on its lead asset mitazalimab, an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody being assessed for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nIdorsia Pharmaceuticals\n\nDec. 2\n\nAs part of cost-cutting measures while it looks to sell the global rights to hypertension drug aprocitentan, Idorsia Pharmaceuticals is considering cutting up to 270 positions globally, the company announced last week. The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees. The biotech hopes to sign the agreement before the end of this year and close the deal in early 2025.\n\nIdorsia spun out of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of Actelion in 2017. In March, the company received FDA approval for Tryvio, an asset J&J gave back to the biotech in September 2023.\n\nNovember Layoffs: Kronos, Novartis, Recursion and More\n\nKronos Bio\n\nNov. 27\n\nKronos Bio on Wednesday announced that it will trim its headcount by approximately 83% by the end of the year, as part of a previously announced cost-cutting campaign.\n\nKronos had 62 full-time employees\u2014and one part-time staff member\u2014as of March 11, 2024, according to an SEC filing. After the layoffs, the California-based biotech will have around 10 staff left. President and CEO Norbert Bischofberger is also stepping down from his role, effective Dec. 3, and will be succeeded by current COO and CFO Deborah Knobelman. Bischofberger will stay on Kronos\u2019 Board of Directors.\n\nThe company first announced its corporate overhaul earlier this month, alongside its third-quarter 2024 business report. At the time, Kronos said that it was exploring strategic alternatives moving forward, which could include a merger or reverse merger, an acquisition or other business combination, sales of its assets or other strategic transactions.\n\nKronos also at the time terminated the development of its CDK9 inhibitor istisociclib after disappointing Phase I/II data in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.\n\nNovartis\n\nNov. 27\n\nAmidst a years-long restructuring effort, Novartis on Tuesday announced it will lay off nearly 140 more employees from in its New Jersey site, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) update.\n\nThe layoffs will start in February 2025 and run through August. In a statement to Fierce Pharma, a company spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said that it will primarily affect commercial field sales teams for Xolair, Tafinlar and Mekinist. The spokesperson nevertheless maintained that these medicines will remain available to patients.\n\nNovartis in April 2022 announced a massive business transformation initiative, with an eye toward saving around $1 billion in operations costs through 2024. This effort included thousands of layoffs\u2014in June 2022, the pharma announced that up to 8,000 jobs were on the chopping block. In September 2023, Novartis also confirmed plans to spin off its generics unit Sandoz.\n\nThe layoffs come as Novartis ramps up its pipeline investments, including the potentially $1.1 billion acquisition of gene therapy specialist Kate Therapeutics to deepen its neuromuscular expertise, and the a radiopharma deal with Ratio Therapeutics, which could reach up to $745 million.\n\nRecursion Therapeutics\n\nNov. 27\n\nJust months after revealing its merger with fellow AI leader Exscientia, Recursion Therapeutics on Tuesday announced that it will lay off dozens of employees to minimize redundancies, according to a STAT News report.\n\nCiting a source who had been terminated, STAT noted that cuts were made across both Recursion and Exscientia. Spokesperson Ryan Kelly confirmed the workforce reduction, disclosing that less than 20% of employees were affected. Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a press release last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n\u201cWith any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,\u201d Kelly told STAT.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia first announced the merger in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion\u2019s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents\u2014plus $100 million in annual synergies\u2014which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\nMedigene\n\nNov. 26\n\nMedigene on Tuesday kicked off a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech\u2019s employees will be let go in 2025\u2014a \u201cdifficult decision to make,\u201d according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are \u201ca necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.\u201d\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech\u2019s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. \u201cThe Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,\u201d according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\nAlector\n\nNov. 26\n\nAlector will let go of 41 employees\u2014or around 17% of its total headcount\u2014after revealing disappointing Phase II findings for its Alzheimer\u2019s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer\u2019s readout.\n\nBMS\n\nNov. 26\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, Bristol Myers Squibb announced plans to lay off around 195 more employees from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS\u2019s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma\u2019s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its first-quarter earnings report in April 2024, noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become \u201cmore agile\u201d and \u201cdrive efficiency across the company.\u201d\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both Q2 and Q3, the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance\u2014further evidence of the business\u2019 robust performance.\n\nSonata Therapeutics\n\nNov. 22\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees, Fierce Biotech reported. A spokesperson at the Watertown, Massachusetts, biotech told Fierce that in addition to the layoffs, founding team member Volker Herrmann is no longer leading the company. Chairman David Khougazian is now acting CEO.\n\nSonata did not tell Fierce whether it would deprioritize any of its programs. The company has been developing a new class of therapeutics\u2014which it calls network medicines\u2014meant to reprogram diseased cells to release therapeutic signals. In March, Sonata announced a research collaboration with Champalimaud Foundation to develop SNT-3012, the biotech\u2019s novel network medicine intended to treat pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nAccording to PitchBook, Sonata has 54 employees and five investors, including Flagship Pioneering and Altitude Life Science Ventures. The company launched in 2022 after two Flagship companies, Inzen Therapeutics and Cygnal Therapeutics, combined.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 22\n\nShortly after announcing it\u2019s laying off more than 200 employees, 23andMe filed Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices indicating it\u2019s letting go 153 employees in California and closing its South San Francisco location. The staff cuts are likely part of the previously announced workforce reduction.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 19 WARN notices, the genetic testing company will trim its workforce by 122 employees in Sunnyvale and 31 employees in South San Francisco, effective Jan. 10. The 65,340-square-foot South San Francisco location, listed as 23andMe\u2019s headquarters in a May SEC filing, will close.\n\n23andMe announced it\u2019s letting go more than 200 people Nov. 11, when it also shared that it is discontinuing development of new therapies to focus on genetic testing services and products. The company is exploring strategic opportunities for its therapeutic pipeline that could include licensing agreements, asset sales or other transactions.\n\nJ&J and Merck\n\nNov. 21\n\nDue to growing competition from rivals in China, Johnson & Johnson and Merck are letting go employees in that country, BNN Bloomberg reported, crediting Chinese media outlets as the first to cover the cuts. The J&J layoffs mainly affect a division that sells products used in surgery, while Merck is trimming its diabetes unit, sources told BNN Bloomberg.\n\nChinese media outlets reported the J&J cuts will affect as much as a fifth of the pharma\u2019s mainland workforce. A company spokesperson told BNN Bloomberg that J&J \u201chas recently implemented organizational changes to optimise our business operations.\u201d BNN Bloomberg did not report the number of employees affected at Merck.\n\nThe layoffs in China are not the only ones affecting the J&J workforce as 2024 winds down. The company is also letting go 231 employees at its New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters. Those cuts are effective Dec. 27.\n\nGilead Sciences\n\nNov. 18\n\nGilead Sciences will let go 104 employees at its Foster City, California, headquarters effective March 14, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice. The cuts are likely part of an unspecified number of layoffs the company confirmed to BioSpace Nov. 14 that involve the company and its subsidiary, Kite Pharma. A Gilead spokesperson attributed the workforce reductions to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nGilead\u2019s layoffs that will be effective in 2025 are now known to involve at least two states, as a Washington WARN notice revealed that 72 employees in Seattle will be let go starting Jan. 17. That site, which focuses on the company\u2019s research and clinical development activities, is closing. Kite Pharma, meanwhile, will shut down its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025, Fierce Biotech reported last week.\n\nFor more details about the Gilead and Kite layoffs, read the article.\n\nAdaptimmune\n\nNov. 18\n\nAs it redefines itself into what CEO Adrian Rawcliffe last week called a \u201csarcoma-focused business,\u201d Adaptimmune is reducing its workforce by approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a wider cost-cutting program that the biotech expects will lower its total operating expenses by around 25% in the first year of implementation. Under this savings initiative, Adaptimmune will also end enrollment in the Phase II SURPASS-3 trial of uza-cel, its next-generation investigational TCR T cell therapy being trialed for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\nAdaptimmune\u2019s business realignment comes after it last week announced a pivotal win for its TCR T cell therapy lete-cel in advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In the IGNYTE-ESO study, 42% of the 64 treated patients responded to lete-cel, including six who achieved complete response. Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel. Adaptimmune projects combined U.S. peak year sales of $400 million for both assets.\n\nAdaptimmune employed 449 staffers by the end of 2023, according to its year-end report.\n\nGilead Sciences and Kite Pharma\n\nNov. 15\n\nGilead Sciences and subsidiary Kite Pharma are laying off employees, including 72 people effective Jan. 17 at Gilead\u2019s Seattle location, which will close, according to a Nov. 13 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. That site focuses on the Foster City, Calif.\u2013based biopharma\u2019s research and clinical development activities.\n\nIn addition, Fierce Biotech reported that Santa Monica, California\u2013based Kite Pharma, which focuses on cell therapy to treat and cure cancer, will close its Philadelphia facility by the middle of 2025.\n\nA Gilead spokesperson confirmed Gilead and Kite\u2019s layoffs to BioSpace Nov. 14 but did not specify the number of employees affected. The spokesperson attributed the layoffs to the business making changes to further align resources with long-term strategic goals, which includes relocating some teams.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nSensei Biotherapeutics\n\nNov. 14\n\nTo focus its resources on advancing clinical development of SNS-101, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Sensei Biotherapeutics will cut 46% of its workforce, the clinical-stage biotech announced Nov. 14. The Rockville, Maryland\u2013based company will also close its research site in Rockville. The moves are expected to extend Sensei\u2019s cash runway into the second quarter of 2026.\n\nAccording to the announcement, most of Sensei\u2019s employee cuts will come in its preclinical research and development group. A Nov. 14 SEC filing stated the company should mostly complete the workforce reduction by the end of 2024. Once the layoffs are complete, the biotech could have about 15 employees given it had 27 full-time employees and one part-time staff member as of Feb. 23, according to a Feb. 22 SEC filing.\n\nSensei\u2019s SNS-101 inhibitor is a conditionally active antibody designed to selectively target the immune checkpoint VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell Activation) within the tumor microenvironment. The company is conducting a multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of SNS-101 as a monotherapy and in combination with Regeneron\u2019s PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nSensei noted in the Nov. 14 announcement that it received preliminary guidance from the FDA on the dose optimization strategy for SNS-101 and plans to re-engage with the agency following additional data from the dose expansion portion of the Phase I/II clinical trial.\n\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals\n\nNov. 14\n\nJust weeks after sharing disappointing Phase III results for ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, Marinus Pharmaceuticals has let go about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 12.\n\nIt\u2019s the second known layoff this year for the commercial-stage pharma in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In May, Marinus revealed it would trim its workforce by about 20%. In October, it stated it would cut an unspecified number of employees. The November layoffs appear to be the culmination of that cut.\n\nMarinus had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. As a result of the May and November cuts, the company could have about 73 employees remaining.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nOrna Therapeutics\n\nNov. 13\n\nFor the second time in a year and in conjunction with a refocused pipeline, Orna Therapeutics has laid off employees, STAT News reported. The biotech based in Watertown, Massachusetts, confirmed the layoffs to STAT but did not say how many jobs it cut.\n\nIn November 2023, Orna let go less than a quarter of its staff, Endpoints News reported at the time. Regarding this month\u2019s layoffs, spokesperson Peg Rusconi told STAT, \u201cWe believe that realigning our resources toward rapidly advancing our maturing panCAR programs will best position us to deliver our potentially breakthrough therapies to patients in need.\u201d\n\nSTAT noted the biotech, which designs circular RNA therapeutics, will also focus on the vaccine collaboration with Merck announced in 2022.\n\nAimed at treating autoimmune and oncology diseases, Orna\u2019s in vivo CAR platform panCAR combines its oRNA technology with proprietary lipid nanoparticles to make therapies that modify immune cells. The company hopes to bring its panCAR drug candidates to clinical trials by 2026, according to its website.\n\n23andMe\n\nNov. 12\n\nGenetic testing company 23andMe announced Nov. 11 that it will lay off more than 200 employees\u2014about 40% of its workforce\u2014as part of a sweeping business restructuring effort to streamline its operations and cut costs. That restructuring includes discontinuing its development of new therapies, instead focusing on its genetic testing services and products.\n\nThe employee cuts will cost the Sunnyvale, California, business up to $12 million in severance, transition and termination-related costs. In return, 23andMe expects to generate over $35 million in annualized savings.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific\n\nNov. 11\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific will lay off 160 employees across three Massachusetts locations, according to a Nov. 7 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice. The Wilmington-based tools and services company is letting go staff in Lexington, Plainville and Cambridge between Jan. 6, 2025, and Nov. 6, 2026. Thermo Fisher will close the Lexington facility, the Boston Business Journal reported.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Thermo Fisher employed about 122,000 people globally, including 61,000 in the Americas, according to a February SEC filing. The Boston Business Journal stated the company had about 4,100 employees in Massachusetts as of September.\n\nThermo Fisher\u2019s 50,000-square-foot, $90 million contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) site in Lexington opened in 2019. At that time, it was expected to add more than 200 jobs, employing scientists, quality control specialists and production teams to support development, testing and manufacture of viral vectors.\n\nAccording to the Boston Business Journal, in a letter to the state explaining the cuts, Thermo Fisher wrote that it continuously evaluates its global operations for opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness in meeting customers\u2019 needs. It added that to further use its state-of the-art Plainville facility and better optimize resources across its manufacturing network, as well as due to \u201cexternal constraints regarding our Cambridge site,\u201d it would adjust staffing in Cambridge and Plainville, cease operations in Lexington and transfer programs from Lexington to Plainville.\n\nThe 290,000-square-foot Plainville location provides comprehensive viral vector services ranging from process development to commercial manufacturing.\n\nCharles River Laboratories\n\nNov. 11\n\nCharles River Laboratories has laid off more than 6% of its employees\u2014over 1,300 people\u2014since 2023, Endpoints News reported following the Wilmington, Massachusetts\u2013based company\u2019s Nov. 6 earnings call. The company also shared during the call that it\u2019s begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites to consolidate capacity that\u2019s no longer needed given lower demand for its products and services, according to Endpoints. Those locations focus on its discovery and safety assessment and regulatory management services.\n\nWhile Endpoints requested additional details about the closures, Charles River did not say which locations are shutting down or if staff cuts are involved.\n\nIn September, Charles River confirmed to BioSpace that it was laying off 3% of its employees, saying in an emailed statement that it was reducing its workforce and streamlining its cost structure to optimize its footprint, more effectively support clients and drive greater operating efficiencies. An SEC filing stated the company had about 21,800 employees as of Dec. 30, so that workforce reduction may have affected about 650 people.\n\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals\n\nNov. 7\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring to grow its lupus nephritis drug Lupkynis and rapidly develop its autoimmune disease candidate AUR200, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals is cutting about 45% of its employees, the company announced Nov. 7. The Edmonton, Alberta\u2013based biopharma company, which has a U.S. commercial hub in Rockville, Maryland, did not say which locations the layoffs affect or when they\u2019ll be complete.\n\nThis is the second known workforce reduction this year for Aurinia. In February, the company announced it would cut at least 25% of its employees during the first quarter. That news came after Aurinia failed to find a buyer, Fierce Biotech reported.\n\nIn its Nov. 7 announcement, Aurinia stated the restructuring will improve operational efficiency and should save the company more than $40 million in annualized cash-based operating expenses.

The Cambridge-based biotech had announced on Oct. 17 that it would cut over 165 employees, or about 33% of its workforce, a move it expected to mostly compete by the end of the year.\n\nThe workforce reduction is part of a strategic reorganization of Sage\u2019s business operations, affecting about 55% of the company\u2019s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team.

The cuts will include some management positions.\n\nCompass had 32 employees at the end of December 2023, 19 of whom were primarily involved in research and development and clinical activities, according to an SEC filing.\n\nThe company, which revealed the delays in its third quarter business update, had expected data from a first Phase III trial, COMP005, this quarter, according to Fierce Biotech. Compass has now shifted that timeline to the second quarter of 2025. The company had also anticipated data from a second Phase III trial, COMP006, around the middle of 2025, Fierce reported.

The clinical-stage biopharma expects to mostly complete the cuts by end of the year, according to an Oct. 29 SEC filing.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Spero had 46 employees, 30 of whom were mostly handling R&D activities, as noted in a March 13 SEC filing. If the Cambridge, Massachusetts, business has the same number of employees now, the cuts could affect about 18 people.\n\nRegarding its antibiotic candidate, Spero shared that an interim analysis of the Phase IIa study of SPR720, a treatment being investigated for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, did not meet the primary endpoint.\n\nFor more details, read the article.\n\nICON\n\nOct. 28\n\nAfter announcing a revenue shortfall, Dublin-based contract research organization (CRO) ICON signaled during an investor call that layoffs are coming, Fierce Biotech reported. In the Oct. 24 call, the company\u2019s CEO, Steve Cutler, shared the business is \u201clooking at where we have an excess of people in certain areas\u201d and \u201ctaking fairly decisive actions.\u201d ICON has locations in 45 countries, including the U.S., where it has offices in 11 states.\n\nICON\u2019s third-quarter revenue of $2.03 million, a 1.2% year-over-year decrease, failed to meet expectations for three reasons, according to the company\u2019s earnings announcement. The CRO cited material headwinds from two large customers undergoing budget cuts and development model changes; lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity; and \u201congoing cautiousness\u201d from biotech customers, resulting in award and study delays.\n\nThe company also noted in its announcement that it expects an \u201coutlook for growth over the medium term\u201d and that its year-to-date revenue is $6.24 million, a year-over-year increase of 3.1%, or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals\n\nOct. 25\n\nFollowing a disappointing Phase III trial of ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Marinus Pharmaceuticals is laying off employees as part of cost-cutting measures, the company announced Oct. 24. The commercial-stage pharma is also discontinuing further clinical development of the drug and exploring strategic alternatives with the goal of \u201cmaximizing value for stockholders,\u201d according to the announcement.\n\nRadnor, Pennsylvania\u2013based Marinus did not specify how many people it\u2019s letting go or when the layoffs are effective. The company had 165 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March SEC filing. However, that number is likely lower now, as Marinus announced in May that it would reduce its workforce by about 20% as part of cost-cutting measures at that time.\n\nIn its Oct. 24 announcement, Marinus noted that the Phase III TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. It added that while reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 23\n\nAt Pfizer, another group of employees is paying the price for the company\u2019s recent Phase III Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failure.\n\nThe layoffs, which will affect 75 workers at Pfizer\u2019s Sanford, North Carolina, site, come four months after the company\u2019s investigational DMD therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase III trial. Pfizer said the cuts are related to that trial failure, according to Fierce Pharma.\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs follows the elimination of 150 positions in Sanford immediately after the Phase III DMD readout. This is also the second round of layoffs in as many weeks at Pfizer after the company handed out 80 layoff notices at its McPherson, Kansas, facility on Oct. 16 and Oct. 17.\n\nPfizer\n\nOct. 22\n\nPfizer handed out 80 layoff notices last Wednesday and Thursday at its McPherson, Kansas, facility, where around 1,800 people are employed, multiple local outlets reported. According to ABC affiliate KAKE News, the cuts affect positions in management and engineering but not in production.\n\n\u201cFollowing the announcement of our margin assessment program in May 2024, we\u2019ve conducted a series of these evaluations focused on operational efficiencies and network optimization,\u201d Pfizer said in a statement sent to the publication. \u201cBased on these evaluations, we have aligned headcount with our site capacity designs to meet the needs of the business.\u201d\n\nThere will be a meeting this week for those affected, Tucky Allen, Kansas WorkforceONE, told KSN News, noting that Pfizer reached out to his organization before announcing the layoffs, so his team could meet with laid-off employees and help them find new jobs, which could include placements within Pfizer. Allen told KSN that more and more manufacturing companies are making such cuts. \u201cThis time of year seasonally is obviously a time when employers will do their internal audits and see what their staffing looks like,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThis is Pfizer\u2019s second round of layoffs this month. At the beginning of October, The Irish Times reported that the company will eliminate up to 210 manufacturing jobs across sites in Grange Castle, Newbridge and Ringaskiddy, Ireland. Pfizer has not formally announced either round of cuts.\n\nTakeda\n\nOct. 21\n\nTakeda will lay off 45 employees at its Cambridge location and another 34 at its Lexington site between late September 2024 and March 2025, according to an Oct. 15 WARN notice. The announcement comes at the same time that the company decided to terminate its work on Wave\u2019s WVE-003 clinical-stage Huntington\u2019s disease program\u2014a potential $5 billion commercial opportunity, according to the biotech.\n\nThis is the latest in a string of layoffs this year from Takeda. In July, the company let go of 220 employees in Massachusetts (189 Cambridge employees and 31 in Lexington). In May, the company separately announced layoffs of 641 in the state (495 in Cambridge and 146 in Lexington) and the shuttering of a San Diego R&D hub that employed 324 people. And in March, Takeda said 190 employees would lose their jobs as a result of shuttering R&D and manufacturing operations at a facility in Orth an der Donau, Austria.\n\nIn total, Takeda has now laid off or announced plans to lay off more than 1,300 employees so far in 2024.\n\nSage Therapeutics\n\nOct. 17\n\nAbout a week after announcing it\u2019s discontinuing the development of dalzanemdor in Alzheimer\u2019s disease comes news that Sage Therapeutics will lay off over 165 employees, or about 33% of its workforce.\n\nThe workforce reduction is part of a strategic reorganization of the company\u2019s business operations, according to Sage\u2019s Oct. 17 announcement. The cuts will include roughly 55% of the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2013based biotech\u2019s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team. The company expects to mostly complete the layoffs by the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to Sage, the reorganization is meant to support the ongoing launch of Zurzuvae in postpartum depression and focus pipeline development efforts for drug candidate dalzanemdor in Huntington\u2019s disease ahead of a clinical study expected later this year. It\u2019s also intended to extend Sage\u2019s cash runway, although the company did not specify for how long.\n\nFor more details, visit the article.\n\nSalioGen Therapeutics\n\nOct. 14\n\nSalioGen Therapeutics is laying off employees, according to \u201ca person familiar with the situation and employee posts on social media,\u201d STAT reported.
